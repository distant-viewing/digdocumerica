{"path":"546490.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features a view framed by a large, geometric structure with what appears to be dark brown tiles or stone. The structure consists of angled and vertical planes, creating an angular archway that frames the focal content of the image. Through this archway, a historic tower with a distinct clock located at the top is visible. The architecture of the tower suggests a traditional style with ornate decorations and a steep, pointed roof adorned with what seem to be small spires or finials.\n\nThe clock tower is set against a clear sky, which brings out its detailed design. Visible behind and partially around the tower are other buildings that give hints of an urban setting, but they are mostly obscured by the tower and trees with lush, green foliage. \n\nThe photographer's composition uses the structure to direct focus toward the clock tower, which stands out in sharp contrast to the foreground structure's dark, monolithic presence. The play of light and shadow, especially on the structure in the foreground, adds a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene, emphasizing depth and the passage of time captured by the stillness of the clock tower.","title":"Courthouse tower seen from civic mall area","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546557","546499","557084","546508","542794","550062","546472","544947","548649","546503","549997","548057","550001","544561","558030","546485"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["tower","clock","archway","photographer","structure","hints","tile","plane","spire","content"]}
