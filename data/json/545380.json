{"path":"545380.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph showcases an interesting scene mainly focused on the reflections of old buildings on the glass facade of a modern building. The image is divided by what appears to be a gridded overlay, possibly a window pane or a protective barrier. The modern building features a large, smooth, reflective glass surface that captures the distorted mirror images of traditional architectural structures with ornate detailing.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a billboard advertising \"E.E. Forbes & Sons Pianos Music\" and \"Allen Organ,\" suggesting a focus on musical instruments and possibly located in a music store or a business area that caters to musical needs. Below this billboard, thereâ€™s a partial view of a pedestrian bridge, enhancing the urban feel of the scene.\n\nThe color palette is predominantly earthy with the warm tones of the brick buildings contrasted against the blue sky reflected on the glass. The overall composition, featuring the intersection of old architecture reflected on a modern structure, creates a juxtaposition between historical and contemporary urban elements. The grid pattern overlays an additional structured, almost graphic element to the scene, adding depth and a slight abstraction to the familiar urban landscape elements.","title":"Reflections in a glass wall","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["546521","549997","557280","549880","551442","545869","551493","550007","545873","550062","555329","553220","550011","552042","550024","556249"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["billboard","glass","overlay","music","pane","need","advertising","building","instrument","detailing"]}
