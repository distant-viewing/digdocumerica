{"path":"543210.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene filled with a variety of elements that depict a slightly rustic and industrial environment, likely near a waterfront due to the presence of pylons and a distant view of watercraft. The main focal point of the image includes an older, green-colored bus or trailer with a curved design and wooden panels patched onto its exterior. A man stands beside this bus, extending his arm upwards to receive a piece of paper from a child's hand sticking out of the bus's window.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there's a prominent red and white sign stating \"FISHING $1 PER PERSON FAMILY RATES,\" with additional text warning about entering an area at one's own risk and conditions for being allowed on the pier. The sign sits near a parked motorcycle, which has a colorful, flame-like design on its fuel tank, enhancing the rugged, outdoor feel of the scene.\n\nIn the background, there are derelict or partially constructed structures and a few old boats visible, further contributing to the sense of a working or recreational maritime area. The ground surface appears unpaved and natural, typical of a less developed outdoor setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph creates a narrative around a casual interchange between individuals in a coastal, possibly fishing-related locale, highlighted by the interaction between the man and the child in a peculiar, makeshift setup.","title":"California--Moss Landing","placename":"Moss Landing (Calif.)","location":"Moss Landing, California","nn1":["544193","543465","544209","543472","552809","551999","545005","547033","554200","546998","550902","548304","545061","545191","550221","544260"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["bus","warn","derelict","watercraft","interchange","pylon","child","receive","motorcycle","fuel"]}
