{"path":"544066.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This is a scenic photograph depicting a series of mountain ridges under a sky filled with clouds. The image captures the mountains in layers, each progressively fading into a lighter shade as they recede into the distance, creating a striking depth effect. The mountains nearer to the viewer are sharply defined, while those in the distance become increasingly blurred and misty. The sky above the mountains is a tapestry of clouds, with pink and white hues that suggest the photo was possibly taken during early morning or late evening. A soft sunlight appears to be filtering through the clouds, casting a gentle light over the scene. The overall color palette consists of muted blues, grays, and hints of pink, conveying a calm, serene atmosphere.","title":"Mountain range west of Globe","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554962","554634","542676","546764","542923","553825","555378","544070","555130","543023","542848","557558","552695","554402","542681","552927"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","cloud","tapestry","become","recede","ridge","define","distance","gray","filter"]}
