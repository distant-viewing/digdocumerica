{"path":"556533.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a gathering of people, mostly children and a few adults, around a series of wooden crates outdoors. The setting appears to be a parking lot, as indicated by the cars visible in the background under an overcast sky. The scene suggests a communal or public event, possibly in a rural or suburban area judging by the style of cars and casual attire of the people.\n\nThe people in the image display keen interest in the contents of the crates. Children of various ages, many shirtless, are tightly packed around the crates, looking at what lies inside. Their expressions range from curiosity to excitement. Two men, who seem to be supervising or facilitating the event, stand by the crates. One man in a white shirt and khaki pants is leaning over the crates while talking to the children, and another in a light blue shirt watches the children. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph shows a communal activity centered around the crates, pulling the viewer's focus towards the curiosity expressed by the group. The array of 1960s-era clothing styles and car models adds a vintage feel to the photo.","title":"A greased pig contest was one of the features of the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company first annual picnic held at a Tennessee Valley Authority lake near Jasper and Chattanooga, Tennessee.
