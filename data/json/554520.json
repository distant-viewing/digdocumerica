{"path":"554520.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene scene set in a lush, natural environment. It features an elderly man engaged in fishing. He stands on a flat rock near the edge of a rapidly flowing river, characterized by white, frothy water indicating its brisk movement. The man is dressed in a traditional fishing outfit, consisting of a red and black plaid shirt, green waders, and a beige fishing vest. His attire is accessorized with a classic plaid cap.\n\nThe background is densely wooded with tall, evergreen trees, suggesting a secluded, forested location. The lighting in the photograph is soft, with the forested background appearing slightly shadowed, possibly indicating either an overcast day or a setting where thick foliage partially obscures the sunlight.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with the rugged natural beauty of the river and the dense forest, alongside the focused figure of the man, creates a peaceful yet dynamic snapshot of an outdoor fishing adventure. The confluence of nature and activity offers a vivid sense of tranquility and engagement with the environment.","title":"Trout fisherman fishing on Twitchell Creek near Big Moose, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554519","550313","542509","550666","550317","542529","550665","550217","555576","542646","542744","542522","551024","543516","552976","551025"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","plaid","forest","accessorize","vest","river","man","adventure","woode","engagement"]}
