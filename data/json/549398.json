{"path":"549398.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a white sailing yacht in action on the ocean. The boat, with its bow pointed towards the left of the frame, cuts through the water, creating a small wake. Its main sail is fully deployed and taut, catching the wind effectively; a smaller jib sail is also visible in front.\n\nOnboard the yacht, there are several people, all wearing life jackets which suggest they are taking safety precautions while sailing. These individuals appear engaged in sailing activities; one of them can be seen pointing out towards the water, possibly indicating a direction or something of interest.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting a muted light on the scene, which gives the ocean a deep bluish-gray hue. The horizon is slightly visible at the top of the photograph, emphasizing a vast, open sea environment. The overall mood is active and focused, reflecting a typical sailing experience.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the yacht positioned diagonally from the right foreground to the left background, adds a dynamic element, conveying motion and direction. This perspective also highlights the sleek design of the yacht and the teamwork among the crew members.","title":"Contender in the Annapolis-Newport race on chesapeake bay in the early hours of the race.
