{"path":"551467.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a moment at an outdoor fountain in an urban setting. A young child, notably fair-haired and clad in a white t-shirt with a red heart print and light-colored pants, is seen leaning over the edge of a fountain basin, possibly engaging with the water. To the right of the child, a woman, presumably the child's caretaker, stands attentively. She sports a casual look with a green tank top and dark pants. Her expression suggests a mix of watchfulness and contemplation.\n\nIn the background, a man is visible, mostly obscured except for his head and shoulders, wearing a dark suit and a light blue shirt. He is looking away from the camera, partly occluded by the woman in the foreground. The fountain itself features a robust stone structure, with water cascading down from a central, darker toned block into a collected pool, bordered by a broad stone rim.\n\nThe scene evokes a leisurely, perhaps warm day, underscored by the casual attire of the subjects and the presence of water-play. The urban setting is hinted at by the architectural elements in the backdrop â€” notably dark doors and tall columns suggesting grand, corporate, or municipal buildings. The overall composition balances candid human activity with the still architecture of the cityscape.","title":"Testing the water on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553229","551446","550080","553219","549985","552737","551638","551857","553192","552539","551484","551858","550072","550748","551667","551639"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","child","stone","rim","heart","basin","pant","print","collect","cascade"]}
