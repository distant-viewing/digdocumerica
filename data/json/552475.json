{"path":"552475.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This is a photograph of an industrial facility at night, vividly illuminated against a dark background. The scene captures a complex array of structures typically associated with an oil refinery or chemical plant. There are various large cylindrical towers, and intricate networks of pipes visible throughout the composition. Bright lights dot the facility, creating a pattern of glows that highlight different parts of the structure. The lights reflect off the metallic surfaces, giving the image a slightly gleaming, almost festive look. The darkness of the night sky contrasts sharply with the intense man-made lights, emphasizing the industrial activity that continues around the clock. The overall atmosphere is one of industrial might and continuous operation. There appears to be no human activity visible in the photograph, suggesting the focus is solely on the structures themselves.","title":"Mobil refining plant off Interstate 55","placename":"Joliet (Ill.)","location":"Joliet, Illinois","nn1":["557398","555794","547702","543020","549959","550958","545528","546118","544700","542705","543004","547200","550917","544173","545433","554771"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["night","might","refinery","clock","facility","darkness","oil","chemical","pipe","network"]}
