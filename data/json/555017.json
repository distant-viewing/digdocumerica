{"path":"555017.jpg","date":"April 1970","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a dense cluster of small mushrooms growing on a dark, rich soil. The fungi appear in various stages of maturity, ranging from tiny, just-emerged caps to more developed ones with open and curved caps. The mushrooms have narrow, elongated stems and small, mainly bell-shaped caps that exhibit a gradient of colors from white at the edges to darker brown at the center. The area is well-colonized, showing a strong, healthy growth of these fungi.\n\nThe natural setting suggests a moist, possibly shaded area conducive to mushroom growth, likely a forest floor or a similarly damp environment. The earthy colors of the mushrooms blend harmoniously with the dark soil background, emphasizing a natural and untouched habitat. There are no visible objects or people in the image, focusing the viewer entirely on the biological detail and natural beauty of the mushrooms.","title":"Mushroom bloom on the root base of a wind-fallen Douglas fir on Bainbridge Island, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551373","558076","557624","557595","555181","558081","555006","555179","555015","554593","557612","557006","553032","555180","555014","555026"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["cap","growth","maturity","soil","bell","stem","one","gradient","habitat","stage"]}
