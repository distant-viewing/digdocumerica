{"path":"544738.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a single jackrabbit situated in a natural setting. The animal is captured mid-motion, possibly while hopping or running through a field which is densely covered in dried, golden-brown grass. This gives the impression of a wide, expansive and somewhat wild terrain.\n\nThe jackrabbit, centrally positioned in the frame, is characterized by pronounced, large ears that stand upright, and a greyish-brown fur coat that blends with the surrounding grassland, suggesting it is well-adapted to its environment. The field is relatively even in height, devoid of any significant disruptions or other wildlife being visible.\n\nIn the background, there is a hint of greenery with some sparse bushes or small trees, providing a contrast to the predominantly brown tones of the dry grass. The sky is not visible in the frame, focusing all attention on the rabbit and its immediate surroundings.\n\nThe lighting seems natural and possibly indicative of a sunny day, given the clear visibility and vibrant colors of the field. The composition emphasizes the solitude and alertness of the jackrabbit in its natural habitat.","title":"Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Area: east shore of the Great Salt Lake","placename":"Farmington (Utah)","location":"Farmington, Utah","nn1":["551376","545557","542629","543265","542630","544916","550467","550468","554621","545902","546163","544623","550472","544571","550436","552697"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["field","alertness","ear","grassland","disruption","fur","grass","habitat","wildlife","visibility"]}
