{"path":"552676.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic, wintry farm scene. A man stands prominently in the foreground, dressed in cold weather attire which includes a hat, a jean jacket over a hoodie, and gloves. He is holding a tall shovel or similar tool, possibly used for managing the hay or snow, and leans slightly on it, looking calmly toward the camera.\n\nBeside and slightly behind the man are several cattle, peering curiously over a wooden fence constructed of logs. These animals are being fed, as evident from the hay scattered on the snow-covered ground along the fence where they are gathered.\n\nThe background features a picturesque, snowy landscape with rolling hills. There are scattered trees and bushes mostly devoid of leaves, suggesting cold, wintry conditions. Further in the distance, a ridgeline of mountains partially obscured by mist or light snowfall creates a serene and somewhat isolated atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of rural life and the ruggedness of winter, portraying a quiet, hardy environment where farming activities are intertwined with the natural elements.","title":"Frank starbuck, last of the old time ranchers near Fairview manages a spread of 1300 acres and 400 head of cattle, he does it alone because it is too difficult and expensive to get help","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552675","552679","552677","547409","553801","543833","547311","552557","555538","543732","547326","552562","554948","554806","547419","552678"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hay","snow","fence","snowfall","cattle","peer","feed","shovel","ruggedness","glove"]}
