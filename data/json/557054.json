{"path":"557054.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph features five people, likely spectators, seated in direct sunlight with varying expressions of focus and relaxation. They are watching an event, possibly a parade or outdoor performance, suggested by their attentiveness and orientation towards something off-camera.\n\nFrom left to right: The first individual is a man wearing a dark-colored cowboy hat, sunglasses, and a brown shirt. He exudes a casual demeanor, sitting relaxed with his hands gripping what might be the rail of a bench or bleacher.\n\nNext to him is a younger man wearing a light-colored straw cowboy hat and a white shirt. He appears engaged in the activity they are watching, with a serene yet attentive expression.\n\nThe third individual is another man, older, with an uncovered head, weathered skin indicating sun exposure, and a light smile. He's dressed in a practical, light-hued printed shirt, possibly a sign of leisure or holiday attire.\n\nBeside him, partially obscured by an umbrella, is an older woman. She wears a red blouse and rests under a large green umbrella—perhaps a personal remedy against the strong sunlight—which she holds with one hand, suggesting it’s a sunny day.\n\nThe last person is an elderly woman to the right, appearing comfortable and somewhat attentive to the event. She dons a light blue cardigan over a darker attire, indicating preparedness for variable weather despite the sunny conditions.\n\nThe background is minimalistic, possibly an indication that they are seated at an elevated position with a railing visible behind them. The structure, likely made of concrete or similar material, adds to the ambience of a community or public space designed for gatherings and watching events.\n\nThe atmosphere is relaxed, communal, and culturally grounded, highlighted by the cowboy hats which suggest a rural or western setting. The composition’s focus on the people and their expressions against a harsh sunlight backdrop effectively captures a slice of life—a moment of shared experience in a public or communal setting.","title":"Animal drawn wagon with an umbrella shading the woman is one of many units in an annual parade in cottonwood falls, Kansas near Emporia.
