{"path":"551254.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and colorful scene aboard a boat. A law enforcement officer, readily identifiable by his beige uniform and characteristic wide-brimmed hat, is interacting with a group of four other individuals on the boat. The officer is standing on the boat, holding a clipboard or a book, appearing to write something. \n\nTwo women and two men make up the group he's interacting with. One woman, wearing a purple bikini and sunglasses, is seen smiling and gesturing with her hand, perhaps in conversation with the officer. Another woman, in a red and white striped tank top, also appears to be in mid-conversation, moving energetically while seated. A man with suntanned skin and blonde hair, presumably the boat's captain, sits at the steering area, looking up with a grin towards the officer. Another man, visible partially, appears to be engaged in the scene as well.\n\nThe background features a calm body of water lined with dense green trees, likely indicating a secluded lake or river setting. The overall mood is jovial, suggesting a friendly interaction possibly related to a casual inspection or safety check by the officer. The bright sunlight enhances the vibrant colors and festive atmosphere of this outdoor recreational scene.","title":"Dan Needham, Missouri Water Patrol supervisor for the Lake of the Ozarks region, stops an inboard runabout for a routine inspection.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551255","543948","551253","545728","550029","544122","551257","548503","548502","554177","546324","553835","554445","551228","543952","543944"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["officer","boat","woman","enforcement","law","conversation","check","clipboard","bikini","steering"]}
