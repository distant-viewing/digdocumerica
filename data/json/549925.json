{"path":"549925.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This image captures a scene on a city street featuring two main subjects, a man and a woman, walking together and engaged in a conversation. The man on the left is dressed in a brownish suit with a patterned shirt and a wide tie. He appears to be glancing at the woman while walking. The woman on the right is wearing a stylish outfit with a red sleeveless top and white high-waisted pants, accessorized with a belt, necklace, and sunglasses. She also has a long white coat draped over her left arm and is carrying a small dark handbag.\n\nThere's another person partially visible to the right, dressed in a pink coat. The background and surroundings are indicative of an urban setting with a grey asphalt road, and there are minor indications of wear on the road, like cracks.\n\nThe overall composition gives a casual yet vibrant vibe of urban life, possibly from a period that looks like the 1970s judging from the fashion and style depicted. The shot is candid, capturing a moment in the daily lives of stylish pedestrians in a bustling city environment.","title":"Approaching the entrance to the terminal of the Staten Island ferry","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551820","557285","545231","549673","551817","549907","553184","549923","551835","556221","556218","551824","551124","549324","550082","549645"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["coat","woman","glance","handbag","necklace","accessorize","indication","walk","asphalt","city"]}
