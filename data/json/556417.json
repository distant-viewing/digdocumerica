{"path":"556417.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural scene with several elements. In the foreground and middle ground, there are multiple mobile homes or trailers arranged in a loose cluster, suggesting a small, possibly semi-permanent residential area. These homes vary in appearance, with some having visible additions or external structures like porches or awnings.\n\nThe trailers are surrounded by lush greenery, including a variety of trees and smaller plants, indicating a spring or summertime setting. The entire area is set against a backdrop dominated by a densely wooded hillside that slopes upward from the residential area, enhancing the secluded, nestled feel of the community.\n\nOverhead, multiple power lines cut across the view, hinting at modern infrastructure amidst the natural environment. The overall lighting is soft and diffused, suggesting either an overcast day or the soft light of an early morning or late afternoon. This contributes to a peaceful, somewhat isolated mood conveyed by the photograph.","title":"A bright and clean trailer park inhabited by area miners at Sunbright, West Virginia, near Logan. The Mobile homes are popular with the young miners because they cost less than conventional housing and take less land to be situated. Level ground is at a premium in the coal mining valleys.","placename":"Logan (W.
