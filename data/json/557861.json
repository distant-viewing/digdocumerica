{"path":"557861.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph shows three individuals in a car workshop setting. Two men and one woman are involved in a car inspection or repair situation. The man on the left is dressed in a blue uniform with a name badge, suggesting he might be a mechanic or a service person; he stands with a somewhat concerned or attentive expression. The woman, positioned in the center with her back to the camera, wears a distinctive white short-sleeved dress adorned with geometric and floral patterns and a black belt around the waist. Two additional individuals are partially visible; one of them is examining the engine compartment of a classic dark-colored car that is likely being serviced.\n\nThe lighting in the space appears to be fluorescent, typical of a garage setting, illuminating the scene with a somewhat cool tone. The background is industrial and utilitarian with visible structural elements of the building, such as metal beams and corrugated metal surfaces that might serve as the workshop's walls or roof. The atmosphere hints at a professional setting focused on vehicle maintenance or repair, characterized by a functional and practical workspace.","title":"Unhappy car owner, foreground, watches as public works department employees try to locate the reason her vehicle failed its inspection for the second time at an auto emission inspection station at Norwood, Ohio.  She was armed with a receipt from the garage where she had taken it for repairs and was very angry it had not passed.  The employees diagnosed the problem as a dirty air filter.
