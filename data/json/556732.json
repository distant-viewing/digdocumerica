{"path":"556732.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban street scene dominated by a traffic jam. The picture is taken from an elevated position, looking down the road, which is lined with leafy green trees, suggesting that the setting might be a city avenue during the warmer months of the year.\n\nThe image is filled predominantly with vehicles—cars, trucks, and a bus—visible in multiple lanes, all appearing to be packed tightly together, indicating heavy traffic congestion. The variety of vehicles includes sedans, vans, and at least one larger truck, and perhaps a few taxis due to their distinctive color, hinting at a diverse urban transport environment.\n\nThe cars are mostly older models, which might suggest the photo was taken several years ago. This diversity in vehicle types and designs adds to the complexity and \"busy\" feel of the scene. The road itself seems well-worn, and the vehicles show signs of regular use.\n\nThe lighting and clarity suggest that it may be either an overcast day or the photo is taken from a distance, which affects the overall sharpness and color saturation, creating a somewhat muted palette dominated by the grays of the road and vehicles and the green of the trees.\n\nThis kind of setting typically indicates issues like daily commuter stress, potential environmental impacts due to emissions, and urban planning challenges related to traffic management in densely populated areas.","title":"Jammed streets during rush hour was a twice-a-day ordeal for motorists during a bus strike which lasted several days in Washington, District of Columbia, during May, 1974. Some 250,000 persons who normally used the bus were forced to find alternate forms of transportation and that usually meant their cars. Drivers soon learned there were more autos than places to park legally. So they resorted to bus lanes, \"no parking\" zones, traffic \"islands\" sidewalks and lawns.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556729","556727","553893","556195","546370","548419","549874","557229","556194","553719","549849","552711","542684","546730","546670","549903"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["vehicle","traffic","year","avenue","stress","jam","road","truck","month","taxi"]}
