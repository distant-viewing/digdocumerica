{"path":"553445.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a serene summer scene at a lakeside, likely in a small town. The image features a group of individuals on a wooden raft in the center of the lake, enjoying the water and sunny weather. To the right of the raft, there is a person lounging on a small, inflatable boat, further emphasizing the leisurely atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe background is dominated by multi-story residential buildings that give the impression of a closely-knit community. The houses, varying in design and color (white, light gray, and dark gray), are densely packed along the lakeside, enhancing the quaint, small-town vibe of the photo. In addition to the prominent three to four-story buildings, there are lush green trees and other vegetation lining the shore, framing the lake beautifully.\n\nOn the shore to the right, there are several other people, some of whom are sitting and others who appear to be preparing to swim or involved in other recreational activities. The area around the lake features well-maintained grass, and paths suggesting frequent use by residents for leisure activities.\n\nThe reflection of the sun on the lake creates a shimmering effect on the water, adding a sense of tranquility and natural beauty to the scene. The overall composition of the photograph, with its central focus on relaxed, outdoor summer activities and the backdrop of charming residential buildings, offers a picturesque view of life by the lake in a small town.","title":"Here at Clinton, in the first quarter mile from its origin below the Wachusett Reservoir, the Nashua River is still safe for swimming.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553442","546856","553440","558233","543579","543892","543881","550054","551679","549368","552978","544266","554618","557562","551543","553446"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["lake","raft","town","lakeside","summer","shore","addition","resident","vibe","right"]}
