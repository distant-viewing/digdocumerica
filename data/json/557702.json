{"path":"557702.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"In the photograph, two elderly individuals appear near the entrance of a building. The man on the left stands leaning slightly on the door frame, wearing a light blue shirt, dark trousers, and a straw hat. He has a serious expression on his face and his arms are crossed or on his hips. To his right, an elderly woman is positioned near another door frame, using a walker to assist her movement. She is dressed in a light blue house dress, looking to the right with a resilient or contemplative expression.\n\nThe building appears to be aged, with a concrete block or cinder block exterior that is painted light gray. The doors and windows are accented with peeling red and white paint, contributing to the sense of wear and age. The interior behind the open doors is dark, and does not reveal much about the inside. The photo captures a moment that seems quiet and somewhat solemn, set against the backdrop of a rustic and worn home environment.","title":"Mrs. Lula Vandiver, 101, of Helen, Georgia, stands on her porch with her nephew, Bill Vandiver of nearby Robertstown. She is the oldest resident of White County. The home in which she had lived for 60 years burned several years earlier and she moved into a two-room shack across the road. Although almost totally blind and deaf, Mrs. Vandiver insists on living alone, refusing to move in with any of her four children who live in Helen.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558330","554192","543464","557407","553202","551337","558335","553503","545976","556493","548240","553849","547816","547411","552680","553029"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["door","block","cinder","inside","hip","straw","expression","entrance","exterior","paint"]}
