{"path":"550903.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a group of six pelicans in flight against a clear sky. The pelicans are spread across the image, soaring at different heights and angles which adds a dynamic sense to the composition. The sky serves as a minimal, unobtrusive background, featuring a subtle gradient of blue tones which suggest it could be either early morning or late evening. The lighting appears soft and diffused, highlighting the pelicansâ€™ large, impressive wingspans and their distinctive body shapes. The birds' positions and spread wings emphasize a sense of freedom and movement. Overall, the photograph depicts a tranquil scene of natural avian grace and synchronization.","title":"Pelicans fly in formation above the Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["555554","552911","550889","557209","544500","550382","545302","552909","554646","557203","553875","544609","544605","545187","552238","548728"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["pelican","spread","soar","grace","freedom","wing","flight","gradient","bird","diffuse"]}
