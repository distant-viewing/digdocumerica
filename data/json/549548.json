{"path":"549548.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning view of Niagara Falls with a focus on a structural bridge in the foreground. The bridge, framed by an industrial-looking steel framework, features two levels; the lower level is partially visible and enclosed, possibly housing machinery or providing structural support, while the upper level is a pedestrian walkway lined with people. The bridge's intricate metalwork and the angular geometry of its construction contrast sharply with the natural, fluid curves of the waterfall.\n\nNiagara Falls is shown in the background, its mighty cascades producing a thick mist which rises and adds a dreamy quality to the scene. The falls stretch across the entire background, presenting a broad, white curtain of water plunging down. The top edge of the falls is smooth, and the water looks powerful yet serene as it descends.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes lush greenery on both sides of the falls. Trees and stretches of grass are visible on the far side, indicating a park or natural reserve conducive to pedestrian activities.\n\nOverall, the photograph juxtaposes man-made engineering with natural grandeur, illustrating both the power of human ingenuity and the sublime beauty of the natural world. It encapsulates a moment of everyday leisure — people walking and taking in the view — against a backdrop of one of the most spectacular natural wonders of the world.","title":"American Falls and lower part of the observation tower which rises from the base of the cliffs to an elevation of 100 feet above ground level.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549466","549563","549530","549549","549540","549496","549537","549474","552405","549557","549536","549475","549556","549534","549473","549491"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["bridge","level","world","pedestrian","metalwork","plunge","fall","wonder","reserve","produce"]}
