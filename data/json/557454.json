{"path":"557454.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dense residential area viewed from an elevated position, giving a broad perspective over numerous houses and rooftops, under a clear blue sky. The scene prominently features a variety of buildings closely packed together, showcasing architectural styles with peaked, shingled roofs typical in suburban settings.\n\nThe area is characterized by its uniformity in building designs, predominantly single-story structures painted in muted, earthy tones. The roofs vary slightly in color and condition, suggesting different ages and materials.\n\nIn the foreground and middle of the composition, the houses are separated by small, well-kept yards with patches of greenery visible among the properties. Streets and vehicles are visible, interspersed within the residential blocks, hinting at the daily life and mobility within the area.\n\nTowards the lower frame, some backyards and possibly small communal areas can be glanced, some having trees and minimal landscaping. The overall layout suggests a planned suburban development.\n\nIn the background, the photograph opens up to a view of a water body, likely a lake or sea, enhancing the tranquility and aesthetic appeal of the location. This vista provides a calming contrast to the densely packed residential area, creating a serene horizon line that reflects the sky above, hinting at a peaceful, suburban lifestyle near a body of water.\n\nThe image likely captures midday or early afternoon given the bright, direct sunlight and the vibrancy of the natural and man-made elements in the photograph. This setting provides an insight into suburban architectural and urban planning styles, possibly indicating a well-established, middle-class neighborhood.","title":"Completed developments at Laguna Niguel contrast with unfinished streets and utilities (not shown). Development here was halted, and construction elsewhere was restricted following state passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November 1972. State and regional regulatory commissions must present a final report to the legislature by January 1976, recommending passage of laws affecting future coastal development.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["557547","548011","553928","557552","551198","553929","553700","557405","553705","553939","546399","553919","547567","544600","545201","557404"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["glance","pack","mobility","backyard","insight","uniformity","class","vista","house","shingle"]}
