{"path":"558277.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene of a historical reenactment involving a cannon firing. The image shows multiple people dressed in traditional military-style uniforms of red jackets and black hats, reminiscent of historical ceremonial attire. Several individuals stand at attention in a line aligning with the cannon which is situated in the forefront.\n\nThe cannon itself is an old-fashioned, large, wheeled artillery piece, positioned on what appears to be a grassy area. The cannon just discharged a blast, indicated by a large, voluminous cloud of white smoke obscuring the left part of the image and emanating dynamically from the cannonâ€™s barrel.\n\nBehind the participants, tall, lush trees can be seen, suggesting the event is taking place in a park or similarly verdant setting. The sunlight, possibly indicating a time near sunset, delicately highlights the scene, enhancing the smoke's visibility and the reflective surfaces of the uniforms and cannon.\n\nThe photograph has a nostalgic or historical ambiance, emphasized by the outfit of the participants and the traditional artillery piece, capturing a moment of historical reenactment intended to educate or commemorate a specific past era or event.","title":"Members of the New Ulm battery firing a salute in New Ulm Minnesota.  The battery was formed as a defense measure in 1863 after the great sioux uprising killed residents and desTroyed a part of the town in 1862.  The indians never attacked again, and the unit has never had to fire in self defense.  The battery serves a ceremonial function and fires salutes on holidays such as memorial day and the fourth of july.  The town supports the group financially","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558275","558276","558274","558273","558272","549701","549698","549735","549705","549700","549703","549699","546772","546906","546790","549697"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["reenactment","participant","uniform","discharge","event","piece","smoke","intend","emanate","barrel"]}
