{"path":"547685.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph captures a body of water, possibly a river or lake, in a muted, earthy tone. A small boat navigates this water, moving from the bottom right part of the frame towards the top left. The boat is primarily white with a hint of red, and appears to be a speedboat given its design and the wake it is creating. The wake behind the boat is pronounced and forms a sharp, zigzag pattern in the water, which is a distinctive feature as it demonstrates the boat's swift movement. The water's surface is slightly rippled, indicating some movement either from the boat or the wind. There aren't any visible landmarks or structures in the background, just the expanse of the water which stretches across the entire photograph. The overall color palette is subdued, with grayish and brown hues suggesting an overcast sky or the timing may be either early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Small powerboat on the potomac river above mt.
