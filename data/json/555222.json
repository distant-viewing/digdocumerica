{"path":"555222.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a serene forest scene centered around a flowing stream. The stream, captured with a slow shutter speed, has a smooth, silky appearance as it moves over rocks and boulders, creating small, white waterfalls and vibrant swirls in the water. The stream bends and weaves through the scene, densely framed by a lush forest.\n\nThe surrounding vegetation is rich and varied; moss-covered rocks and fallen tree trunks suggest a moist, possibly temperate rainforest environment. Tall trees with thick trunks and scattered light shining through occasionally suggest a canopy above that is not completely dense but allows for light penetration, illuminating patches of the forest floor and enhancing the greenery's vibrancy.\n\nThe forest floor itself is cluttered with plant debris, ferns, and the irregular forms of rocks, contributing to a natural and untamed landscape. The heavy moss on the trees and rocks implies a climate with significant humidity and precipitation.\n\nOverall, the composition and lighting of the photograph create a tranquil, almost mystical atmosphere, inviting the viewer to appreciate the quiet beauty and complexity of a forest ecosystem.","title":"Watercourse in the Wynoochee Reservoir drainage system in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555218","555076","554406","558085","542844","554525","555153","555211","554748","554407","555216","555075","547011","546171","543869","553410"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["forest","stream","rock","moss","trunk","humidity","rainforest","floor","swirl","shutter"]}
