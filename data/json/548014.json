{"path":"548014.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a vintage, scenic rural moment featuring a large Goodyear blimp and a man on a tractor. The blimp, prominently labeled \"Goodyear\" with a winged-foot logo, is the centerpiece, grounded in a field with its side ropes staked to the ground. It appears to be a clear day with bright sunlight, and the sky is relatively clear with some light cloud cover.\n\nThe field itself is mowed, with dry, golden-brown grass underfoot. In the foreground, there's a tractor, and a man wearing a hat is seated on it, adding a human element to the scene. The overall setting hints at a countryside landscape, possibly near a small town given the partial view of buildings in the background, including what appears to be a red-roofed building.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the blimp occupying a significant portion and the contrasting scale of the tractor and man, highlights humans' interaction with technology and nature in a pastoral environment. This setting might be an airfield or a specially adapted open area for the blimp.","title":"Threshing at the pierson park airfield, goodyear blimp in background","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552577","544888","555619","544323","547436","557521","553665","547297","549258","547304","547301","555874","555528","554204","549036","548950"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["tractor","centerpiece","clould","hints","countryside","adapt","field","foot","human","technology"]}
