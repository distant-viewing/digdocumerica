{"path":"550074.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene at an urban park, filled with people and adorned by lush greenery under a clear blue sky. The image is framed by dark foliage in the foreground, partially obscuring and providing a natural border to the activities within the park. Large trees with dense foliage are scattered throughout the background, enhancing the urban oasis feel.\n\nThe central area features multiple clusters of predominantly metal-framed chairs, some with individuals seated and others standing nearby. The people, consisting of a mix of men and women dressed in casual and semi-formal attire, are engaged in various activities such as sitting, talking, reading, and relaxing, giving the scene a relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere. No children are visibly notable in the gathering.\n\nSidewalk paths crisscross the park area, with some people using them to stroll through the scene. The layout suggests a communal gathering spot possibly during a lunch break or a casual meet-up, emphasized by the calm yet animated interactions among the individuals present.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph and the activities captured evoke a sense of community and leisure, common in city parks, where people come to enjoy moments of respite amidst their urban surroundings.","title":"Eastman Park, a much appreciated green spot in downtown Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550075","551771","555947","556296","551713","550302","544808","553065","557257","553193","550071","552036","549516","550051","551798","550052"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["park","oasis","people","respite","gathering","lunch","stroll","reading","foliage","talk"]}
