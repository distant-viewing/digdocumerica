{"path":"549767.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph showcases a contrast between urban development and a neglected area, highlighting the bustling city skyline against a foreground of decay and disregard. The image foreground features a scene of debris and discarded materials, including chunks of broken concrete and miscellaneous refuse scattered across a barren, dirt-covered ground. Prominently, there is a \"PRIVATE PROPERTY NO DUMPING\" sign, planted on the unpaved ground, emphasizing the neglected state despite the warning.\n\nIn stark contrast, the background presents a vibrant city skyline with notable high-rise buildings, including the distinctive profile of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center complex, indicating that this photo was taken before the events of September 11, 2001. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a fine weather day, which brightly illuminates the cityscape and contrasts with the dilapidated state of the foreground.\n\nThis photograph speaks volumes about urban expansion, environmental neglect, and the coexistence of development alongside decay within close proximities in a metropolitan area.","title":"Despite warning signs, illegal dumping continues in this area just off the New Jersey turnpike facing Manhattan.
