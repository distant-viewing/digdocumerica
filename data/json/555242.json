{"path":"555242.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In the photograph, a man is seen inspecting large yellow cylindrical containers which are storage drums, each bearing various labels and markings. The man, wearing a light-colored shirt, plaid pants, and a yellow hard hat, is squatting down to read or examine something on the surface of one of the lower drums. He appears focused on the task at hand.\n\nThe setting seems to be inside a storage or warehouse facility, suggested by the dimly lit background and metal rack structures visible holding other items. Natural light appears to filter through from the top of the image, highlighting the upper parts of the drums and parts of the background. The atmosphere is industrious, encapsulated by the presence of the protective headgear and the industrial setting. The image has a slight bluish tint, adding a cool tone to the overall look.","title":"An environmental protection agency inspector checks a label on a pesticide container during a routine inspection at the valley chemical company, greenville, Mississippi","placename":"Mississippi","location":"Mississippi","nn1":["555237","555243","555244","555245","555236","555815","555263","543706","553045","555816","548994","555246","557386","551588","555239","558306"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["drum","headgear","storage","squat","rack","marking","tint","inspect","bear","warehouse"]}
