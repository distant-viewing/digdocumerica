{"path":"543147.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph focuses on a small green, moss-like cluster situated on a bed of rocks and stones. The green organism, possibly a type of moss or lichen, appears dense and spongy with a bright, vibrant green color sprinkled with tiny white dots, giving it a textured appearance.\n\nThe immediate background features a range of small pebbles and a portion of what seems to be a dried, curled leaf to the left. These pebbles vary in color â€“ from white and grey to brown, adding a natural and rugged texture to the scene. The background blurs slightly into darker shades, emphasizing the vivid green of the mossy cluster in the foreground.\n\nThe level of detail in the image indicates a close-up or macro perspective, highlighting the intricacies and minute qualities of the moss and the surrounding small stones. The overall composition captures the natural and intricate beauty of a small-scale ecosystem, focusing on textures and organic forms in a natural setting.","title":"California--point lobos state park","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["555026","555025","554571","555027","555018","550483","553358","550476","545271","554554","554993","554991","555884","555183","554594","547635"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","pebble","minute","organism","stone","sprinkle","cluster","lichen","curl","intricacy"]}
