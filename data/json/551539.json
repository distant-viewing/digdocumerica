{"path":"551539.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph features a serene scene of two people sailing in a small sailboat on a shimmering body of water. The sun, likely low in the sky based on the lighting, dapples the water's surface with bright, reflective spots suggesting it might be early morning or late afternoon. The sail of the boat is predominantly white with thick, diagonal, blue stripes which add a dynamic visual element against the watery reflection. The two individuals aboard the boat are seated close to the water's surface, actively engaged in navigating or controlling the sail. In the background, a densely wooded area or forest lines the horizon, its details cast in silhouette due to the backlit lighting conditions, enhancing the contrast between the still dark land and the bright, lively water. The composition and the striking contrast between the sparkling water and the shaded sail and foliage evoke a sense of peaceful isolation and the pleasure of a quiet sail.","title":"No motors disturb the quiet of Lake Calhoun.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["544224","547273","548118","552345","551541","544669","544663","548521","544667","552343","543941","549411","551540","550758","548506","547754"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["sail","pleasure","water","boat","sailboat","stripe","spot","surface","contrast","reflection"]}
