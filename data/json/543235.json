{"path":"543235.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a group of three tourists, possibly engaged in sightseeing or on a guided tour. The scene features an older woman on the left, facing slightly towards the camera. She is wearing glasses, a red bandana, a white-collared sweater over a light shirt, plaid pants, and has a navy blue backpack slung over one shoulder. She appears to be holding and possibly reading a map or a pamphlet.\n\nBeside her, in the center, is another tourist dressed in a bright red jacket with a large straw hat adorned with a floral decoration. This person is seen from behind and also appears to be carrying a light blue backpack.\n\nOn the right side of the frame is a person wearing a patterned blue shirt and black pants, viewed from the side and partially from behind. This individual is holding what looks like a tourist guide or map.\n\nThe background is nondescript and appears quite foggy or misty, adding a sense of atmospheric obscurity to the scene which doesn't allow for any distinct landscape features to be discerned. The overall mood is quiet and focused, typical of travelers intent on navigating and absorbing new surroundings.","title":"Sierra Club nature hike","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553963","553965","551648","553225","554672","543236","554539","551816","553755","553964","557177","554508","545692","544315","543506","553738"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["tourist","map","backpack","pamphlet","sightseeing","guide","bandana","tour","traveler","pant"]}
