{"path":"546969.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a beachside scene significantly impacted by natural forces, likely a storm or hurricane. The foreground is cluttered with uprooted trees and fallen branches, strewn across the sandy beach. The root systems of several trees are exposed, indicating the strength of the event that dislodged them. The sand is visible around the trees, but also mixed with debris and plant material.\n\nIn the background, there is a line of dense, windswept trees, some of which appear still upright but possibly damaged, showing the resilience of some vegetation despite the environmental stress. Beyond the trees, a building with a red roof is visible, suggesting this area is close to a residential zone. The overall atmosphere is somewhat bleak and desolate, emphasized by the overcast sky and the absence of any people or activity in the visible area. The scene captures both the destructive impact of natural events on the environment and the proximity of human habitation to vulnerable coastlines.","title":"Jekyll Island, once a millionaires' playground, is now a state-owned public park.
