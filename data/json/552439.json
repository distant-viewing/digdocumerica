{"path":"552439.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a flooded area, likely in a rural setting, where an old-style car is submerged in water up to its windows. The car, appearing to be from the mid-20th century, is near the center right of the frame. To the left, a line of fence posts indicates that this area is typically used for agricultural or property demarcation purposes; one of the fence posts is prominently visible in the foreground with barbed wire running horizontally.\n\nThe water reflects the sky and surrounding natural elements. The sky above is visible and suggests a partly cloudy day with ample natural sunlight enhancing the reflective qualities of the water. Beyond the immediate flooded area are grassy fields, which are not submerged, and a line of trees can be observed in the distance, providing a rural landscape backdrop. The overall atmosphere, while serene due to the rural setting, also carries a sense of abandonment and loss due to the submerged vehicle.","title":"Field near banner has become a lake and car is stRanded after spring flooding of the Illinois River","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["547839","547835","546318","546173","548298","547132","547911","546315","547605","547481","547601","555850","547484","544433","553008","547771"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["post","fence","loss","demarcation","property","car","wire","submerge","abandonment","water"]}
