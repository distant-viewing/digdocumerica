{"path":"556384.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts an interior scene focused on a large, industrial control panel in what appears to be a control room of some sort. The panel is extensive, covering the majority of the visible wall, and consists of numerous buttons, switches, dials, and indicator lights, arranged in a systematic and organized manner. The panel is predominantly grey in color, suggesting a utilitarian design typical of industrial or technological settings.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a person standing near the window. This individual appears as a silhouette against the light coming through the window, which makes it difficult to discern details about their appearance or clothing. Their posture suggests they are standing casually or overseeing the panel's operation.\n\nThe room is lit by both the natural light coming through the large windows with white frames and interior lighting, visible as ceiling lights. The floor is carpeted, in line with the practical, functional aesthetic of the room. The overall ambiance suggests a professional environment associated with technical or industrial operations, likely emphasizing precision and control in whatever processes the equipment manages.","title":"The control room of the coal cleaning plant at the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia.
