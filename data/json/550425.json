{"path":"550425.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures the rugged terrain of a mountain. The mountain features a strikingly steep and angular slope, marked prominently by sharp ridges and deep crevasses. The texture of the rock face is rough and appears to consist of layered sedimentary rock, suggesting geological processes over millennia.\n\nThe colors in the image range from dark shadows, cast by the mountain's own contours, to lighter shades of gray and brown where sunlight strikes the surface, highlighting the rock's texture and layering. The lighting conditions suggest that the photo may have been taken during a time when the sun was low in the sky, possibly early morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows and the warm glow.\n\nNo human activity or vegetation is visible, reinforcing the barren, inhospitable nature of the high-altitude environment. The focused composition on the geological features of the mountain effectively conveys a sense of isolation and the raw beauty of natural rock formations without any distractions. The background is mostly occupied by the continuation of the mountain, further emphasizing the vastness and the undisturbed state of the landscape.","title":"Limestone cliffs of peak 5308, view southeast across galbraith lake with 300mm lens.
