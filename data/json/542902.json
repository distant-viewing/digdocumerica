{"path":"542902.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a busy marina scene, densely populated by various sailing boats and vessels, evidence of active maritime pursuits. In the foreground, a boat named “Bodega Bay” is prominently displayed; its hull is painted white with the name in bold black lettering, and it features a vivid orange roof over the cabin area. Adjacent to it, another boat named \"Anna J\" is partly visible with a white body and hints of red on its hull.\n\nThe array of masts, rising at different heights, creates a forest of lines and geometric patterns against the sky. The masts are equipped with numerous riggings, wires, and navigation lights, illustrating a well-equipped marina catering to sailing and fishing activities. The background is a blend of additional boats and masts, contributing to the scene's bustling marine environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere suggests a clear day with good visibility, as evidenced by the natural lighting that enhances the sharpness and colors of the boats and their equipment. The water appears calm, with light reflections visible on its surface, adding to the tranquility despite the density of moored boats. No people are visible in this scene, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the boats and their maritime context.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["546877","542871","552028","542912","556191","542904","552027","544248","548078","548547","548535","546388","546853","544244","548075","543246"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","mast","marina","name","sailing","hull","evidence","pursuit","equip","sharpness"]}
