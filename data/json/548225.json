{"path":"548225.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"The photograph depicts an American flag in a state of partial collapse, resting against the right edge of an aged window frame. The fabric of the flag, perhaps once vivid, now appears faded and slightly wrinkled, displaying stripes of red and white and a blue field adorned with white stars. Holding the flag is a thin wooden pole, extending diagonally across the image from the lower left corner of the frame to the top center.\n\nThe backdrop of the photo is intriguing, featuring a densely packed network of cobwebs covering what appears to be a brownish-red wall. The cobwebs are exceptionally detailed, exhibiting intricate patterns and a thick accumulation that suggests long-term neglect.\n\nBy the lower right corner of the window frame, light-toned paint peels away, revealing darker materials underneath, which enhances the sense of decay and disrepair in the scene.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, focused significantly on the textures—the fibrous cobwebs, the rough surface of the window frame, and the soft fabric of the flag—evokes a feeling of forgotten heritage or neglected values, symbolized by the lone, disregarded flag in a derelict setting. The elements combine to create a powerful image loaded with implications of decline and the passage of time.","title":"Old flag and frosted window in Dock Square, the center of Rockport.","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["554361","545047","548577","542581","553175","557244","544423","556491","552457","554561","557640","552589","543330","550144","552450","557343"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["flag","fabric","corner","collapse","frame","value","window","implication","heritage","decline"]}
