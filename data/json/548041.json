{"path":"548041.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up image of a broken glass bottle piece on a rocky surface, likely a beach or a gravelly outdoor area. The piece of glass is amber-colored and relatively thick, a characteristic usually associated with older or decorative glass. Notably, the glass displays raised lettering, indicating it might have been part of a product label or branding, with the visible letters forming the incomplete text \"NO DEPO\".\n\nThe shard is set against a soft-focus background that blends hues of pale pink and blue, suggesting either an early morning or late evening sky. Light plays across the bottle's jagged edges, highlighting its sharp contours and adding a bit of sparkle to its textured surface.\n\nThe surrounding elements appear to be small stones, pebbles, and possibly some bits of other broken glass or debris, emphasizing the discarded and possibly neglected environment in which the glass was found. The overall mood of the scene might evoke themes of environmental concern, particularly the issues of littering and glass recycling. The shallow depth of field used in the image focuses the viewer's attention primarily on the glass piece and the details on its surface.","title":"Broken glass from \"no-deposit, non-returnable\" bottles along the Washington side of the Columbia River in a public picnic area.
