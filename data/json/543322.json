{"path":"543322.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a beach. The beach has a distinct natural feature in the backgroundâ€”a large rock arch formation that creates a captivating portal-like structure extending from one side of the frame into the sea. The sandy shoreline, under a blue sky, contrasts with the rocky features and adds to the vivid scenery.\n\nThe beach is busy with various activities. Several people are enjoying the day, scattered across the frame. They are engaging in different leisure activities such as playing, walking and wading in the shallow water of the surf as waves gently break upon the shore. These people, comprising both adults and children, are dressed in casual beachwear which suggests a warm, pleasant day.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on the natural rock arch and the expanse of the beach filled with people enjoying themselves, suggests a mood of relaxation and recreation at a picturesque seaside location.","title":"Natural arches beach state park","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["553952","547482","557458","550243","547628","543072","555923","543047","545097","547503","546874","546928","551931","553686","553685","550936"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","arch","captivating","enjoy","surf","wad","seaside","people","rock","recreation"]}
