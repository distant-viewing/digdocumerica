{"path":"550061.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and bustling outdoor market. In the foreground, heaps of fresh produce, specifically large green watermelons, are prominently displayed. They're partially housed in open cardboard boxes which feature labels including \"Flo Indian River Citrus Fruit\". Behind the watermelons are other varieties of produce such as lemons, also packaged in similar cardboard boxes.\n\nFurther into the scene, numerous stands and vendors are visible, each offering different goods. Flowers in varied colors, arranged in buckets and baskets, add splashes of yellow, pink, and purple to the lively market atmosphere. Numerous people, including customers and vendors, populate the area. Some are engaged in transactions, selecting produce or flowers, while others are seemingly in conversation or in the process of moving through the market.\n\nThe setting of the market is urban, evident from the surrounding infrastructure. An elevated road or highway runs parallel above the market area in the background, supported by dark structural beams that contrast with the sunny day. Several large vehicles and delivery trucks in red and white are parked or in the process of unloading goods near the vendors.\n\nThe overall composition and busy atmosphere hint at a typical day at a popular local market, filled with casual clothing styles and a sense of community interaction under a clear blue sky.","title":"Fruits and flowers at the outdoor market in Haymarket Square","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550040","551838","550036","550064","550041","556211","551843","550028","550045","551837","557135","551749","544192","557131","550044","550032"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["market","vendor","produce","cardboard","good","box","package","transaction","select","flower"]}
