{"path":"548217.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint and picturesque harbor scene, likely in a New England fishing village. The image prominently features a large, rustic red barn which is built directly on the waterfront, supported by stone foundations that touch the water's edge. The barn has a sloping roof, with weathered shingles and a few visible windows near the top under the gable.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several wooden fishing boats moored in the calm water, adding a nautical charm to the scene. These boats vary in size and shape but are typical of small fishing vessels often seen in coastal communities, equipped with items like ropes, buoys, and fishing gear. To the left of the barn, a pier constructed of wood and filled with numerous lobster traps extends into the water.\n\nThe background across the water shows a line of classic New England homes and buildings that blend seamlessly into the coastal landscape. The architecture suggests a combination of residential and perhaps small commercial properties. Behind, a gentle hill rises, speckled with bare trees and scattered houses, indicating a chilly season as there are no leaves.\n\nThe overall scene is bathed in soft natural light with clear blue skies, suggesting it is either a late autumn or early spring day. The composition is balanced, with the vibrant red of the barn drawing the eye as a focal point against the more muted colors of the boats and buildings.","title":"Rockport harbor","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["548229","548228","550307","542876","543358","542907","542878","550322","542872","550293","546998","545005","542905","548764","550306","550357"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["barn","fishing","trap","sloping","village","foundation","buoy","shingles","boat","gable"]}
