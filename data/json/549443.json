{"path":"549443.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a male individual fishing from an inflatable raft on a calm river or lake. The man, who appears to be middle-aged, is seated casually at the stern of the white raft, focused on reeling in his fishing rod that extends over the water. He wears a light blue short-sleeved shirt, pants, and sunglasses, suggesting a bright, sunny day.\n\nThe raft itself is quite large, marked with the words “UNITED STATES” and partially readable “...TR...” in red paint, indicating possibly a designation or the name of the raft. There are various gear and personal belongings scattered in the raft, including what appears to be a cushion or small bag near the front.\n\nIn the background, rugged, dark rock formations rise steeply from both sides of the water, defining a narrow passage through which the water flows. These rocks are sharp and jagged, textured with a multitude of crevices and protrusions, covered in shadows and sunlight.\n\nThe sky above is a clear and deep blue, virtually cloudless, which contrasts starkly with the dark tones of the rocky cliffs. The overall setting is serene and secluded, conveying a sense of peaceful isolation and engagement with nature.","title":"Members of Snake River raft trip catch smallmouth bass in Hells Canyon","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["554519","550317","554520","550666","542529","542646","551025","542509","551024","550665","550217","553337","544714","552122","550313","549935"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["raft","fishing","cushion","protrusion","stern","belonging","crevice","multitude","rock","rod"]}
