{"path":"553733.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a bustling scene likely at an airport. The foreground is occupied by a large number of variously sized and colored suitcases, arranged haphazardly on the ground. These suitcases, many adorned with yellow luggage tags, range in color from deep reds and browns to black and bright pink, indicating multiple travelers' belongings. The center suitcase in the foreground prominently features a tag with the name \"C. Derca.\"\n\nIn the background, a person is seen loading or unloading these suitcases from a yellow truck that has its back door open. The truck is labeled with the word \"STOYES,\" which might indicate the logistics or transportation company involved. The setting includes a paved area, possibly a loading dock or a curb near an entrance, and there is a bright, cloud-filled sky suggesting a sunny day. The architecture in the distant background includes modern, functional structures, typical of an airport. Overall, the image captures a moment in the travel process, focused on the handling and transport of luggage.","title":"Honolulu international airport handles almost all of the island's visitors.
