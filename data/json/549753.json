{"path":"549753.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph captures a busy scene at a landfill or waste management site featuring two prominent garbage trucks. The truck on the left is painted dark with white lettering on the door that reads \"Miele Bros.,\" indicating it might be owned by a private company. This truck has its bed raised, suggesting it is either dumping or getting ready to dump waste. The other truck on the right is silver and larger, potentially for heavier duty; it has additional attributes such as headlights mounted above its windshield and heavier tires, suited for rugged terrain.\n\nBehind and around the trucks, seagulls are flying chaotically, likely attracted by the waste. The birds add a dynamic element to the otherwise industrial scene. The environment is dusty and barren with no vegetation visible, highlighting the harshness of the setting. Ground material appears to be a mix of dirt and scattered refuse.\n\nForeground and middle ground of the photo are occupied by the trucks and birds, while the background, albeit mostly obscured by the vehicles and birds, seems open and dusty, typical of landfill sites. The sky is clear and blue, indicating fair weather conditions during the capture of this image.","title":"Trucks haul garbage to Hackensack meadows near ft.
