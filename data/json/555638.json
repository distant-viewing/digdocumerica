{"path":"555638.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This image depicts a bustling industrial scene at a mining or excavation site. The photograph captures several large pieces of machinery actively engaged in work. In the center, a large yellow wheel loader is shown lifting a full bucket of material, possibly soil or rocks, demonstrating its role in the heavy-duty operations typical at sites like this. To the left, a large dump truck is visible, either awaiting or just having been loaded with material, ready to transport it to another location.\n\nThe terrain is rugged and uneven, filled with heaps of excavated earth and rocks. The ground appears muddy and wet, suggesting recent activity or perhaps the effects of weather. On both sides of the image, the land rises to form rough, soil-rich embankments, which indicate the depth of the excavation area.\n\nIn the background, amidst the haze that may be dust or mist, another heavy vehicle is discernible at the top of one of the embankments. The landscape behind the working area is filled with sparse vegetation, hinting at a remote or less developed location typically chosen for such industrial activities to avoid densely populated areas.\n\nThe lighting in the photo suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, with the sun not directly visible but illuminating the site with enough light to clearly view the operations. The overall mood of the scene captures the gritty and dynamic environment of construction and mining industries, emphasizing the scale of human endeavor against the natural landscape.","title":"Coal company equipment is used to load trucks at a strip mining site west of Barnesville, Ohio, in the southeastern part of the state","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["544099","544135","547243","544138","555636","552418","544134","542539","549956","547922","554765","549245","544139","555644","555606","554826"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["embankment","site","excavation","mining","choose","await","loader","soil","excavate","operation"]}
