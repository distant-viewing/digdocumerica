{"path":"554000.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features an old wooden church with a steep pitched roof and a small bell tower at the top. The building appears to be aged, with weathered, vertical plank siding and a pronounced rustic aesthetic. There are five visible windows with simple frames, further contributing to the antiquated feel of the architecture.\n\nThe church is surrounded by lush, tropical greenery, including several tall palm trees which partially shade the structure. These palms have large, fronded leaves that are rich in color, contrasting with the worn look of the church. The sky visible in the background is a clear blue, suggesting a serene, tropical setting.\n\nThe ground around the church is mostly barren, with patches of grass and what appears to be dried leaves scattered around, typical to a forest floor. The natural and somewhat overgrown landscape conveys a sense of abandonment or low maintenance of the area. \n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes natural beauty and the serene decay of man-made structures, invoking a sense of quiet solitude and perhaps the historical depth of the location.","title":"Old church in Keomuku, a \"ghost town\" on the island's east shore, where developers plan to build a hotel.
