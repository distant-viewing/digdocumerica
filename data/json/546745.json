{"path":"546745.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a busy urban street lined by stately buildings and lush green areas. The street is packed with a mix of vehicles, suggesting a bustling traffic scene typical of big cities. Both sides of the street are bordered by uniform, classical architecture that gives the area a formal, organized appearance. These buildings are likely governmental or institutional, characterized by their large windows, ornamental detailing, and the prominence of white and beige facades.\n\nOn the left side of the street, you can see a park-like area with open grassy fields, trees, and several walking paths, presenting a contrasting serene environment to the busy street alongside. This green space adds a breath of freshness and natural beauty, providing a recreational area for the city's inhabitants.\n\nIn the foreground, two prominent buildings frame the scene. One on the left is red-brick with a traditional design featuring a steep pitched roof and a tower-like structure, possibly an older historic building. On the right is another large structure with a flat roof and many windows, suggesting a modern utility or office building.\n\nThe perspective provides a vanishing point that draws the viewer's eye along the street toward the horizon, enhancing the depth and scale of the cityscape. The cloudy sky cast a gentle, diffused light over the entire scene, muting the colors and creating a calm, overcast day atmosphere. This photograph captures a dynamic juxtaposition of urban life, historical architecture, and green spaces, typical of a well-planned city.","title":"14th street looking north.
