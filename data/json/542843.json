{"path":"542843.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image provides a sweeping aerial view of a mountainous landscape covered in dense forests. The photograph captures several mountain ridges that extend toward the horizon, showing the varying elevations and rugged terrain. The nearer ridge is prominently featured in the foreground, characterized by a relatively smooth, elongated summit with patches of snow scattered across it. The dense forest cover is a rich green, suggesting it might be spring or summer when the photo was taken.\n\nFurther into the distance, additional mountain ridges, each varying in height and covered similarly in dense green forests, stretch out one behind another, fading into a blueish haze. This haze creates a sense of depth and vastness in the landscape, illustrating the scale of this wilderness area.\n\nThe sky above is clear, indicating good weather conditions at the time of the photograph, which enhances the visibility across this extensive natural scene. The overall impression is of a remote, untouched mountain environment, likely far from urban development, offering natural beauty and a sense of serenity.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542831","552144","542830","557003","555677","552143","542842","550642","554530","556906","553564","550541","548025","555656","544936","542519"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["ridge","mountain","haze","forest","summit","cover","serenity","vary","elevation","visibility"]}
