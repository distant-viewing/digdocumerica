{"path":"556099.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph portrays an interior view of a small, compact space, likely a sleeping cabin or a berth inside a train or a ship. A man in a red shirt and dark trousers is seen adjusting a white sheet on a narrow bed. His posture suggests he is in the midst of making the bed, standing slightly bent over the mattress.\n\nThe surroundings have a metallic and utilitarian look, typical of transportation or utility vehicles. The walls are light-colored, probably a light gray, with various elements such as latches, panels, and air vents integrated into them. The ceiling has built-in fixtures and a compact storage space where a brown towel hangs partially obscure from view, enhancing the sense of cramped, functional design.\n\nThe overall mood appears mundane and routine, perhaps capturing a moment in the daily life of someone whose job entails maintaining or preparing sleeping arrangements in a transit setting. The space is efficiently used, indicating design considerations for maximum utility in a confined area.","title":"Attendant makes up a bed in a private compartment on the Empire Builder passenger train enroute from Chicago to East Glacier Park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington. Compartments are an extra cost option aVailable to persons who prefer such accommodations to the reclining seats in the passenger cars. A steady decline in train travel since the end of World War II was reversed when Amtrak took control in 1971.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["553522","553517","556079","544163","548455","556624","556620","556083","555956","556656","549385","556842","553819","556845","544368","556833"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["bed","utility","space","consideration","job","vent","towel","sheet","fixture","midst"]}
