{"path":"553718.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a traffic scene on a city street that is receding into the distance. It captures a sequence of cars, predominantly vintage models, suggesting the photograph may have been taken several decades ago. The cars are densely packed, indicating either heavy traffic or a possible traffic jam. The cars are lined up in two lanes, with the nearest cars in sharper focus compared to those farther away, creating a sense of depth.\n\nThe lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, as the sunlight casts elongated shadows and dapples the scene through what appears to be lush foliage on either side of the street. This presence of greenery indicates the street is likely in a well-tended, possibly upscale residential area or a suburban setting.\n\nThe setting is peaceful yet busy, with the focus being almost entirely on the procession of cars. There are no clear signs of people outside their vehicles, which puts the entire emphasis on the automobiles and the road. The overall composition and choice of focus pull the viewer’s eye along the length of the road, emphasizing the pattern and repetition of the cars and the narrow urban corridor they’re navigating.","title":"Morning rush hour traffic to Honolulu from the east on kalanianaole highway","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["546370","556195","556729","556724","556718","545432","556727","553681","542684","551913","549857","557230","556732","546730","549829","556709"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["car","traffic","street","procession","repetition","sequence","jam","navigating","put","ten"]}
