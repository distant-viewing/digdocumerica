{"path":"546556.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a classroom scene with two young females seated at long wooden tables laden with books and papers. The environment suggests a typical school or college classroom with functional furnishing, including large black cupboards against one wall.\n\nThe girl in the foreground sits on the left side, resting her face on her hand, looking somewhat thoughtful or bored, directly at the camera. She has long, straight hair and wears a plain white sleeveless top. The other young female, seated further back to the right, is engrossed in reading or writing. She wears a plaid patterned shirt and also has long, straight hair. Her pose suggests concentration or deep focus on her task.\n\nThe room is well-lit, with natural light seeming to stream in from windows outside the frame. In the background, several pieces of colorful artwork hang on the walls, providing a creative touch to the otherwise stark and functional space. The presence of these artworks suggests the area might be used for art classes or creative sessions.\n\nThe overall mood captured in the photo is one of typical school-day activity, depicting moments of study and personal reflection within an academic setting.","title":"W.
