{"path":"543292.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a natural coastal scene where the primary focus is on rugged rock formations and seaweed floating in a clear body of water. The rock formations are rough and jagged, predominantly gray in color with some lighter striations suggesting geological layering or wear from water exposure. The rocks emerge steeply from the water's surface, forming a craggy border.\n\nIn the translucent blue-green water, dark seaweed with long, sinuous fronds is visible. The seaweed appears to be swaying or floating, and is clustered around the base of the rocks, extending into the water which enhances the sense of underwater life and ecosystem. The water's surface reflects a bit of sparkle, possibly due to sunlight, indicating either the time of day or the clarity of the water.\n\nThe composition captures a tranquil yet stark natural environment, emphasizing the interplay between the solid, enduring texture of the rocks and the fluid, organic shapes of the seaweed. The image can evoke a feeling of calmness or solitude, showcasing the undisturbed beauty of a marine habitat. The photograph has a deep and vivid color palette, predominately in tones of blue and gray, which adds to the serene and somewhat mysterious quality of the scene.","title":"California--point lobos reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["545173","547486","549353","547471","554087","543289","543307","545122","542917","543186","545130","543068","547602","543297","543183","543187"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["seaweed","rock","water","float","craggy","fronds","layering","formation","striation","sway"]}
