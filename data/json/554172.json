{"path":"554172.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows petroglyphs carved on a large, flat volcanic rock surface. The petroglyphs are a collection of various ancient symbols and designs, including concentric circles and other intricate geometric patterns and figures that may represent local wildlife or mythological beings. The texture of the rock appears rough and uneven, with visible cracks and natural wear, indicating great age. The color of the rock is a deep, rusty brown.\n\nIn the background, there seems to be a broad, open landscape typical of a volcanic terrain with minimal vegetation. The horizon shows a clear, bright sky that mildly contrasts the dark tone of the foreground. The image captures a sense of isolation and the vastness of the area, suggesting that the location is remote. There are no people or man-made objects visible in the scene, emphasizing the ancient and undisturbed nature of the petroglyph site. The lighting appears natural, enhancing the rugged textures and the mystique of the petroglyphs.","title":"Most recent and most controversial land speculation in Hawaii centers on this area near Kamuela","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["557117","545679","545608","545675","555084","545671","552444","545687","544915","545804","552685","555885","545692","543421","544750","552890"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","mystique","circle","carve","symbol","crack","wildlife","represent","collection","texture"]}
