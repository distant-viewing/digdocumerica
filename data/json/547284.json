{"path":"547284.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a meeting taking place in a modestly furnished room. Five individuals, four men and one woman, are seated around a simple rectangular table set with papers, suggesting a discussion or meeting in progress. The décor is functional and somewhat dated, with the walls adorned with calendars, a small bulletin board, and framed certificates.\n\nThe room features two windows dressed in floral curtains that allow in natural light, enhancing the informal ambiance. An American flag stands prominently in the corner of the room beside one of the windows, adding a formal touch to the setting.\n\nFour of the individuals are attentively focused on a central point, possibly listening or addressing the person opposite them, indicating active engagement in the meeting's proceedings. Their attire is casual and typical of workplace environments; men in button-up shirts and slacks, and the woman in a patterned blouse.\n\nThe overall composition and items in the room suggest this could be a setting within a small office or a community center, typical of settings used for local meetings or small organizational gatherings. The presence of the flag also hints at a setting within the United States, likely emphasizing a community-focused or governmental aspect of the meeting.","title":"Monthly meeting of the Garland Village Board","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["552618","547365","547407","547368","548237","557704","546299","556028","547362","552616","557027","547367","545547","552387","556270","549073"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["meeting","room","flag","proceeding","décor","slack","community","progress","curtain","discussion"]}
