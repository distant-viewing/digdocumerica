{"path":"542822.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a densely forested landscape, with a noticeable contrast between areas covered in trees and cleared land. The cleared areas form meandering patterns that suggest they could be paths, smaller water courses, or areas affected by logging. A large river cuts prominently through the scene from top to bottom, flanked by trees on either side exhibiting a noticeably lighter green color, possibly indicating changes in vegetation or soil moisture compared to more forested areas. \n\nThe river's surface reflects light, giving it a silvery appearance and it winds through the terrain, forming several curves and bends which suggest its natural flow over the landscape. The different textures and patterns indicate a variety of vegetation densities and possibly different types of land use or natural formations. \n\nThe overall image captures a rugged natural environment with significant water presence and human influence, hinting at both the resilience of nature and its vulnerability to changes imposed by human activities.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542881","550621","550620","550601","546351","550559","550580","550623","550530","550527","557002","550625","550576","542909","550570","543767"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["clear","change","vulnerability","land","course","affect","moisture","form","influence","river"]}
