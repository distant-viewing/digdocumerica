{"path":"557178.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people on a wooden observation tower overlooking a natural landscape. The tower, built with sturdy wooden beams and cross braces, has a platform on top accessed by a ladder with metal rungs and wooden side rails. There are about ten people, wearing cool-weather attire such as jackets and hats, distributed across various parts of the tower. Some are standing at the top platform, looking out over the scene, while others are ascending or descending the stairs. \n\nThe environment around the tower appears to be a wide open space, perhaps a wetland or marsh, as suggested by the visible water body and tall, dry grasses spreading out into the distance. Trees, mostly bare, hint at a cold season, possibly late autumn or early winter. The sky is overcast, lending a muted tone to the colors in the landscape. The scene conveys a sense of outdoor exploration or bird watching, with the attendees focused on observing the natural surroundings.","title":"Burrough Audubon Society members watch for migratory shore birds from an observation tower during a scheduled outing at the Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge near Mound City, Missouri, in the northwest part of the state.
