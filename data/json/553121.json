{"path":"553121.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts three women entering what appears to be a casino or gaming establishment, identifiable by the bright red neon sign above the entrance displaying the partial characters \"LIG9J\" or similar. The entrance features glass double doors, flanked by transparent glass panels on a dark, possibly black frame. The woman are dressed in period-style dresses, suggesting the photo may have been taken several decades ago.\n\nThe floor inside the venue has a dark, patterned carpet, typical of casinos, and the interior is dimly lit compared to the brighter outdoor light that illuminates the scene from behind the camera. Past the entrance, the left side of the frame shows part of a gaming area with slot machines and other electronic gaming devices, softly lit by their screen lights and overhead ambient lighting.\n\nThe focus of the photo, the three women, carry various bags and are seen from behind walking into the establishment. They are engaged casually with one another as they enter, and one wears a noticeably patterned dress with a large floral design, while the others sport more muted, polka-dotted and plain outfits.\n\nThe overall impression is of a typical day at a casino entrance with visitors entering, possibly excited about the prospect of entertainment and gaming inside.","title":"Attractive shop","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["546975","549015","549025","553119","549026","551144","558253","546489","548586","548626","548240","556702","551437","545231","547376","545369"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["entrance","enter","establishment","woman","polka","entertainment","screen","glass","neon","carpet"]}
