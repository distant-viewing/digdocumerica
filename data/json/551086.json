{"path":"551086.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph features a chaotic scene of industrial destruction or demolition, with a vivid display of dust and debris. In the foreground, there is a large pile of twisted metal and various mechanical components, suggesting the remnants of heavy machinery or vehicles. Among these, a yellow crane or similar heavy equipment vehicle, partially visible, seems caught amidst the wreckage. There is a significant amount of purple and pink-hued dust cloud enveloping the center, obscuring details and adding a dense atmosphere to the scene.\n\nThe background is only faintly visible due to the dust cloud, but it shows a lush, green, forested area that sharply contrasts with the destruction in the foreground. This setting indicates that the location might be in a valley or a similar secluded area typically not used for large-scale industrial activities, thereby hinting that this could be a site specifically set up for dealing with scrap or waste from industrial sources.\n\nThis scene is heavy with colors that are unusually vibrant for such a scenario, suggesting either the nature of the materials being destroyed (possibly containing paints or other chemicals) or an effect of the photography process itself. The overall impression is one of dramatic, almost apocalyptic destruction within a natural setting.","title":"Raleigh Junk Company, a large scrap metal operation on the Kanawha River at Riverside","placename":"Charleston (W.
