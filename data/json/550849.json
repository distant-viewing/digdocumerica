{"path":"550849.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph depicts a wide expanse of water that appears to be partly covered in patches or clusters of white foam or froth. These patches vary in size and shape, scattered unevenly across the water surface. The water itself has a dark, almost black appearance, which contrasts sharply with the white patches. This gives the image a monochromatic look with a textured pattern created by the interplay of light and dark areas.\n\nThe background is homogeneous and indistinct, suggesting that the focus is solely on the water's surface. There is no visible landscape, horizon, or sky that can be distinctly made out, which could indicate that the photograph was taken from a low angle focusing down onto the water, or during a time of day when light conditions do not permit a wider view.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a sense of quiet and minimalism, with no human activity or objects interfering with the natural elements. The composition emphasizes texture, contrast, and the natural patterns formed by the foam on the water.","title":"Detail of the Fox River at Montello","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543194","557252","550817","553348","545923","545164","553388","557240","547502","550815","550370","550686","545168","545850","555322","547905"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["foam","water","froth","patch","pattern","surface","interplay","look","cluster","expanse"]}
