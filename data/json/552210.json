{"path":"552210.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene featuring a factory or plant situated alongside a body of water. In the background, the plant stretches across the image with various structures, including a tall chimney from which white smoke is being emitted. The sky appears overcast, suggesting either dawn or dusk due to the soft, dim lighting.\n\nIn the foreground, the body of water reflects the plant and sky, creating a mirror image interrupted by patches of dark, muddy terrain or possibly pollution. These dark patches seem to be in and around the water, hinting at environmental degradation. The overall mood of the image is slightly gloomy, emphasized by the subdued color palette primarily consisting of blues and grays.\n\nThe composition effectively captures the juxtaposition of industrial activity with a natural environment, potentially raising questions about industrial impact on nature. Such a setting could provoke discussions on topics like pollution, environmental conservation, and the effects of industrialization on ecosystems.","title":"PulPage waste water treatment lagoons at Weyerhaeuser and St. Regis pulp mills","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552194","548068","546808","550694","552041","546118","544328","548070","551576","557246","550956","554630","546080","557225","550672","551009"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["plant","pollution","topic","question","provoke","interrupt","industrialization","discussion","conservation","degradation"]}
