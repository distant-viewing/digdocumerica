{"path":"552643.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a scene within a cemetery where a mechanical excavation is taking place. In the center of the image is a large, yellow backhoe that is actively engaged in digging a hole in the ground. A substantial mound of fresh earth is lifted in the bucket of the backhoe, indicating that digging has recently occurred.\n\nThe surroundings suggest a peaceful, well-kept cemetery with lush green grass. There are several headstones visible variously in the background, modest in size and scattered throughout the area. The backdrop features a landscape of rolling hills and a few trees under a clear blue sky, hinting at a serene, rural setting.\n\nThe focus of the activity is the excavation by the backhoe, possibly for the purpose of making a grave considering the location. The overall atmosphere, although featuring heavy machinery, retains a sense of calm typical of a cemetery environment.","title":"Cemetery at Rifle","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552642","554825","552641","543102","546147","543107","557742","552640","547583","555608","547243","545888","553138","554837","554790","555566"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["cemetery","digge","excavation","headstone","lifte","grave","hole","retain","peaceful","consider"]}
