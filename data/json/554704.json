{"path":"554704.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"In the photograph, there is a scene along a rural roadside under clear blue skies. The central focus is a large roadside sign advertising \"Michaud's Motor Court\" featuring amenities like \"Kitchenettes\" and noting that it's \"1000 ft. ahead\" along with an additional pointer indicating \"Campsites.\"\n\nTo the left of the sign, there is a man walking. He is dressed in typical casual attire: a plaid shirt and dark trousers, and he is wearing a cap. He appears to be in mid-stride and is looking towards the ground, possibly at something out of frame.\n\nThe background landscape features vibrant foliage with autumn colorsâ€”reds and greens mostly, suggesting the photograph was taken in the fall. There are utility poles running along the roadside, enhancing the rural setting. On the road itself, no vehicles are visible, suggesting a quiet or less traveled route. The combination of elements gives the image a nostalgic feel, reminiscent of road travel in past decades.","title":"Unaesthetic sign at the edge of route 73.
