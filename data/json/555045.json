{"path":"555045.jpg","date":"May 1964","photographer":"","caption":"This image features a close-up of a large Skunk Cabbage plant, scientifically known as Symplocarpus foetidus, situated in a natural setting. The focus is on an upright spadix, encased in a taut, yellow spathe that has a smooth, glossy texture reminiscent of peppers. The spathe envelops around the spadix, which is densely covered by tiny, rounded florets.\n\nSurrounding the central plant are several large, ribbed leaves with a deep green hue. The leaves display prominent veins and have somewhat wavy edges, contributing to a lush, textured backdrop. The lighting in the photograph casts dramatic highlights and shadows across the leaves, enhancing their intricate details and the overall verdancy of the scene.\n\nFurther enhancing the composition, some delicate white flowers with thin, spread-out petals can be seen peeking through darker shaded areas near the bottom of the image, adding contrast to the dominant greens and yellows.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of vibrant natural life and emphasizes the unique characteristics of the Skunk Cabbage within its native, moist woodland habitat. The composition artfully captures the interplay of light and shadow, accentuating the organic forms and colors of the forest floor.","title":"Flowering skunk cabbage in a private forest preserve at Green Mountain, Kitsap County, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543615","553368","555037","544541","553361","555040","555053","553369","554575","555044","547631","554743","551356","555042","558080","554745"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["leave","vein","spread","characteristic","petal","plant","close","highlight","up","yellow"]}
