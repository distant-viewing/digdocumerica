{"path":"557202.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape featuring an agricultural field and a group of birds in mid-flight. The foreground of the image shows dark, plowed soil, indicating recent agricultural activity. In the middle of the field, there is a noticeable mound of hay or straw, slightly off-center, adding a point of interest in the expansive flat terrain.\n\nThe background is lined with a row of leafless, winter-bare trees or shrubs, which provide a natural boundary. Beyond this vegetation, a flock of birds, possibly geese or similar migratory species, are seen soaring across the sky. Their scattered formation suggests they might be in the process of landing or adjusting their flight path.\n\nThe overall ambiance is calm and quiet, typical of a rural setting away from urban bustle. The lighting in the photograph is soft, likely indicating either early morning or late afternoon, times which are often preferred by photographers for the gentle light qualities. The colors are muted, primarily in shades of brown, gray, and blue, reflecting the dormant vegetation and season.","title":"Lillian Annette Rowe Bird Sanctuary near GRand Island, Nebraska, a major stopping area for 250,000 lesser sandhill cranes during their migration to Siberia and the Yukon Territory from the Gulf of Mexico. The birds require a habitat for roosting that is provided by the Platte River, which is shallow and marshy. The area is threatened by a U.S. Corps of Engineers project which would dam and dredge the river. This area also is a major stopover for whooping cranes.","placename":"Grand Island (Neb.)","location":"Grand Island, Nebraska","nn1":["557124","544834","557203","546759","557123","553875","547297","547301","557208","545040","549772","557023","557121","555537","545991","550888"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flight","bird","flock","hay","photographer","bustle","straw","field","specie","mound"]}
