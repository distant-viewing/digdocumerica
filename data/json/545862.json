{"path":"545862.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial landscape under an overcast sky. In the foreground, there is a patch of tall, wild grass bordering a body of water, possibly a river or a canal. The water reflects the cloudy sky and some of the surrounding vegetation, including a dense area of trees on the right side of the image.\n\nTowards the mid-ground on the left, there is an industrial site with several structures, including low-rise buildings and cylindrical tanks, indicative of a water treatment facility or a similar industrial plant. The site is enclosed by fences and connected with various paved areas.\n\nA prominent feature in the background is a series of transmission towers, stretching across the scene and helping to emphasize the industrial theme of the photograph. The industrial structures are flanked by more greenery and additional water bodies, suggesting the coexistence of natural and man-made environments.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of industry and nature, under a dynamic and stormy sky that adds a moody tone to the scene.","title":"Construction of solid waste disposal settling tank on Simms Bayou.
