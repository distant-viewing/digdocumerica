{"path":"552015.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial maritime scene, likely from a dock or harbor area. The foreground shows a small body of water, perhaps a channel, leading into a larger body of water where various maritime equipment and infrastructure are visible. On the left, there is a towboat with bold numbering \"3100\" on its side, moored next to a barge equipped with a tall, black crane. To the right of this, another larger crane mounted on a floating barge is seen; its boom is painted in yellow and black, indicating perhaps its role in heavy lifting or construction.\n\nThe background features an industrial landscape with multiple warehouses or factory buildings, large chimneys emitting smoke, and several more cranes scattered around the site. This setting indicates heavy industrial activity, likely related to shipping, manufacturing, or processing of some form.\n\nThe sky is relatively clear with a hint of haze, typical for industrial areas, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light. The area between the water and the viewer appears to be sparsely vegetated, possibly marshy, with patches of grass and bare soil visible, which gives a rough, utilitarian feel to the environment likely impacted by industrial activity. The overall mood of the scene is one of robust industrial work, focusing on construction or maintenance in a maritime setting.","title":"Arthur Kill Road on, looking north.
