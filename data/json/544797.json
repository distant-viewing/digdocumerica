{"path":"544797.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of devastation likely resulting from a natural disaster. In the foreground, there is a chaotic accumulation of debris and destroyed household items. Notable objects include a large overturned desk or table, scattered chairs, a bicycle, several empty white plastic containers, and an assortment of smaller, unidentifiable debris. The overall feeling is one of chaotic abandonment and loss.\n\nThe background of the image features a large, two-story house with a traditional gabled roof, which also seems heavily affected. The house appears shifted from its foundation, tilting noticeably to one side, suggesting structural damage that likely makes it uninhabitable. The architectural style of the house includes wood paneling and decorative trims, suggesting a somewhat rural or traditional setting.\n\nThe house is situated in a rugged terrain, backed by a steep, tree-covered hillside, which enhances the sense of isolation and the harsh impact of the environment. The sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting an overcast day, adding to the somber mood of the scene. The absence of people in the photo emphasizes the emptiness and the scale of the disaster's impact.","title":"Moldering building, piles of trash","placename":"Black Hawk (Colo.)","location":"Black Hawk, Colorado","nn1":["547079","544461","544464","544463","547888","553470","547868","557993","544467","547085","544468","557162","544583","554437","547130","552829"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["house","disaster","destroy","emptiness","loss","paneling","foundation","devastation","household","impact"]}
