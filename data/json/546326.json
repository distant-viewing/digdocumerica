{"path":"546326.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph focuses on a scientific or technical setup that involves multiple syringes attached to a device, presumably for the purpose of injecting, measuring, or transferring specific substances. These syringes are mounted on a panel, and each is labeled with a different chemical: \"Dieldrin,\" \"PCB,\" and \"DDT.\" These labels indicate the substances are likely chemicals previously used in agricultural pesticides and industrial applications.\n\nThe syringe plungers are metal and are shown in varying positions, suggesting either measurement adjustments or the dispensing process. The syringes themselves are clear, allowing visibility into the barrel, although no liquids are visible in this image.\n\nA human hand is also prominent in the frame, adjusting a knob or part on the scientific instrument, indicating an action of calibration or preparation for an operation involving the syringes. The hand appears to be of a Caucasian adult based on skin tone, though this is a general observation and not specific.\n\nThe background is largely out of focus and indistinct, providing a contrasting backdrop that puts emphasis on the actions of the hand and the precision of the devices in the foreground. The focus on the mechanical and technical elements suggests that the setting could be a laboratory or a facility where chemical analysis or research is conducted.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory: bioassay wet lab.
