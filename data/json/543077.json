{"path":"543077.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat moody scene at a beach under overcast or misty conditions. It features two individuals engaged in the activity of fishing with large nets, standing near the edge where the surf meets the sand. Both fishermen are dressed in dark attire suitable for the beach environment and the cool weather, and each is handling a long, pole-like structure to which the nets are attached.\n\nThe beach setting includes a sandy foreground scattered with small debris, such as pieces of driftwood. Toward the background, the coastline stretches into the distance, characterized by a slightly rugged terrain with cliffs partially covered in coniferous trees. The muted colors and soft focus suggest a foggy or very misty day, which adds a mysterious, tranquil dimension to the scene.\n\nIn the far background, the shoreline curves inward, hinting at a bay or cove. The sky, blending seamlessly with the sea, has a uniform tone that reinforces the tranquil and isolated atmosphere of this setting. The overall color palette is dominantly grey and blue, with subtle natural hues that evoke a sense of calm and solitude. The composition, with the fishermen positioned off-center, draws attention to their activity while still allowing the viewer to take in the expansiveness of the natural landscape around them.","title":"Smelt fishermen cast nets in surf","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"Redwood National Park, California","nn1":["554008","553812","552291","554147","546340","544274","543033","543076","545081","549933","546330","545054","547555","547549","554002","545086"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fisherman","beach","net","surf","overcast","expansiveness","dimension","cove","foggy","trees"]}
