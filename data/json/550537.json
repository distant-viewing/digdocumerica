{"path":"550537.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a scenic natural landscape dominated by a view of a dense forest under a vast sky. The forest, covering the lower portion of the image, is thick with trees that exhibit a range of green hues, suggesting the lush growth typical of late spring or summer seasons. The foliage appears relatively uniform in height, indicating a well-established woodland area, possibly a conifer forest given the texture and color.\n\nAbove the treeline, the rest of the frame is occupied by a spacious sky. The sky has a subtle gradient of colors, starting with a light blue at the top, blending into soft white and gray hues that could be thin clouds. There are no distinct cloud formations, just gentle variations in color that create a quiet, serene atmosphere.\n\nThe overall composition has a quiet, untouched wilderness appeal, reflecting a peaceful natural setting away from urban or populated areas. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, providing soft illumination that enhances the tranquil and somewhat mysterious quality of the scene. No human presence or man-made structures are visible, emphasizing the untamed and pristine character of the landscape.","title":"Autumn colors on a hillside north of the prospect camp typical of interior Alaska","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["548025","550604","554459","550602","553567","553594","558088","550536","548685","555119","555133","549234","549139","555675","550643","542849"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["forest","treeline","start","establish","appeal","illumination","hue","cloud","variation","gradient"]}
