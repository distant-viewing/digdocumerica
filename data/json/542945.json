{"path":"542945.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a logging and sawmill operation nestled in a densely wooded area. In the foreground, massive stacks of logs are organized into neat rows, ready for processing. These stacks are partially bordered by dark green forests, emphasizing the source of the logs.\n\nThe central part of the image shows various buildings and structures of the sawmill, including several large white and gray industrial buildings with gabled and flat roofs. Among these, there is a prominent round structure with a conical roof, possibly a wood chip or sawdust burner, emitting a plume of smoke or steam into the air.\n\nThroughout the sawmill area, scattered piles of logs and lumber can be seen, indicating ongoing logging and sawmill operations. There are also open spaces that appear to be used for storing equipment or additional log piles. A few small vehicles or machinery, possibly for transporting logs, are visible near the buildings.\n\nThe background includes more forested areas and a glimpse of a rural landscape beyond the immediate industrial scene. The entire area appears active but is isolated, mainly surrounded by nature, highlighting the industrial intrusion into a forested environment. This setting suggests a focus on the timber industry and its operational scale within a natural setting.","title":"Lumbermill","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["545011","542941","552198","542942","552162","542940","552140","552163","543749","542921","552199","545256","542944","542943","542515","548155"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","logging","stack","burner","sawdust","pile","intrusion","lumber","operation","chip"]}
