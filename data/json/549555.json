{"path":"549555.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures a serene yet striking landscape encompassing elements of both natural beauty and historical industrial decay. It features a large, derelict building with numerous empty window panes and a couple of tall, slim smokestacks, located on the edge of a steep, rocky cliff alongside a body of water. The building, which appears to be an old power plant, is made of large blocks of stone and has classical architectural detailing that suggests it was built in the early twentieth century or late nineteenth century.\n\nIn the foreground and surrounding the plant, there are lush green trees and bushes, giving a sense of overgrowth and nature reclaiming the area around the disused structure. These green areas are interspersed among rocky surfaces that form the cliff's face, indicating the geographical formations typical of a river basin or a canyon area.\n\nThe body of water along which the plant is situated appears to be a river, showing whitish-blue colors likely due to sediment or fast-flowing currents. The other side of the river is visible, showing more greenery and a suburban area with houses and possibly small buildings, which provide a contrast between the natural and residential spaces co-existing in the landscape.\n\nAbove the scene, the sky is partly cloudy, suggesting an overcast day where the sun might be hidden, casting an even light across the scene that enhances the somber and abandoned feel of the industrial architecture.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—from the framing of foliage in the upper corners to the central positioning of the old power plant—creates a narrative of a place once bustling with activity now quiet and being slowly taken over by natural forces. This mix of nature and industrial history presents a contemplative and slightly melancholic mood.","title":"Aerial view of city of Niagara Falls sewage treatment plant showing discharge of wastes into the Niagara River at Blue Falls","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["554565","547519","553393","545982","544281","550821","546122","557377","557220","543006","551519","550204","552188","549514","550995","553462"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["plant","cliff","power","river","overgrowth","exist","reclaim","century","hide","basin"]}
