{"path":"554431.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside an industrial workplace, specifically a wood processing factory. The image shows two workers involved in manufacturing tasks.\n\nOne worker is in the foreground, prominently positioned, and appears focused on sorting or organizing large wooden planks which seem to be moving along a conveyor belt. He is wearing a plaid shirt, denim jeans, a hard hat, and appears to be in motion, actively engaging with the wood. His posture and gaze suggest a moment of concentration and physical labor.\n\nIn the background, another worker can be seen standing beside what looks like large industrial machinery, possibly overseeing the operation or waiting to perform a task. This individual is partially obscured by the equipment and distant in the frame, adding depth to the scene.\n\nThe setting is a large industrial building with a high ceiling structured with wooden beams. Fluorescent lighting fixtures hang from the ceiling, casting bright light on the workers and the machinery. The environment looks busy with various machinery and materials, indicative of an active production line.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a moment of everyday labor in a wood processing facility, highlighting the physical work and the industrial environment in which these workers operate. The composition effectively emphasizes the scale of the operations and the human element within this industrial setting.","title":"Inside the litchfield paper company mill near Tupper Lake freshly cut boards are fed by hand onto belt-ramp leading to outside platform","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554432","554430","557945","554429","554428","546036","544018","544026","544014","544007","542857","544053","544826","546901","544022","558373"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["worker","wood","machinery","ceiling","labor","processing","workplace","task","manufacture","oversee"]}
