{"path":"557737.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and vibrant summer day scene by a river. In the image, several young people are engaged in a variety of activities: One person is swinging high above the river from a rope tied to a large tree branch, seemingly in mid-air and just about to let go into the water. Another person has just jumped off the rope and is in a freefall towards the river, executing a backflip.\n\nIn the river itself, you can see two individuals wading through the water. One person, closer to the foreground, appears to be moving energetically through the water, possibly splashing or playing. Near the riverbank, a person is walking out of the water onto a muddy shore where an inflatable tire tube rests, suggesting they might have been tubing.\n\nThe setting is lush and green with dense foliage of trees and shrubs lining the riverbank. Overhead, the branches of a large tree provide shade and the point from which the rope swing is suspended. The sky is partially visible through the canopy of leaves, hinting at a clear, sunny day. \n\nOverall, the scene is full of energy and joy, with the natural environment providing a perfect backdrop for a day of play and relaxation in the water.","title":"Children at play on a rope swing at \"big rock\", the favorite local play area on the chattahoochee river 250 yards south of the river bridge at the western entrance to helen.
