{"path":"544451.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph showcases a resilient plant flowering in an arid, rocky environment. In the foreground, a large, roughly textured brown rock dominates the scene. It appears to be composed of conglomerate material with smaller stones embedded within it. Just beside this rock, emerging from a pile of reddish-brown and gray stones and dry soil, is a small plant with delicate yellow flowers.\n\nThe flowers are clustered at the tips of branching green stems that seem to spring directly from the rocky ground, suggesting a hardy adaptation to tough growing conditions. The background is softly out of focus, allowing for a better view of the rough surface of the foreground rocks and the subtle, yet vibrant life growing in their midst.\n\nThe image's composition uses the contrast between the enduring, inert stone and the fleeting vibrancy of life, illuminated under a bright light that casts deep shadows, enhancing the textures and colors of the natural elements depicted. This photograph likely emphasizes themes of resilience, survival, and natural beauty in harsh conditions.","title":"Texas--Lake Buchanan","placename":"Buchanan, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Buchanan, Lake, Texas","nn1":["544894","545718","543201","544440","544887","545727","555884","543195","555667","545562","545724","549018","549228","545703","544443","545723"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["stone","rock","survival","flower","adaptation","tip","stem","midst","plant","vibrancy"]}
