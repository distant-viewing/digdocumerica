{"path":"553956.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows two signs placed side by side in a grassy field. The sign on the left, painted in red with white text, displays a warning: \"KEEP OFF PRIVATE PROPERTY\". The second sign, also featuring red and white colors, is larger and reads: \"PRIVATE PROPERTY PUBLIC MAY USE ROAD TO WAIPAHEE FALLS ONLY AT THEIR OWN RISK. PLEASE OBSERVE ALL SIGNS AND REGULATIONS. L.P. CO.\" The surrounding landscape features dense, tall green grass or cane-like plants, suggesting a rural or natural environment. The background subtly hints at distant mountains, partially obscured by a light haze, adding a sense of depth and tranquility to the scene. The overall impression is one of a serene, but regulated, natural area.","title":"Trail to state-maintained.
