{"path":"546511.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph encapsulates a modern architectural indoor setting, characterized by minimalistic and functional design elements. The scene is captured from a high vantage point, looking down onto a spacious atrium-like area distinguished by dark, glossy, tiled flooring which enhances the space's open and clean aesthetic.\n\nThe central area below is furnished with small, circular, wooden tables matched with wooden chairs that border two tables in the foreground. Each arrangement provides seating for multiple persons. The tables are sparsely occupied; at one table, two individuals are seated across from each other, engaged in what appears to be a focused conversation or study session. Each person has materials like papers or books on the table. Another table, positioned slightly further in the background and directly below the viewer’s perspective, is occupied by one person sitting alone, seemingly involved in reading or writing.\n\nThe architecture features raw concrete structures, creating a sense of sturdy simplicity. A significant structural element in the scene is a pair of large, wide concrete staircases which symmetrically flank the central seating area, leading upwards out of the frame. These stairs create a dynamic line that guides the viewer’s eye back and forth across the image, emphasizing both the depth and the geometric design of the space.\n\nAdding a touch of nature and softness to the otherwise hard and angular surroundings, several potted plants are discreetly placed in the scene. These are small, possibly decorative and meant to add a bit of life and color to the predominantly neutral color palette of grays and browns.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph and the design elements within it reflect a modern, functional environment that prioritizes clean lines and open spaces, likely conducive to quiet study or personal work in what seems to be a public or semi-public building such as a university, library, or civic center.","title":"Interior courtyard of southside junior high school","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["551487","546515","546526","546500","546519","546517","546470","558211","556627","546553","546560","555290","546531","556023","555317","546528"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["table","seating","study","library","occupy","person","furnish","space","design","session"]}
