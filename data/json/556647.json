{"path":"556647.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts the interior of a rustic house, showcasing a blend of traditional and bohemian decor elements. The setting is brightly illuminated, likely by natural light filtering through windows.\n\nThe perspective of the image is from one end of the room, looking diagonally across to capture the breadth and depth of the interior. The room features open-beamed wooden ceilings and hardwood floors, contributing to a warm, cozy ambiance.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a long, narrow table adorned with various items including what appear to be candlesticks and possibly silver teapots or decorative vessels. Sunlight streams across the table and onto the floor, creating elongated shadows and highlighting the reflective surfaces of the table items.\n\nThe left side of the image shows a decorative wall with circular patterns, possibly a textured or artistic installation, adding an intricate detail to the space.\n\nIn the midst of the room stands a broad wooden staircase without risers, leading up to an upper level. This mezzanine is bordered by a robust wooden railing, behind which there are glimpses of houseplants, furniture, and a person. The person on this upper level appears to be involved in a leisure activity, potentially reading or arranging something. They contribute to the lived-in feel of the space.\n\nFurther into the room, below the staircase, sits a group of chairs around a small table, crafting an inviting seating area. Various decor pieces, including framed pictures, vases, and textile wall hangings, add layers of personalization and visual interest.\n\nOverall, this photograph portrays a charming and eclectic home space, which is well-lived in and radiates warmth and creativity.","title":"Interior view of the all aluminum beer and soft drink can experimental house near Taos, New Mexico. The owners report the house seems to work well so far and gives the feeling of being very solid. The southfacing windows capture heat from the sun, a good feature because the winters of the Southwest can be severe. Houses of this type can be built for as much as 20% less than conventional structures because unskilled labor can be employed and the cost of the cans is cheap.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["555310","556627","555311","555312","555316","555289","556646","543041","548440","552114","555304","551267","556016","558025","552096","544911"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["room","table","decor","staircase","live","interior","vase","space","floor","level"]}
