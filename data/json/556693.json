{"path":"556693.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of an urban rail network, highlighting a subway train in motion. The central subject is the subway train, marked with the sign \"Z MAIN,\" indicating its route or destination. The train consists of several silver-colored cars with some graffiti visible on the first car closer to the viewer. It is forging ahead on an elevated track system that curves slightly around to the left.\n\nThe railing near the first car, a grayish metal, serves as a safety boundary close to the train. Below the tracks, an extensive array of other railway lines is visible, spreading out in different directions, hinting at a complex railway junction or a yard. This expanse features multiple tracks, indicating heavy rail usage.\n\nIn the background, other structures related to the rail system, including switching equipment and signal controls, can be seen. These are small, vertical structures situated between the railway lines. Additionally, another overhead bridge is visible in the upper left area of the image, under which some trains or train cars are seen stationary, suggesting this area might be close to a depot or maintenance facility.\n\nThe setting appears industrial and somewhat dated, reflecting the wear and infrastructure typical of a busy metropolitan rail system. The overcast sky above contributes to a somewhat dreary or cold atmosphere, enhancing the industrial vibe of the scene. Overall, the photograph conveys motion and the complex logistics of urban mass transportation.","title":"Long Island commuter train arrives to interconnect with New York Transit Authority subways to Manhattan. The subway has 232 miles of track and is the longest system in the world. In 1970 there was an average of 2.1 million people who rode the subway each day, about 47 percent of the work force. Despite its crucial importance, voters refused to okay new funds for any more improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be raised to cover costs of the system.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556692","556076","548263","556783","556841","548479","556650","556120","548474","547140","556846","546627","548266","555925","551889","556821"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","rail","railway","system","subway","track","car","depot","junction","motion"]}
