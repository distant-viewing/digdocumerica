{"path":"551519.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a serene yet industrially influenced riverside landscape under a clear blue sky. The body of water in the foreground reflects light and appears calm. On the left side, there's a rocky and rugged shoreline with sandy, eroded patches interspersed with small green shrubs and a few young trees with bright green foliage. A notable feature is a large, smooth rock formation that seems to slope gently towards the river, mingling with the sandy patches.\n\nThe center to right portion of the image shows evidence of industrial activity. There are various pieces of debris scattered along the shoreline including slabs of concrete and other unidentifiable items, hinting at human impact on the environment. The background is dominated by an industrial building structure which appears to be old and partially dilapidated. Its dark and worn exterior contrasts sharply with the natural environment at the forefront.\n\nVisually, the image juxtaposes the natural elements of water, rock, and vegetation with the human-made elements, emphasizing an intersection between nature and industrialization. This interaction hints at a storyline of environmental change, possibly questioning the sustainability and impact of human activities on natural landscapes.","title":"The Marshall block company dumps unused concrete over the edge of the Mississippi river bank.
