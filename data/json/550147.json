{"path":"550147.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph displays a street scene focused on garbage collection. In the foreground, several black garbage bags and a container filled with leaves and twigs dominate the view. The garbage bags appear tightly sealed, and the container is partially visible, situated to the left of the frame.\n\nTo the right and extending into the middle ground, a refuse truck, painted in faded white, is parked in parallel to the tree-lined street. The truck features a classic design, potentially dating from the mid-20th century, suggesting an urban setting in that period. The truck's front shows an open door, indicating that the driver might have just exited or is preparing to return to the vehicle.\n\nFurther background reveals a residential street characterized by a calm, suburban atmosphere. Trees with lush foliage line the sidewalks, hinting at spring or summer. Houses are not distinctly visible but suggested by the general residential surroundings.\n\nOn the street, two individuals, possibly sanitation workers, are seen walking toward or around the truck. Their presence adds a sense of everyday activity and duty to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the routine task of garbage collection within a tranquil suburban environment, capturing a mundane yet essential urban operation. The focus on refuse and a service vehicle also reflects themes of cleanliness, maintenance, and urban management.","title":"Sanitation department work near east 125th street","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550162","550159","550163","550154","544091","549842","549844","549837","550150","550158","545502","549840","549765","544087","549751","546902"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","truck","refuse","street","collection","bag","container","sanitation","seal","cleanliness"]}
