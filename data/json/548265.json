{"path":"548265.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a graffiti-covered subway train stopped at a station platform. The train is an older model, heavily vandalized with various tags and artworks in multiple colors; phrases and icons such as \"Hunter Charles\" and \"RAM\" can be seen scribbled on the surface. The subway car's destination readout at the top displays \"SOUTH FERRY\" with mentions of \"BROADWAY.\"\n\nThe platform where the train is stopped shows a few individuals. One man is seen walking along the platform, dressed in a casual jacket and jeans from a style popular in the late 20th century. There's minimal interaction or movement visible among the people.\n\nIn the background, beyond the tracks opposite the train, there are urban high-rise buildings that form a dense cityscape, typical of a large metropolitan area. These buildings are somewhat faded and lack distinct architectural details, suggesting a focus on the subway environment itself.\n\nThe entire scene conveys a gritty urban feel, typical of some cities' subway systems during the late 20th century, reflective of issues such as public neglect or urban decay during that era.","title":"Trains like this one have been spray-painted by vandals.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556811","548266","556652","548263","554325","548253","556814","548258","554324","548261","556651","556653","548254","548273","556650","553823"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","train","platform","mention","phrase","artwork","century","tag","graffiti","destination"]}
