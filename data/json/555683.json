{"path":"555683.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph showcasing a vast landscape consisting of various natural elements and terrain types. In the foreground, there are several water bodies including a large lake which appears to be vividly reflecting the sky. Surrounding these lakes, there is a mixture of rugged terrain and green, vegetated land. This implies the presence of plains interspersed with low shrubbery and perhaps grasslands.\n\nMoving towards the middle of the image, the landscape transitions into a wide, flat river delta flowing into a larger body of water, likely a sea or ocean, seen in the deeper background. The river is braided, featuring multiple channels of water weaving through sediment and sand. This area is less vegetated and features earth tones of browns and beiges, contrasting with the richer greens of the foreground.\n\nIn the background, majestic snow-capped mountain ranges extend across the horizon, suggesting a remote or high-altitude location. The peaks are rugged and sharp, indicating that they might be part of a young mountain range geologically.\n\nThe sky is clear blue, indicating fair weather, which enhances the visibility of this scenic vista. Overall, the photograph captures a breathtaking natural atmosphere, combining aquatic landscapes with mountainous terrains in what appears to be a beautifully isolated setting, possibly within a national park or a protected nature reserve in a temperate or sub-polar region.","title":"View west to port Valdez, the glacial fiord that will be the trans-Alaska pipeline terminus, with robe lake in the foreground the lowe river dumps its burden of silty rock flour--ground by glaciers--into port Valdez, an arm of the pacific ocean at center left","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["555712","550402","550611","543761","550523","550641","548974","555678","555690","555695","555669","555660","556926","550403","542842","550541"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["vegetate","terrain","lakes","isolated","range","reserve","breathtaking","vista","grassland","mountain"]}
