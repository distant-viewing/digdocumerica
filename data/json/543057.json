{"path":"543057.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a moody and striking coastal scene. In the foreground, an abandoned boat is beached on the sand, its body largely intact but showing signs of disrepair and neglect. The boat is surrounded by scattered debris and rocks, suggesting a harsh natural environment. The beach appears to be at a low tide, exposing a broad stretch of sand.\n\nCentered in the background is a large, cliff-like rock formation covered at its top with dense evergreen trees, suggesting a Pacific Northwest location possibly. This rock formation looms dramatically over the scene, casting a shadow that falls across the beach and envelops the boat in darkness.\n\nTo the right side of the image, extending into the sea, is a weathered wooden pier. The pier looks dilapidated, with visible gaps and possibly missing sections, hinting at its long exposure to the harsh coastal elements. The ocean is visible in the distance behind the pier, calm and stretching to the horizon under a clear sky.\n\nThe photography itself uses lighting and shadow effectively, with the backlighting from the sun enhancing the silhouette of the rock formation and creating a contrast that emphasizes the textures and outlines of the boat and the pier. The overall mood conveyed is one of isolation and abandonment in a striking natural setting.","title":"An old fishing boat weathers among driftwood.","placename":"Trinidad (Calif.)","location":"Trinidad, California","nn1":["543175","554004","545132","543053","547044","544181","542884","542887","543081","545081","550310","542889","547040","547041","542886","542890"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["pier","boat","rock","formation","sand","beach","backlighting","tide","gap","stretch"]}
