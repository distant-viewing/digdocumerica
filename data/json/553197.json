{"path":"553197.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of three individuals deep in concentration while playing chess in an urban park setting. One player, wearing a black tank top and black pants, is bent over the chess board, appearing to be in the middle of making a move. Opposite him sits a man in a sleeveless top, shorts, and sunglasses, poised as if closely observing the game or waiting for his turn. Another onlooker, who stands between the two, wears a white turtleneck sweater, jeans, and a cowboy hat, and he seems to be watching the game intently.\n\nIn the background, tall buildings and a busy cityscape suggest this activity is happening in a city center. The park setting is indicated by the presence of trees and greenery framing the foreground, which adds a more relaxed and casual atmosphere to this urban chess scene. The mixture of foliage, city life, and leisure activity combines to give a lively and typical urban park feel, where diverse activities are a norm, including chess, which seems to be a popular pastime here.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: chess game.
