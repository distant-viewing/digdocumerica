{"path":"552087.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures a scene with a rustic, vintage charm, set in a natural outdoor environment that appears like a wasteland or an unused open field. It prominently features an older man standing near the foreground, perhaps in his sixties, looking slightly up towards the camera, adding a personal touch to the scene. He is dressed in a simple white sleeveless tank top, gray pants, and dark shoes, with a weathered baseball cap in his hand held by his side. Notably, he has a tattoo on his left arm, hinting at a story or historical perspective individual to him.\n\nBehind the man stands a rusty, dilapidated truck with a striking red color that has faded over time and is accented with spots of rust and wear. It is an old model, possibly from the mid-20th century, featuring classic rounded fenders and a grill design typical of early trucks. The truck's presence suggests a bygone era or abandonment. Its tires are intact, and it is parked on grass and patches of dirt, indicating the truck is non-operational and left to the elements.\n\nIn the background, the setting includes a broad, bright landscape under a clear sky with cloud tufts, enhancing the feeling of openness and disuse. A small fire burns some distance behind the truck, contributing to the desolate and neglected mood of the scene. A wide river or lake is visible further back, bordered by tree lines, adding a natural boundary to the expansive setting.\n\nThis photograph overall evokes a sense of nostalgia and melancholy, images that reflect passage, abandonment, or perhaps resilience, depending on perspective. The tranquil yet somber atmosphere interacts subtly with the human element provided by the man, creating a layered and thought-provoking composition.","title":"Lawrence resident filled his pickup truck with debris, dumped it at river's edge and there set a match to it","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552673","554561","552997","544767","555875","548752","545739","544349","552995","550797","543354","544720","543478","546092","543173","549058"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["truck","abandonment","tattoo","fender","depend","provoke","grill","perspective","disuse","nostalgia"]}
