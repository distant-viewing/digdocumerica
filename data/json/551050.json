{"path":"551050.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a visually rich landscape of a valley town surrounded by heavily wooded hills. The view is from an elevated vantage point, looking downwards towards a dense array of small, closely packed residential houses typical of a mid-20th-century American town. These are primarily single-story homes with pitched roofs, situated amidst lush greenery.\n\nIn the distance, the natural scenery transitions to an industrial setup, marked by several tall structures, possibly factories, emitting large plumes of white smoke that contrast starkly with the green of the surrounding hills. The whole scene is enveloped in a slightly hazy atmosphere, possibly indicative of humidity or pollution.\n\nForeground elements include various utility poles and wires that crisscross the view, adding a layer of human-made infrastructure to the natural and built environment. The lower part of the image shows grassy areas and some trees closer to the viewerâ€™s perspective, enhancing the depth and layered composition of the photograph. A railroad track also runs parallel to a road at the base of the hills, hinting at the connectivity of this town to other regions.\n\nDespite the serene greenery and charming residential setup, the industrial backdrop introduces a contrasting element to the bucolic setting, perhaps hinting at the economic backbone of the community nestled in this valley.","title":"Looking up the kanawha river valley from deepwater toward Alloy where smoke from union carbide's ferroAlloy plant rises high into the air","placename":"Charleston (W.
