{"path":"546485.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph features an architectural scene dominated by four tall, slender structures with what appears to be brick construction and narrow vertical windows. These towers are evenly spaced and exhibit a modernist design, with certain parts extending above the main structure and featuring what look like vents or slats. The background shows a series of evenly-placed trees with lush foliage, providing a natural contrast to the manmade structures. The foreground includes a neatly maintained lawn, bounded by a curb that suggests a walkway or small road bisected by the image. It's a clear day, and the sky is visible as a serene blue above the structures. The overall feel is orderly and peaceful with a focus on the contrast between the natural greenery and the geometric architecture.","title":"Irwin Union Bank and Trust Company, built in 1971.","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546473","546539","546481","546702","546534","546464","546531","546542","546480","544565","548022","551653","546543","557271","546456","546468"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["slat","vent","curb","structure","walkway","lawn","contrast","tower","brick","series"]}
