{"path":"546649.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a scene on a city street, showing a variety of vehicles and notable elements of urban life. The central focus is a white tow truck with \"POLICE\" labeled on its side, featuring a large towing crane. A police officer can be seen inside the truck, driving it across the street. Adjacent to the tow truck, there is a red convertible sports car with a roll bar behind its seats, suggesting this vehicle might be getting towed.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, parts of a motorcycle are visible, likely belonging to a police officer given the partial view of equipment that appears to be attached to it.\n\nThe scene is set against a backdrop containing urban elements: a row of trees in bloom, light posts, and a large plain building, creating a typical cityscape. The overcast sky suggests a slightly gloomy or overcast day. The street scene captures a moment seemingly busy with activity, possibly a traffic situation or public event, evidenced by the specialized vehicles and visible police presence.","title":"Any car parked on Constitution Avenue, a major artery, is subject to tow-away after 3 pm.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["554309","546638","546653","546743","552077","554293","542755","549932","546635","546631","555461","549832","549886","549853","547666","546661"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["police","officer","truck","street","roll","vehicle","motorcycle","situation","bar","bloom"]}
