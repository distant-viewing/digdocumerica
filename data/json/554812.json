{"path":"554812.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph features a vast open-pit mining landscape under an overcast sky. The terrain is rugged and primarily dirt-covered, with multiple irregular layers exposed indicating different soil and mineral strata. There are deep cuts and terraced sections throughout the pit, indicative of ongoing excavation activities.\n\nDominating the scene is a large red dragline excavator positioned towards the center-right of the image. It stands out with its high lattice structure supporting a large bucket, used for digging deep into the earth. The dragline is positioned on an elevated mound, giving it a commanding view over the surrounding area.\n\nIn the foreground, bare tree branches subtly frame the top corners of the image, partially obscuring the mining operations and giving a slightly obscured, natural border to the otherwise stark industrial scene.\n\nRoads or dirt tracks are visible, winding through the pit, mostly used for the transportation of extracted materials or equipment. There's also a small collection of water, likely a runoff pond, seen at one of the terraced levels.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is somber with muted earth tones and a sense of disturbance due to the large-scale human intervention in the natural landscape. The lack of visible workers or additional machinery besides the dragline suggests a moment of inactivity or a focus on this particular machinery at work.","title":"The \"Silver Spade\" coal shovel owned by the Hanna Coal Company dominates the Barren landscape, off Route 9.","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["549124","552416","554826","549242","554769","555621","552177","544112","549172","549177","549241","544100","554836","544111","544054","554829"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["pit","mining","stratum","runoff","earth","dirt","machinery","lattice","excavator","cut"]}
