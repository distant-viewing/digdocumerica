{"path":"556451.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor scene of a courtroom-like setting. The interior features classical architectural details such as high ceilings, decorative trimming, and panel walls. The background includes three large windows placed at the top of the walls, emitting a soft, diffused natural light which illuminates the room uniformly. Multiple light fixtures hang from the ceiling, complementing the natural light sources.\n\nAn audience comprised of numerous individuals, possibly citizens or jurors, occupies traditional wooden benches, directing their attention towards the front of the room. The audience exhibits a range of age groups and is dressed in civillian attire, indicating the event could be a public hearing or community meeting rather than a formal trial.\n\nAt the front, a male speaker stands behind a wooden podium on a raised platform, addressing the audience. He appears to be in a leadership or speaker role, possibly conducting proceedings or delivering a presentation. Beside him, an American flag is prominently displayed, reinforcing the formal and civic nature of the event being held. Additional wooden doors and signage suggestive of bureaucratic or institutional use feature in the composition, adding to the formal atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of civic engagement or public discourse in a community-oriented setting, characterized by formal decor and focused attention from participants.","title":"Meeting of the Beckley (West Virginia) black lung association, one of the most militant of the groups concerned with that aspect of the miners' health.
