{"path":"555822.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene. It features a man standing in a pasture that is thick with tall grass. He is dressed in a light blue shirt, dark pants, and a baseball cap, walking with a casual stance while observing the cattle around him. The cattle themselves are diverse in size; some are larger with a rich brown and white color pattern, while one smaller, mostly black and white calf is also present, suggesting a mix of ages and possibly breeds.\n\nThe pasture is bordered by a line of dense trees and underbrush in the background, indicating the edge of a wood or a forested area. The sky above is clear and bright, indicative of good weather and contributing to the lushness of the grass and trees.\n\nThe lighting of the photograph, being bright and even, highlights the greenery of the grass and the natural landscape around. Utility poles with wires are visible in the deep background, suggesting that this rural scene is not far from modern infrastructure. Overall, the composition of the photograph envelops a quiet, bucolic atmosphere with a focus on pastoral life and livestock management.","title":"Farmer with his cattle on a farm surrounded by industry near Somerville, New Jersey, in the New York metropolitan area. The farmer also raises sheep and hogs. He trucks two loads of incinerator ash from a nearby sewage treatment plant each day to spread on his hay fields. He rents some land from the industries; the taxes are too high for him to own all the land he uses.","placename":"Somerville (N.J.)","location":"Somerville, New Jersey","nn1":["542626","546102","554071","542627","550833","552565","542628","554560","552562","555823","545153","553801","552566","553100","557749","548984"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["pasture","cattle","grass","calf","breed","lushness","livestock","baseball","stance","wire"]}
