{"path":"552403.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban landscape observed from a distance across water. In the foreground is a natural terrain featuring a lush green landscape with a cliff, atop of which are dense clusters of trees in various shades of green. Below the forested area, near the water bodyâ€™s edge, there is a stone structure with a visible arched gateway that seems to lead into a tunnel. This historical or old structure has another arched opening next to it that appears partially collapsed or in ruins.\n\nThe middle ground presents a water body, possibly a river or lake, which reflects some of the greenery and elements around it. Across the water, in the background, an urban skyline fills the horizon. Notable is a tall building prominently marked with \"O'Keefe Ale\" on top, suggesting either a commercial advertisement or a location name. This building, together with others, exhibits an architectural style from the mid-20th century, characterized by its rectangular massing and step-back style more commonly found in Art Deco skyscrapers.\n\nThe skyline is composed of several buildings of varying heights, dense tree coverage around them and possibly behind them which suggests that the urban area might not be very extensive or may be integrated with surrounding natural environments. The atmosphere in the image appears slightly hazy, contributing to a slightly subdued color palette and a feeling of tranquility or quietness in the scene. It provides a contrasting and intriguing blend of natural and urban environments coexisting.","title":"Looking across the niagara river from Niagara Falls, on ontario, to the american side.
