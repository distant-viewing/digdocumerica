{"path":"545558.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a geological formation, consisting mainly of vertical and angular sedimentary rock layers. The rock is primarily reddish-brown in color, indicating the presence of iron oxide minerals. The formation shows a variety of textures, including chunky, fragmented pieces and some smoother, elongated slabs.\n\nThe composition focuses on the natural patterns and alignment of the rock layers, highlighting the geological processes that may have influenced its current state. There are distinct lines and grooves that suggest layers of sediment deposited over time, then compacted and possibly shifted by tectonic activity.\n\nThe background is uniformly filled with the same type of rock, creating a consistent and textured backdrop that emphasizes the intricate details of the formation. The lighting in the photo is natural and appears to be indirect, casting subtle shadows and enhancing the depth of the crevices and ridges in the rock.","title":"In Canyonlands National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["553770","543151","544907","550474","543421","552543","554410","545795","552890","552546","544815","555182","550428","555047","551233","550475"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["rock","formation","layer","groove","slab","alignment","crevice","iron","mineral","sediment"]}
