{"path":"542697.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of two high-speed boats racing across a body of water, possibly during a competitive event or a demonstration. The water is a deep blue, indicating either a large lake or the ocean.\n\nEach boat has left behind a distinct, elongated wake streaming out toward the background of the image, highlighting the speed at which they're moving. The wakes create patterns of frothy white water, contrasting sharply against the darker blue of the water.\n\nAdding to the dynamism of the scene, there are also several parallel lines stretching across the waterâ€™s surface, which appear to be the paths of other boats that have passed by previously, or possibly disturbance lines from nearby maritime activity. These lines give the image a sense of depth and layering.\n\nThe photo could be taken from an elevated or aerial perspective, given the comprehensive overview of the scene. There are no visible landmarks or shorelines, contributing to an arresting focus on the motion and interaction of the boats with their aquatic environment.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on movement, speed, and the play of textures between the smooth water and the churned wakes of the boats. This creates a vibrant and energetic snapshot of maritime activity.","title":"Water skiers on pine flat lake with power lines stretching above","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["547708","550879","550840","549731","546049","556911","548926","547674","546317","547685","545156","549733","549085","548520","549406","551564"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["wake","speed","boat","water","dynamism","layering","demonstration","churn","race","overview"]}
