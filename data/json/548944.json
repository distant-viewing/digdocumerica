{"path":"548944.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides a striking aerial view of a rugged landscape dominated by a series of intertwining rivers or water channels. The setting features a dramatic contrast between dark blue water bodies and the surrounding terrain that appears textured with various shades of red, brown, and dark green. The water channels snake through the landscape, forming intricate patterns and borders between land masses.\n\nThe landforms surrounding the water are sharply rugged and uneven, characterized by what looks like rocky cliffs and undulations, indicating a possible mountainous or highland area. The colors on the land vary from red and copper tones, possibly indicating mineral-rich soil or vegetation changes, to deeper greens suggesting denser foliage or different vegetation.\n\nIn the background, the terrain seems to flatten out somewhat, and the color shifts to lighter tones and possibly snowy or icy patches, which may suggest a colder or higher altitude region far off in the distance. The overall view is vivid and dynamic, with a clear emphasis on the natural topography and the interaction between water and land in this diverse ecological and geographical setting.","title":"Dams and canals on the Colorado River have permitted a vast reclamation of desert lands in California and Arizona.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["550597","552908","544744","555705","550393","544772","552548","552924","549021","550633","552426","544752","550531","550400","550519","544748"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["channel","land","masse","undulation","water","shift","landform","topography","mineral","border"]}
