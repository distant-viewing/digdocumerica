{"path":"545566.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural rock formation, likely in a desert environment. The primary feature of the image is a natural sandstone arch, which is prominently displayed against a clear, blue sky. The arch is composed of layered red and beige sandstone, indicating geological formations that have been shaped over millennia by weathering and erosion.\n\nThe arch structure is flanked by massive sandstone rock formations on both sides, with one resembling a pedestal and the other appearing as a rounded, towering form. Both sides exhibit a rich tapestry of striations and eroded surfaces, which add visual interest and testify to the natural processes at work.\n\nIn the foreground, there are green, bushy trees that contrast sharply with the earthy reds of the sandstone, suggesting a rugged yet vibrant ecosystem capable of sustaining life in arid conditions. The vegetation is typical of desert flora, possibly juniper or similar species, adapted to conserve water and thrive in such environments.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph balances the enduring grandeur of the rock formations with the transient vitality of the greenery, under the vastness of the clear sky, creating a scene that is both majestic and serene.","title":"Angel Arch, famous rock formation","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544939","545568","553077","544935","545570","545563","545555","545578","545572","545711","545554","545584","545580","545797","545550","545551"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["sandstone","formation","arch","rock","desert","millennium","vitality","pedestal","striation","tapestry"]}
