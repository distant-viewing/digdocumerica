{"path":"552132.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of a bustling industrial waterfront. The prominent feature of the image is the numerous floating logs organized into clusters in the water, likely part of a logging or wood processing operation. These log rafts are arranged in various geometric configurations, dotting the blue waters with dark brown textures.\n\nToward the center and right side of the image, you see the industrial infrastructure of the waterfront. There are several large red and white buildings, possibly mills or processing facilities, positioned along the docks. These buildings are presumably related to the management and processing of the timber.\n\nLarge industrial silos and storage tanks are visible near some of these buildings, suggesting the presence of additional industrial activities, possibly related to the timber industry or other manufacturing processes.\n\nThe background of the photo showcases an urban landscape with dense housing and other buildings, spreading into the distance. The town displays a variety of architecture, indicating a mix of residential and commercial properties.\n\nSeveral vessels, including a tugboat and other smaller boats, are visible in the water, indicating active maritime operations supporting the industries pictured. The overall setting suggests a community heavily involved in industrial and maritime commerce, integrated closely with the surrounding urban environment.","title":"Logs rafted on harbor at Everett","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552215","552214","552140","552153","552170","542921","555165","542944","552195","552207","547994","550330","552206","552249","551203","551609"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["processing","timber","waterfront","log","industry","configuration","raft","tugboat","operation","mill"]}
