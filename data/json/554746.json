{"path":"554746.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural forest scene featuring a mix of live and dead trees under a clear blue sky. The foreground is dense with young, slender trees, many of which have no leaves, suggesting either a wintertime setting or that the trees are dead. These trees have tall, thin trunks and are densely packed, standing stark against the sky.\n\nBetween the sparse branches, you can see hints of mature, leafier trees in the background, which add a touch of greenery to the scene and suggest that this forest could be transitioning or recovering from damage, possibly due to natural events such as a fire or disease.\n\nThe lighting in the photo indicates it was taken on a sunny day, as the sunlight illuminates the forest and casts shadows on the ground, adding depth and texture to the image. The clear sky in the background hints at favorable weather conditions at the time the photograph was taken.\n\nOverall, the composition and setting invoke a quiet, somber tone, reflecting the resilience of nature amidst challenges.","title":"Path of burn or wind blowdown near the top of Phelps Mountain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555201","553579","555139","558088","548744","548685","555096","552453","557019","553574","546947","555133","546065","554718","542939","543487"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","tree","hint","challenge","damage","resilience","fire","trunk","touch","branch"]}
