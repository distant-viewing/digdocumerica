{"path":"546709.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a busy and complex highway system. The image captures multiple lanes of traffic that intertwine through various ramps and exchanges. The roads are filled with numerous cars that suggest a scene of daily commuter traffic, with some areas showing denser traffic congestion. Near the top left of the image, a river can be seen winding its way adjacent to the highway, its surface reflecting light. The urban landscape around the highways appears dense with buildings, predominantly a mixture of commercial and industrial structures given the large footprint and flat roofs. Further in the background, the area transitions into a residential zone with smaller structures and patches of greenery. The sky is slightly overcast, casting soft light that mutes the colors of the scenery. The overall composition effectively highlights the intricate design of the highway system and urban development surrounding it, captured from a bird's-eye view.","title":"Beltway into Washington","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547770","553015","547780","546686","548332","552719","553838","546714","547762","546726","555745","550282","544642","548333","546734","546612"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","traffic","system","exchange","ramp","commuter","footprint","congestion","mute","intertwine"]}
