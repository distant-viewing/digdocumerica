{"path":"556496.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a family of seven people posing together outside what appears to be a modest, weathered wooden house. The family is dressed in eclectic and colorful outfits that suggest a special occasion, possibly a festive event or a family gathering.\n\nStarting from the background, an older man and two women stand on an elevated wooden porch. The elderly man, standing to the left, wears a dark suit and tie. Next to him, a middle-aged woman in a bright red and patterned outfit, complete with a headscarf, stands proudly. To the far right, another woman in a patchwork garment stands slightly behind others, observing the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, four younger family members are present. To the far left, a youth in a bright red jacket and white shirt adds a splash of color. Towards the center, two children stand togetherâ€”one boy in a dark suit and stylish glasses, and another, a girl, wearing a layered, patterned dress. On the extreme right, a girl in a light blue dress smiles gently at the camera.\n\nThe setting is humble, with visible peeling paint and aging wood on the house, and an old set of steps leads up to the porch. The atmosphere, however, is one of warmth and celebration, contrasting with the simplicity of the architectural backdrop. The family's attire varies from formal to traditional festive wear, showcasing a rich tapestry of styles and possibly cultural influences. This image captures a moment of familial pride and togetherness amidst a simple, everyday environment.","title":"Photograph of a West Virginia coal mining family","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548312","556173","557677","556609","552959","553498","556497","556235","558236","556531","543540","545379","551129","551063","552821","551130"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["family","girl","suit","porch","outfit","dress","woman","pride","headscarf","patchwork"]}
