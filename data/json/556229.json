He is wearing a brown jacket and denim pants, accessorized with a red belt, and his posture is slightly bent forward as he focuses intently on his task.\n\nThe background mural has a vibrant and eclectic design featuring various mythical creatures and symbols. These include a red dragon and a mythical being that resembles a unicorn, set against a blue globe. The colors are vivid, with shades of blue, red, purple, and pink, creating a lively and fantastical atmosphere. The mural seems to blend elements of various cultures and fantasies, suggesting a theme of global myths or storytelling.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is subtle yet highlights the artist and his work, casting deep shadows and enhancing the details of the painting and the painter's outfit. The overall feeling is one of creativity and concentration, with the artist absorbed in his craft against a backdrop of imaginative art.","title":"Artist Ron Blackburn painting an outdoor wall mural at the corner of 33rd and Giles streets in Chicago. He is one of many artists painting in the city's Black communities. The artists feel it is a means of sharing art with the people of the ghetto who don't go to the city's museums.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556230","556154","545603","557689","549930","549964","556551","556637","555936","558345","553262","555911","555939","556228","546552","555935"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["mural","artist","globe","creativity","creature","painting","brush","craft","symbol","art"]}
