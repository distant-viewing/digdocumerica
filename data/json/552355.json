{"path":"552355.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a large body of water, most likely a lake or a wide river, scattered with numerous sailing boats. These boats, varying slightly in size and color, predominantly feature white sails, though a few have hints of red and other colors. They are spread out across the water, with some grouped closer together, suggesting a leisure sailing activity or a regatta.\n\nThe land surrounding the water consists of densely wooded areas, and one can observe a piece of land jutting into the water, forming a peninsula. The water is calm, and there are visible ripples around the boats, which are possibly due to gentle wind. The background shows an expanse of water leading to distant shores under a serene sky, hinting at a tranquil, vast, natural setting. The color tones of the environment suggest it might be either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft lighting and long shadows.","title":"Sailboats at sunset on spinnaker run in race on Commencement Bay, Puget Sound.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543936","547781","543059","548555","552353","544021","544669","552351","552234","552345","543994","549411","547757","548498","552346","543305"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","boat","regatta","water","peninsula","land","jut","sail","woode","ripple"]}
