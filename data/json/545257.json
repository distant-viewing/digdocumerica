{"path":"545257.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a panoramic view of a city skyline under a dramatic, cloud-filled sky. The foreground of the image is dominated by a vast number of wooden logs or beams, which are stacked in an orderly fashion, creating an interesting textural contrast with the smoothness of the distant buildings and the soft, billowing clouds above.\n\nThe city skyline in the background includes various high-rise buildings, among which a few standout due to their relative height and distinct architecture. This part of the photo shows a mixture of commercial buildings, possibly including some residential structures based on their size and design.\n\nAbove, the sky is a striking element of the photograph, showcasing a broad expanse of blue interspersed with large, fluffy clouds tinged with shades of white and gray. These clouds appear somewhat tumultuous, suggesting the potential for changing weather.\n\nBirds can be seen flying in the sky, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise still image. The overall impression is of a moment captured between the busyness of human constructions and the natural, more unpredictable element represented by the sky and the logs in the foreground. This contrast might evoke thoughts on nature versus human development, or the passage of time as seen in the enduring sky and the temporary state of the stacked logs.","title":"Log storage at the St. Regis pulp mill with Tacoma skyline visible beyond.
