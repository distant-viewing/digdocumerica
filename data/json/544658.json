{"path":"544658.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a long, straight road and an adjacent canal cutting through a flat, expansive landscape. The road is on the left side of the image and is mainly occupied by one visible vehicle, possibly a car, driving along it. The road extends into the horizon, and its boundaries are marked by short, scattered vegetation which transitions into denser forest or bushland that dominates most of the surroundings.\n\nBeside the road is a narrow canal filled with water, reflecting the sunlight, casting golden and blue hues onto the water surface. This canal is lined with similar, sparse vegetation on both sides but has clearer, more defined banks compared to the road. The canal also runs parallel to the road into the distant horizon. \n\nThe overall terrain is relatively flat and consists mostly of low vegetation, with areas of more concentrated wooded patches. The image suggests a remote or rural area, with little to no immediate signs of urban development. The perspective offers a sense of the vastness and isolation of the landscape, emphasizing the engineered straightness of the road and canal in contrast to the natural, wild surroundings.","title":"Alligator Alley, east-west tollroad across the Everglades area.
