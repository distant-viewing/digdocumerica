{"path":"545672.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a group of four men engaged in a discussion in a rugged outdoor environment. Each man is dressed distinctively, geared for a more formal yet practical outfit suited for the outdoors.\n\nStarting from the left, we see a man with a beard, wearing glasses and a blue jacket over a dark shirt. Next, a man in a yellow rain jacket is speaking and gesturing with his hands, about something presumably relevant to the location or situation. He appears to be in the middle of making a point. Another man, to the right of the man in yellow, is listening intently. He wears a blue jacket with a patterned shirt. On the far right, a bald man wearing glasses and a dark jacket is partly facing the viewer, his attention directed towards the speaker.\n\nBehind the group, the environment is bleak and starkâ€”dominated by a vast, muddy field with scattered patches of grass and debris under an overcast sky. In the distance, a rocky hillside forms the backdrop, suggesting a location that might be used for industrial, construction or environmental study purposes.\n\nThis setting and the attire of the men suggest the photograph might be documenting an industrial or scientific field trip, where professionals are analyzing the site, possibly discussing environmental impacts, construction plans, or geological features.","title":"Dr. George Rice (in yellow jacket) was EPA's on-scene coordinator for the clean-up of the San Juan River oil spill. A burst pipeline at Shiprock, New Mexico, spilled about 285,000 gallons of crude oil into the river. Under EPA supervision personnel from many government agencies and crews of the Texas-New Mexico Pipeline Company worked round the clock to contain the spill with a log boom.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["542607","548277","556600","557145","542562","555287","557727","549908","553182","543995","545537","545088","554865","557856","545668","551853"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["man","jacket","plan","professional","speaker","glass","construction","situation","beard","trip"]}
