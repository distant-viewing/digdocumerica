{"path":"545425.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene at sunset. On the horizon, multiple large smokestacks dominate the skyline, emitting thick, dark smoke. This heavy smoke drifts upwards and blends into the orange-hued sky. The setting sun, large and fiery, is positioned directly behind some of these stacked columns, creating a stark silhouette and enhancing the industrial atmosphere of the composition.\n\nForeground details include a series of utility poles, some with visible transformers and wires. A single street lamp is also silhouetted against the glowing sky. The bright electric colors of the sunset suggest high levels of air pollution, highlighting the environmental impact of the scene. The overall ambience evokes a potent combination of human industrial activity juxtaposed against natural elements, narrated vividly through contrasts in light and shadow.","title":"U.S. steel plant.
