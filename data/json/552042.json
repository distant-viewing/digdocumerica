{"path":"552042.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene that contrasts historic and modern architectural styles. The foreground features a series of terraced structures with sloping roofs, lined up along an ascending street. These buildings display dark brick construction and appear somewhat older, suggesting residential use. Above and behind these buildings, the skyline is dominated by a variety of taller structures, highlighting the diversity in the building designs.\n\nThe most prominent building in the background is a tall, Art Deco-style skyscraper that occupies the center of the shot. Its distinctive architectural features include a tiered structure, intricate details on the facade, and a towering spire at the top, which gives it a commanding presence. To the left of this grand building, you can spot another high-rise with a flat, unadorned facade that typifies mid-20th-century office building designs. There is also visible signage on a building that reads \"HOTEL,\" suggesting lodging options in the area.\n\nThe street in the lower part of the photo is moderately busy with vehicles typical of the late 20th century, reflecting various car designs from the period. The street itself bends around the hill and the landscape is adorned with trees and clear blue sky that suggests a bright, sunny day. Overall, the composition of this photograph tells a story of a cityscape in transition, blending the old with the new in an urban setting.","title":"Newly constructed apartments in downtown Buffalo near the waterfront","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["550024","551442","549997","547229","556030","556020","550062","553840","550122","548425","550007","551507","546745","550118","550011","546728"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["building","street","terraced","facade","design","option","roofs","sloping","tell","century"]}
