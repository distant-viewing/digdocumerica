{"path":"554653.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph features an expansive aerial view of a lush, mountainous landscape during what appears to be the autumn season, given the vibrant, varied shades of orange, red, yellow, and green in the foliage. A series of rounded mountains and hills dominate the landscape, interspersed with narrow, meandering bodies of water that reflect the sky and surrounding terrain. These waters create natural, serpentine patterns through the dense forest.\n\nThe panorama encompasses a wide, hazy horizon, suggesting that the vantage point is quite high above the ground, possibly taken from an aircraft or a high peak. The sky above is mostly clear with a soft, diffuse light that enhances the autumnal colors of the trees.\n\nThere are no visible structures, people, or any signs of direct human activity, emphasizing the natural, untouched quality of the scene. The composition of the photograph, with its broad perspective and emphasis on the natural beauty and tranquility of the environment, evokes a sense of peacefulness and isolation from urban life.","title":"Sargeants Pond, near Blue Mountain, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554640","554642","554761","550629","550478","554712","554714","550596","554713","548025","557127","554639","554647","556906","552600","550513"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["panorama","peacefulness","aircraft","emphasis","autumn","peak","season","series","isolation","tranquility"]}
