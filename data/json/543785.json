{"path":"543785.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial or mining scene, possibly a construction site or mining operation in a rugged outdoor area. The foreground features a large expanse of muddy terrain, with traces of multiple dirt tracks converging towards the middle, indicating heavy vehicle activity. The mud appears wet and shiny, suggesting recent exposure to water.\n\nCentered in the background, you can see earth-moving or mining equipment, which includes bulldozers and dump trucks actively engaged in moving earth or debris. There's a substantial accumulation of piled rocks or rubble, which might be either the material being extracted or the waste product of the mining process.\n\nAdditionally, large cylindrical objects, possibly pipelines or industrial components, are visible on the left side of the background. These might be used for transporting materials or are part of the site's infrastructure.\n\nThe background also shows a steep, wooded hillside indicating that the site is located in a valley or a similarly enclosed natural area. This hilly backdrop, covered with dense green trees, contrasts starkly with the disturbed, industrial foreground, highlighting the environmental impact of the operation.\n\nOverall, the scene depicts heavy industrial activity within a natural setting, emphasizing the interaction and often the confrontation between industrial development and the environment.","title":"Dirt from a small gold-washing operation flows directly into creek.","placename":"Central City (Colo.)","location":"Central City, Colorado","nn1":["556350","547225","552814","554765","555633","555634","545661","544139","549205","556322","556506","556325","544138","547591","554809","552004"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","site","earth","pipeline","trace","operation","rubble","bulldozer","material","accumulation"]}
