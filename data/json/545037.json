{"path":"545037.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, loosely bound raft of logs floating on water. The logs are of various sizes and are wet, indicating recent contact with the water or rain, with some logs displaying remnants of bark and moss, suggesting that they may have been recently felled. The logs show signs of aging and weathering, as evidenced by their darkened, rough textures and patches of lichen or moss growing on them.\n\nThe background of the image features a calm, expansive body of water that stretches out to a hilly landscape in the distance, under a cloudy sky. The hills are lightly covered with what appears to be greenery, indicating a largely natural, forested environment. These elements suggest that the location could be in a temperate climate near coastal or riverine areas where logging takes place. The overcast sky adds a serene yet somber tone to the setting, enhancing the impression of a quiet, possibly isolated natural workspace.\n\nThere are no visible people in the image, emphasizing the focus on the industrial activity of log rafting without direct human interaction at the moment of capture. The composition of the photograph draws the viewer's eye along the length of the raft, leading towards the picturesque, natural horizon, thus highlighting the interaction between industrial activity and natural environment.","title":"Plants growing on old log rafts at Weyerhaeuser pulp mill on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545036","552178","552161","548004","550326","548018","550325","545028","545266","548162","550338","552197","548059","552162","552163","551603"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","raft","moss","bind","rafting","fell","lichen","contact","darken","logging"]}
