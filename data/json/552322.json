{"path":"552322.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures the joyful moment of a man fishing from a small boat. The man is holding up a large fish, displaying pride and happiness. He wears glasses, a camouflage hat, and a plaid jacket, suggesting a cool outdoor setting. His grin reflects his satisfaction and excitement at the catch.\n\nThe setting is on water, visible in the backdrop where the horizon meets a cloudy sky, possibly indicating it's either early morning or late afternoon. The inside of the boat is a bit cluttered with what appears like fishing gear, including fishing rods, a net, tackle, and a red tackle box that the fish is resting on, emphasizing the authenticity and rawness of the fishing experience.\n\nThe boat and the man's attire suggest itâ€™s a casual or sport fishing trip. The overall mood of the image is one of triumph and bliss associated with successful outdoor adventures.","title":"Fishing for true cod in southern Puget Sound near Point Defiance.
