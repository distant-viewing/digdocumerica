{"path":"547330.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an older man seated with a cane, exuding a strong, grounded presence. He is wearing a striped engineer-style cap and overalls with a dark navy jacket, suggesting a working-class background or association. The overalls are adorned with visible metallic buttons and a small emblem, accentuating his attire with elements that speak to a practical lifestyle.\n\nHis posture is relaxed yet alert; he sits with his legs slightly apart, firmly planting his sturdy work boots on what appears to be a brick pavement. The boots seem well-worn, aligning with the practical theme of his outfit. A cane rests in his right hand, hinting at his need for mobility support. With his left hand resting on his left thigh, he gazes off to his left, indicating engagement or attention towards something out of the frame.\n\nTo his far left side, barely within the frame, there is an indication of another individual, suggested by a glimpse of an arm grasping onto another cane, setting a context that the older man might be in a communal or public space, possibly sharing a moment with others of similar age or disposition.\n\nThe background is primarily composed of a large, brownish fabric, possibly a canvas or cover, creating a simple backdrop that further directs the focus onto the seated man. The light is natural and abundant, casting gentle shadows and illuminating the textures of his clothing and accessories, enhancing the visual storytelling of his character and environment.\n\nOverall, the composition reflects a slice of everyday life, possibly capturing a moment of rest or social interaction, framed in a candid, unpretentious manner.","title":"Benches along the main street of Diller offer a chance to rest and review the passing scene.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547313","553090","547355","558330","552684","556563","548218","552103","547179","557713","552871","547282","548251","554857","542613","552648"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["cane","overall","boot","thigh","engineer","mobility","canvas","class","accessory","indication"]}
