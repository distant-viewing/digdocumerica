{"path":"554268.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph depicts a man and a woman sitting at an outdoor caf√© table, engaged in a casual dining scene. The man, seated to the right, is wearing a bright yellow sweater with a bold black and red snowflake pattern and green stripes on the sleeves. The woman, on the left, dons large sunglasses and a red and white gingham jacket. Both individuals appear focused on an activity involving a table cluttered with various items indicative of a meal shared.\n\nOn the table, there are several objects that indicate a relaxed and leisurely meal might be underway or just concluding. Visible items include a pair of cameras, suggesting that photography is perhaps a shared interest or the purpose behind their outing. There is also a white plate with what appears to be a dessert topped with strawberries, along with empty coffee cups, and utensils scattered around. A small bottle, possibly containing ketchup or some condiment, is being handled by the man, who appears to be showing it to the woman.\n\nThe background is unobtrusive, with a light-colored rough plaster wall that helps focus attention on the subjects and the table setting. The settings and attire suggest this photo might be from a period in the late 20th century, given the style of the clothes and cameras. \n\nThe overall ambiance of the photo captures a moment of day-to-day life, possibly a snippet from a vacation or a casual outing, characterized by a mix of personal interaction and engagement in a common hobby or interest.","title":"Lunch at Pepi's outdoor cafe","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554222","554895","551834","551846","558301","551460","554280","550037","553202","551271","547405","548439","558328","545970","549669","551272"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["table","meal","outing","share","interest","conclude","condiment","plaster","hobby","woman"]}
