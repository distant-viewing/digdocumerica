{"path":"546853.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures a vivid aerial view of a bustling marina. The photograph shows numerous boats, primarily sailboats, neatly arranged in rows anchored to several long docks extending into the water. The water surrounding the boats glistens, suggesting either sunlight or the presence of light reflections.\n\nAlong the edge of the water, several structures, likely boat storage or marine supply buildings, are visible. There also appears to be a parking area where various cars are parked, illustrating the activity and popularity of the location. The arrangement of the docks forms a systematic grid which enhances the organization of the marina, making it efficient for boat owners to access their vessels.\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of the marina, there are patches of greenery, possibly small grassy areas or landscaped zones, which add a contrast to the dominant blue and gray tones of the water and marine infrastructure. The surrounding landscape includes roads, hinting at easy accessibility to the marina from nearby areas. The overall composition depicts a well-used and well-maintained marine environment, bustling with boating activity.","title":"Boat docks at north point, east of Baltimore","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["548969","542871","557450","548075","552028","548639","552027","546877","542912","548078","548637","548547","542902","544248","556191","543246"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","boat","popularity","dock","owner","accessibility","organization","anchor","supply","glisten"]}
