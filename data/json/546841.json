{"path":"546841.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime industrial scene where two workers are involved in handling large coils of cable on a dockside. Both individuals are dressed in workwear suitable for heavy manual labor: one wears coveralls and the other jeans and a jacket, both with protective helmets. They are actively engaged in maneuvering the heavy, bulky cables; one is pushing a coil towards the other, who seems ready to receive or guide it.\n\nThe background features a cargo ship with visible rust and wear, suggesting it may be an older vessel or one that operates in harsh conditions. The ship's deck and structures are faintly seen beyond the workers, including elements like safety rails and other maritime equipment. There is also a glimpse of another worker or perhaps a supervisor visible on the ship, further hinting at a busy working environment.\n\nThe immediate foreground shows the dock, littered with other tools and smaller objects, which underscores the ongoing activity in this industrial setting. There is also a truck parked alongside the ship, likely used for transporting the coils or other cargo, adding to the overall sense of productivity and movement in the scene. The atmosphere is further characterized by a gray sky, possibly indicating cold or overcast weather typical for port areas, contributing to the gritty, utilitarian feel of the photograph.","title":"Unloading wire at Port Covington terminal in the Middle Branch of Baltimore Harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["547065","547164","546917","552148","546016","546762","551046","546033","546850","551040","546914","555797","546796","546881","546861","551039"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["coil","ship","worker","cable","cargo","workwear","productivity","receive","push","maneuver"]}
