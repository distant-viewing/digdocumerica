{"path":"549018.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a striking low-angle shot of white wildflowers in the foreground, set against a rugged desert landscape. The flowers are bright and appear resilient in the harsh environment, highlighting their delicate petals and green foliage surrounded by small rocks and dusty soil. The background is dominated by a prominent, flat-topped mesa that stretches across the horizon, under a clear, blue sky with minimal clouds. This setting suggests a serene yet arid climate, typical of desert regions, where vegetation is sparse but certain flora like the featured wildflowers manage to thrive. The composition focuses on contrasting the fragile beauty of nature with the enduring and vast desert terrain, creating a sense of isolation and tranquility.","title":"Wildflowers on Nevada highway","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["545296","545723","544879","544887","545703","544890","545719","545717","544894","544938","545562","545727","545797","544443","545718","544451"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","wildflower","mesa","petal","flora","shot","climate","flower","angle","soil"]}
