{"path":"549441.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people engaged in outdoor recreational activities, specifically river rafting. The image shows several individuals and rafting gear on the riverbanks and on the rafts. The setting is a canyon with steep, rocky slopes that rise dramatically on both sides of the river.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a large raft equipped with various gear including oars and containers, possibly for storing supplies. A wooden table-like structure is also visible laid across part of the raft, possibly used for meals or as a work surface.\n\nOn this raft, two individuals are prominent: one is seated facing the river, wearing a life jacket and grasping a metal canister, possibly a drink container. Another individual is seen from behind, bending over and appears to be handling equipment or securing gear.\n\nTo the left of the image, there is another raft with three more individuals. One of them, standing in the water, is holding a pole or oar. The environment suggests they are either preparing to depart or have just arrived and are managing their equipment.\n\nThe background features rugged mountains with sparse vegetation under a clear blue sky, emphasizing the remote and natural setting of the activity. The mood is one of adventure and outdoor exploration, as the group seems equipped and ready for river navigation.","title":"Lunch stop for river runners on a quiet stretch of the snake river in hells canyon, the world's deepest gorge","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["545733","544925","545741","545908","549462","545745","545729","554462","545737","549461","549437","545937","549447","545744","549465","549463"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["raft","rafting","oar","gear","river","container","individual","canister","depart","grasp"]}
