{"path":"549909.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a lively urban scene that appears to be from the 1970s. The setting includes a group of young people in casual attire, gathered around a low, tiered structure that serves as informal seating, possibly in a public park or plaza.\n\nIn the foreground, three young individuals are focused: a male on the left, leaning forward with his chin resting on his hand, wearing a blue denim jacket and dark pants; a male in the center seated on the steps, sporting reddish-blonde hair, a simple beige top, and jeans; and a woman from a rear view, with long straight blonde hair, wearing a cropped floral blouse and high-waisted jeans. All appear engaged in a relaxed conversation.\n\nThe background is busy with other people walking and interacting. Notably, there's a refreshment stand with the word \"REFRESHMENTS\" prominently displayed, and colorful balloons tied around, which adds a festive vibe to the scene. Behind the crowd, there's a towering and imposing modern skyscraper that dominates the background, suggesting a downtown setting in a large city.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photo is youthful and energetic, set against an urban backdrop that contrasts sharply with the leisurely mood of the people in the foreground. The architecture and fashion hint at an era from the past, possibly the late 1960s or 1970s, giving the image a nostalgic quality.","title":"In battery park, lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550082","553183","553319","553264","555906","553155","551124","550083","553159","554178","553204","553158","551433","553185","550751","551646"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["refreshment","male","jean","1970","balloon","chin","past","plaza","people","hair"]}
