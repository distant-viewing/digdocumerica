{"path":"543051.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image presents an aerial view of a coastal landscape during what appears to be either dusk or dawn, given the soft, low light casting long shadows and gently illuminating the scene. The photograph captures a large section of coastline with several rugged, mountainous promontories extending into a shimmering sea. The color palette is rich yet subdued, with deep blues of the ocean contrasted against the dark, earthy tones of the landmass.\n\nThe sun, positioned low in the sky, creates a dramatic backlight effect, enhancing the textures and contours of the terrain. The sunlight also reflects off the water, causing it to glisten and creating a path of light that appears to lead towards the horizon. A thin layer of clouds or mist partially obscures the mountains in the background, adding a sense of depth and mystery to the landscape.\n\nThe coastline is jagged and irregular, with steep cliffs dropping into the sea, interspersed with what could be small beaches or coves. Inland, the terrain rises abruptly into hills and peaks, suggesting a geologically diverse region possibly shaped by volcanic activity. The overall composition and mood of the photograph evoke a sense of serene isolation and the grandeur of natural landscapes.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553975","543430","543328","543085","543424","543434","553995","554091","543060","557508","543432","542808","545934","543090","543300","553910"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["coastline","cove","backlight","sea","landmass","mystery","grandeur","terrain","contour","cliff"]}
