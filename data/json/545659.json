{"path":"545659.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental cleanup operation in a river setting. The main focus is a small boat labeled \"Coast Guard,\" maneuvering in muddy waters. In the boat, there are two individuals wearing hard hats and life jackets, actively engaged in the operation. They appear to be using a long, flexible boom, which is partially floating on the water's surface and seems designed to contain floating debris or pollution.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes a large expanse of what appears to be contaminated water, heavily littered with floating debris primarily made up of wood and some visible plastic items. The riverbanks in the background show a barren landscape with minimal vegetation and rocky terrains. The sky is overcast, suggesting cloudy weather conditions, which might contribute to the somber mood of the scene.\n\nThis cleanup effort highlights environmental concerns, potentially after a flood or industrial accident, indicated by the mass accumulation of debris in the water and the necessity for intervention by authorities like the Coast Guard.","title":"At site of oil-spill clean-up operations in a remote area of the San Juan river.  Boat pushes oil-laden debris to a point where a dragline shovel can reach it.  Spill originated near Shiprock, New Mexico.  Oil flowed 200 miles downstream until temporarily contained by the log boom pictured here.
