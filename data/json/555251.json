{"path":"555251.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a man working in a scientific or laboratory setting. He is wearing glasses and a white lab coat, focused intently on handling scientific equipment. The man is adjusting or examining a large, spherical blue flask that is connected to some type of precision laboratory machine, possibly for chemical analysis or synthesis.\n\nThe equipment includes various adjustment knobs, metal frames, and holders, arranged in a complex assembly to presumably hold and manipulate the flask securely during an experiment. The equipment is positioned on a sturdy table or benchtop.\n\nIn the background, there are white walls and a window with partially closed blinds that allow some natural light into the room. The overall setting suggests a controlled and clean environment typical of scientific research labs. The focus on the equipment and the man's concentration indicate a moment of careful measurement or setup, crucial for the task at hand.","title":"An atomic absorption spectrophotometer is used to detect metals (such as arsenic) in pesticide samples by the Environmental Protection Agency at their Mississippi Test Facility laboratory in Bay St. Louis.","placename":"Mississippi","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555250","546284","546277","543801","542666","549604","549612","549605","546278","549333","546296","555280","549608","555248","555249","555265"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["flask","lab","equipment","laboratory","holder","blind","adjustment","knob","analysis","measurement"]}
