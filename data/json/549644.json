{"path":"549644.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene with several individuals at a bus stop. The composition is framed around a large, dark-colored tree in the foreground, slightly off-center to the right, which splits the view and partly shades the image.\n\nIn the scene, there are a few bus stop shelters; each has a flat, slightly angled roof supported by posts. The shelters appear to be constructed from concrete and metal. Underneath one of these shelters, there are adults engaged in various activities: standing, talking, and checking the time. Thereâ€™s a distinct focus on the individuals under the shelter to the left of the tree, where three adults are visibly engaging with each other. Across the road, there is another adult standing alone under another shelter. \n\nThe scene is set in a street-side location with a paved sidewalk and a road visible adjacent to the bus stop. The background features buildings and leafy trees, suggesting a quiet, perhaps suburban or small-town setting. The lighting in the photograph suggests it is a sunny day, casting shadows beneath the tree and shelter, which contribute to the texture and depth of the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a typical, everyday moment of people waiting at a bus stop, presented in a quaint, serene setting. The attire of the people suggests a setting from a few decades ago, considering the style of clothes and accessories.","title":"Bus stop shelters","placename":"Belgrade (Serbia)","location":"Belgrade, Serbia","nn1":["546650","546662","546655","547195","546651","548608","546615","553796","546589","556786","556799","556809","546666","547133","546605","546592"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["shelter","stop","bus","adult","accessory","consider","split","talk","tree","check"]}
