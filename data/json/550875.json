{"path":"550875.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a factory releasing heavy pollution. The foreground is an expanse of water, possibly a river, with scattered debris and a large pile of wood chips or similar material on its bank. The middle ground consists of industrial structures, including a dark colored metal framework supporting machinery and possibly conveyor systems.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple tall smokestacks emitting thick smoke. The smoke billows are in different shades: one stack emits dark gray to black smoke, which may indicate the burning of heavy, polluting materials, while another stack emits white smoke, which could be steam or smoke from the burning of lighter materials. The sky above is partially cloudy, providing a natural backdrop that contrasts starkly with the artificial and heavy industrial activity shown.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its dramatic portrayal of industrial pollution, could be suggestive of environmental challenges associated with industrial operations.","title":"Smokestacks of the Charmin Paper Company belching smoke and sulfite odor.
