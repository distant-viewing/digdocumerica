{"path":"555353.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph displays two large, semi-circular structures which appear to be air-inflated domes. The dome on the left is covered in what seems to be a material fraying at the edges, possibly as a result of wear or damage, which reveals underlying layers that are black and potentially insulative. The right dome looks intact and is uniformly white.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a rectangular structure, possibly an equipment or storage box, with a label which reads \"AIR INFLATED ADEQUATELY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT.\" This label suggests that the structures may be used for purposes that require atmospheric control, such as agricultural or scientific experiments.\n\nThe ground is barren and gravelly, indicating a dry or desert-like environment. In the background, the sky is mostly clear but with few streaky, white clouds. There are no visible natural or artificial landmarks that would immediately identify the location. The overall setting feels isolated and utilitarian, primarily focused on the function of these domes.","title":"Two inflated polyethylene solar heated \"greenhouses\" located at the University of Arizona Environmental Research Laboratory at Tucson. High intensity aquaculture is being studied in these structures; high intensity agriculture is studied in others. The time for shrimp to breed, hatch, and mature has been halved over the natural ocean process.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["555364","546160","546844","555367","555369","555313","555331","555321","555306","557325","555333","555320","546148","546189","555307","544137"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["dome","label","air","result","experiment","landmark","damage","function","box","control"]}
