{"path":"552340.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a group of four cyclists on a paved road surrounded by lush greenery. The scene appears to be set in a rural or forested area given the dense canopy of trees in the background. The road is bending slightly to the right where the cyclists are headed.\n\nA focal point of the image is a young man in the foreground, intensely focused while looking down and gripping the handlebars of what appears to be a road or racing bicycle. He wears a light-colored T-shirt and dark shorts, which contrasts with the bright greenery around him.\n\nBehind him, another cyclist, a young woman, is pedaling casually and looking forward with a relaxed posture. She is followed closely by two more cyclists, both women, who are further back on the road; one of them is also looking straight ahead while the other is slightly turned, perhaps speaking to her companion.\n\nThe scene captures a tranquil yet active moment, possibly during a leisurely ride in a less trafficked, natural area. On the left, at the edge of the road, there is a small, somewhat worn road sign embedded in the grass, partially obscured by the lead woman cyclist.","title":"Cyclists enjoy outing on Chuckanut Drive, Larrabee State Park, during monthly Bicycle Sunday.","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["545287","550069","555499","547209","543719","557990","555500","543715","550084","551545","548574","551303","553908","550073","554690","550689"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["cyclist","road","pedal","woman","racing","handlebar","companion","embed","grip","bicycle"]}
