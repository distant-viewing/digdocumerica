{"path":"550051.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene in a park setting. In the foreground, two people are seen sitting on a park bench. They appear to be engaged in a conversation, enjoying the surroundings. The individuals are silhouetted, adding a sense of privacy and anonymity to their interaction.\n\nAround the bench, there are several trees with young, sparse leaves suggesting that it might be early spring. The branches of the trees create an intricate natural framework that partially obscures the view but adds texture to the image.\n\nIn the background, a modern, curved high-rise building looms over the park. Its reflective glass surface contrasts with the natural elements in the park, illustrating the juxtaposition of urban development and green spaces.\n\nThe park itself seems well-maintained, with a paved walking path visible, suggesting the park is designed for leisurely strolls and relaxation. Beneath the bench and path, the grass is lush and green, indicating healthy vegetation. Further in the background, more people can be faintly seen enjoying the park, which adds a lively but peaceful atmosphere to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the interaction between the natural environment and urban elements, along with the peaceful human activity, conveys a serene and contemplative mood.","title":"The common and adjoining public gardens provide rest and recreation in the center of metropolitan Boston","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551776","550075","552722","550074","552723","544808","551682","547784","549986","557257","553065","552036","546259","551942","549516","551713"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["park","bench","anonymity","path","enjoy","stroll","privacy","lively","loom","walking"]}
