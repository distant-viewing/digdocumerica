{"path":"548292.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet dynamic beach scene. A woman is throwing a frisbee, shown mid-action with her arm extended upwards towards the sky and one leg slightly raised above the soft, white sand. She is dressed in casual beach attire, wearing white pants and a dark long-sleeve top. A dog, mid-leap, is energetically chasing after the frisbee, adding a sense of motion and playfulness to the scene.\n\nThe backdrop features a picturesque beach setting with turquoise blue waters and gentle waves lapping at the shore. The ocean extends to the horizon, meeting a clear, slightly hazy blue sky. The beach appears to be largely deserted, emphasizing a sense of tranquility and isolation.\n\nThe overall composition and the vintage color saturation give the scene a nostalgic quality, evoking a sense of timeless summer days spent at the beach. The soft sand, scattered with footprints, curves gently into the distance, guiding the viewer's eye through the scene from the foreground to the vast ocean in the background.","title":"\"Call of the Running Tide\"","placename":"Destin Harbor (Fla.)","location":"Destin Harbor, Florida","nn1":["543463","543395","553072","544191","545218","557507","543083","546982","553951","548697","547612","548695","545162","545133","543070","548698"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","ocean","mid","playfulness","footprint","saturation","dog","leg","curve"]}
