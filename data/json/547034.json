{"path":"547034.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil seaside scene, depicting a concrete structure on a sandy beach. The structure appears to be a curvilinear shelter, possibly a bench or small pavilion, characterized by a broad, arching roof supported by thick, rectangular pillars. The design is modern and minimalistic.\n\nThe beach itself is sandy, with patches of grass and scattered debris which suggests it is not frequently maintained. In the distance, a calm sea extends to the horizon under a partly cloudy sky. The light indicates either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and giving the scene a warm tone.\n\nTo the left of the image, there's another building and some industrial-looking structures, hinting that the beach might be near a developed or industrial area. The overall mood is somewhat serene yet forlorn, as the area appears deserted and slightly neglected. The composition of the image, with the shelter offset to the right and the expansive view of the beach and sea stretching out, evokes a sense of isolation and the passage of time.","title":"Lakeside beach house under construction near zion nuclear plant (in background)","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["543244","548221","544617","547607","557460","545052","545162","543078","547040","548220","548809","544989","546953","545108","543493","553772"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","shelter","pavilion","sea","pillars","seaside","passage","bench","arch","neglect"]}
