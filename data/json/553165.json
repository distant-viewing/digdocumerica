Her attire includes a dark turtleneck and a maroon jacket over blue jeans. She is holding a small bouquet featuring a white flower and ferns. The young woman's expression is thoughtful, with her gaze directed towards something off-camera. Her earrings, visible due to her hair being swept by the wind, add to her detailed appearance. The background is softly focused but hints at a public space, perhaps a park, with indistinct figures and dashes of greenery suggesting a relaxed, sunny day.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: a flower vender has made a sale.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553156","544747","557114","556414","553191","551448","554923","543835","556492","544742","550048","546555","553157","553164","551458","556765"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["turtleneck","earring","fern","hair","gaze","woman","wind","jean","flower","park"]}
