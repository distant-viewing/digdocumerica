{"path":"543443.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph shows a magnificent nature scene that captures a moment of exploration and tranquility against a backdrop of impressive mountain landscapes. The setting is a serene, reflective lake nestled amongst mountain slopes covered with trees. The lake itself is calm, reflecting a blue sky scattered with clouds and the towering presence of a large, dome-shaped mountain prominently displayed in the background.\n\nIn the foreground on the left, a large shadowy boulder partially frames the view. At the center of the image, several people are gathered on a small, rocky outcrop that extends into the calm water. The group appears engaged in a leisure activity, possibly preparing for a small excursion or enjoying the beauty of the surroundings. The people, small in scale compared to the grandeur of the landscape, add a human element to the scene, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the natural environment around them.\n\nSurrounding the lake and the rock outcrop, lush green trees and foliage fill the landscape, suggesting this photograph was taken during a season of growth. The majestic mountain in the background anchors the composition, its smooth, rounded summit standing in contrast to the textured, rugged terrain that supports the vegetation and the life of the forest below. The overall effect is one of peace and the timelessness of nature.","title":"California -- Yosemite National Park","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["543816","543643","555692","550641","543450","554399","545710","554516","552894","552900","543761","554761","543547","548963","557769","543535"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","lake","summit","excursion","timelessness","scale","peace","outcrop","dome","anchor"]}
