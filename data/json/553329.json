The room is filled with technical equipment and various machines, suggesting a focus on engineering or mechanical testing.\n\nProminently in the foreground, there is a large, intricate machine adorned with blue and orange components. Hoses and metal fittings connect various parts. This machine appears complex and possibly used for engine or mechanical testing, as indicated by its automotive-style components.\n\nThe man in the scene is adjusting another machine, which is equipped with cylindrical parts and mounted on a sturdy metal frame. He wears glasses and a short-sleeve shirt, and is focused intently on his task, creating a sense of industry and precision.\n\nThe setting is utilitarian, with visible conduits and piping running along the floor and walls. The lighting is functional, aimed at illuminating the workspace effectively rather than for ambiance. The overall atmosphere is one of a technical workspace where detailed mechanical work or research is conducted.","title":"Emission test at the national environmental research center of epa: the ford engine (blue) with ford's monolith-honeycombed catalytic converter (brass-colored) chevrolet engine at upper right","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553330","549684","544822","551595","549364","558379","556314","558371","555239","546036","542765","542664","549683","549627","544818","558373"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["machine","testing","workspace","component","fitting","conduit","precision","piping","hose","conduct"]}
