{"path":"550844.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and somewhat shadowy view of a waterway, likely a river, bordered by dense trees. The scene is bathed in natural light, creating a contrast between the dark shadows cast by the overarching trees and the brighter surfaces where the sunlight breaks through. The water features a mix of calm sections and gentle ripples, reflecting the overhanging trees and patches of blue sky.\n\nThe perspective of the shot places the observer looking down a natural corridor created by the river, which gently bends away and disappears into the distance, framed by the lush foliage. The trees themselves vary in type, showing different textures and shades of green, suggesting a diverse ecosystem.\n\nNo human activities or people are visible in this tranquil natural setting, emphasizing the untouched and quiet aspect of the environment. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and somewhat introspective, inviting the viewer to consider the quietude and beauty of this natural landscape.","title":"The fox river meanders toward lake winnebago","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["546963","550845","542844","555076","557250","555075","557106","550656","554629","542653","550839","553452","553410","554623","544861","553355"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["corridor","disappear","observer","quietude","consider","overhang","tree","river","bathe","waterway"]}
