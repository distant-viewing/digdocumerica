{"path":"545400.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a nostalgic and atmospheric scene on a residential street. In the foreground, a child is in mid-action, captured in silhouette with arms extended and one leg lifted, suggesting a running or jumping motion. The child appears to be throwing or playing with a flat object, possibly a Frisbee.\n\nThe setting is softly lit with an ambience that suggests either early morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows and subdued lighting. Notable in the background is a vintage car parked on the side of the street, emphasizing the period feel of the photograph. This car, also in silhouette, has distinctive 1960s or 1970s styling, adding a sense of the era to the image.\n\nThe background shows residential housing with simple, modest architecture typical of mid-20th-century urban design. A notable feature in the sky behind is a thick smoke cloud, suggesting a large fire in the vicinity, which adds a dramatic touch and possibly contextual importance to the photo.\n\nThe overall composition, with the child's motion and the intriguing background, creates a dynamic and somewhat moody narrative, evoking curiosity about the story behind this moment. The inclusion of elements like the smoke and the classic car invite interpretations related to the historical or social context of the scene.","title":"Tossing a frisbee on a smoke-filled street in north Birmingham, most heavily polluted area of the city","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["553851","545404","547738","547201","551119","545372","545398","552756","549272","555934","555895","543947","545321","551084","545353","548238"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["child","car","interpretation","jump","styling","motion","silhouette","smoke","throw","inclusion"]}
