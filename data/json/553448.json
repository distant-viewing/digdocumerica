{"path":"553448.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures two young boys on a sunny day at a lakeside. The first boy, on the left, is smiling at the camera, making a peace sign with his fingers. He has short dark hair and is shirtless, visually expressing joy and playfulness. The other boy, on the right, is also shirtless and has wet, dark hair swept to the side, covering his forehead slightly. His expression is more subdued compared to the first boy but still suggests a sense of contentment and relaxation.\n\nThe background shows a lively scene at a lake, with other people visible at a slight distance. Some individuals are standing in the shallow part of the water, while others relax on the grassy shore, scattered around with their belongings. The atmosphere is casual and leisurely, indicative of a typical day out enjoying the water and sun. The setting includes trees around the perimeter of the lake, providing a natural green backdrop to the scene of recreational and social activity.","title":"Here at Clinton, in the first quarter mile from its origin below the Wachusett Reservoir, the Nashua River is still safe for swimming.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553431","544221","544218","544204","544211","553430","544805","553447","551544","543892","553446","544185","558233","544200","554499","545959"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["boy","contentment","forehead","playfulness","lake","perimeter","belonging","finger","peace","hair"]}
