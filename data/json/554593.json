{"path":"554593.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a tree trunk densely populated by layers of fungal growths, presumably shelf or bracket fungi. The tree bark is dark and rugged, featuring deep furrows that contribute to a textured backdrop for the pale, overlapping fungi that exhibit a slightly wavy form with delicate edges.\n\nThe fungi vary slightly in shade, ranging from white to a subtle gray, adding vibrancy against the shadowy, dark tones of the bark. These fungi are typically found on trees and play a role in breaking down the wood, indicating an ongoing natural decomposing process.\n\nThe composition emphasizes the contrast between the organic life forms—highlighting textures, patterns, and the interaction between the tree and the fungi. The focus and shallow depth of field underscore the fungi, allowing the details of their structure to stand out sharply against the softer, blurred background which fades into darkness. This interplay of focus also enhances the visual impact of the fungi’s intricate details and the ruggedness of the tree bark.","title":"Closeup of fungus on a dead beech tree in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["558081","555015","555181","555180","558076","555006","555179","557595","557624","554974","557616","555188","551355","555001","545288","544662"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","furrow","decompose","bracket","tree","overlap","ruggedness","shelf","vibrancy","darkness"]}
