{"path":"544600.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a suburban development with multiple distinct features. Visible on the right side of the image, there is a developed residential area consisting of closely spaced single-family homes laid out along curvilinear streets beside a large body of water that has the appearance of a river or canal. This residential section prominently features roofs in shades of gray and brown. The contrast of well-maintained green lawns against the homes enhances the orderly suburban aesthetic.\n\nAdjacent to the residential area, to the left of the image, a large construction zone or undeveloped land is visible, containing partially constructed roads and plots, some of which are filled with water, possibly for future development or as stormwater management features. This zone is marked by an absence of buildings and sparse vegetation.\n\nIn the background, the horizon is dominated by flat, expansive open fields that give way to a wide-open sky with clusters of clouds, suggesting a vast, less developed or agricultural landscape extending beyond the suburban and construction areas.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes developed residential living with undeveloped land, highlighting a phase of expansion or growth within a suburban context. The nearby open fields and cloudy sky contribute to a sense of isolation or separation from urban centers, emphasizing the locale's proximity to natural landscapes.","title":"Kendale lakes housing development is constructed near the boundaries of the Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["544568","544604","553700","553706","553934","551198","553936","558112","553693","558059","548825","548011","553061","557454","547435","549071"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["develop","zone","home","development","separation","phase","construction","expansion","land","locale"]}
