{"path":"548514.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph features two small sailboats on a body of water, likely a lake or calm sea. Each boat is manned by a single individual. \n\nThe boat in the foreground is equipped with a vibrant red and white spinnaker with the number \"14\" prominently displayed, and the sail is billowing in the wind. The main sail bears a numerical registration \"US11466.\" A young man with curly dark hair, wearing a sleeveless white tank top and striped shorts, is operating the boat. He stands near the stern, holding onto some ropes, likely managing the boat's direction and sails.\n\nThe second boat in the background has a less visible sail, but it appears to be a smaller, regular sail without a spinnaker.\n\nThe backdrop is a wide expanse of water that extends to a hazy, tree-lined horizon, indicating a large lake or coastal area. The sky is overcast with hints of blue peeking through, suggesting a bright yet cloudy day. The overall ambiance is serene with a focus on recreational sailing.","title":"Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548517","543941","549421","549423","549425","549406","548526","544029","548521","548532","549422","549386","548510","543953","548203","548522"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","boat","registration","lake","sailing","sailboat","rope","wind","direction","number"]}
