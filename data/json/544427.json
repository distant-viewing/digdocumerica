{"path":"544427.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This image captures a poignant scene at a cemetery during sunset, with the focus on well-decorated graves. The graves are adorned with a rich array of colorful flower arrangements, small American flags, and other small personal tokens that indicate remembrance and honor for the deceased.\n\nThe foreground primarily features one grave that is highlighted by the warm glow of the sunset. This grave, in particular, stands out with a prominent American flag that is illuminated by the sunlight, suggesting a patriotic or military connection of the deceased. Surrounding this grave are numerous other floral decorations, crosses, and personal remembrances beautifully lit by the dimming light, creating a solemn yet peaceful atmosphere.\n\nThe background of the scene is less distinct, bathed in the evening shadows, but one can discern a sparse landscape that suggests a rural or semi-desert setting. It appears vast and open, providing a stark contrast to the intimate, richly decorated graves in the foreground.\n\nThe overall composition and lighting in the photograph evoke a mood of reverence and quiet reflection, highlighting themes of memory, honor, and patriotism.","title":"Veterans' cemetery","placename":"Window Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Window Rock, Arizona","nn1":["544423","544267","550364","545322","554790","554824","557184","557089","547337","557185","550731","557942","552487","558040","547397","554792"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["grave","remembrance","decorate","flag","sunset","patriotism","reverence","memory","intimate","cemetery"]}
