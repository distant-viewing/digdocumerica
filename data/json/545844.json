{"path":"545844.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures machinery at an industrial facility, focusing on the complex arrangement of pipes, valves, and cylinders lined along a concrete pathway. Large vertical and horizontal steel pipes dominate the scene, featuring multiple connections sealed with bolted flanges. Valves and pressure gauges are installed intermittently to control and monitor the flow of substances. Some larger cylinders are also visible, potentially acting as separators or processing units.\n\nThe machinery is mounted on concrete pedestals, suggesting the need for a sturdy foundation due to the weight and vibration of the operational equipment. Metallic structures include stairs and safety handrails, indicating that the facility accommodates human operators for maintenance and monitoring.\n\nThe background shows a clear blue sky, hinting that the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day. There is no visible vegetation or other buildings in the immediate vicinity, placing the industrial setup possibly in a secluded or dedicated zone typically used for such large-scale industrial operations.\n\nThe overall appearance of the installation is well-maintained, with clean, unpainted metal surfaces and organized layouts, reflecting a functional and operational industrial environment.","title":"Cooling towers and settling tanks for removal of effluents from the water used by this general tire chemical plant are partially financed by the government.
