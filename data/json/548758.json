{"path":"548758.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast collection of crushed and flattened aluminum cans that are densely spread across the foreground. These cans appear to be primarily beverage cans, identifiable by some visible logos and branding of well-known beverage companies. The cans are in various states of being crumpled and overlapping each other, creating a metallic tapestry of refuse.\n\nIn the background, a sign reading \"ALL ALUMINUM ONLY\" is prominently displayed. This sign is mounted on a pole and is situated above the can collection, suggesting that this is a specialized recycling facility or collection point specifically for aluminum waste. The sign, along with the context of the scene, emphasizes a focus on aluminum recycling.\n\nThe surrounding area consists of a few sparse trees and what seems to be a fence, partitioning off the area of the aluminum cans from the background, which is less discernible but appears to be an open outdoor space.\n\nThe image likely serves to highlight issues of waste management, recycling, and the environmental impact of non-biodegradable materials. The overcast sky suggests an outdoor setting and provides a natural, soft light that evenly illuminates the scene. The focus and composition of the photograph draw attention to both the vast quantity of waste and the organized effort to reclaim and recycle materials.","title":"Dump outside aluminum recycling plant in Islamorada in the central Florida keys","placename":"Florida Keys (Fla.)","location":"Florida Keys, Florida","nn1":["548755","545136","556640","550880","547611","548753","557307","544831","554301","544640","557308","544830","546256","550265","556639","547971"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["can","aluminum","recycling","collection","waste","beverage","recycle","partition","quantity","flatten"]}
