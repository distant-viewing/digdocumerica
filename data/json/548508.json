{"path":"548508.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a sailing boat on a body of water, likely a lake or a bay, under clear skies. The boat is equipped with a large, triangular main sail that is billowing in the wind, visibly filled as it catches the breeze. There is a smaller foresail also hoisted near the bow of the boat. The boat appears to be a small to medium-sized recreational sailboat, painted predominantly white with a deeper blue stripe below the deck line. \n\nThree people are visible onboard; two sitting and one lying down along the port side of the boat. They are dressed casually in short-sleeve shirts and pants or shorts, appropriate for a relaxed day of sailing. The crew seems engaged either in navigating the boat or enjoying the leisurely outing.\n\nIn the background, other sailboats can be seen moored or sailing at some distance, and beyond them is a shoreline populated with trees and several buildings, suggesting this body of water is adjacent to a residential or urban area.\n\nThe water around the sailing boat has ripples and reflections from the sunlight, emphasizing a serene yet vibrant day on the water. The edges of the image are slightly darkened, focusing attention on the centrally positioned boat and its passengers.","title":"Chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549386","544667","547465","549403","544021","548513","552345","547781","549415","549411","549392","548521","547273","549394","549413","548203"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","sailing","sailboat","sail","hoist","crew","darken","breeze","bow","outing"]}
