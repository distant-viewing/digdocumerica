{"path":"551616.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This image appears to be a microscopic photograph of biological cells, possibly a histology section stained for cellular detail. The cells have various shades of purple and pink, which are common stain colors used in microscopy to enhance detail. The image shows cells that appear to be columnar in nature, suggesting this might be a section of an epithelial layer from a glandular organ or a similar structure.\n\nThe cells in the photo feature well-defined nuclei, some of which are darker and more prominently stained than others. This differential staining highlights the nuclei and other cellular components, helping in the study of cell structure and arrangement. There appears to be a layering or stratification in the layout of the cells, with some cells located on the periphery and others nestled more internally, suggesting a tightly packed structure possibly designed for secretion or absorption.\n\nThe background of the image is out of focus, enhancing the emphasis on the cells' detailed structure. The overall impression is that of a specialized tissue section, observed under high magnification for medical or biological analysis.","title":"Highly magnified portion of epithelium (gill covering) of healthy channel catfish.
