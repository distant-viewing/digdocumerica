{"path":"548523.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, outdoor scene at a wooden dock beside a body of water, presumably at a marina. In the image, three people are engaged in water-related activities.\n\n1. **Foreground**: A woman is seated on the edge of the dock. She has short dark hair and wears shorts and a dark tank top. She is focused on pulling a white rope or string that extends into the water. Her posture and expression indicate concentration on her task.\n\n2. **Middle ground**: To the right of the seated woman, a young boy and a young girl are standing on the dock. The boy, wearing a blue tank top and red shorts, holds a long fishing net and seems to be looking down into the water, perhaps watching what the woman is doing. The girl, who is partly visible and wearing a yellow shirt and brown shorts, is bending over the dock, also engaged in an activity involving the rope or string.\n\n3. **Background**: The background shows a tranquil maritime scene with various sailboats moored at floating docks. The water is calm, reflecting the boats and partially clouded sky.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is placid and leisurely, suggesting a warm, sunny day spent by the water. The clothing and hairstyles of the individuals hint at a casual outdoor setting, possibly from an earlier decade, judging by the vintage look of the image.","title":"Crabbing from a marina dock on chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["544260","543465","551283","544980","543164","554661","544209","547004","554198","546800","544266","550776","548537","553403","554517","543943"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["dock","string","short","rope","girl","boy","water","woman","tank","do"]}
