{"path":"557705.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph captures a busy street scene, likely from the 1970s or 1980s, judging from the style and model of the vehicles visible. The scene is set in a small town or village, illustrated by the modest scale of the architecture and the informal nature of activities on the street.\n\nThe road is filled with a variety of vehicles including classic cars in various colors, a white mail truck on the left, an RV, and a white van among others. The vehicles are in motion, suggesting this is a main thoroughfare. Painted lines on the road indicate that it is a dual lane street.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are small commercial buildings with visible signage. The signs include words like \"Brass Ball,\" \"Granny's Cupboard,\" and \"Fame's Follies\" along with signs promoting parking and indicating that they are open. The architecture of the buildings includes red sloping roofs and siding, typical of small commercial buildings from this period.\n\nPeople are visible throughout the scene. On the right, a group of people is standing or walking on the sidewalk, with an individual dressed in white and holding a child's hand. There are also pedestrians in the median of the road, crossing or preparing to cross. On the left, there's a man in a light-colored uniform, possibly a police officer or security, interacting with people and managing traffic or pedestrian flow.\n\nThe overall composition and busy nature of the scene, combined with the style of the buildings and vehicles, provide a nostalgic view of daily life in a small American town during this period. The scene is lively and offers a snapshot of the era's community and street dynamism.","title":"Traffic moves through the center of Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown on an average Saturday in July. No traffic light regulates the flow of traffic, and pedestrians and bike riders have to fend for themselves when the policeman normally on duty is in court. A state financed planning report for Helen recommended state construction of a bypass as an alternate tourist route to the north Georgia mountains.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554551","551324","557655","542586","552602","549872","545216","556709","550139","557805","551135","547369","555584","545614","556724","554297"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","road","vehicle","pedestrian","cross","period","town","median","dynamism","thoroughfare"]}
