{"path":"548734.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of a young person, likely a male, engaging in outdoor activities beside the sea. He is shirtless and has long, wet hair that suggests he might have been swimming or diving just before the snapshot was taken. The person is kneeling on a concrete surface, possibly a pier or jetty.\n\nHe seems focused on cleaning or preparing a fish, which he holds in his left hand while using a knife in his right hand. Around him on the concrete surface are several items related to fishing and diving: a spear (or speargun), a pair of black flippers, a red handled tool (possibly another knife), and other miscellaneous items linked to the activity such as fishing lures or small equipment. \n\nIn the backdrop, the sea spreads out, relatively calm with gentle waves, under a partly cloudy sky that fills the upper frame of the image. The overall atmosphere suggests a solitary, peaceful moment in nature, possibly on a warm day given the clear skies and the apparent swimwear of the person. The scene is vividly colored, enhancing the outdoor, rustic setting.","title":"Spear fisherman with catch at spanish harbor key.
