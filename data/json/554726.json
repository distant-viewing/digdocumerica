{"path":"554726.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures the vibrant autumn foliage of maple trees under a clear, deep blue sky. The trees are densely filled with leaves that range in color from bright red to deep crimson. The sunlight filtering through the leaves highlights their intricate shapes and vibrant colors, creating a warm, glowing effect. The composition primarily focuses upward towards the treetops, filling the frame with the richly colored leaves against the stark contrast of the blue sky. There is no visible ground or horizon line, only the upward view of these colorful branches, emphasizing the fullness and beauty of the autumn canopy.","title":"Red maple in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554725","554727","554736","554730","554735","558074","554636","554737","554711","554758","557127","554751","554738","554637","554641","550603"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["leave","autumn","treetop","canopy","red","range","shape","branch","effect","foliage"]}
