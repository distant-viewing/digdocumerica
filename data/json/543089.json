{"path":"543089.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a serene beach scene viewed from an elevated perspective, creating a somewhat bird's-eye view of the scene below. The dominant features are the sandy beach, with its uniquely dark color, contrasted against the blue of the ocean waves crashing onto the shoreline. The ocean is relatively calm with gentle waves lapping at the shore.\n\nSeveral long pieces of driftwood and logs are scattered randomly over the sand, brought in by the sea. People are present in the scene; a small group of four individuals can be seen standing close to one another near the center of the image. One of them appears to be holding up a camera or a similar device, possibly taking a photograph of the stunning scenery around them. Another individual is seen lying on the sand, suggesting a relaxed and leisurely atmosphere.\n\nAt the top left of the beach, more people are either walking along the shore or are engaged in other stationary activities. The area surrounding the beach is bordered by what looks to be a grassy verge leading to a steadier incline of land, indicating that the beach might be set somewhat below the surrounding landscape. \n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a tranquil beach setting that is a popular spot for visitors, embraced by natural beauty and a casual, relaxed vibe.","title":"Northern California--Bodega Bay","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif.)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["548757","543287","546982","543254","543069","543303","545162","547612","544989","543072","551554","545280","555402","547607","543244","542890"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","wave","lapp","shore","embrace","incline","bordere","crash","stationary"]}
