{"path":"548969.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view featuring a marina with numerous boats and yachts neatly moored in rows, surrounded by a dark water surface that contrasts with the bright and diverse colors of the boats. Each row that holds the boats is connected to a larger pier, extending from the bottom right of the image towards the upper left, in a vertically ascending diagonal pattern. The pier appears to be made of wooden planks and concrete, and in several places, it's equipped with additional smaller floating docks that extend perpendicularly from the main pier, providing individual spaces for each boat.\n\nThe boats vary in size and type, ranging from small motorboats to larger yachts. The central focus of the marina layout is an area around the middle of the pier where a large square platform with a structure possibly used for marina services or storage is present. The image is rich in detail, allowing for clear visibility of the boats’ features and the dock’s structure. The background and surroundings of the marina are exclusively water, emphasizing the isolation and organized layout of this mooring facility. The overall composition of the photograph uses a combination of man-made structures and natural elements, capturing a serene yet structured nautical scene.","title":"Colorado River boat dock near Hoover Dam","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["546853","557450","548075","552027","548639","542871","552028","548078","546388","542904","542912","546877","546935","548637","556191","542650"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["pier","boat","marina","yacht","layout","dock","mooring","row","motorboat","ascend"]}
