{"path":"554758.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene autumn landscape centered around a calm, reflective lake. The vibrant fall foliage is prominent, showcasing a range of colors from golden yellow to deep crimson, which densely cover the hills rolling up from the shores of the lake. The trees' colors are mirrored subtly in the lake's surface, enhancing the autumnal feel.\n\nIn the foreground, bright yellow leaves from a closer sapling frame the left side of the image, contrasting sharply with the more distant colors and adding depth to the scene. These leaves are sunlit, shining vividly against the darker backdrop.\n\nThe lake appears calm with a faint ripple, suggesting a gentle breeze. The sky above is partly cloudy, with both white and darker clouds, suggesting variability in the weather.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with the framing trees at the front and the expansive view of the lake leading up to richly colored hills, creates a tranquil and picturesque setting typical of a North American autumn landscape. The absence of any human activity or man-made structures gives the image a timeless, untouched quality.","title":"Fall scene at Bald Mountain Pond on Route #28 in New York looking south, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554757","554648","554649","554749","554750","554751","554737","554714","554761","554712","554635","554711","554756","554738","552599","554719"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["lake","autumn","variability","leave","breeze","hill","fall","absence","yellow","ripple"]}
