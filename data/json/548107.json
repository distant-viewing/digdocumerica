{"path":"548107.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial area located alongside a body of water. The scene is dominated by multiple columns of thick, white smoke billowing into the sky from various tall stacks across an extensive factory setting. In the foreground, on the water, there is a small sailing boat making a stark contrast with the industrial activity. Alongside the waterfront, there are large mounds of reddish-orange material, possibly minerals or industrial raw materials, stored in open piles. The sky is heavily clouded, possibly a mix of natural clouds and industrial emissions, creating a dramatic and somewhat moody atmosphere. The overall tonality of the image is slightly dark, accentuating the industrial vibe and environmental impact depicted. Overall, the scene highlights a bustling industrial landscape with significant pollution and activity.","title":"Weyerhaeuser paper mills and Reynolds metal plant are both located in Longview, on the Columbia River.
