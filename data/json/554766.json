{"path":"554766.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a rural mining or excavation site, showcasing exposed geological layers. In the forefront, there are multiple layers of earth visible, with various shades of brown and gray indicating different soil and rock types. At the top of these layers, there is a singular, bare tree standing out due to its isolation and the lack of other vegetation around it. The middle ground of the image includes a winding dirt road that cuts through the area, potentially used by mining trucks or heavy machinery. The background consists of a soft blue sky lightly clouded with wisps of white, adding a stark contrast to the earthy tones of the dug-out terrain. Beyond this, there are hints of a forest or wooded area visible on the horizon, suggesting the landscape's original state before mining commenced. The image captures both the raw, industrial aspect of land use and a hint of the natural environment surrounding the site.","title":"Following the meanderings of a coal seam, the Hanna Coal Company has altered the face of the land. Unless carefully recontoured, and unless topsoil is returned, this land will not support vegetation.
