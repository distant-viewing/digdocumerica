{"path":"550674.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene. It appears to be taken in late afternoon, given the soft light and subdued colors typical of that time of day. The foreground features a grassy area with several white-barked birch trees, imparting a vibrant, natural feel to the setting. Close to the shore, two overturned boats, possibly canoes or small rowboats, are visible, suggesting recent or intended water activities.\n\nIn the lake, a person is seen actively paddling a yellow kayak, which adds a touch of vivid color contrasting nicely against the predominantly darker hues of the water. The water itself is calm, indicating a peaceful setting without strong winds.\n\nThe background shows more dense forested areas and a softly rolling hill, further emphasizing the natural, untouched atmosphere of the location. The sky is overcast, with clouds filling the frame, which adds a muted, cool tone to the overall ambiance of the scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph depicts an idyllic moment in nature, focusing on outdoor activities and the beauty of a tranquil lakeside environment.","title":"Pontook Reservoir area of the Androscoggin River, between Lake Umbagog and Berlin","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["554609","550324","557562","544031","543579","551207","553440","550650","544266","545229","557571","550822","554474","554486","543618","550299"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["kayak","birch","rowboat","canoe","lakeside","white","wind","water","shore","touch"]}
