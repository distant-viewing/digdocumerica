{"path":"556540.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This historical photograph depicts a close-up portrait of a middle-aged man with a contemplative or serious expression. He has a pronounced, rugged face with visible signs of aging and stress, including wrinkles and a slightly sunken cheek. His hair is neatly combed back and dark with distinct touches of graying at the sides, suggesting maturity and possibly manual labor or outdoor work.\n\nThe man is wearing a sleeveless, striped tank top with a pattern that could be herringbone or chevron, which enables a slight sense of casualness mixed with practicality often associated with working-class attire of earlier decades. The backdrop is a dark blue or black, possibly a painted wooden wall or a similarly textured surface, which contrasts sharply with his lighter skin tone and the white pattern of his tank top.\n\nThe focus and framing are tightly set on his profile up to his chest, creating an intimate and direct engagement with the viewer. The lighting emphasizes his facial features and adds a layer of emotional depth to the portrait, highlighting his thoughtful or perhaps worried demeanor. The photograph not only captures a personal moment but also reflects a broader historical context, potentially evoking the life and cultural environment of a specific era.","title":"Closeup of Jerry Rainey, 34, miner at the Brookside Mine Company who was out on strike in the summer of 1974","placename":"Kentucky","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556563","557035","552872","556452","543701","546636","554846","542784","556443","548616","543713","553055","557648","552871","545417","552103"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["portrait","maturity","practicality","tank","cheek","stress","wrinkle","class","chest","aging"]}
