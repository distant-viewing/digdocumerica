{"path":"545048.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and expansive landscape scene under a cloud-laden sky. In the foreground, a patchwork of dark fields and clusters of trees stretches across the frame, suggesting a rural or agricultural area. Beyond this, the middle ground shows more dense vegetation, possibly a forest or large park area, that transitions into a developed landscape with visible structures and buildings, indicating the outskirts of an urban area.\n\nThe background is dominated by an impressive and slightly ominous view of two large columns of smoke rising vertically into the sky. These smoke plumes, which are thick and well-defined, appear to originate from two separate points on the ground, suggesting industrial activity, such as factories or power plants. This juxtaposition of natural and industrial elements adds a layer of complexity to the scene, highlighting human impact on the environment.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is somewhat somber, enhanced by the overcast conditions and the dark hues of the landscape. The composition effectively balances the serene rural foreground with the more dynamic and potentially disruptive activity in the distance, creating a thought-provoking visual narrative.","title":"Burning grass seed stubble in Willamette Valley","placename":"Salem (Or.)","location":"Salem, Oregon","nn1":["551061","545020","545009","547673","543668","545025","547542","547204","545975","543981","549191","547539","545013","545439","550983","545990"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["smoke","patchwork","outskirt","thought","complexity","column","plume","transition","narrative","factory"]}
