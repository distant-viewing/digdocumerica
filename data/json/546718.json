{"path":"546718.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph provides a birdâ€™s-eye view of a complex roadway system weaving through a lush green landscape. Multiple roads intersect and curve around each other, surrounded by dense groups of trees. There are various vehicles, mainly cars, visible on the roads, either moving or parked alongside the roads in designated areas.\n\nIn the foreground, a well-maintained park area includes winding footpaths and small bridges over a stream that cuts through the park. The waterway is bordered by protective barriers and the park is dotted with several light poles and patches of what appear to be recreational spaces. Visible near the bottom of the image is a part of an infrastructure that resembles either a bus stop or a small shelter alongside the road.\n\nThe overall scenery depicts a harmonious blend of transportation infrastructure with natural and recreational areas, indicating a possibly suburban or semi-urban area designed with considerable attention to green spaces and environmental integration. The color palette consists predominantly of various shades of green from the vegetation, grey from the roads and bridges, and blue from the distant landscape under a hazy sky, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light.","title":"Beltway and Route 70, looking northwest.
