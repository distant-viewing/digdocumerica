{"path":"557396.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial setting, likely inside a manufacturing plant or a large facility with complex machinery. The scene is shrouded in thick smoke, which creates a mystic and somewhat eerie atmosphere. The central feature is a large, tilted metal hopper or container dangling from what appears to be a lifting mechanism or conveyor system. The container is partly damaged and charred, suggesting that it might have been through some form of intense heat or fire incident.\n\nThis metal container is suspended in mid-air and is emitting heavy smoke, which could indicate recent use or a malfunction. Various industrial beams and structures surround the scene, and intense light sources punctuate the darkness below, likely from indoor lighting.\n\nThe background is barely visible due to the thick smoke and dark lighting conditions, emphasizing the industrial tone of the photograph. There are no visible people in the scene, which further focuses attention on the machinery and the industrial activity occurring. The overall composition conjures a sense of chaos and urgency, possibly hinting at an emergency situation or critical work process within an industrial setup.","title":"Open doors on furnace #6 while changing electrodes at the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant.  Air pressure blows dirt off the carbon to expose the bolts to change the electrodes.  \"fugitive smoke\" escapes through the roof.  Powerplant and metallurgical furnace emissions were reduced 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975 a compliance schedule was reached between the company and the West Virginia air pollution control commission.
