{"path":"545591.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a man engaging with a wooden signpost labeled \"SILVER STAIRS\" in a dramatic rocky desert landscape. The man, who appears to be a park ranger or a guide given his official-looking uniform consisting of khaki pants, a light-colored shirt, and a wide-brimmed hat, is actively hammering or fixing the sign post into the ground. His pose is dynamic, showing action as he bends forward towards the signpost.\n\nThe signpost itself is positioned in a rugged terrain surrounded by large reddish-brown rock formations, typical of a desert landscape with sparse vegetation visible in the background. The sky above is vividly blue, indicating clear, sunny weather conditions. This scenic backdrop, characterized by the distinctive geology and vastness, suggests the location might be in a protected area or a national park known for such natural rock formations.\n\nThe overall composition highlights the interaction between human activity and the natural environment, as indicated by the maintenance of trail or area signage in a remote setting. The focus on the man and the signpost at the foreground, against the expansive background, draws attention to the role of park services and the importance of wayfinding in such vast natural landscapes.","title":"Ranger at work in the needles area of Canyonlands National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545620","543379","545592","545762","545624","544902","544341","545746","552687","544740","544845","544903","545755","545759","549001","545697"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["signpost","desert","ranger","geology","formation","park","fix","rock","importance","brim"]}
