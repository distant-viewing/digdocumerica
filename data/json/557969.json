{"path":"557969.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and pastoral scene featuring a large, classic arched bridge that spans across the frame, characterized by several elegant and symmetric arches constructed from concrete. The bridge has a strong, architectural presence with its tall, sweeping curves which are indicative of early to mid-20th-century engineering.\n\nBelow the bridge, on the ground, you see two individuals walking along what appears to be a dusty trail or a bank next to a body of water which reflects part of the bridge. The individuals are dressed casually; one appears to wear orange-red clothing and the other in white and dark pants, seeming engaged in conversation.\n\nThe setting is lush and green, with an abundance of trees surrounding the area under a clear blue sky that suggests it's a bright, sunny day. This kind of environment suggests a quiet, possibly rural area where nature and human-made structures coexist harmoniously. The overall composition of the photograph, with its balance of human elements, architecture, and nature, creates a peaceful yet impressive visual narrative.","title":"Ohio highway 82 bridge spans the cuyahoga valley and the Ohio-erie canal beyond the walkers, near Cleveland, Ohio.
