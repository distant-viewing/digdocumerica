{"path":"554640.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a panoramic view of a mountainous landscape during what appears to be the fall season. The image captures a sweeping view of forests covered mainly in autumn colors with hues of red, orange, and yellow, interspersed with patches of evergreens. To the left side, near the bottom of the image, there is a body of water reflecting a bright shade of blue, along with a small cluster of buildings nestled amidst the trees, indicating a rural or wilderness community.\n\nIn the foreground, a significant element of the photo is a large sloping area of exposed rock that cuts through the forest, providing a contrast in texture and color to the surrounding foliage. This rocky area has sparse growth, showing the rugged terrain typical of mountainous regions.\n\nIn the background, the landscape stretches into the distance where several mountain ridges are visible under a hazy sky, suggesting vastness and a remote location. The overall composition of the image, with its natural beauty and remote settings, evokes a sense of solitude and the grand scale of nature.","title":"Balsam firs and yellow paper birch grow against rock slides with hardwood forest below on the south side and Blue Mountain Lake in the distance, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Blue Mountain Lake (N.Y.)","location":"Blue Mountain Lake, New York","nn1":["554653","554639","550478","554642","554761","552600","554638","550401","550599","556936","555130","555655","550441","554402","550596","550629"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["evergreen","forest","ridge","autumn","nestle","growth","orange","wilderness","vastness","season"]}
