{"path":"551058.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"In the photograph, we see a scene of a residential area; the focus is on two houses and their immediate surroundings. The first house, closer to the foreground and partially visible, is painted white and has horizontal siding with some noticeable wear, including peeled paint and visible seams. This house features at least one small, closed window, and there is lush vegetation growing around its base.\n\nThe second house, visible in the background, is also clad in horizontal siding, appearing gray or dark-colored, and has a window visible from this angle. Both houses have pitched roofs covered in shingles, adding to a typical residential look.\n\nProminently in the foreground of the image stands a well-constructed, brick-built, square well or cistern top covered with what appears to be a yellow tarp, possibly to protect it from debris and rain. A metal pipe or can protrudes from the center of this cover, indicating its functional use.\n\nThe lawn area around the well is overgrown, with various types of plants and weeds, suggesting that mowing or maintenance has been infrequent. Behind the houses and up the hill, dense trees and overgrown areas suggest a rural setting. The atmosphere is slightly overcast, and a mist or faint smoke lingers in the air, hinting at the possible presence of nearby industry or natural fog, softening the distant scenery and adding a moody tone to the image.\n\nLastly, the background includes what looks like an industrial facility, partly visible through the trees, with structures that suggest it might be a factory or similar setup, contributing to the sense of a working-class neighborhood in a semi-rural or rural-industrial hybrid area.","title":"These hillside homes in Montgomery Heights are directly across the Kanawha River from Union Carbide's ferroAlloy plant in background.","placename":"Charleston (W.
