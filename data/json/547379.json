{"path":"547379.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between two elderly women engaged in a conversation. The woman on the right is prominently featured in profile. She is wearing glasses and a light purple scarf tied around her head, which covers her hair. Her outfit consists of a black and white patterned jacket over a darker shirt.\n\nThe woman on the left is facing away from the camera, showing only the right side of her head. She has curly hair, set back probably with hairpins, and is wearing white, cat-eye style sunglasses. Her outfit includes a light-colored blouse with a distinctive geometric pattern, primarily in black and yellow.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred but a wooden structure, possibly a building or a large fence, is visible. There seems to be another person in the shadowed part of the background, but details are indistinct. The overall ambiance suggests an informal, possibly communal gathering during daylight, with natural light highlighting the subjects.","title":"Pausing to chat at outdoor auction near hickman","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547392","553484","556176","552962","551817","557177","557175","548482","551337","551436","557143","551334","553202","543036","555961","552624"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["outfin","woman","head","scarf","shadowed","hair","sunglass","profile","blouse","patterned"]}
