{"path":"544049.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting, specifically a steel mill or foundry, showing a row of large, cylindrical steel-making or metal-processing furnaces. The scene is dramatic and visually arresting, characterized by vibrant and intense colors. Glowing molten metal is visible in the foreground, with vivid orange hues and green smoke emitting from one of the furnaces, which contrasts starkly against the overall dark and atmospheric environment of the facility.\n\nThe furnaces, massive and lined up in a row, have intricate surfaces with metallic components that suggest heavy and robust machinery used for high-temperature metal processing. The environment appears smoky and possibly hot, given the visible emissions and rough industrial textures around the area.\n\nIn terms of human presence, there is a lone figure standing to the right side of the frame. This person, possibly a worker, is blurred and shadowed, but their presence adds a human element to the otherwise mechanical and harsh industrial scene. The worker's positioning and attire suggest involvement in the operation or monitoring of the furnaces.\n\nThe background is dimly lit but filled with industrial structures, including beams and additional plant equipment, further depicting the complexity and scale of this industrial operation. The overall composition communicates not only the intensity of industrial activities but also the challenging conditions within such working environments.","title":"Smelting machinery at the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["543996","557397","544000","544045","557399","544001","549694","557395","547060","549693","545532","544004","545536","557400","544041","542591"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["furnace","steel","worker","metal","making","row","temperature","operation","monitoring","involvement"]}
