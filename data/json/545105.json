{"path":"545105.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a rugged coastal landscape, capturing a series of winding dirt roads descending toward a rocky shoreline. The terrain is characterized by sharp inclines and declines, with dark earthen colors contrasted against the bright blue of the expansive sea in the background. A few vehicles are parked along the curves of the roadways, suggesting that this area might be a viewpoint or a recreational spot for visitors.\n\nThe vegetation varies from low-lying coastal scrubs to sporadic groupings of wildflowers that add pops of white and yellow to the scene. On the higher ground, the greenery is denser, including some larger bushes and what appear to be trees at the edge of the frame, suggesting the presence of a forested area nearby.\n\nTo the left, the hill slopes steeply, lined partially by a natural ridge, emphasizing the ruggedness and natural erosion of the landscape likely shaped by wind and water over time. The ocean is visible at multiple points along the horizon, meeting the sky in a hazy line that indicates either mist or distance.\n\nOverall, the scene is quiet and appears devoid of human activity beyond the parked cars, offering a glimpse into a serene, natural coastal environment ideal for exploratory drives or enjoying panoramic ocean views.","title":"Quarry on Newport Beach","placename":"Newport (Or.)","location":"Newport, Oregon","nn1":["553774","543424","554170","543435","545104","543184","545222","543300","543374","543431","543090","543297","545129","545125","557468","543433"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","drive","grouping","incline","scrub","pop","ruggedness","ideal","wildflower","ridge"]}
