{"path":"553985.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an abandoned and rusted tractor in a natural setting. The tractor appears quite old, characterized by its large metal wheels equipped with chains for traction, reflecting an era when such technology was more common. The body of the tractor is primarily metal, mostly discolored due to rust and exposure to the elements. Key features include a steering wheel that stands prominently against the backdrop, a seat that is somewhat tilted and likely weathered, and various metal components that are integral to the tractor's machinery, all shown in varying states of deterioration.\n\nThe tractor sits in a desolate field with dry, sparse grass and leafless trees in the background, suggesting it could be late autumn or winter. The background has a gloomy, barren look, enhancing the sense of abandonment of the tractor. The sky is not visible, but the lighting implies either an overcast day or a setting where natural light is fading, which adds to the melancholic ambiance of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition gives a strong sense of neglect and the passage of time, as nature slowly reclaims the space occupied by this once useful machine. The image evokes a nostalgic or contemplative feel, possibly reflecting on the passage of an industrial age or the impermanence of human endeavors.","title":"Remains of abandoned wagon rest beside road on the \"Pineapple Island.\" 95 per cent of Lanai is owned by Castle and Cooke (formerly Dole Pineapple).
