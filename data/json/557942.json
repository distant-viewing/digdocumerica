{"path":"557942.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph displays a serene and solemn scene in a cemetery. The image features several gravestones of varying shapes and sizes, distributed fairly evenly across a lush, grassy area. The gravestones, some of which appear aged and weather-worn, have different inscriptions and decorative elements, including motifs like hands in a praying position and flourished engravings.\n\nThe background of the photo reveals a natural landscape that includes a gently sloping hill, a few dispersed trees with lush green foliage, and an open sky that is partially obscured by the density of the trees. The light in the photograph suggests that it is either morning or late afternoon, providing a soft illumination that enhances the tranquility of the setting. The focus and depth of field isolate the foreground, where the gravestones are clearer, from the softer, less distinct background, emphasizing the quiet dignity of the cemetery.","title":"Ira cemetery near Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village contain the graves of families who settled there more than 150 years ago.
