{"path":"551071.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling street scene set against a mountainous backdrop. We can observe several components:\n\n1. **Vehicles**: The street is busy with a lineup of cars, indicative of an era by their designâ€”most likely from the 1960s or 1970s. These vehicles, including sedans and a few vans, are in motion, suggesting active traffic along the street.\n\n2. **Architecture and Businesses**: On the left side of the street, there is a row of two- and three-story brick buildings housing various businesses. Notable signs include \"RITE AID,\" \"Pharmacy,\" \"Auto Supply,\" \"Western Shop,\" and other partially visible signage that hint at a commercial area catering to daily needs and services. The architecture has a utilitarian, mid-20th-century American style.\n\n3. **Street Elements**: The street is lined with utility poles and overhead cables, typical of urban settings in this period. Streetlights are also visible alongside.\n\n4. **Mountain in the Background**: Dominating the background is a lush, green mountain with a distinctive, rocky peak. On top of this peak, there are visible structures, possibly residential or old institutional buildings, which add a point of interest and contrast sharply with the commercial nature of the foreground.\n\n5. **Overall Atmosphere**: The image has a somewhat nostalgic feel, capturing a slice of everyday life in an American town during the mid-20th century. The balance between nature and urban activity is well represented, with the busy street life starkly set against the serene and majestic mountain in the distance.\n\nThis photograph thus captures a specific moment and place, likely intending to document the character and dynamics of a typical American town of that era, characterized by its blend of natural beauty and bustling urban life.","title":"Dupont avenue in downtown west Belle","placename":"Charleston (W.
