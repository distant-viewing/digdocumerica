{"path":"550039.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene at either sunrise or sunset, where the warm hues of the sky meld into a gentle gradient. Several boats, varying from small motorboats to larger sailboats with their sails down, are anchored and scattered across the calm waters, which reflect a softened mirror of the sky’s purple and mauve tones.\n\nIn the background, a distant landmass is visible, possibly an island or a far shore, under a hazy sky that suggests early morning fog or dusk mist. A bridge, discernible by its silhouette of repeated arches and supporting columns, spans the far stretch of water, connecting one part of the land to another.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is tranquil and quiet, evoking a sense of peaceful isolation and the beauty of a day’s beginning or end by the water. The composition of the image, with its layering of sky, water, and land, along with the scattered arrangement of the boats, contributes to a feeling of vastness and the gentle passage of time.","title":"Boston Harbor - looking toward Squantum.
