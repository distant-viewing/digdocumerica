{"path":"543532.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and scenic lakeshore setting. The foreground features a gently curving beach with dark, grainy sand leading into the shallow edges of a vast lake. Notably, the water at the edge of the lake has formed translucent ice patterns that appear almost like foam, highlighting the cold nature of the scene.\n\nThe lake itself spans a large area, its serene surface reflecting the clear blue sky above. Along the left curve of the shoreline, a small boat rests partially on land, suggesting the presence of human activity, possibly for fishing or recreation. In the distance across the lake, a mountain range covered in snow can be seen under the bright sky, adding a majestic backdrop to the landscape.\n\nAt the distant right side of the beach, a black dog is barely noticeable, exploring the area. This suggests the area is used for leisure and walks by local residents or visitors. The overall composition and setting of the photograph evoke a sense of peacefulness and natural beauty, typical of a cold but sunny day in a mountainous lake region.","title":"Scum along lake shore","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543533","552978","543547","543531","547127","543618","550493","551207","543546","543536","543535","548034","552974","543518","543550","543816"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","beach","resident","ice","peacefulness","recreation","foam","dog","edge","visitor"]}
