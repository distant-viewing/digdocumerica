{"path":"556666.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts three people seated on a subway train. From left to right, the first individual is a woman with short, light brown hair, dressed in a black coat with a checkered scarf around her neck. She appears to be looking sideways with a somewhat pensive or fatigued expression. The second individual is another woman, older, wearing glasses and a dark-colored coat. She is focused on reading a newspaper, the headline of which reads \"Nixon After Toughest Broke and in Debt.\" The third person is a man dressed in a tan jacket and a white shirt, with a serious expression on his face as he looks slightly downward.\n\nThe subway car they are sitting in features graffiti on the wall next to the window, a common sight in many subway cars during certain periods. Above the passengers is an advertisement poster, partly visible, showing an image of a house. The overall muted lighting adds a somber tone to the scene, typical of underground subway environments. The image captures a moment that suggests a routine commute perhaps disrupted by personal thoughts and the daily news.","title":"Subway riders lost in their own thoughts and reading the newspaper on the Lexington Avenue line of the New York City Transit Authority. The system has 232 miles of track and is the longest in the world. Although the system provides transportation for four million rides a day (approximately 2 million commuters each way), voters have refused to authorize any more funds for improvements, or an increase of the present 35-cent fare to cover operating costs.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556665","548260","556691","554370","548273","556659","548261","556780","556813","556653","556669","556698","553823","554326","556811","548255"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["subway","coat","headline","commute","scarf","sight","graffiti","poster","newspaper","expression"]}
