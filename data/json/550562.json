{"path":"550562.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a majestic aerial view of a meandering river flowing through a lush landscape. The river dominates the scene, winding its way through valleys and between rolling hills. It displays a wide mix of colors, primarily a greyish blue tone, reflecting the sky above and also some areas with more sediment making parts of the water appear lighter.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is cloaked in varying shades of green, suggesting dense vegetation, likely a mix of forests and grasslands. The landscape is hilly, with ridges and valleys forming gentle undulating patterns.\n\nIn the background, a series of mountain ranges rise against the horizon, their peaks slightly obscured by mist or clouds, adding a sense of depth and vastness to the scene. The light appears to be that of either early morning or late afternoon, as the soft lighting creates gentle shadows and highlights the textures of both the water and the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition is both serene and dynamic, capturing the natural beauty and tranquility of this expansive wilderness area.","title":"View west along the Yukon toward Sight As Island (at nearest Bend in river) from a point up river from the pipeline crossing. The pipeline's suspension bridge will span the river from the lower left corner of the frame to the lower right. Pipeline will then proceed north.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550542","549456","550526","550581","550616","550627","550561","550680","550508","550531","550577","550487","550509","550524","550571","550625"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["valley","grassland","mix","river","sediment","ridge","way","mist","peak","wilderness"]}
