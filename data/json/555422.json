{"path":"555422.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and nostalgic street scene, centered around a large, colorful sign for a diner named \"Steakburger.\" The upper part of the sign features bold, red letters spelling \"Steakburger,\" with a bright yellow arrow pointing downwards. Just below, there is a marquee with the message “POWER SHORTAGE HAS US IN THE DARK” in black letters on a white background, suggesting a period of energy crisis.\n\nIn the foreground, parked directly under the sign, is a classic car, indicative of 1970s American automotive design. This car has a prominent front grille and rectangular headlights, painted in a light, muted color.\n\nBehind the car, the street extends into the distance, lined with various businesses and signs that provide a snapshot of a mid-20th-century American town. There are other cars visible, both parked and moving along the road, which adds to the bustling urban atmosphere.\n\nThe sky above is dramatic, with heavy, stormy clouds suggesting an impending or recent storm which could be linked to the power shortage mentioned on the sign.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a slice of American life from a past era, highlighted by distinctive vintage elements such as the car and the Steakburger diner sign, set against a backdrop of an everyday urban setting under an expressive sky.","title":"The energy crisis in the states of Oregon and Washington resulted in attempts at humor by businesses with darkened signs such as this one in vancouver, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["549113","555438","548889","545216","545618","550093","551494","554297","549014","549017","546183","545333","556709","547855","551495","555584"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["diner","sign","car","letter","crisis","shortage","arrow","grille","stormy","downward"]}
