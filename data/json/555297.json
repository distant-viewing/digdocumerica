{"path":"555297.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment of a man seated indoors with a contemplative expression directed to something outside the frame, his gaze intent and slightly furrowed. The setting appears to be a cluttered workspace or office area.\n\nThe subject is a Caucasian man with light brown hair, wearing a brown or olive jacket with grit and wear visible, suggesting it might have been used in a labor-intensive environment or for outdoor activities. His expression and attire project a sense of casual professionalism mixed with a blue-collar aesthetic.\n\nIn the environment around him, there are various papers, books, and what appears to be drafting or architectural tools spread out on a desk in disarray, suggesting the space is used for design, planning or creative projects. There's also a noticeable pile of items including a dark blue knitted garment and a mug, which add a personal touch to the workspace, indicating the space is regularly used.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph comes from a natural source, likely sunlight coming through a window out of frame, highlighting his face and the left side of the space, creating a warm, inviting atmosphere despite the clutter. The background is subdued with cool tones, dimly lit, focusing the attention on the man and the immediate surroundings.","title":"Steve Baer, founder and operator of Zomeworks, Inc., of Albuquerque, New Mexico, one of the pioneers in solar energy applications","placename":"Albuquerque (N.M.)","location":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","nn1":["552104","557892","557648","553088","553516","546636","551897","545986","557317","544326","543713","545974","542690","556443","557034","553517"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["workspace","project","come","intent","mug","professionalism","space","furrow","disarray","clutter"]}
