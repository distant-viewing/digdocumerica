{"path":"549578.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a mime artist performing in a public setting, likely during a parade or a street performance. The mime, a male figure, is prominently dressed in a traditional mime costume that includes a checkerboard pattern jacket in black, white, and red, and a black bowler hat. He has a painted white face with exaggerated facial features, including black eyebrows and a small black mustache, and red accents around his eyes and lips, enhancing his expressions. The mime's face is contorted into an emotional expression, possibly conveying sadness or despair, as he gestures upwards with one hand.\n\nIn the background, a crowd of spectators can be seen watching the performance. Various people of different ages are captured in mid-reaction; some are taking photos, while others are observing intently. The audience appears to be casually dressed, suggesting a daytime outdoor event in a relaxed, informal setting.\n\nThe scene is bathed in natural sunlight, highlighting the vivid colors of the mimeâ€™s costume and the lively atmosphere of the event. The focus is on the mime, making him the central figure of this lively public performance, with the blurred crowd serving to emphasize his performance and the interaction or distance between him and the audience.","title":"Actor Ernest Borgnine emcees the annual \"Old Milwaukee Days\" circus parade for the National Educational Television Network.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548571","549569","553200","553231","549582","553714","549575","553238","553268","553283","553267","553282","553210","553240","551019","548262"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["performance","costume","audience","crowd","artist","reaction","lip","event","figure","mustache"]}
