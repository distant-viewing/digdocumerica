{"path":"554052.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph represents a beautiful aerial view of a coastal landscape, showcasing a varied terrain and human influence on the environment. The foreground and middle of the image disclose vast fields, possibly agricultural, characterized by rich, dark soil and neatly arranged in long, curved rows that contour the geographic undulations of the land. These fields have different shades of brown and red, hinting at differing crop types or soil conditions.\n\nOn the left and middle part of the frame, there's a body of calm blue water, likely a bay, that intrudes slightly into the land, bordered by lighter blue shallow waters indicative of beaches or reefs. The coastline is rugged with textured cliffs visible in places where the waves meet the shore. \n\nFurther into the background, the landscape gradually transitions into more green, vegetated areas, showing some signs of residential or urban development near the waterfront, as evidenced by tiny structures or buildings and patches of organized greenery, possibly parks or gardens.\n\nToward the horizon, the landscape is dominated by a significant mountain which appears smooth, possibly volcanic, and it merges with a clear, bright blue sky punctuated by sparse clouds. The overall composition and natural light suggest this image could have been captured during late afternoon, given the gentle shadows cast over the fields and the warm sunlight accentuating the contours of the terrain.","title":"Aerial view of a tract of pineapple saved from urban development.
