{"path":"550706.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a large industrial area surrounded by a natural landscape. At the center of the image, there's a prominent industrial plant emitting a thick column of white smoke, which rises amidst the backdrop of lush green mountains that stretch across the horizon. The industrial area is located near a river that snakes through the terrain, bending around the plant and following through the valley. The river appears brownish, possibly indicating sediment or pollution.\n\nSurrounding the industrial plant are several smaller buildings, roads, and parking lots, suggesting this is an established industrial zone. Across the river from the plant, residential areas can be observed with neat rows of houses, streets, and patches of trees interspersed between them, creating a contrasting environment with the industrial setting.\n\nThe photograph captures a juxtaposition between industrial development and natural environment, emphasizing the impact of industrial activities on the nearby natural resources and residential areas. The overall composition highlights the interaction between human activity and the natural landscape, marked by the visible presence of the plant and its emissions against the green, mountainous region.","title":"Oxford Paper Company mill at Rumford on the Androscoggin River.
