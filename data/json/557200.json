{"path":"557200.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene winter scene. The main focus is a collection of grass and slender plants, heavily laden with ice and snow. Their delicate structures are accentuated by a thick coating of frost that sparkles under the sunlight. The lighting suggests that it is either early morning or late afternoon, giving the ice a luminous quality, almost like glass.\n\nIn the background, there is a hint of a wooded area with deciduous trees that appear dormant for the winter, their branches bare and also frosted with snow. The composition has an overcast sky, bluish in tone, which casts a cool hue over the entire landscape, enhancing the chill of the winter atmosphere.\n\nThere are no visible animals or people in this scene; it is a quiet, natural winter setting with an emphasis on the beauty of the frost and the stillness of the cold season. The image has a peaceful, almost ethereal quality to it, conveying the stark yet beautiful side of winter in a natural environment.","title":"Closeup of tall grass, big bluestem, covered with winter ice and snow at Lake Quivira, Kansas, near Kansas City.
