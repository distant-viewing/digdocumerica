{"path":"549650.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene from a subway station, capturing a moment of everyday city life. We see a red subway train stopped at the platform, with its doors open, ready for passengers to board or disembark. The train is marked with a number \"557\" and a text on its side that reads \"1. BEIWAGEN SCHÃ–NBRUNN,\" indicating it is part of a network (perhaps a specific line or route).\n\nInside the train, several passengers can be seen through the windows; they appear to be seated quietly, engaged in their own thoughts or activities, typical of a public transit setting. There's a mix of individuals, both young and old, dressed in casual outfits reflective of the era this photo was taken (seemingly a few decades past, judging by the style of clothes and interior of the train). \n\nOn the platform outside, the floor is dark, possibly tiled, and there's a partial view of the advertisement hanging above the train, promoting what seems to be a water heating system. The platform itself appears empty except for a lone individual caught mid-motion, possibly a train conductor or a passenger moving towards the open train doors.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph conveys a typical moment in public transportation, highlighted by the calm and mundane activity within the train juxtaposed against the relatively empty platform. The overall composition, with focus on the open door and the occupants inside the train, gives a glimpse into the quiet routines of city life and public transportation use.","title":"In an attempt to relieve the congestion of 350,000 autoMobiles in the old city of Vienna, trolley service has been improved and some of the lines placed underground.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551889","556665","556774","556669","548263","556660","554326","556780","556817","551883","556821","554370","548261","554324","556651","556691"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","platform","passenger","subway","door","transportation","conductor","heating","occupant","past"]}
