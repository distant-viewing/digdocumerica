{"path":"550159.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny, suburban neighborhood scene centered around the activity of garbage collection. In the foreground, two sanitation workers, dressed identically in caps and coats, are actively engaged in their task. One of the workers is seen lifting a metal trash can, tipping its contents into the back of a large garbage truck labeled with the text \"KEEP CLEAN\" and marked with a city seal, implying it is a municipally owned vehicle.\n\nThe truck, painted in a beige color, is parked by the curb of a tree-lined street, the open back showing piles of refuse already collected. Along the street, multiple trash cans are placed at intervals, ready for pick up.\n\nThe residential setting features well-manicured lawns and a sidewalk that stretches along the front of the houses. An abundance of mature, blooming trees adds a vibrant touch of spring to the scene. In the background, among the leafy boughs, a car is seen driving down the road, and a person on a motorcycle appears to be parked near the roadside.\n\nThe homes in the backdrop have a classic American architectural style with gabled roofs and prominent front porches, suggesting a quiet, middle-class neighborhood. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and orderly, with clear evidence of routine municipal services in operation.","title":"Curb-only pickup speeds work of sanitation crew.
