{"path":"549058.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a relaxed, outdoor setting featuring an older man sitting on a folding chair next to a classic red car with its trunk open. The man appears composed and casual, wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt, grey trousers, and boat shoes. His expression is thoughtful as he gazes slightly away from the camera, with a serene, open landscape stretching out in the background.\n\nThe scene is set on a dirt area beside a road, with a blue canal running parallel to the road, extending into the distance amidst flat agricultural fields under a clear sky. The environment suggests a rural or semi-rural setting, possibly in an area used for farming given the flat, cultivated land and the presence of the irrigation canal.\n\nThe manâ€™s personal belongings are casually spread around him; a cowboy hat rests on the ground along with a few scattered items, including a beverage can and what seems to be a paper bag. This setup, combined with his relaxed attire and serene demeanor, implies he is taking a break from driving, perhaps enjoying a quiet moment in a long journey.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the car, the man, and the long road beside the canal, creates a narrative of travel, rest, and contemplation in a rural American landscape. It captures a personal moment against the expansive backdrop of nature and infrastructure, reminiscent of a classic Americana scene.","title":"Fishing the Colorado River with no strain","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546092","552780","552087","548302","556547","546093","544349","544641","556292","557370","553090","557684","546176","554025","547141","548752"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["canal","road","rest","irrigation","man","belonging","fold","beverage","cowboy","journey"]}
