{"path":"547691.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The image captures an aerial view of the Twin Towers (World Trade Center) in New York City. It shows both towers from a high vantage point, possibly taken from another high-rise building or an aircraft.\n\nThe towers stand tall and close to one another, with their facades made up of closely-packed vertical elements, giving them a textured appearance. This pattern is prominent and is a defining characteristic of the buildings' architecture. The rooftops of the towers appear to be covered in snow, suggesting the photo was taken in winter.\n\nBetween the towers, there is a plaza visible, with circular and square patterns on the ground which crates a decorative geometric design. The river is visible in the background, adding to the urban setting of the image. The surrounding areas around the river appear slightly blurred but show signs of industrial and residential development. The general atmosphere is somewhat moody and grey, typical of overcast, snowy days in New York City.","title":"The \"twin towers\" of New York City's World Trade Center","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549302","555274","555275","548409","548387","549915","549918","550116","548319","555278","549301","549764","552395","549914","548408","555741"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["tower","crate","plaza","characteristic","rooftop","aircraft","river","define","pattern","vantage"]}
