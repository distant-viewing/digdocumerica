{"path":"544829.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a brightly lit, outdoor scene featuring a group of children and an elderly man engaging in what appears to be a learning or exploratory activity. The older man, to the left of the frame, is dressed in a light beige suit and cap, and he is bent slightly forward, observing or instructing a child in the foreground. This child, a boy wearing a golden yellow shirt with a name tag reading \"Mark Spitz\" is intensely focused on something in his hands which is not clearly visible in the image.\n\nJust behind the main subject, another boy in a hat adorned with various badges and patches watches closely, along with two other partially visible children. The child in the hat has a name tag with \"Karl\" on it. The background is predominantly a clear blue sky, indicating a fair weather day. Overall, the scene suggests an educational outing or event where children are learning from or interacting with an adult, possibly about nature or small objects that the boy is handling in his hands. This type of activity might be associated with scouting or a school field trip, emphasizing observation and learning in a hands-on environment.","title":"Colorado--Denver","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["543238","543178","545311","543181","553371","543176","543736","551677","546449","542563","544821","556437","553507","551766","543234","546271"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","learning","boy","tag","name","hand","instruct","learn","hat","school"]}
