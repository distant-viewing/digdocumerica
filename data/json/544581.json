{"path":"544581.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph presents a vibrant, expansive landscape dominated by a field of tall grasses and wildflowers exhibiting an unusual and striking purplish-red hue. The vast meadow stretches towards the horizon, underlining the flat, open nature of the terrain. The sky above is a rich, deep blue with splotches of white clouds, adding a dynamic contrast to the vivid colors of the field.\n\nThe foreground features dense vegetation, predominantly colored in shades of dark purple and red, possibly due to the lighting or a specific photographic filter used to emphasize these hues. No distinct paths or human-made structures interrupt the natural scene, suggesting a remote or undisturbed location. The middle ground transitions into a slightly lighter shade of purple and red vegetation, blending seamlessly with the horizon.\n\nThe lighting and color saturation give the image a surreal, almost other-worldly feel, enhancing the ethereal quality of the landscape. The overall mood is peaceful yet dramatic, with the natural elements dominating the scene without any visible signs of human interference.","title":"Sawgrass along the taMiami canal near the shark valley park entrance","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["557189","556990","552442","550489","549225","551370","557191","552903","557099","549156","549238","549157","552914","549232","550536","549229"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["interference","interrupt","meadow","field","saturation","hue","wildflower","underline","horizon","shade"]}
