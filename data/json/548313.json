{"path":"548313.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In this photograph, a man is engaging in gardening activities, specifically attending to a bush with bright pink flowers, likely azaleas. The man, wearing a brown jacket with a name badge and a dark hat, is using a long-handled tool, possibly a hoe, to cultivate or weed around the plant. His posture is bent forward slightly, focusing intently on his task.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor space with green grass, suggesting a private garden or a park. In the background, there are scattered trees with moderate foliage and what appears to be a white, metallic garden fence, beyond which there is a more densely wooded area. The setting conveys a peaceful, natural environment, typical of a well-maintained outdoor space.\n\nVisible in the background to the side is part of what looks like playground equipment, indicating that this area might be close to a public park or a residential area that accommodates families. The sky is bright and clear, suggesting a sunny day, which enhances the vividness of the green and pink hues in the foreground.","title":"This Montz homeowner is digging up plants before his property is taken over by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for construction of a new Mississippi River setback levee.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["548311","550760","557289","544240","549298","544236","557681","550063","546567","544295","550059","551702","551490","551704","546505","550055"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","park","playground","gardening","badge","vividness","space","family","name","tool"]}
