{"path":"546820.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking contrast between environmental pollution and architectural grace. It features a large accumulation of discarded objects, predominantly old, degraded tires, scattered haphazardly along a muddy shoreline. These tires vary in size and are caked with dirt, suggesting they have been there for a considerable time.\n\nIn the background, a large bridge spans over a calm body of water. It has multiple arches, each creating a neat reflection on the water's surface, which conveys a sense of order and stability in contrast to the chaotic, polluted foreground. The bridge is constructed with white concrete, and its upper deck supports what appears to be a roadway lined with lampposts, indicating it serves a significant transport function.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is somewhat serene due to the still water and clear sky, tinged with the soft, warm light of either early morning or late afternoon. This lighting adds a gentle quality to the image, enhancing the visual impact of the reflected arches, yet also highlighting the neglect shown to the natural environment at the forefront. The juxtaposition within this image powerfully comments on human impact on nature and the duality of progress.","title":"Yachts on Middle River, east of Baltimore","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["547897","546838","546913","545034","546785","547846","545988","547689","547844","547907","552098","552080","549820","549776","547831","548741"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["tire","arch","comment","bridge","lamppost","grace","stability","order","tinge","impact"]}
