{"path":"553660.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a river running through a rugged landscape, marked by its serpentine path and varied terrain. A dam is clearly visible, built across a narrower section of the river, creating a significant change in water levels on either side. The river above the dam appears calm and expansive, while below the dam, the river narrows and flows more rapidly through a canyon-like area with steep, barren hillsides.\n\nOn one side of the river, the terrain is a mix of grassy areas and patches of dense trees, indicating a somewhat lush environment possibly supported by the river's presence. There is a small structure visible near the riverside, which could be a utility building related to the dam's operations or local river management.\n\nBuilt across the river, the dam itself is composed of large blocks, possibly concrete, with a road running across the top, allowing for vehicular crossing from one side of the river to the other. This suggests that the dam also serves as a bridge.\n\nThe surrounding area is a stark contrast of greenery along the riverside and the more arid, rocky hills that rise steeply from the waterâ€™s edge. The human presence in this environment is minimal, focusing primarily on the infrastructure related to water management and transport.\n\nThis scene captures both natural beauty and human engineering, reflecting a landscape shaped by both geological features and the necessities of human use and habitation.","title":"Derby Dam on the Truckee River seen from the air.
