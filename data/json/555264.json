{"path":"555264.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a person wearing protective safety gear. The individual has on a bright yellow hard hat and a large, black gas mask that covers the entire face except for the eyes, which are visible through large, clear goggles. The gas mask is equipped with two prominent filters on the sides. The background is indistinct, but it gives the impression of being taken in a low-light, possibly industrial setting due to the choice of protective gear. The focus of the image is sharply on the face and mask, highlighting details like the straps of the mask and the reflective quality of the goggles.","title":"Closeup of the face mask worn by an inspector from the environmental protection agency as he checks pesticides at the port of Newark, New Jersey.
