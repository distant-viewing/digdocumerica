{"path":"554975.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a dense forest scene filled with lush vegetation and tall trees. In the foreground, a large tree trunk covered with moss is prominently visible, displaying a textured bark that speaks of the humidity and richness of the woodland environment. The trunk angles slightly, leading the viewer's eye deeper into the scene.\n\nSurrounding the tree, the forest floor is carpeted with various forms of underbrush, including numerous small, leafy plants and ferns, indicating a healthy, moist ecosystem. The colors are richly green, suggesting either a recent rain or a consistently wet climate.\n\nBeyond the immediate vicinity, the forest becomes a network of similar trees, some standing straight and others slightly bent, all covered to some extent in moss or other epiphytes. The trees are tightly packed, showing only small glimpses of the area beyond, shrouded in a natural green dimness created by the canopy above.\n\nThere is no visible sky, only the close, intertwined branches and leaves that filter the light, casting soft, diffuse illumination throughout the scene. There are no human figures or man-made objects visible; the entire frame is consumed by the natural environment, offering a sense of seclusion and untouched wilderness.","title":"Old growth coastal sitka spruce forest with typical dense ground cover and underbrush of bead ruby, salal, huckleberry western sword/fern and elderberry in Olympic National Park Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555000","555057","554961","554958","555054","554972","545271","555058","555043","545285","554976","554999","554992","542958","545488","546947"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","forest","trunk","humidity","consume","underbrush","richness","tree","extent","fern"]}
