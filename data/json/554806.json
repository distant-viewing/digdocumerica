{"path":"554806.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene featuring a large farm situated in a valley. The primary focus is on a substantial, weathered barn in the center, surrounded by various other farm buildings including smaller outbuildings and possibly a residential home. In front of the barn, several items associated with farm life, such as a red tractor and other agricultural equipment, are visible.\n\nThe background showcases a stark, expansive hillside that appears to have been subjected to significant excavation or mining, as evidenced by the exposed layers of earth and minimal vegetation. This scraped landscape contrasts sharply with the more verdant and organized farm area.\n\nThe foreground includes bare trees, indicating that the season could be either late fall or early spring when trees have not yet fully leafed out. There is no snow on the ground, supporting the likelihood of one of these transition seasons.\n\nOverall, the composition of the shot is framed to highlight the juxtaposition between the cultivated farm life and the rugged, altered terrain of the hillside in the distance, suggesting themes of resilience and adaptability in a changing environment.","title":"This farm, surrounded by hanna coal company stripping, is still in operation, off route 100","placename":"Ohio","location":"Ohio","nn1":["547304","547307","550019","551333","552462","555571","555577","554782","556963","547291","547321","547426","552537","547447","547305","547303"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["farm","barn","hillside","season","outbuilding","alte","cultivate","tractor","leaf","resilience"]}
