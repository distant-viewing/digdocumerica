{"path":"547012.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph is framed by the dark silhouette of a doorway, creating a natural border around the scene observed. The setting is outdoors, likely in a boatyard or similar maintenance area, illuminated by natural daylight.\n\nCentral to the composition is a large boat named \"MOON\" mounted on a trailer, which suggests readiness for transport or recent retrieval from water. Its hull is prominently red and white, and stands out against the more subdued colors of the surroundings.\n\nSeveral people are engaged in various activities around the boatyard. To the right, a group is gathered, possibly involved in either repairing or inspecting something on the ground which is not clearly visible; their postures suggest focused attention and collaborative effort. One individual, standing on the left side of the frame, seems to be looking towards the group, possibly overseeing or ready to assist.\n\nAccompanying these human elements are everyday objects that hint at the nature of the workspace: rusted barrels, tools, and other equipment scattered around the area. The setting is rustic and utilitarian, characterized by dirt and patches of grass, typical of a working yard.\n\nThe overall feel of the photograph is candid and unposed, capturing a moment of everyday labor and interaction within a specific community setting.","title":"At the black-owned shrimp cooperative on hilton head island","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["546802","543409","547557","551228","543035","547564","546939","547941","544993","547559","544260","545932","554200","547033","547955","552806"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["readiness","involved","barrel","group","trailer","workspace","repair","assist","doorway","inspect"]}
