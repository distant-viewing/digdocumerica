{"path":"549471.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment between two individuals seated on a rugged shoreline, gazing out at a body of water. The setting appears to be a natural coastal scene, identifiable through the texture and shapes of the rocky foreground. The two people are positioned at the right edge of the frame, sitting on the uneven, mossy rocks, which are a dark gray color interspersed with patches of greenery.\n\nIn the background, there is a lively expanse of water, potentially a river or the sea, characterized by white frothy waves indicating strong currents or possibly rapids. The body of water extends towards the horizon, suggesting a vast and possibly remote location.\n\nAbove the seated figures, the upper portion of the photograph is framed by overhanging branches from an unseen tree. These branches, filled with dense, green leaves, partially obscure the sky and cast shadows, adding a sense of enclosure and intimacy to the setting.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is tranquil and contemplative, emphasized by the natural surroundings and the distant, powerful water suggesting a moment of connection with nature. The color palette is predominantly cool, with the blues and grays of the water and rocks complemented by the green of the foliage, creating a harmonious natural scene.","title":"Couple enjoy view of Niagara River rapids from the shore of Goat Island, which separates the American and the Canadian Falls at the brink of the cataract.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["543203","548833","543139","543505","554002","550826","547595","543601","554901","551967","553396","543950","551942","543951","549716","549552"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["mossy","rapid","branch","water","intimacy","enclosure","rock","current","connection","gray"]}
