{"path":"542735.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic vista that embodies natural beauty and serenity, likely within a mountainous national park setting. In the foreground, a winding asphalt road closely follows the course of a turbulent, white-washed river. The river, bustling with rapid waters, flows from the right to the left side of the frame, lined by rugged rocky banks that emphasize the wild nature of the landscape.\n\nOn the right side of the road, two individuals can be seen walking, small in scale compared to the grandeur of their surroundings. They appear to be engaged in a leisurely activity, perhaps hiking or simply enjoying a walk in this picturesque environment.\n\nThe middle ground prominently features a steep, tree-lined cliff that rises directly from the river, leading the eye towards the dramatic background. Dominating the background are towering mountain peaks, which sharply punctuate the skyline. The highest peak stands majestically, its sharp point looming over the valley. The mountains, cloaked in dense forests at lower elevations and rocky surfaces near the peaks, serve as a majestic backdrop, suggesting a sense of tranquility and the grand scale of nature.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph, with shadows cast across the road and highlighted surfaces of the river and mountain peaks, suggests it was taken on a clear day, under bright sunlight that enhances the vivid textures and colors of the natural landscape. The overall composition of the photograph, with its blend of dynamic water, serene road, lush vegetation, and imposing mountains, offers a snapshot that is both dramatic and peaceful, inviting viewers to contemplate the beauty and power of nature.","title":"Bicycling on road to Mineral King","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["555665","553785","550518","550497","543739","550526","542696","550680","550487","550634","550441","548010","550509","550592","555670","543716"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["peak","mountain","river","road","walk","vista","course","scale","asphalt","serenity"]}
