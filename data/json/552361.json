{"path":"552361.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a unique outdoor scene where several people are engaged with large, translucent tetrahedral kites. These geometric kites dominate the foreground and exhibit an intricate structure made of thin, shiny metal rods and clear plastic or cellophane surfaces, giving them a shimmering, lightweight appearance. \n\nThere are three individuals prominently visible in the image, presumably involved in assembling or preparing to fly these kites. The person closest to the viewer is a man wearing a short-sleeved, green shirt, khaki pants, and sunglasses, holding one of the tetrahedral kites. Behind him, the environment is semi-industrial with bear dirt and patches of grass. Further in the background, two other men, both in light-colored shirts and dark pants, are handling similar kites near a vintage sedan parked on a patch of dirt next to the activity area. \n\nThe setting suggests a spacious outdoor area, perhaps an open field or a construction site, with some industrial materials like wooden planks visible on the ground. The overall atmosphere appears casual with a focus on leisure or experimental activity related to the unique kites.","title":"Los angeles reactive pollutant program (larpp), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552362","553252","547120","544851","544839","551733","553294","557719","552359","551677","553266","557799","557718","553254","557798","544843"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dirt","assemble","khaki","pant","fly","rod","bear","plastic","plank","sedan"]}
