{"path":"543332.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts three women enjoying the outdoors on a rocky terrain surrounded by vibrant purple flowers. The scene seems to be set in a rugged, natural landscape possibly during spring given the abundance of blooms. The woman on the left side of the image is sitting with her back towards the camera, wearing a vivid blue long-sleeve top and her blonde hair is loose. The other two women are sitting behind her, one dressed in a bohemian-style poncho, adorned with multiple colors and patterns, smiling cheerfully towards the camera with sunglasses on. The other woman, who is partly obscured by the first two, is also smiling and appears to be wearing a dark jacket or top. The surrounding area is lush with dense patches of small purple flowers covering the cliff sides, suggesting a serene yet vibrant setting perfect for a leisurely outing or hiking.\n","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["553359","543316","553364","545721","543467","558096","543373","543319","545768","545710","545300","545785","543234","553755","545776","543199"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["woman","smile","flower","abundance","sit","hiking","camera","outing","bloom","outdoor"]}
