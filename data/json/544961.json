{"path":"544961.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In this photograph, a young man is engaging in an activity on a floating platform over a body of water, which appears to be part of an aquaculture or marine research facility. He is squatting over what looks like an enclosed mesh or net pen that is submerged in the water within the wooden frame of the platform. His attention is focused on using a small, circular net attached to a pole, possibly to catch or handle fish or other marine organisms within the enclosure.\n\nThe man wears a long-sleeve light gray shirt, checked shorts, and sandals. Sunlight illuminates the scene, suggesting it is a bright day. In the background, the calm water extends to a lightly forested shoreline, hinting at a remote or tranquil location. The platform is constructed with wooden planks and various sections are visible, implying a larger structure, likely used for similar activities related to marine or aquatic research and cultivation. There are no other people visible in this shot, emphasizing a serene and focused setting for the task at hand.","title":"Alan Musone, Quinault Indian, at work at a steelhead rearing pond on Lake Quinault","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553953","550047","545206","555602","553650","545940","545211","549595","552290","546334","545386","546360","553657","546307","545080","546301"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["platform","research","aquaculture","organism","sandal","enclosure","mesh","cultivation","pen","net"]}
