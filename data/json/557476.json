{"path":"557476.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases a rural scene with a distinct contrast between agriculture and urban development. At the forefront of the image, the central focus is on a large agricultural field that appears to be freshly plowed. The ground is covered with patterned rows indicative of recent tilling, and the soil's rich brown color suggests fertile land. A single individual, presumably a farmer, is operating an old red tractor. The tractor, modest in size and slightly aged, is equipped with what appears to be plowing machinery, actively engaged in cultivating the field.\n\nBehind the agricultural activity, there is a stark transition to a suburban environment. A line of single-story houses marks the boundary between the farmland and the residential area. These homes have uniform designs with reddish-brown tiled roofs, beige or light-colored walls, and neatly arranged in straight rows, typical of suburban developments. The area also features well-maintained green lawns and a few visible streets in between the homes.\n\nThe scene likely captures the juxtaposition of rural and urban lifestyles, highlighting the proximity and perhaps the encroaching nature of urban expansion onto agricultural lands. The overall composition underscores the contrasting dynamics of life and land use, inviting reflection on land management, urbanization, and agricultural preservation.","title":"One of a few remaining farm fields near the ocean in fast growing orange county.  Some 4 percent of the state residents live within 30 miles of the coast and it has resulted in increasing land use pressures.  Since november, 1972, regulatory commissions have been charged with determining development within 1,000 yards of the coast.  The commissions must submit a report to the legislature by january, 1976, recommending a plan for future coastal development","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["544323","547304","544888","558414","547297","548902","548898","548820","544552","551333","552577","554015","553698","548296","554202","548950"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["plow","tractor","land","urbanization","farmer","encroach","development","lands","roofs","row"]}
