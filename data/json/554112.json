{"path":"554112.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph beautifully captures a close-up image of a vibrant pink orchid, possibly from the Vanda genus, known for its symmetrically shaped and brightly colored flowers. The orchid features soft, pink petals transitioning to a darker pink center, with accents of lighter pink veins adding texture and depth to the image.\n\nA bee, capturing pollen or nectar, is centrally located inside one of the large, funnel-shaped blooms. This enhances the image's focal point, illustrating the interaction between flora and fauna. The bee's presence highlights the natural environment in which these orchids thrive and their role in the ecosystem.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly blurred, predominantly in greenish hues, suggesting a natural setting with subdued lighting, possibly under the canopy of larger plants or in a shaded garden area. This composition focuses the viewerâ€™s attention mainly on the orchid and the bee, utilizing a shallow depth of field to isolate the subjects from the surrounding environment, thus enhancing the stunning natural colors and the delicate details of the flower.","title":"The Hilo area of Hawaii is known as the orchid capital of the world.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554581","553366","554586","553369","554595","543200","543597","554580","543623","557545","550464","553365","554843","551380","544578","542970"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["fauna","flower","funnel","vein","petal","accent","bloom","flora","depth","garden"]}
