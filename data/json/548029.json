{"path":"548029.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph features two men, closely positioned in front of the camera and looking directly into the lens. Both men are dressed in cold-weather attire. The man on the left wears yellow-tinted goggles and a black-and-white checked jacket with a visible patch, suggesting a uniform or team outfit. He also has a black beanie under his goggles and seems to be wearing suspenders over a light-colored shirt. The man on the right also sports yellow-tinted goggles and a similar black-and-white checkered pom-pom beanie. He wears a blue jacket atop a shirt, visible near his neck.\n\nThese men appear to be engaged in a winter outdoor activity, as indicated by their clothing and the snowy backdrop consisting of dense, snow-covered trees. Between them, a metal frame, possibly part of a sled or outdoor equipment, is visible. The environment suggests a cold, wintry setting, possibly during a sporting or research event.\n\nTheir expressions are serious, and they seem to be focused on something off-camera or possibly interacting with the photographer, which adds an intimate, candid quality to the capture. The close-up framing emphasizes their faces and attire, reflecting a purposeful outing or adventure in the snow.","title":"Members of the Crag Rats Climbing Club make winter snow surveys for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service at Tilly Jane Camp Ground on Mt.
