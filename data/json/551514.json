The person to the left, who appears to be a woman wearing a sleeveless plaid dress, is positioned with her body turned slightly towards the other individual, engaging in a face-to-face conversation. The person to the right, who appears to be a man, is dressed in a light-colored long sleeve shirt, jeans, and boots. He is sitting with his legs crossed and seems to be listening intently.\n\nThe setting is outdoors on a sunny day, with sunlight filtering through the trees and casting shadows and highlights around the scene. The background is filled with lush greenery and the calm, reflective surface of the water, characteristic of a secluded, peaceful natural environment. The overall mood of the image suggests a relaxed and intimate moment shared between two people in a serene setting.","title":"A quiet place on the Mississippi River at the north end of Nicollet Island in downtown Minneapolis.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["554494","554900","551859","546077","543505","549471","551462","553396","548833","553244","551450","547595","551271","554901","551942","549756"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["face","person","highlight","boot","plaid","leg","trunk","dress","individual","body"]}
