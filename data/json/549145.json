{"path":"549145.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a single frog perched subtly amidst a natural environment, likely a pond or wetland. The frog, showcasing mottled green and brown skin with distinctive black markings, is situated slightly off-center and blends into its surroundings. Its eyes, with a hint of metallic sheen, appear alert and watching.\n\nThe foreground of the image is dominated by dark, entangled plant matter, possibly dead leaves or twigs that have fallen into the water. These elements add a textured, dense quality to the scene, promoting a sense of natural clutter and the decaying cycle in a wetland ecosystem.\n\nReflections and small specks of light shimmer on the surface of the water, suggesting either the presence of small insects or simply the play of light on the water. The subdued lighting adds a hint of mystery and focuses the viewerâ€™s attention on the frog and its immediate surroundings.\n\nThe background is dark and obscure, enhancing the spotlight on the frog and the immediate vicinity it occupies. This composition effectively portrays the frog in its natural habitat, emphasizing adaptation and camouflage in the wild.","title":"Frog in marshy stream near sarpy basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["551362","555066","544280","551363","557606","557587","555197","555067","554602","550727","546161","542554","551367","551366","542582","547509"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["entangle","mottle","spotlight","camouflage","matter","adaptation","cycle","alert","wild","twig"]}
