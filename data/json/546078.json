{"path":"546078.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts the facade of a colorful and heavily adorned furniture store, named Atlas Furniture. The building is decorated with multiple signs and banners, proclaiming specials and sales on various furniture and home appliances. Each advertising sign lists different products along with their prices, such as \"New Air Conditioners $89,\" \"Stereo's [sic] $89,\" and \"Refrigerators SAVE $169.95.\" The signage includes exaggerated promotional phrases like \"Buy Here is SAVE A lot free.\"\n\nThe upper part of the facade features a series of hanging multi-colored triangular flags, adding a festive yet cluttered feel to the aesthetic. Visible text on a canopy above the central store entrance declares \"THIS IS THE OFFICE\" and a hand-written sign with a phone number instructs customers to call if they need assistance.\n\nThe store's appearance is quite eclectic and visually busy, with handwritten, painted, and printed text competing for attention against a backdrop of wooden slats and worn, painted surfaces. There are no visible people in the image; instead, the focus is solely on the commercial messaging and vibrant, somewhat chaotic storefront decoration. The overall impression is that of a local business employing aggressive, direct marketing tactics to attract customers from a variety of economic backgrounds, emphasizing deals and credit availability (\"Put Your CREDIT APPLICATION HERE\").","title":"Small retail businesses on St. Claude Avenue","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546034","547655","554185","554184","550132","543099","553120","558281","547021","556207","551495","558127","549871","545411","551323","546672"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["store","customer","furniture","text","refrigerator","application","instruct","facade","availability","employ"]}
