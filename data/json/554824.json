{"path":"554824.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a somber and evocative scene at a hilltop cemetery during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, judged by the subdued lighting and color tones. A large, leafless tree stands prominently on the left side of the image, its bare branches silhouetted against the overcast sky. The foreground shows a collection of gravestones, some of which are tilted or fallen, indicating neglect or the passage of time. The ground is covered in grass and fallen leaves, typical of a late autumn setting.\n\nIn the middle ground, a simple wooden fence partially encloses the cemetery, with additional gravestones visible inside the boundary. Beyond the cemetery, the landscape opens into a rolling panorama of hills, revealing areas of barren land mixed with patches of vegetation. There appear to be small roads or paths winding through the hills, and a few structures can be seen in the distance, perhaps farmhouses or other rural buildings.\n\nThe color palette of the photograph is dominated by muted browns, greens, and greys, contributing to a melancholic and reflective mood. The composition, with its contrasting elements of the stark tree and the weathered gravestones against the expansive, open landscape, conveys themes of memory, time, and perhaps isolation or abandonment. The image captures a quiet, contemplative atmosphere, inviting the viewer to reflect on history and the natural progression of life and decay.","title":"View of strip mined land and tipple from a graveyard off route 100, near Morristown, Ohio, and Steubenville","placename":"Morristown (Belmont County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["554790","557184","557185","552487","554792","558040","550731","557089","547420","552451","545322","552683","546098","557942","552017","547337"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["gravestone","cemetery","fall","panorama","memory","farmhouse","pat","subdued","tilt","hill"]}
