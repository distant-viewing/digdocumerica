{"path":"552212.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features an industrial setting, captured in a somewhat somber light, likely near evening. The image is prominently anchored by a \"NO TRESPASSING KEEP OUT\" sign that is situated on a wooden post on the left side of the frame, slightly tilted. Behind the sign, a rugged and barren foreground stretches towards a body of still water reflecting the cloudy sky above and elements of the scene.\n\nIn the background, an industrial landscape dominates, characterized by large buildings that include a prominent factory or plant emitting smoke from a tall stack, adding to the slightly bleak atmosphere of the scene. Various other industrial structures and some silhouetted piping are visible, as well as what appears to be a bridge farther back. The overall feel of the photograph is one of restriction and isolation, emphasized by the strong message on the sign and the desolate environment around the industrial zone. The lighting and cloud cover contribute to the overall moody and slightly ominous tone.","title":"Dry waste water treatment lagoon at site of pulp waste water treatment lagoons of the weyerhaeuser and scott mills","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552211","557412","548316","549965","557220","546080","545447","542999","557381","546118","546084","557375","552037","552014","547014","551033"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["trespassing","restriction","sign","piping","anchor","tilt","message","keep","post","zone"]}
