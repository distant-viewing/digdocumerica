{"path":"552245.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph provides an aerial view of an industrial area by the coastline. The prominent features include a cluster of large, circular storage tanks situated near the upper left of the photo, possibly for oil or chemicals, surrounded by roads that curve around them. Below these tanks, a large industrial facility can be seen, characterized by several long, rectangular buildings aligned parallel to each other. These structures are likely warehouses or production facilities.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a substantial pier or jetty protruding into the body of water, with a small structure at its end. Adjacent to this pier, a series of long and thin buildings are arranged in a grid-like pattern, close to the waterâ€™s edge, which could be part of a fish processing plant or similar maritime-related industry.\n\nThe surrounding area is diverse - with areas of dense forestation near the top, and a more developed area with parked vehicles and smaller buildings at the bottom. The coastline is irregular, with sandy beaches visible in parts, and the water appears calm. The overall setting suggests a mix of industrial activity closely integrated with the natural landscape, potentially indicating economic uses linked to the maritime location. The photograph's high vantage point and sharp angles give a clear, structured view of the spatial layout of both the industrial operations and the natural topography.","title":"Oil tank farm and yacht basin at edmonds, on puget sound","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552131","551574","551607","550886","557464","551606","549978","556912","549522","552181","552835","555786","551612","552009","551203","549495"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["pier","coastline","forestation","warehous","tanks","jetty","angles","protrud","facility","chemical"]}
