{"path":"558399.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Haque, Abul","caption":"This photograph captures a compelling scene of a church steeple against a clear sky. At the top of the steeple, there is a cross and just below it, a man can be seen working or conducting maintenance; he appears to be standing on a ledge or platform. He is positioned quite high, suggesting a potentially risky or careful operation. The steeple itself features a pointed, Gothic-style architectural design with a dark-colored shingle surface and light trim. Several smaller architectural elements such as louvers are visible on the sides of the steeple, likely for ventilation. The clear blue sky in the background helps to highlight the height and isolated position of the worker in relation to the ground, emphasizing the verticality and elegance of the steeple structure. This setting evokes a sense of serenity but also a hint of danger due to the height at which the man is working.","title":"Religion plays an important part in the lives of residents. The second largest denomination of churchgoers are Lutherans. The largest Lutheran church in town is St. Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church, whose church steeple is seen in this photo. The structure is located in the center of town. New Ulm is a county seat trading center of 13,000 founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["546459","546466","545873","546451","558019","546048","554700","554207","558163","555296","558034","557093","547346","546455","557088","547332"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["steeple","height","relation","verticality","danger","ventilation","elegance","ledge","shingle","conduct"]}
