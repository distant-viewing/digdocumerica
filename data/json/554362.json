{"path":"554362.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a bouquet of flowers placed on the dashboard of a vehicle. The bouquet predominantly includes vibrant dual-toned carnations, with colors transitioning from yellow at the base to a deep pink near the tips of the petals. The flowers are tied together with a light-colored string or ribbon, adding a delicate touch to their arrangement.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but indicates that the car is likely parked, as suggested by the visible dashboard and part of the steering wheel, which is covered with a textured, black material, probably a steering wheel cover. Through the windscreen, one might discern a vague, overcast outdoor setting, contributing to the atmospheric feel of the image.\n\nThe composition utilizes a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the flowers and making the dashboard's texture and the vague shapes in the background merge into a bokeh effect. This focus pulls the viewer's attention directly to the vivid colors and textures of the flowers and emphasizes a sense of intimacy and quietude within the confines of the car's interior.","title":"Paper posy brightens inside of photographer's VW \"Beetle\"","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543597","548971","553737","557618","554843","542970","543596","545726","543623","557167","554574","542969","553366","545335","545880","554595"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["dashboard","flower","steering","wheel","confine","string","ribbon","intimacy","tip","quietude"]}
