{"path":"555564.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial scene with several prominent elements. In the foreground, multiple railway tracks are filled with rows of open-topped freight cars, distinctly marked by their visible content and identifying initials like \"PRR.\" The railcars and tracks are positioned horizontally across the image, leading the viewer's eye deeper into the scene.\n\nTowards the center and slightly to the left, there is a large industrial building with a unique architectural design, featuring a large diagonal conveyor structure that extends above part of the building, likely used for loading materials into or out of the building. This building is emitting a thick plume of dark smoke into the air, suggesting some type of heavy industrial activity, possibly related to materials processing or energy production.\n\nThe background features a calm body of water, possibly a river, and lush greenery on the far shore, contrasting with the industrial activity in the foreground. The sky is clear and blue, indicating a bright, sunny day. \n\nThis combination of elements—the industrial setting, railway infrastructure, and natural background—suggests a scene focused on heavy industry located near a water source, which is typical for facilitating the transport of goods and raw materials.","title":"Processing plant of the Hanna Coal Company at Cadiz","placename":"Steubenville (Ohio)","location":"Steubenville, Ohio","nn1":["545503","556382","549968","549508","554632","551177","545889","555776","547999","547014","550974","556852","547528","545434","557223","551201"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["railway","material","railcar","track","freight","conveyor","building","identify","facilitate","production"]}
