{"path":"553362.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph shows a road scene prominently featuring a weathered road sign for the Nashua River. The sign is rectangular with a white background and bold, black text saying \"NASHUA RIVER.\" It also includes the logo of what appears to be a highway department in the upper left corner, marked with the letters \"NH\" inside a shield shape with a peak.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left side of the image, is a large rectangular roadside warning sign or barrier painted in yellow and black diagonal stripes.\n\nBeyond the sign, along the road, a row of people can be seen walking along the sidewalk parallel to a guardrail, near the edge of a bridge. The individuals are dressed casually, some wearing jeans and carrying bags, suggesting they might be hiking or simply walking along the route. They face away from the camera, heading towards a destination not visible in the shot.\n\nThe background includes trees and blue skies with some clouds, indicating it might be a nice day. The overall scene could be set in a suburban or rural area given the nature around and the simplicity of the road setup.","title":"Naturalists cross runnells bridge on way to woods along the nissitisset river (a branch of the Nashua), where rare ferns lady slippers and other wild flowers can be found","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550660","547918","554704","558089","548140","542555","545141","558090","553351","546783","553413","547081","551525","542649","543379","546600"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["road","sign","guardrail","hike","shield","walk","say","parallel","destination","warning"]}
