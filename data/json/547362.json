{"path":"547362.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a gathering, possibly a meeting or a formal event, of three men seated at a table, with a large American flag serving as a backdrop. The flag is prominent, covering the entire background horizontally across the image. It features a classic design of alternating red and white stripes with a blue canton containing white stars, symbolizing the United States.\n\nThe men are engaged in what appears to be a serious discussion. On the left side, there's a man wearing a light-colored suit, attentively listening or speaking to his companions. He faces slightly towards the camera, providing a partial view of his face. The middle man, only the back of his head visible, acts as a connector between the conversation with another participant to his right. This third man, on the right side of the frame, also wears glasses and a light-colored short-sleeved shirt. He seems to be in mid-conversation, possibly elaborating on a point or making an argument, indicated by his hand gesture near his face.\n\nThe setting suggests an indoor venue, indicated by the artificial lighting and the formal attire of the participants, hinting at a potentially political or community-related event. The mood conveyed is one of earnest dialogue, possibly discussing matters of importance, underlined by the symbolic American flag in the backdrop, suggesting themes of patriotism or national issues.","title":"Members of the kiwanis club of seward at their weekly meeting","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547365","547407","552618","547284","547368","547320","557856","547367","552616","555234","549073","558393","548237","547359","545984","556451"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["flag","participant","man","dialogue","patriotism","face","companion","event","matter","meeting"]}
