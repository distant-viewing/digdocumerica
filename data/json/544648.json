{"path":"544648.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of environmental neglect in a natural setting, possibly a forest or wooded area. In the foreground, there is an assortment of litter strewn around, including empty liquor bottles, crumpled papers, and discarded items like a covered jar and what appears to be parts of a poster or newspaper. The ground is covered with pine needles and dried leaves, signaling that this might be a pine forest or an area with similar vegetation.\n\nSeveral thin, young trees prominently stand in the foreground, their trunks bare and roots exposed, suggesting poor soil quality or erosion, potentially exacerbated by human activity. Further in the background, more lush and green foliage is visible, possibly indicating a transition into a denser part of the forest or a different type of vegetation zone. The background foliage includes larger, leafy plants and there is a hint of more debris visible between the trees.\n\nThe light filtering through the trees suggests it might be an overcast day, as the overall lighting is soft and diffused with no harsh shadows. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of neglect and the adverse impact of human activity on natural environments, highlighted by the contrast between the littered foreground and the more pristine background.","title":"Litter left by visitors in the TaMiami Canal area beside Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544640","544652","544644","551247","550352","547525","543600","551440","557008","549944","544651","556942","550687","547527","552089","552102"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["forest","neglect","jar","root","poster","foliage","needle","newspaper","litter","pine"]}
