{"path":"547178.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features a small standalone structure labeled as an office, set within a wooded area. The building is constructed with a simple design, featuring light-colored siding contrasted with dark trim around its edges and roofline. It has a gabled roof and is relatively small in size. \n\nOn the side facing the viewer, there's a door centrally located with a small window next to it on the right. Above the window and door, a sign reads \"OFFICE\" in capital letters. Adjacent to the door, there is a welcome sign affixed to the building that states, \"Welcome COME ON IN!\" in a welcoming font, indicating an inviting atmosphere. \n\nThe office is elevated slightly above the ground, resting on a foundation that is not fully visible, but what can be seen suggests it might be simple block masonry. In front of the building, there are a couple of red stepping stones that appear to lead towards the door, enhancing the approachability of the office.\n\nThe background is densely populated with tall, mature trees, suggesting that this office is located in a relatively secluded and natural setting. The trees are dark and leafless, indicating that the photograph might have been taken in late autumn or winter. The ground is covered with fallen leaves and debris, adding to the rustic ambience.\n\nOverall, the setting appears quite serene and private, suitable for an office that might serve a small business or a remote outpost for a larger organization in a scenic location. The image conveys a sense of tranquility and modesty, centered on this small, welcoming office surrounded by nature.","title":"Land development office","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["543580","543587","542593","554440","554436","555351","555231","549221","554438","555295","553458","557327","551076","554232","556472","552986"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["office","door","masonry","font","capital","foundation","roofline","organization","ambience","trim"]}
