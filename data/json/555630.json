{"path":"555630.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape with a mix of natural and man-made elements. The foreground shows rough, muddy terrain with piles of dirt and rocks, suggesting ongoing construction or excavation. Parallel lines of dirt and several covered objects, possibly to protect them or contain environmental impacts, are visible on this rugged terrain.\n\nIn the middle ground, thereâ€™s a well-defined, curving highway with multiple lanes which are divided by grassy medians. This highway smoothly weaves through the hilly terrain, indicating sophisticated road engineering intended to handle significant traffic. This section of the image also features several vehicles traveling along the highway, giving a sense of scale and daily activity in this area.\n\nThe background consists of green, rolling hills extending into the distance, signifying a rural or semi-rural setting. Small buildings, possibly homes or farm structures, dot the landscape, nestled among patches of trees and open fields which hint at agricultural use of the land. \n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the disruptive, messy foreground of construction with the orderly and flowing lines of the highway and the serene, pastoral backdrop, all under what appears to be overcast lighting, softening the colors and details.","title":"Coal companies have strip mined this site in tiers.
