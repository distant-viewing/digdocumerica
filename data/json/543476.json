{"path":"543476.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a young boy, likely at an outdoor event. He appears to be of Asian descent, based on his facial features. The boy has short black hair and is looking slightly to the side, displaying a serious expression. His lips are parted slightly, and his overall appearance seems contemplative or absorbed in his surroundings.\n\nHe is dressed in a navy blue sweater adorned with intricate, colorful patterns that include hues of red, blue, and white. The pattern seems to include geometric or possibly symbolic elements. Over his sweater, he wears a bright yellow scarf with black zigzag patterns and a fringe, draped around his neck and over his shoulder, which infuses a vibrant contrast to his dark top.\n\nThe background is out of focus, featuring a soft green hue that suggests a grassy area, possibly a park or a similar recreational space. This setting underscores the casual, outdoor atmosphere of the photograph. The lighting is natural, likely overcast given the soft shadows and gentle light distribution across the scene.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["556606","543870","553494","558394","553168","553170","556138","549254","543871","546520","551763","553147","549299","553553","552035","552942"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["sweater","boy","pattern","fringe","descent","lip","navy","distribution","scarf","close"]}
