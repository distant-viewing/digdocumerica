{"path":"547636.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The image depicts an aerial view of a coastal area, possibly a beachfront community. There is a shoreline with a clear sandy beach that meets the calm blue ocean waters on the left. Adjacent to the beach, there's a cluster of houses positioned in close proximity along the shore. These houses vary in architecture but most are small to medium-sized homes with peaked roofs, and are likely residential properties.\n\nEach house seems to have its own plot, separated by small dirt or paved paths. The style and color of the houses vary, with some painted bright colors like yellow and red, while others are more subdued in white or grey. Several homes are elevated on stilts, suggesting this area may be prone to flooding or situated in a low-lying area.\n\nBeyond the houses, towards the center and right side of the image, is a more sparse arrangement of buildings spread across a patchy landscape of greenery and wetlands. A body of water, possibly a lagoon or a bay, occupies the middle right side of the image, reflecting a semblance of tranquility and isolation. \n\nThe area looks relatively undeveloped, with wide-open spaces, sparsely located houses, and visible patches of raw greenery and sand. There are a few small roads or paths winding through the area, connecting the clusters of homes to each other. The scene suggests a peaceful, perhaps vacation-oriented community with close access to natural waterfronts.","title":"Housing on barrier beach","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547633","553928","557451","557504","547641","543427","555757","556953","547644","553931","543362","553982","547629","547645","557453","543084"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["house","home","vary","housis","lagoon","beach","prone","cluster","peaked","stilt"]}
