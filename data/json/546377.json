{"path":"546377.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of three men actively engaged in disposing or handling waste at a dumpsite. They are working around a blue pickup truck, which has its hood open and appears to be parked next to a large pile of burning trash emitting thick smoke. The background shows a heavily wooded hillside, enhancing the rural or isolated setting of the dumpsite.\n\nTwo of the men are standing in the bed of the truck. One, wearing a white shirt and dark pants, is bending over as if picking up or adjusting something heavy. The other, who is shirtless and in dark pants, appears to be shoveling or moving garbage. The third man, wearing a checkered shirt, is partially obscured and positioned by the opened hood of the truck on the driver's side, possibly working on or checking something mechanical.\n\nThe scene is clouded in parts by the rising smoke, giving the photograph an overall gritty and grim aura. This visual suggests the tiresome and unhealthy conditions typically associated with open-air waste disposal and the environmental impact evident from the uncontrolled smoke pluming into the sky.","title":"Open garbage dump on highway 112, north of san sebastian","placename":"Mayagüez (P.R.)","location":"Mayagüez, Puero Rico","nn1":["546381","542549","542550","549949","549945","546761","543824","549743","543828","547208","545600","547159","549842","551248","549936","550248"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["dumpsite","truck","hood","smoke","waste","burning","cloude","aura","shovel","pick"]}
