{"path":"556868.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures two men standing closely together, likely colleagues or friends, in a workplace setting that appears to be industrial or construction-related. Both men are smiling and relaxed, suggesting a moment of casual interaction during a break or lighthearted moment.\n\nEach man is wearing a hard hat, an essential safety item in many industrial and construction environments. These hats are colored orange and are visibly worn, indicating frequent use. The man on the left is donned in a dark jacket over a white shirt and is wearing sunglasses shaped in a classic style. The man on the right is wearing a purple-striped, long-sleeve shirt and similar style sunglasses, adding a touch of personal style to their protective gear.\n\nThe background includes a red piece of machinery, possibly part of a vehicle like a crane or truck, which aligns with the industrial setting. The colors are rich and somewhat muted, possibly due to the lighting or age of the photograph. Sparse foliage can be seen in the further background, suggesting an outdoor setting. The overall composition and mood of the photo convey a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose among the subjects, captured in a moment of genuine interaction.","title":"Closeup of Southern Railway right-of-way workers on the job. They are members of one of four crews averaging 50 to 55 men the company had working on its 10,531 miles of track during 1974. Southern that year spent 18.6 percent of its revenue in maintaining the tracks, the highest percentage in the industry. As a result, maximum safe speed on virtually all the track is 60 miles per hour. That figure is higher than for other railroad company track.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["543651","549947","547160","556335","553606","556339","556864","547987","544969","546036","542779","556903","542783","556867","553802","556391"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["sunglass","man","colleague","workplace","style","construction","camaraderie","hat","friend","moment"]}
