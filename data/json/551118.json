{"path":"551118.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside setting with several large industrial tanks and a small wooden bridge or walkway, situated on the left side. The scene is surrounded by a forested mountainous area that fades into the backdrop under a hazy sky, possibly due to mist or fog. The lake reflects the colors and elements of the scene gently, emphasizing a peaceful calmness in the environment.\n\nForeground vegetation includes lush foliage with prominent fronds and leaves that silhouette against the sky, adding a natural frame to the scene. The overall ambiance is quiet and moody, with a hint of mystery due to the low visibility and soft lighting. The colors in the image are subdued, with a palette of deep greens, blues, and purples enhancing the tranquil and slightly melancholic feel of the setting.","title":"Beyond the Exxon loading dock at Boomer--looking up the Kanawha River to Smokey Alloy","placename":"Charleston (W.
