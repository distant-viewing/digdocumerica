{"path":"556186.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a construction worker in action. The man, dressed in work attire consisting of a dark long-sleeve shirt and denim jeans, is wearing a white hard hat, emphasizing safety protocols typical in construction settings. He is bending over a large pile of rebar, gripping and organizing the metal rods, which are essential materials for reinforced concrete constructions.\n\nThe setting is an urban environment, evidenced by the backdrop featuring a building with vibrant green and red windows, adding a colorful contrast to the otherwise industrial scene. The focus and lighting on the worker suggest that he is the primary subject, with the blurred background emphasizing his actions and the physicality of his labor.\n\nThe overall composition of the image conveys a sense of hard work and attention to detail, highlighting the physical aspect of construction work and the urban setting in which it takes place.","title":"Black construction worker in South Side Chicago. Some blacks charge that areas of the new \"Loop\" and on the South Side have been systematically vacated as a result of fires, vandalism or failure by building owners to provide basic services to tenants. And that the new apartment units are expensive, appealing only to a small percentage of the black community and almost none of the area's previous residents.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["546258","546254","553618","544828","544171","553921","547218","546414","546869","547989","544394","556447","542497","546815","556391","551951"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","rebar","action","worker","protocol","work","grip","rod","denim","evidence"]}
