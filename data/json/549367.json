{"path":"549367.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features two men in a cluttered, equipment-filled room that appears to be used for electronic or technical work. \n\nForeground:\n- A plethora of electronic mountain cables at the very front, creating a blurred effect due to their proximity to the camera.\n\nMidground:\n- The primary focus is a large electronic device with multiple dials, switches, and cables. It's housed within a gray metal frame and shows some diagnostic or measurement information on its display.\n- Next to this main device are other racks of electronic equipment, also filled with dials, wires, and monitors, indicative of a workspace dedicated to technical or scientific exploration.\n\nBackground:\n- Two men are present, one seated and the other standing. The seated man is centrally positioned and looks directly at the camera, wearing a pink shirt and dark pants, representing a calm, focused demeanor. The standing man, partially obscured by the equipment, occupies the right side of the frame. He is also looking toward the camera, wearing glasses and a blue shirt with red stripes, adding to the dynamic and involved scene.\n- The room is well-lit from natural light coming through windows lined along a wall, showing a view of exterior greenery which contrasts with the dense technological interior.\n- The ceiling is industrial, with visible pipes and ducts running across it, emphasizing the workspace environment.\n- Shelves with books and other items line the background, suggesting a storing facility for manuals, records, or reference materials vital for the activities performed here.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively portrays a busy, intricate workplace possibly used for research, development, or complex electronic repairs, marked by the detailed assembly of technology and the serious engagement of its occupants.","title":"Dr. Velimir Pravdic, chief of the electro-chemistry lab (right), and his assistant, Marijan Vukovic.
