{"path":"545594.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged outdoor scene where the main focal point is a camper van parked on rocky terrain. The camper van is large, modern, and predominantly white with some teal and black accents. It appears parked on a flat, rocky surface surrounded by a landscape of red and brown rocks, possibly sandstone, which is typical in desert environments like canyons or plateaus.\n\nIn the foreground, the image shows a somewhat dramatic geological feature: a crack or small canyon within the rock, which adds a sense of depth and natural ruggedness to the scene. The rocks around this feature are jagged and irregular, with colors ranging from dark red to brown.\n\nIn the background, beyond the camper van, the terrain is populated with scattered brushes and low-lying vegetation, characteristic of semi-arid or desert climates. The sky is partly cloudy with sizable white clouds scattered across a bright blue sky, suggesting a sunny day with good weather.\n\nA person is visible near the camper van, which brings a human element to the image and shows the scale of the natural and man-made objects. This person appears to be engaging in an outdoor activity, possibly exploring or setting up a site, which compliments the theme of adventure and travel suggested by the presence of the camper van.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photo suggest a theme of outdoor exploration, travel, and adventure in a rugged desert environment.","title":"Tourists at Dead Horse Point State Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["548802","545596","548796","545605","548668","554681","548795","545590","553133","545102","545500","548748","545601","545739","552898","542747"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["camper","van","desert","canyon","travel","adventure","rock","plateaus","teal","sandstone"]}
