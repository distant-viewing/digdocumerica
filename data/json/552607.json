{"path":"552607.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a wintry landscape dominated by a scenic mountain range in the background. The mountains, draped with snow, exhibit rugged contours and dark striations that suggest geological texture. Beneath this mountainous backdrop, the middle ground is a patchwork of frost-covered fields and sporadic areas of exposed earth, introducing a blend of muted earth tones and white snow cover.\n\nIn the foreground, a small town stretches across the scene, its buildings and homes partially dusted with snow, suggesting recent snowfall. The architecture is typical of mid-20th century small-town America, with low-rise structures spread relatively sparsely. There are visible clusters of trees scattered throughout the town, their bare branches hinting at the cold season. A main road can be seen winding through the town, alongside which are other minor roads and paths, all lightly coated with snow and thus integrating seamlessly into the winter theme.\n\nThe overall lighting in the photo is soft, likely due to overcast conditions, which adds to the chilly, serene atmosphere of the scene. The sky, a blend of pale blue and light gray, suggests a cold but calm winter day. This composition beautifully highlights the interaction between civilization and the natural environment, showcasing the quiet beauty of a rural winter setting.","title":"Rifle, southeast of the Piceance Basin, beneath the oil shale bearing Book (or Roan) Cliffs, is the major community in this region of sheep and cattle ranches.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["543755","557193","544901","543640","543763","553811","544857","550408","550406","550412","543720","550416","554281","557194","543738","550415"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["town","snow","winter","civilization","blend","frost","earth","snowfall","striation","patchwork"]}
