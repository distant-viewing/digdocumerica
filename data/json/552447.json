{"path":"552447.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a stark contrast between natural landscapes and human waste. In the background, thereâ€™s a prominent volcanic mountain with a rugged, barren surface, mostly in hues of brown and gray under a clear blue sky. The peak is irregular and rocky, suggesting a harsh, desolate environment typical of volcanic regions.\n\nIn stark contrast, the foreground is cluttered with an expansive pile of garbage. This garbage includes numerous black plastic bags filled with waste, along with scattered loose items such as newspapers, cardboard boxes, and other discarded materials. The waste spills over the rough terrain, suggesting a landfill or dumpsite located in proximity to the volcanic area.\n\nThis image captures the juxtaposition of natural geological features with the environmental impact of human activities, highlighting the issue of waste management and environmental preservation.","title":"Abandoned mine in Ladd is used as city dump.
