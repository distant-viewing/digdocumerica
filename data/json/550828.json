{"path":"550828.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph depicts a single beaten-up sandal lying amidst sand. The sandal, possibly brown, shows significant wear with a faded white daisy-like flower attached near the toe area; this attachment itself appears to be coming apart. The background and surrounding area are filled with loose, wet sand, small pebbles, and some leafy green vegetation emerging sporadically. The vegetation is in various states of health, with some leaves young and vibrant, and others older or mildly decayed. The setting appears to be a muddy or sandy area, possibly near a body of water, given the wetness of the sand and the types of flora present. The general atmosphere portrays a sense of abandonment and solitude, highlighted by the discarded state of the sandal amidst the subtle yet persistent encroachment of nature.","title":"Shore of the Wisconsin river in the popular dells region are strewn with tourists' mementos","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["548707","547167","545029","545587","548051","547590","547607","543136","547869","543496","547024","548742","547978","548672","548752","547015"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["sandal","sand","wetness","state","daisy","attachment","beat","encroachment","health","pebble"]}
