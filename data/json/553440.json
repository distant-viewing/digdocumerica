{"path":"553440.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lake setting during what appears to be the late afternoon or early evening, given the lighting conditions. The image features a broad, tranquil lake with a shimmering surface reflecting some of the dusky sky. On the far side, the land gently slopes upwards, covered with dense greenery and trees. A few houses are nestled discretely among the trees, partially hidden by the foliage.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a small sandy beach area where several people can be seen engaged in various activities. Some individuals are standing by the waterâ€™s edge, possibly chatting or simply enjoying the view, while others are in the water swimming or wading near a floating dock. A couple of small boats with people are also visible closer to the middle of the lake, adding a dynamic element to the peaceful scenery.\n\nOverall, the composition and the soft focus lend the photograph a calm and somewhat nostalgic feel, evoking a sense of relaxation and leisure typical of lakeside retreats. The colors are generally muted with shades of green, blue, and touches of earth tones, reinforcing the tranquility of the scene.","title":"Here at Clinton, in the first quarter mile from its origin below the Wachusett Reservoir, the Nashua River is still safe for swimming.
