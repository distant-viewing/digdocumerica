{"path":"545450.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures three young men at an outdoor event, possibly during the evening given the visible lighting conditions. The setting appears to be lively and social, evidenced by various people visible in the softly focused background.\n\nThe three young men are leaning on a wooden railing painted in orange with a noticeable 'N' on it, suggesting they might be at a fair or carnival. The one on the left is wearing a dark denim hat with a matching jacket over a light-colored shirt. He has a gold wristwatch and appears to be talking directly to the camera, showing an expressive facial gesture.\n\nThe middle individual wears a light, possibly white, shirt with a casual jacket over it. His expression is neutral, and he is looking slightly towards his right, perhaps at someone or something outside the frame.\n\nThe third man on the right wears a patterned shirt with bold, possibly black and white, geometric shapes and holds a green bottle. He is turned towards the middle man, creating a sense of engagement among the group.\n\nThe atmosphere hints at an informal gathering where youth congregate to enjoy their time, demonstrated by the casual dress code and relaxed postures. The blurred background with other patrons and possibly stalls or booths contributes to a sense of depth and context, placing this scene at a public gathering place where people socialize and enjoy the evening.","title":"State fair","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545358","545330","553304","552973","558313","553172","557030","557031","553122","557145","558295","551028","553166","557036","551460","547443"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["code","evening","congregate","socialize","patron","wristwatch","enjoy","man","bold","shirt"]}
