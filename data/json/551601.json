{"path":"551601.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and intense scene involving wildlife and a man-made machine. At the forefront of the image is a small, single-engine propeller airplane making its way along what appears to be a wet runway or a shallow body of water. The aircraft, facing towards the camera, has its cockpit lights on, illuminating part of the scene.\n\nIn a dramatic interaction, a large number of birds, possibly seagulls, are scattered all around the airplane. Many of these birds are in full flight, with wings spread wide, while others are just taking off from the ground. This activity suggests that the arrival or movement of the plane has startled the birds, causing a flurry of action.\n\nThe background shows a dense tree line under a dusky or overcast sky, providing a natural and rather dark backdrop that contrasts with the lighter, reflective surface of the water or wetland. This setting emphasizes the disturbance caused in this normally tranquil environment by the intrusive presence of the airplane. The overall composition of the photograph captures a moment of interaction between technology and nature, highlighting the dramatic and chaotic beauty of such encounters.","title":"At the sky harbor airport and seaplane base the seagulls compete with the \"iron birds\"","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["544606","544491","549738","552238","546759","553347","549742","548469","543283","557121","548881","547824","549772","557123","548485","549757"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","bird","cause","encounter","arrival","propeller","runway","dusky","cockpit","seagull"]}
