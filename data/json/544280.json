{"path":"544280.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a small tree frog perched vertically and clinging onto a blade of grass or a similar plant. The frog is clearly the focal point of the image, highlighted against a darker, blurred background composed of greens and browns. The background includes more foliage, which seems to encompass various grasses or thin-leaved plants. The lighting in the scene is subdued, providing a natural and somewhat moody atmosphere. The color tone is rich, with strong dark greens and slight hints of orange or rust, suggesting either a sunset or sunrise time, or perhaps the effect of the photographic exposure and film used. The detail on the frog is crisp, showcasing its glossy skin and the subtle textures that define its limbs and head. The overall composition emphasizes the small size of the frog within its natural environment, portraying a quiet moment in nature.","title":"Southeastern Louisiana","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["549145","555066","557587","551362","551363","555067","557606","555197","549144","558077","554602","553589","557593","543564","542554","543565"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["limb","green","blade","encompass","cling","perch","skin","plant","grass","sunrise"]}
