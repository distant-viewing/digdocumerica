{"path":"544457.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This image captures a group of men working inside what appears to be an empty swimming pool filled with debris and muddy water. The setting is a sunny day, as indicated by the bright daylight and shadows cast in the scene.\n\nThe pool, of a rectangular shape, has its interior surfaces covered in mud and scattered with various debris such as broken branches, leaves, parts of metal structures, and miscellaneous trash. At the center and corners, the water has pooled, reflecting the light and mirroring some of the debris floating on it.\n\nThere are at least nine men within and around the pool, dressed in casual and work clothing, including hats and helmets. These individuals are engaged in different activities: some are scooping mud out, others seem to be inspecting or moving around the debris, while a couple appear to be observing or possibly directing the operations.\n\nThe background beyond the pool shows a grassy area with trees and a clear sky. The overall ambiance is one of cooperation and effort in clearing out or perhaps renovating the pool. The image evokes a sense of community work or a clean-up project after a possible natural disaster or long period of neglect.","title":"Flooding of Guadalupe River caused widespread damage.","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["545535","545531","550224","555562","558143","544469","552012","555891","546337","548549","555877","547665","548761","542979","548548","552706"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["pool","debris","mud","work","cooperation","scoop","disaster","swimming","inspect","clear"]}
