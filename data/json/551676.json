{"path":"551676.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This image depicts a lively scene set in a large, grassy park with scattered trees in the background and a partial view of some towering buildings, hinting that this might be an urban park. There are several people engaged in various activities around a table.\n\nAt the table, a quilt appears to be either being made or displayed. Several individuals—mostly women and children—are gathered around it. Each person is actively involved in either looking at or working on the quilt.\n\nOn the left, a young woman with shoulder-length hair is sitting, intensely focusing on a specific section of the quilt. Opposite her, another woman, wearing a floral dress and glasses, leans forward on the table, possibly giving instructions or pointing out something interesting about the quilt.\n\nStanding next to the table is a young girl and a woman in a bright red sleeveless top and pants, observing the activities at the table. Behind them are more children and another woman, all casually dressed, suggesting a relaxed, informal gathering.\n\nThe setting and clothing suggest a 1970s vibe, based on the styles and prints observed in their attire. The atmosphere is casual and communal, characteristic of a park gathering. Overall, the photograph captures a moment of shared creativity and social interaction in an outdoor setting.","title":"Midsummer evening quilting bee in Central Park, sponsored by the New York Parks Administration Department of Cultural Affairs.
