{"path":"547003.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a marshy area with several environmental and industrial elements. In the foreground, there's a collection of bones scattered along the muddy shoreline of the marsh. The bones are bleached and appear weathered, suggesting they have been exposed to the elements for some time. The immediate surroundings feature tall, dry reeds and grasses indicative of a wetland environment, and reflect the tranquility and natural aspect of the scene.\n\nThe background contrasts sharply with the natural elements in the foreground. It shows an industrial setting with large structures that include towering silos, smokestacks, and other facilities. Smoke or steam can be seen billowing from the stacks, a sign of ongoing industrial activity. The presence of cranes and piled materials suggests that this might be a manufacturing plant or similar operation.\n\nThe composition draws a stark line between the industrial backdrop and the natural foreground, possibly highlighting contrasts between nature and human activity, suggesting themes of environmental impact or ecological degradation. The sky is overcast, casting a dull light over the entire scene, which contributes to a somewhat somber mood.","title":"Mercury waste from the Brunswick pulp and paper plant (in background) has desTroyed the marsh in front of the building","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["546978","546974","544289","545993","545989","550995","545996","552154","550343","546056","555542","547539","552194","545988","554791","546073"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["bleach","marsh","reed","silo","degradation","billow","weathere","manufacturing","towering","collection"]}
