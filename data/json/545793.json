{"path":"545793.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph features a striking landscape under clear blue skies showcasing the natural rock formations of Arches National Park in Utah, USA. The main focus is on the Balanced Rock, an iconic large rock formation that dramatically appears to be balanced on a pedestal of eroded sandstone. This rock sits prominently in the right-third of the image, contrasting against a backdrop of distant snow-capped mountains which add a serene and majestic atmosphere to the scene.\n\nIn the background, spanning across the horizon from the left to the center, are more red rocks and formations typical of the park, interspersed with sparse green vegetation. These formations, varying in shapes and sizes with deep crevices and rugged textures, lead the eye towards the snow-covered mountain range, which looms in the distance under a bright blue sky. The foreground of the photograph is a relatively flat area with scattered bushes, leading a natural pathway towards the Balanced Rock.\n\nThe entire scene encapsulates the unique geological features and the stark but beautiful contrasts of desert landscape against mountainous terrain, typical of the American Southwest. The composition balances the massiveness of the rock formations with the expansiveness of the sky and distant mountains, while the lighting accentuates the natural red and orange hues of the sandstone.","title":"Delicate Arch, the most famous natural arch in the park.
