{"path":"550271.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a panorama of a town spread across varying elevations. In the foreground, the terrain is predominantly green, covered with grass and sparse shrubbery, suggesting a semi-urban setting transitioning into a natural landscape. The midground features a cluster of residential homes, all of which possess similar architectural styles that include gabled roofs, white exteriors, and compact structures, hinting at a cohesive community or neighborhood design.\n\nA significant architectural feature in the image is a large, multi-level overpass system, indicative of a major traffic artery that aids in connecting different parts of the town. The overpass stretches across the midground of the photo, providing a contrast of modern infrastructure against the more traditional housing.\n\nThe background is defined by taller structures, including a building with what appears to be a grain elevator, hinting at industrial or agricultural activity in or near the town. Dominating the skyline are two prominent spires, likely belonging to a church or cathedral, which pierces the skyline with its gothic-style architecture, adding an element of historical significance to the town.\n\nOverall, the composition includes man-made structures harmoniously integrated into a natural landscape, encapsulated under a wide, cloudy sky that casts a soft, diffuse light, lending an overall calm and serene mood to the scene.","title":"Vacated space in downtown area lies in path of the freeway","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553327","553326","556585","550558","546745","552595","550318","545429","550550","556951","547229","557271","550157","558030","556948","558058"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["town","midground","skyline","panorama","possess","aid","belong","spire","grain","integrate"]}
