{"path":"547075.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image features a vibrant, dynamic scene on a narrow urban street. In the photograph, we see two individuals interacting with a large, heavily loaded truck. The truck is packed to capacity, with various items, possibly old papers or cardboard, strapped down and piled high above the top edge of the truck's container. The container itself appears to be a rusty orange color, with visible signs of wear and is secured by a metal grid structure on its side.\n\nOne of the two individuals, wearing a red jacket, grey pants, and dark boots, is seen pulling upward on a strap or a rope, possibly to adjust or secure the load. This person is standing at the rear left side of the truck. The other individual, dressed in a dark jacket, blue jeans, and light-colored shoes, is positioned at the rear right of the truck, holding onto the truck, seemingly assisting or supervising the loading or securing process.\n\nThe background of the scene reveals a grimy, industrial environment characterized by faded brick buildings and a plethora of overhead wires crisscrossing the sky. The street appears damp as if it had recently rained, contributing to the gritty, overcast atmosphere of the setting. The overall composition and elements in the scene suggest a moment of manual labor and collaboration within an urban, industrial setting.","title":"Collecting old papers","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557110","549850","556043","546910","557687","549867","542857","547174","547666","544161","553631","542856","552360","555866","544057","549844"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","strap","secure","load","container","collaboration","capacity","supervise","jacket","individual"]}
