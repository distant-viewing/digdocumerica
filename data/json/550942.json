{"path":"550942.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic maritime moment. In the foreground, two individuals are shown fishing off a rocky shoreline. On the left, there is a person wearing a light yellow shirt and stripped pants, actively fishing with a rod. To their right, another individual, clad in a green bikini, also stands fishing. Both are facing the sea, engrossed in their activity, backs to the viewer.\n\nThe mid-ground is dominated by a massive ship, the \"Vettriano,\" moving towards the left of the image. The ship, painted in a dark color with a white superstructure and marked with a logo or shield near its bow, creates a striking contrast against the water and sky. This vessel seems to be cutting through the water with a sense of purpose, as indicated by the bow waves.\n\nIn the background, the horizon is lined with industrial structures that suggest a port or shipyard, complete with cranes and storage tanks. The sea is relatively calm, and the sky is cloudy but bright. A few birds can be seen flying in the sky, adding a sense of life and movement to the serene scene.\n\nThe overall composition combines elements of human leisure activity with industrial maritime operations, set against a natural seascape, encapsulating a moment of daily life by the water.","title":"Freighter moves slowly up the Houston Ship Channel as girls fish from the shore.
