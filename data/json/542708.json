{"path":"542708.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph showcases a striking aerial view of a large agricultural area with colorfully differentiated fields. In the foreground, there is a densely forested hill that slopes downwards towards the fields. The fields themselves are organized in vibrant, distinct blocks of red and green, likely indicating different types of crops or flowers. These fields are segmented by narrow pathways or small roads, adding a geometric pattern to the expansive landscape.\n\nIn the midground, several large water basins or flood areas are visible, reflecting a dull blue-gray color which contrasts with the vivid reds of the nearby fields. A few buildings, possibly farmhouses or storage units, are scattered within the vicinity of the fields and along the edges.\n\nIn the background, the landscape transitions into a flat, open area that extends towards the horizon, giving a sense of vastness to the setting. The overall composition, with its mix of lush greenery, bright fields, and reflective water bodies, underscores a blend of natural and cultivated land. The photograph likely emphasizes the expansive, methodical nature of agricultural planning and layout.","title":"Flower fields of Lompoc where many of the world's flower seeds are grown","placename":"Lompoc (Calif.)","location":"Lompoc, California","nn1":["549094","554029","548907","558414","553977","554055","552858","557517","548817","548901","547724","549253","542730","554030","553047","553972"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["field","bodie","farmhouse","basin","planning","flood","organize","segment","transitions","vicinity"]}
