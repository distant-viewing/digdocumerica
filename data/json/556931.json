{"path":"556931.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view capturing a vast natural landscape featuring a densely forested area and a body of water, appearing to be a lake or river. The forest is predominantly dark green, indicating lush, perhaps coniferous trees, stretching endlessly across the frame, hinting at a remote location. The expanse of water adjoining the forest reflects a serene surface, suggesting little to no wind at the time the photo was taken.\n\nOn the bottom right corner of the image, there is a small clearing at the water's edge, hosting a few structures which are probably residential or recreational facilities, though they appear tiny from this altitude. Connected to these structures are a few pathways or small roads curving through the clearing and along the shoreline. The area surrounding these roads includes spots of bare land, possibly sandy or grassy patches, which contrast with the surrounding dense forest.\n\nThe topography and positioning suggest that this could be a secluded recreational or living area, likely used for getting away from urban environments. The overall mood conveyed by the photo is one of tranquility and isolation, highlighting an untouched natural setting. The horizon line subtly seen in the distance fades into a lighter blue sky, suggesting vastness and the continuation of this natural landscape beyond what is visible.","title":"Aerial view looking southeast at Floral Point on the Navy's Bangor Annex. It is the site of the proposed Trident submarine deperming facility. Extensive construction for support facilities of the new submarine will take several years. Expected population growth for construction and workers to man the new facilities will affect the way of life of humans and animals currently living in the area.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["556930","552141","556906","555702","555728","556928","550541","542882","550579","550620","555698","556926","550644","544557","550601","556937"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["clearing","forest","adjoin","get","continuation","host","positioning","topography","living","altitude"]}
