{"path":"550797.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph shows an abandoned car, a vintage model, settled in a field of tall, wild grass. The car's paint appears faded and chipped, primarily reddish-brown with remnants of once-glossy finish now dulled by weather and time. Its body is rusted in several areas, suggesting long exposure to the elements. Glass is missing from one of the windows, and the overall appearance of the vehicle speaks of neglect and decay.\n\nIn the foreground, the wild grass is thick and overgrown, covering almost the entirety of the carâ€™s lower half, indicating that it has been sitting in this spot for a considerable period. The grass sways slightly, a mix of golden and green hues, giving a natural and somewhat untamed look to the scene.\n\nIn the background, dense green foliage from trees can be seen. This backs up the sense of an isolated or rural setting, with the forest encroaching upon the space where the car rests. The lighting in the photo suggests it may be either early morning or late afternoon, with soft light filtering through the trees, enhancing the sense of quiet and abandonment.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a mood of nostalgia and melancholy, capturing a slice of history slowly being reclaimed by nature. It evokes thoughts about the passage of time and the inevitable return of man-made objects to the earth.","title":"Abandoned chevy with 1960 license plate on a back road that follows the Wisconsin river","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["550795","553008","546405","545540","553007","549107","547535","554920","553002","547747","547771","552995","550279","553010","548751","552673"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","grass","dull","missing","entirety","encroach","settle","sway","return","reclaim"]}
