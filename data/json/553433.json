{"path":"553433.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, cluttered landfill with a variety of discarded items. The foreground and midground are filled with numerous rusted barrels, some of which are upright while others are lying on their sides. The barrels show visible signs of wear and corrosion, featuring colors such as red, green, blue and black. Scattered around the barrels are other waste materials including broken pieces of wood, boxes, bags, and smaller debris that contribute to the chaotic appearance of the scene.\n\nBeyond the immediate piles of waste, the landscape extends into a larger dump area where similar types of discarded items continue to accumulate. The background reveals a line of trees that form a perimeter around the landfill, suggesting that the area is somewhat secluded. The sky is clear and brightly lit, indicating that the photograph was taken during daylight with good weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the image captures a scene of environmental neglect and pollution, with a focus on the impact of industrial waste. The variety of discarded objects and the lack of any human presence emphasize the ongoing issues of waste management and environmental degradation.","title":"The dump at leominster on the banks of the Nashua river adds to the deterioration of this already severely polluted river","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["543762","542494","557307","543806","550801","544637","552883","544799","550798","548210","554541","550248","544298","549750","556324","552884"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","landfill","barrel","barrels","corrosion","accumulate","item","perimeter","variety","dump"]}
