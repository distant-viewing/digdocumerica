{"path":"550241.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"In the photograph, you see a child crouching near the shoreline during what appears to be sunset based on the warm, golden tones of the lighting. The child is intently engaged in an activity near the waterâ€™s edge, possibly building something with sand or examining an object found near the water.\n\nThe child is wearing clothes suitable for a cooler day, including long pants, shoes, and a long-sleeve shirt, all seeming to offer comfort and protection from cooler elements. The shoes are noteworthy with a distinctive strap style, suggesting practicality for being near water.\n\nIn the background, the surface of the water glistens beautifully with circular bokeh effects likely caused by the reflection of the sunset on the gentle waves. The sea enhances the peaceful and contemplative mood of the scene. The soft focus and round light patterns contribute to the atmosphere, infusing the scene with a dreamy quality.\n\nThe composition of the image, focusing on the child in silhouette against the glaring reflection of the sun on the water, delivers a poignant sense of innocence and discovery. The picture appears timeless, capturing a universal moment of childhood exploration and wonder.","title":"Sunset at Huntington Beach on Lake Erie","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["549105","547727","550233","552940","544380","555398","543493","547676","544187","552341","552279","550244","545539","544200","549642","544302"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","shoe","sunset","practicality","infuse","discovery","innocence","deliver","reflection","wonder"]}
