{"path":"554138.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and intense scene of a volcanic eruption viewed through a silhouetted thicket of barren tree branches. The forefront features intricate outlines of twigs and leafless branches, starkly set against the vibrant backdrop caused by the volcanic activity. The central part of the image shows a vivid eruption, emitting a strong, bright light at the base, which gradually turns into a tumultuous plume of smoke and ash that ascends into the night sky. The colors range from intense orange near the eruption site, softening into a deep, moody red that mellows into the darkness of the surrounding environment. The overall atmosphere of the image is eerie and powerful, accentuating the unpredictable beauty of natural phenomena.","title":"Mauna Loa glows with hot lava during peak of eruption.
