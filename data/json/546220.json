{"path":"546220.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a striking scene by a body of water, under what appears to be a hazy or polluted sky. Characterized by industrial elements, the composition includes:\n\n1. **People**: Two children are in the water while another stands by the shore. They are seemingly engaged in leisure activities like playing or wading in the shallow part of the water.\n\n2. **Foreground**: Dominating the left side of the foreground is a large cylindrical tank lying horizontally on the sand. The tank is marked with warnings in bold, white letters stating \"DANGER DEEP WATER AREA.\" This suggests a hazardous or ecologically sensitive location.\n\n3. **Background**: In the distant background, an industrial setting is visible. There are factories or processing plants with several structures, including smokestacks, from which no visible emissions are seen. A large pile of what might be industrial waste or raw material also forms part of the scene. The overall industrial backdrop contrasts starkly with the foreground where children play.\n\n4. **Environment and Atmosphere**: The ambiance is somewhat eerie, emphasized by a heavily muted color palette likely due to the quality of air or photographic effects. The water looks calm, and the beach area is devoid of vegetation, underlining an environment impacted by industrial activities. This setting imparts a narrative about environmental degradation and the interaction between industrial development and natural landscapes. \n\n5. **Miscellaneous**: There is a piece of driftwood or debris on the sand near the waterâ€™s edge, adding to the neglected or contaminated vibe of the scene.\n\nThis photograph might be evoking themes of environmental concern, the innocence of childhood in contrast with human-inflicted environmental issues, and the coexistence of industrial and residential zones.","title":"Chemical plants on shore are considered prime source of pollution.","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["549220","551959","550899","550280","550937","546145","546393","550902","546228","544430","551519","547622","551559","546378","555852","543302"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["sand","tank","play","innocence","child","water","wade","impart","driftwood","warning"]}
