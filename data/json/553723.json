{"path":"553723.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a view of a highway leading into a densely populated urban center. The road is lined with multiple lanes accommodating a variety of vehicles including cars and a truck, which are in motion towards the cityscape. The city itself features a skyline dominated by high-rise buildings including condominiums and office towers. One tall building stands prominently in the center, towering over other nearby structures.\n\nIn the background, there are mountain ranges that provide a dramatic backdrop to the urban area, suggesting a contrast between natural landscapes and human-made architecture. The overall lighting suggests it's either early morning or late afternoon, adding a warm glow to the scene.\n\nThe infrastructure includes standard features like lampposts and traffic signs, hinting at a well-developed metropolitan area. The foliage on the roadsides is lush and green, indicating a possibly tropical or subtropical climate. This setting might be indicative of a city like Honolulu, given the presence of high-rise buildings along with the mountainous terrain in the distance.","title":"On H-1 (or Lunalilo) Freeway looking west toward downtown Honolulu.
