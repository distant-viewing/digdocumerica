{"path":"543337.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque coastal scene. The foreground prominently features the deep blue waters of the ocean, which are moderately agitated, with waves crashing against the rocky coastline. The rocks near the shore are rugged and uneven, adding texture to the seascape.\n\nThe central and background areas of the image are dominated by a hilly landscape, on which various houses and buildings are perched. These buildings appear to be residential homes, most of which have a rustic architecture that complements the natural surroundings. They vary in design, but many have large windows and wooden exteriors, indicating they might offer panoramic views of the ocean.\n\nThe topography of the land is uneven and covered with patches of green vegetation and some areas of brownish earth, suggesting a semi-arid climate. The scene is set under a clear blue sky, which suggests a bright, sunny day, enhancing the vivid blues of the ocean and the natural tones of the landscape.\n\nThis image effectively captures the serene yet dynamic interface between human habitation and the rugged beauty of a coastal environment.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["543289","543291","557453","554102","557429","543427","557523","543297","545230","545110","543184","543340","545226","543309","543250","545129"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","interface","seascape","crash","perch","topography","habitation","coastline","complement","exterior"]}
