{"path":"552409.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil garden scene, filled with colorful and vibrant flowers. In the foreground, a bed of marigold flowers dominates, overflowing with rich orange and yellow hues, segmented by green leaves and stems. Each cluster of flowers adds textural detail to the lush display. Beyond the marigold bed, there is a variety of other plants, some with grayish-green leaves that provide a contrasting backdrop to the bright marigolds.\n\nIn the background, the garden opens up into a well-maintained lawn area bordered by a variety of trees, creating a tranquil park-like setting. Two people are seen walking in the distance on the lawn. They appear casual, one in darker clothing and the other in a lighter outfit, possibly enjoying a leisurely stroll in this serene setting. \n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful, capturing a harmonious blend of nature's colors and the tranquility of a garden walk. The overcast sky suggests a possibly cool or mild weather, enhancing the serenity and lushness of the garden.","title":"Gardens of the canadian school of horticulture, on the niagara parkway north of Niagara Falls, ontario","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["552408","552400","551728","551702","557262","557782","551703","557098","551784","551746","552396","544574","551785","546505","544295","551743"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","bed","flower","lushness","overflow","grayish","variety","serenity","stem","flowers"]}
