{"path":"557993.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of destruction and damage, likely from a natural disaster such as a storm or flood. In the foreground, a collapsed wooden structure, possibly a bridge or small building, lies in ruins. The wreckage is extensive, with broken beams and scattered debris covering a rocky and uneven terrain. The remains of the structure are partially submerged in a narrow stream or riverbed, which is bordered by rock and sparse vegetation.\n\nIn the middle of the image, the bed of the stream is visible and appears mostly dry with a few patches of shallow water. The surrounding landscape is rugged, with exposed earth and rocks suggesting recent disturbance or ongoing erosion.\n\nThe background reveals a dense grove of trees and plants under a bright, clear sky, suggesting a rural or semi-wilderness area. A road or path can be seen at the edge of the image, with a vehicle partly visible, parked or abandoned on the roadside, overlooking the scene of devastation.\n\nThis photograph effectively conveys a sense of sudden destruction within a natural setting, hinting at the forces of nature's impact on human-made structures. The image is likely intended to document the aftermath and the resilience or vulnerability of the affected area.","title":"A covered bridge lies in Furnace Run at Oak Hill and Everett Roads in Boston Township, near Cleveland, Ohio. A decision must be made whether to rebuild it or reroute the road across the river in another direction. Current thinking is that the covered bridge will be rebuilt downstream and a modern overpass will run parallel to it. This area lies within the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area signed into law in December, 1974. It includes some 20 miles of land between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Boston (Ohio : Township)","location":"Boston, Ohio","nn1":["544583","544468","544463","544464","544466","554437","545254","544467","544462","547888","555199","544797","555872","555207","547868","555540"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["destruction","stream","vulnerability","ruin","wreckage","riverbed","devastation","disaster","intend","rock"]}
