{"path":"542530.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a landscape featuring large, dark-colored water bodies, surrounded by various paths and tracks. The scene captures two main dark pools; each pool appears somewhat murky and is encircled by large embankments or barriers made from earth and rocks. The barriers contain the liquid and prevent it from spreading into the surrounding areas, which seem arid and lightly vegetated.\n\nIn addition, there are multiple dirt roads visible, bisecting and running around the site, suggesting this area may be accessed frequently, possibly for maintenance or monitoring purposes. Several lighter patches of soil around the water bodies indicate either dry ground or areas with lesser vegetation.\n\nA notable detail in the photograph is the shadow of an airplane visible in the bottom left corner, indicating that the photo was taken from another aircraft flying overhead.\n\nThe terrain overall looks rugged and sparsely vegetated, typical of a semi-arid or desert environment. This setting could potentially be part of an industrial operation, such as mining or waste disposal, given the controlled nature of the pools and the extensive access paths surrounding them. The lack of visible infrastructure or buildings leaves the precise nature of the area and its usage somewhat ambiguous.","title":"Oil wast on desert","placename":"Bakersfield (Calif.)","location":"Bakersfield, California","nn1":["555860","551611","555859","544569","551556","555847","550405","553456","552168","552169","555846","545680","552991","547665","554546","548631"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pool","vegetate","barrier","access","path","prevent","bisect","embankment","encircle","addition"]}
