{"path":"547588.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene featuring a person riding a motorcycle along a vast shoreline. The person, clad in a red top and riding a red motorcycle, travels along the soft, sandy surface of the beach, which is marked by tire tracks and footprints. The expansive beach leads to the ocean, where frothy waves continuously crash onto the shore under a clear blue sky. The horizon is visible in the distance, emphasizing the vastness of the ocean and the solitude of the motorcycle rider in the natural setting. The composition of the photo utilizes natural light and showcases a balance between the land, the person with the motorcycle, and the sea, creating a sense of freedom and exploration.","title":"Motorcycling over the sand","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["543209","548690","545150","550935","548691","544844","542885","553954","544840","553955","542800","547612","543370","543208","546408","547600"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["motorcycle","beach","person","ocean","footprint","freedom","rider","balance","tire","exploration"]}
