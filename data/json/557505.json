{"path":"557505.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a coastal area that includes various landscapes. In the foreground and middle portion of the image, there are several fields with distinctly different crops; the fields are neatly sectioned off, displaying a variety of colors from deep greens to dark reds, indicating different types of vegetation. Aerial views of agricultural fields often show such color variation due to differences in crop types.\n\nTo the right and in the central part of the image, the fields are bordered by winding dirt roads, adding a geometric aspect to the natural landscape. Additionally, some areas of the field appear plowed or fallow, showing darker soil.\n\nBeyond the fields, towards the left side of the image, a large body of water, possibly a river or estuary, flows toward the ocean, which is visible in the upper left corner. The waterway appears calm with reflections visible on the surface, suggesting it might be a sheltered area. Also, in the upper part of the image, there appears to be a bridge crossing the water, connecting one side to the other.\n\nThe landscape in the distance transitions into a more built-up area near the coastline, likely a small coastal town or community. The view extends out to a horizon where the sky meets the ocean, which subtly blends with the sky under hazy or overcast conditions.\n\nOverall, the photograph combines elements of agriculture, natural waterways, and coastal community living, giving an extensive overview of the varying uses and features of the land along the coast.","title":"Aerial of botaquito lagoon, one of the last few Bodies of water of this type in the southern part of the state.
