{"path":"551969.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a group of people seated in an open-air vehicle, touring a desert landscape. The viewpoint is from behind the seated passengers, offering a look at their backs as they face forward. The vehicle appears to be a large jeep or all-terrain vehicle with rows of bench seats. There are about four rows visible, with roughly two to four people seated per row. The passengers include adults and at least one child; they are dressed in casual summer attire suitable for a hot environment, such as t-shirts and hats.\n\nThe surroundings are characterized by large, undulating sand dunes. The sky is clear and the sun appears to be shining brightly, indicating a hot and dry climate typical of a desert area. The vehicle is on a compacted track or road that cuts through the sand dunes, denoted by tire tracks visible in the sandy path ahead. This setting and activity suggest an adventurous excursion into the desert, likely focused on exploring the natural landscape and possibly wildlife or other desert features. The vastness and emptiness of the landscape, consisting essentially of sand and sky, emphasize the isolation and unique environment experienced during such a tour.","title":"Tourists in dune buggy ride over shifting sand dunes at silver lake state park, 8 miles southwest of hart","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["545102","545098","545596","545094","543211","545071","553112","545702","545575","548986","548897","545689","553058","545604","549037","545199"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["desert","tour","dune","sand","seat","row","vehicle","passenger","emptiness","track"]}
