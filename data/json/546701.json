{"path":"546701.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a large, semi-circular structure, which appears to be in the process of being dismantled or is perhaps undergoing construction. The right side of the structure exhibits a concentric, amphitheater-like arrangement of steps or seats, which are largely absent on the left side, indicating significant dismantling or damage. At the center of the structure, debris and construction materials are scattered, contributing to the appearance of a site under demolition or repair.\n\nSurrounding the main structure are several industrial buildings with black or dark roofs, and there is a presence of trucks and other industrial vehicles, suggesting this is an area associated with heavy machinery or construction activity. To the left of the buildings, a large open space filled with wooden planks and more debris can be seen, which could be a storage or staging area for construction materials.\n\nThe area beyond the immediate site includes a dense arrangement of residential housing, visible in both the top left and right corners of the photograph. These homes have uniform red roofs and are arranged in tidy rows, contrasting with the industrial chaos of the main site.\n\nThe overall setting suggests an urban area undergoing significant industrial activity, possibly related to transportation or infrastructure development, hinted by the proximity of multiple railway tracks visible running parallel to the site at the bottom of the photograph. The setting is expansive, indicating a location that could potentially be on the outskirts of a city, where such heavy industrial activities typically occur without encroaching on residential spaces.","title":"Only one-fourth of railroad roundhouse remains","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["555780","555779","555761","549479","553969","549526","549168","556350","548353","555805","547225","547054","549727","545889","547066","551983"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["site","construction","arrangement","demolition","parallel","chaos","repair","debris","material","outskirt"]}
