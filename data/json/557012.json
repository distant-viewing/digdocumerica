{"path":"557012.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a pastoral scene on a foggy day. The image is dominated by thick fog, which gives the entire scene a mysterious and subdued tone. A group of cows is scattered across a lush green pasture, grazing calmly. The composition shows multiple cows, primarily black, with only their silhouettes discernible due to the dense fog. Some cows are closer to the foreground while others are partially obscured by the fog in the background.\n\nTo the left of the image, a wooden fence line runs parallel to a road, leading towards a barely visible vehicle suggesting movement and life beyond the immediate tranquility of the field. In the background, there are faint outlines of trees providing a dark contrast against the light gray foggy sky, enhancing the depth of the field.\n\nThis image captures a serene and somewhat ethereal rural landscape, emphasizing the peaceful coexistence of nature and the presence of domesticated animals in their environment.","title":"Farm pasturage adjacent to Bucklin Hill Road just east of Silverdale. Increased land use pressure for this area and others like it are expected when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby. A \"new city\" is proposed to house a substantial portion of the projected 27,000 people who will move into the area when the naval installation is completed.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["557022","545153","554560","542628","550833","542627","557554","542626","548984","552566","543318","549214","554071","557749","542960","552465"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["cow","fog","pasture","field","coexistence","outline","animal","fence","silhouette","tranquility"]}
