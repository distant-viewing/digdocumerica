{"path":"543602.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph is a close-up image of a dandelion seed head, capturing the intricate details of the seeds and their filaments. The seeds are arranged radially, creating a delicate pattern that resembles a fine mesh or web. Each seed is attached to a thin, white, feathery filament that helps it to catch the wind for dispersal.\n\nThe filaments are translucent and glisten slightly, perhaps due to moisture or natural oils, adding a gentle shimmer to the texture. The photograph's focus is shallow, with the central seeds in sharp detail while those towards the edges become gradually blurred, emphasizing the depth and spherical shape of the seed head.\n\nThe background is completely out of focus, presenting a dark, uniform color that contrasts starkly with the light, airy textures of the dandelion seeds. This backdrop enhances the visibility of the delicate seed structures and creates a sense of isolation, making the dandelion the sole subject of the photo. The lighting is soft yet sufficiently bright to highlight the intricate details and natural symmetry of the dandelion.","title":"Dandelion blossom gone to seed","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["544880","557487","545291","543623","557169","554745","552554","555189","554574","557167","545699","545706","557617","555035","543596","545695"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["seed","dandelion","translucent","web","detail","head","symmetry","mesh","glisten","become"]}
