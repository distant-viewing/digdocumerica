{"path":"548468.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, yet somewhat contrasting scene along a beach overlooking an airfield. In the foreground, three people are enjoying a sunny day on the sandy beach. On the left, a person seated on a beach chair is partially covered with a bright, striped towel, seemingly reading from a paper or a book. In the middle, another individual lies on a blue beach chair, wearing shorts and shielding their head from the sun with their hand, possibly browsing through a book or resting. On the right, a figure lounges on a red beach chair, partaking in some relaxation, their posture and positioning suggesting a laid-back state.\n\nAll three beachgoers are turned towards an expansive body of water that reflects the sunny skies. The background scene presents a starkly different environment â€“ an active airfield across the water. We see several planes; one is taking off, another is landing, and a couple more are stationary. This juxtaposition of a tranquil beach setting with the dynamic and mechanical operation of the airport creates a striking contrast in the photograph.\n\nOverall, the image is rich with details that suggest a typical leisure day for some juxtaposed against the backdrop of bustling air traffic, illustrating the coexistence of relaxation and industry.","title":"Constitution Beach--within sight and sound of Logan Airport's takeoff runway, 22R.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548466","545162","547877","548541","554160","547503","546408","557484","553685","548464","553882","547237","546928","550936","550931","548929"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","chair","book","relaxation","partake","beachgoer","browse","airport","lounge","shield"]}
