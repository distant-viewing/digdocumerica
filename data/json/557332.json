{"path":"557332.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"In this photograph, there is a man sitting inside what appears to be a display or demonstration model of a solar energy system. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly at an exhibition or a show room given the structured setup and informational displays.\n\nThe man is dressed in a dark blazer and light-colored pants, wearing glasses, and he is looking towards the camera. He is interacting with part of the solar energy system display, touching a triangular, reflective structure that likely channels or collects solar energy. \n\nThe background features various parts of the solar energy system including reflective shields and diagrams explaining how the system works. Visible labels such as \"Battery Area,\" \"Collector Blower,\" and \"Reflective Shields\" provide information on different components of the system. These components are encased within makeshift wooden structures and clear glass or plastic casings, suggesting that the setup is for educational or demonstrative purposes.\n\nThere is also a diagram titled \"Vertical Wire Collector Clips,\" detailed with technical drawings and text, aiding in the explanation of the system's design and function. The overall ambiance hints at innovation and education in renewable energy technologies, aiming to make the functionalities of such a system comprehensible to viewers or passersby.","title":"John keys, president of international solarthermics corporation, beside a cutaway model of the backyard solar heating system developed by his company","placename":"Nederland (Colo.)","location":"Nederland, Colorado","nn1":["555323","557328","555349","555347","557312","555343","555293","557338","555348","555341","555327","555309","555292","557320","557316","557334"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["system","energy","diagram","component","setup","drawing","education","encase","indoor","display"]}
