{"path":"557778.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene focused on an older model Chevrolet Blazer parked in a dense wooded area. The vehicle, partially cropped at the bottom, features a large rear window, a mounted spare tire, and a two-tone paint job, primarily brown with a white top. The license plate, visible on the back of the vehicle, shows the identifier \"RT 3974\" and has a \"MAINE\" banner at the bottom, indicating it's registered in Maine.\n\nIn the background, a multi-story house is partially visible through the trees. The house has a large deck where two people are seen engaging in a task together, surrounded by lush green foliage. The house's façade includes large windows and wood siding, integrating well with the natural environment. The setting gives the impression of a peaceful, secluded residence hidden among the trees.","title":"Home of Doug Robertson blends naturally with its White County environment at McClure Creek, six miles southeast of Unicoi State Park off Highway 255 and near Robertstown, Georgia.
