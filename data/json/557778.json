The vehicle, partially cropped at the bottom, features a large rear window, a mounted spare tire, and a two-tone paint job, primarily brown with a white top. The license plate, visible on the back of the vehicle, shows the identifier \"RT 3974\" and has a \"MAINE\" banner at the bottom, indicating it's registered in Maine.\n\nIn the background, a multi-story house is partially visible through the trees. The house has a large deck where two people are seen engaging in a task together, surrounded by lush green foliage. The house's fa√ßade includes large windows and wood siding, integrating well with the natural environment. The setting gives the impression of a peaceful, secluded residence hidden among the trees.","title":"Home of doug robertson blends naturally with its white county environment at mcclure creek six miles southeast of unicoi state park off highway 255 and near robertstown, Georgia robertson as director of planning and research at the state's unicoi experiment station when it closed in july, 1975.
