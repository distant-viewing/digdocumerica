{"path":"552919.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a bird's-eye view of a solitary island surrounded by water. The island features rugged, uneven terrain covered with various shades of earthy tones, predominantly browns and greens, hinting at potentially rocky and vegetated surfaces. The sunlight casts a pronounced shadow of the island onto the water towards the left side of the frame, suggesting early or late day lighting.\n\nThe water enveloping the island appears calm with a deep blue hue, possibly indicating depth or purity. The surface of the water sparkles with reflections of the sunlight, particularly noticeable on the right side of the image where the tiny glimmers look like scattered diamonds.\n\nThe composition focuses on the contrast between the solid, enduring character of the island and the vast, fluid environment that surrounds it, emphasizing isolation and natural beauty. There is no visible human activity or artificial structure, reinforcing a sense of untouched, pristine wilderness. The scene is peaceful, yet it exudes a rugged wildness indicative of a remote location.","title":"One of the rock formations known as the Pinnacles thrusts up from Pyramid Lake.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["552886","552887","543625","548605","550358","544596","550360","542808","553135","551573","551553","548630","545173","554024","552229","548785"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["island","glimmer","wildness","diamond","pronounce","sparkle","endure","sunlight","water","vegetate"]}
