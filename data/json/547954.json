{"path":"547954.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph provides a detailed view of a car parking lot filled with vehicles from what appears to be the 1960s or 70s. In the foreground, a portion of a brown vehicle with a visible hood and windshield can be seen. A white note or piece of paper is visible under the windshield wiper.\n\nJust beyond the nearest car, another vehicle is positioned sideways relative to the photo's viewpoint. This car, which is the main focal point, is a classic model painted black with a white hardtop, distinctive brightwork, and whitewall tires. The car is pristine, reflecting the era's automotive design with a long body, angular lines, and large, round headlamps.\n\nBeyond these two prominently displayed cars, the background shows a densely packed parking area filled with rows of various cars extending into the distance. The cars feature an array of colors, and the setting appears open with no discernible structures apart from the parking lot itself. The environment is bright, suggesting a sunny day, which casts shadows from the cars onto the pavement. This scene captures a typical day at a busy parking lot, reflecting a period-specific slice of American car culture.","title":"Parking lot at the John F.
