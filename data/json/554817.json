{"path":"554817.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph captures a landscape distinguished by its undulating terrain and earthy textures. In the foreground, there is a series of mounds covered in a mixture of rocks and soil, which appear to be man-made piles, perhaps for mining or industrial purposes. This area provides a rugged, textured contrast to the smoother surfaces seen beyond it.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a cliff-like formation where the earth drops down sharply, exposing layers of bedrock and soil that suggest erosion or excavation activities. The detail in this section is richer, revealing variations in soil composition and color ranging from dark browns to lighter tans.\n\nThe background is dominated by a vast, open field that ascends mildly towards a flat horizon. The field is barren, devoid of any visible vegetation or structures, accentuating a sense of desolation and isolation. The sky above the field is clear, with a very subtle gradient of light near the horizon, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nOverall, the photograph presents a scene characterized by human impact on the natural environment, showcasing textures and forms within a largely uninhabited and utilitarian landscape. The color palette is dominated by earth tones, reflecting the natural elements of soil and rock.","title":"Topsoil is the lighter colored dirt and must be replaced according to 1972 Ohio law.
