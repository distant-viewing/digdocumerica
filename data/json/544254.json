{"path":"544254.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural outdoor setting where two men are engaged in agricultural work. The ground is covered with dried plant material, likely sugarcane debris, setting a backdrop typical of a harvesting scene.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a man dressed in dark pants and a light-colored shirt. He wears a straw hat, frayed at the edge, and gardening gloves, suggesting labor involving hands-on activity. He is holding a long wooden tool, probably a rake or a hoe, appropriate for managing ground cover or debris.\n\nTo the right, another man stands, wearing jeans, a short-sleeved white shirt, and a distinctive head covering made from a checkered fabric, tied around his head. Like the first man, he also has gloves, indicating manual labor. His posture, with hands clasped in front and head slightly bowed, appears more reflective or cautious.\n\nBetween them on the ground lies a black snake, adding a sense of immediate danger or alertness to the scene. This element perhaps explains the cautious demeanor of the second man.\n\nIn the background, a pickup truck is loaded with more plant debris, underlining the agricultural nature of their work. Large metal tanks or silos and a clear blue sky without significant cloud cover suggest a rural farm setting, likely in a warm climate.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a moment of typical agricultural labor, underscored by the potential peril indicated by the presence of the snake, highlighting the everyday risks faced by workers in such environments.","title":"Workmen killing a water moccasin","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["554047","554937","555620","546383","552812","549036","552570","555876","553093","549259","544371","546380","554108","548299","554922","557696"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["labor","glove","head","snake","cover","debris","man","rake","alertness","managing"]}
