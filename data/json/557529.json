{"path":"557529.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene coastal landscape during a time of day when the sunlight reflects off the ocean, creating a shimmering effect on the water. The composition includes a sandy beach that curves gently and meets the water's edge where waves are breaking softly. This beach hosts a few people scattered across it, possibly engaging in beach activities like walking or simply enjoying the scenery.\n\nTo the right of the beach, the scene is bordered by a hill that features sparse vegetation and appears rugged and dry. A winding road closely hugs the shoreline on this hill, accentuated by a row of utility poles that follow the road's trajectory, leading the eye through the landscape. The road is empty, hinting at a tranquil or less-traveled locale.\n\nAbove the scene, the sky, although mostly obscured, appears somewhat pale, suggesting it may be early morning or late afternoon when the light is less harsh. This time of day enhances the almost silhouetted appearance of the hill and other landscape features.\n\nOverall, the image captures a peaceful and picturesque setting, typical of a secluded coastal road that offers both the natural beauty of the seaside and the gentle contours of the land.","title":"U.S. #1 near the Pacific Ocean north of Malibu, California, on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543425","547697","557509","543424","548221","553765","543287","543091","542918","557508","547483","547592","545104","543303","546953","542890"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","road","hill","hug","seaside","host","locale","time","follow","contour"]}
