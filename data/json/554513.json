{"path":"554513.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene where two individuals, likely engaged in hiking or camping, are seated by a rocky stream. The backdrop is densely wooded, featuring upright birch trees with white bark, and further back, rugged, moss-covered rocks and water cascading down, likely a small waterfall or fast river.\n\nOn the left side, a large red backpack is propped up on the rocks, indicating a break or rest from trekking. Facing towards the center, one person is seen wearing a yellow sleeping bag around their legs for warmth, which suggests cooler weather or a high-altitude environment. This individual, whose face is not visible, appears to be interacting with the other person across.\n\nThe person across, partially out of shadows and distinguished by long blonde hair, is donned in a dark jacket and focused on what seems to be a map or paper, possibly discussing or planning their route. Their involvement and direct engagement with the paper suggest a moment of preparation or reassessment of their hiking path.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a serene yet adventurous moment in a natural, rugged setting, emphasizing themes of exploration, nature, and perhaps companionship in the wilderness. The lighting is dramatic, with patches of sunlight filtering through the trees, brightening fragments of the scene and casting large portions into shadow, enhancing the intimate and secluded feel of the environment.","title":"Waterfalls at macintyre brook on the trail up algonquin mountain, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, second highest point in New York state","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554679","545516","545784","554515","551942","545780","545768","545527","554672","554507","554514","545751","549452","554501","543371","554509"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["hiking","paper","sleeping","person","birch","don","brighten","cascad","prop","intimate"]}
