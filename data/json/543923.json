{"path":"543923.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bird, possibly a seagull, in the moment it touches down on the rippling surface of a body of water. The water's surface is dyed in soft hues of purple and blue, likely due to the low light conditions of either early morning or late evening. The ripples on the water create a textured pattern that covers the frame, with the bird's landing causing small splashes and disturbances in the water's surface.\n\nThe bird is depicted in mid-motion with its wings outspread, one wing tipped downwards nearly touching the water, while the other arcs gracefully upward. Its legs are extended and reaching towards the water, suggesting the action of landing or lightly skimming the surface for fish. The bird's reflection, though slightly blurred, is visible just under its actual body, enhancing the sense of motion and interaction with the environment.\n\nThe background is minimally detailed, allowing the main focus to remain on the bird and the water. The lighting and the simplicity of the surroundings contribute to a tranquil yet dynamic scene, capturing a fleeting moment in nature.","title":"Marsh land","placename":"Galveston Bay (Tex.)","location":"Galveston Bay, Texas","nn1":["543922","548832","543918","545142","557495","543063","550388","544539","557448","553777","545991","544683","550387","547744","547593","544543"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","landing","wing","water","surface","tipp","rippling","arc","seagull","disturbance"]}
