{"path":"545819.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a barren desert landscape dominated by a weathered barbed wire fence that stretches from the foreground into the distance along the right side of the frame. The image is taken from the perspective of being next to one of the wooden fence posts, which appears prominently on the right-hand side of the image. The post is aged and weathered, showing signs of cracking and wear, and it anchors several lines of sagging barbed wire that are slightly rusted.\n\nThe desert floor is flat and covered with sparse vegetation, primarily small bushes and dry grass. The terrain is sandy and appears dry, stretching flat and uninterrupted towards the horizon. In the background, a range of low mountains can be seen under a clear blue sky. The lighting suggests that the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day, casting stark shadows and giving a vivid blue to the sky.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes a sense of solitude and the harsh, expansive environment of the desert, with the focus on the textural contrast between the rough wooden post and the arid, open landscape.","title":"Texas--near Big Bend National Park","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["545823","543774","544019","543122","545341","545843","549156","545159","544016","544401","544405","547404","545575","547522","545809","544428"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["post","desert","wire","fence","anchor","stretch","crack","bush","solitude","take"]}
