{"path":"545878.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural scene focused on a cascading waterfall surrounded by lush vegetation. Dominating the foreground are branches with clusters of elongated, light green leaves, which appear slightly translucent as they catch the sunlight. The leaves are angled in such a way that they slightly frame the view while allowing the sun to peek through, creating a striking flare effect.\n\nBeyond the leaves, the waterfall is visible, tumbling down multiple rocky tiers. The water appears white and foamy, indicating its force as it descends. Mist from the waterfall adds a soft quality to the scene, blurring the lines between the water and the air.\n\nThe surrounding area is dark, suggesting that the setting might be either in the shade of a dense forest or during a time of day when sunlight is scarce, except where it breaks through the canopy above to highlight aspects of the waterfall. Overall, the composition creates a strong contrast between the illuminated, vibrant leaves and sunbeams and the darker, more subdued tones of the rocky waterfall and shadowed forest. This landscape conveys a peaceful and secluded atmosphere, virtually untouched by human presence.","title":"Gorman falls, a clean spring water creek.
