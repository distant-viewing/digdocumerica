{"path":"549971.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a high-angle view of an urban skyline, likely captured from a high-rise building or a helicopter. The photo prominently features a dense conglomeration of buildings. These range in height and architecture, suggesting a mixture of residential and commercial zones.\n\nThe buildings in the foreground are generally shorter, with flat roofs and some having visible rooftop equipment or garden spaces. These structures have a more traditional architectural style with visible fa√ßades that likely reflect an older era of construction. The colors of these buildings are generally darker, with shades of red, brown, and beige.\n\nMoving towards the background, the buildings become progressively taller and more modern in design, possibly housing offices or high-rise apartments. These skyscrapers are characterized by their vertical linearity and use of reflective glass, with some still under construction as indicated by visible cranes.\n\nThe overall ambiance is somewhat muted under what appears to be an overcast sky. The photograph displays a limited color palette dominated by greys and earth tones, emphasizing an urban environment that feels densely packed yet orderly, reflecting the complex layers of city life.\n\nDespite the potential for bustling activity typical of such urban settings, the photograph captures a static moment where the architecture and spatial arrangement become the focal point, inviting contemplation of the interplay between space, development, and urban living.","title":"Row houses and skyscrapers in center city area","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["548424","548425","552394","552363","552395","548408","553674","553673","548417","548364","548392","549979","548374","555743","551509","545429"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["become","potential","building","helicopter","construction","architecture","rise","rooftop","apartment","housing"]}
