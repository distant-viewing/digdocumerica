{"path":"543824.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor setting overwhelmed with garbage, illustrating a large-scale littering or dumping scenario. The composition mainly includes heaps of discarded items such as cardboard boxes, plastic bags, a mattress, old tires, and miscellaneous household trash that spreads across the ground unevenly. In the scene, there are at least three people who appear to be actively throwing debris into this pile, suggesting an ongoing disposal activity.\n\nThe environment is visibly cluttered and chaotic, with a diverse array of waste materials scattered throughout. In the background, there is a strip of landscape visible under an overcast or hazy sky. Additionally, there is a plume of black smoke rising in the distance, which could indicate burning of trash or other industrial activity nearby, contributing to pollution.\n\nThe image captures a moment of dynamic action with one of the objects (a box) captured in mid-air, thrown by one of the individuals, adding a sense of movement to the otherwise static pile of waste. The overall tone of the image highlights environmental neglect and the pressing issue of waste management.","title":"Boulder County's landfill dump.
