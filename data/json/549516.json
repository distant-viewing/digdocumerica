{"path":"549516.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid and striking view of a leisurely public space. In the foreground, a focus on the lush beauty of nature is evident through clusters of vibrant red berries and pink flowers, interspersed with deep green leaves, appearing on multiple branches that frame the image.\n\nAs the view extends beyond the botanical foreground, it leads to a well-maintained grassy lawn. On this lawn, several people are scattered about, engaged in various activities which include walking and possibly conversing in small groups, contributing to a relaxed and social atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, a clear blue sky is prominent, enhancing the visibility of the urban skyline. Notable within this skyline are buildings and a distinct tower, suggesting the photograph might be set in a park within a city. The overall composition of the photograph, with its bright, natural foreground and an urban backdrop, juxtaposes natural beauty with urban development.","title":"New geology museum on the united states side of Niagara Falls just north of prospect park","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["557257","550075","550074","551767","553469","544808","551746","557262","551644","553043","550071","550302","550298","551776","546457","546259"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["lawn","skyline","converse","beauty","visibility","juxtapose","intersperse","flower","maintain","cluster"]}
