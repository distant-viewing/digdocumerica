{"path":"546977.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly woman engaged in a quilting activity while sitting on a doorstep. The woman is wearing a pink dress adorned with small, lighter pink floral patterns and puffed sleeves. On her head, she wears an intricately patterned scarf tied around her head, partially covering her eyeglasses. Her attention is directed downwards towards her work.\n\nIn her hands, she holds a large, colorful quilt comprised of various fabric patches in a multitude of colors like yellow, blue, red, and green, each patch with its own unique pattern. The quilt appears well-crafted and vivid against her pink dress.\n\nShe is sitting comfortably on a silver metal chair with slightly curved legs. The setting is rustic and outdoors, possibly a porch. The wooden door of the house is open behind her, revealing a dark interior. The exterior wall to her side is made of concrete cinder blocks, suggesting a modest, sturdy home. This wall, along with the open door, frames her as she sits under the shelter of the house's overhang.\n\nThe emotion and atmosphere of the photo convey a peaceful solitude, perhaps indicating a moment of creative personal time or a break from daily routines. The surrounding environment and her attire give a sense of warmth and homeliness.","title":"Mrs. Hunter is well-known on John's Island for the beautiful quilts she sews.","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558327","546981","558341","558336","547741","558340","547308","548561","557151","547275","547377","558323","557153","547339","558339","558343"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["quilt","dress","cinder","head","emotion","door","eyeglass","overhang","house","scarf"]}
