{"path":"554030.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases an expansive agricultural landscape. The foreground prominently displays large, neatly arranged fields with crops that exhibit a bluish-green color, suggesting dense vegetation, possibly young crops. The fields are distinctly marked by reddish-brown dirt roads that curve gently between them, creating an interesting geometric pattern.\n\nThe middle ground transitions to a more mixed-use landscape where patches of cultivated land are interspersed with areas of greenery and sporadic buildings, indicating rural habitation or farm structures. The soil in this region shows variations in color, including areas of darker and lighter earth, reflecting different land uses or crop types.\n\nThe background features a distant vista that includes gently rolling hills. The terrain here is more varied, containing both wooded areas and open fields, which contributes to a sense of depth in the photograph. Above this, the sky, occupying the upper third of the image, displays a dramatic array of clouds, hinting at weather dynamics in the region.\n\nThe overall composition of the image with its layers of land use from dense agriculture in the foreground to more mixed and natural terrain in the distance, coupled with a dynamic sky, provides a rich visual narrative of rural and agricultural life in this locale. The color palette, dominated by earth tones punctuated with greenery from the crops and the vibrant sky, adds to the serene yet lively ambiance of the rural setting.","title":"Pineapple fields. About one third of Molokai's residents are connected with pineapple production, but planting will cease in 1975. Water is a critical problem. Other crops, such as sorghum, papaya and vegetables are suggested as an alternative to pineapple.","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["554029","554027","554055","558414","549094","549181","542517","544552","553698","542708","553978","552858","552466","555641","553977","545040"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["crop","land","field","earth","region","vista","dynamic","locale","third","use"]}
