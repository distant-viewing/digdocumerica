{"path":"548942.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a large hydroelectric dam nestled between rugged, mountainous terrain. The dam is situated along a wide body of water, appearing vibrant blue against the contrasting dark, rocky hills. A series of large penstocks—massive pipes or tunnels—are visible on the slope, running downhill from the dam structure to the powerhouse. These penstocks help transport water from higher to lower elevations to generate electricity.\n\nTo the left of the dam, the water reservoir extends, surrounded by steep, barren hills that enhance the isolation and engineered prominence of the dam. The overall landscape is dry and arid with minimal vegetation, showcasing various shades of brown and dark gray in the surrounding terrain. The sky above is clear and bright, indicating a sunny day, which further sharpens the visibility of the dam’s architectural and structural details. The scene is a striking example of significant human engineering integrated into a natural landscape.","title":"Los angeles metropolitan water district aqueduct on havasu lake","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548008","548936","548975","548920","548938","548013","548007","548915","549004","548927","548930","548947","548003","548940","548024","548012"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","example","reservoir","engineer","tunnel","electricity","prominence","generate","hill","engineering"]}
