{"path":"552398.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"In the photograph, we see an elderly woman engaging in the activity of photography. She is positioned outdoors, focusing closely on capturing an image with her camera, which she holds up to her eye. The woman stands on a pathway with a background lush with green grass covered sporadically with fallen leaves, signaling a scene from either autumn or early winter.\n\nShe is dressed in a long-sleeved, plaid two-piece outfit comprising black, white, and gray colors. Her hair is styled in a short, practical manner, gray in color, complementing her mature appearance. Additionally, over her shoulder, she carries a bright red purse with a bold black pattern, which adds a pop of color to her otherwise monochrome outfit.\n\nFurther into the scenery, there are some flowering bushes with deep red flowers, adding a vibrant touch to the natural background. The setting appears serene and well-maintained, indicative of a park or a similar outdoor public space designed for quiet leisure activities.","title":"Visitor at queen victoria park, ontario, takes a picture of the canadian Niagara Falls","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["555530","547385","554051","545616","552401","547372","547281","550048","553360","557177","554270","556594","556487","551439","550079","557172"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["monochrome","flower","purse","pop","signal","photography","manner","comprise","woman","shoulder"]}
