{"path":"548121.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph shows a black dog sitting on a rustic wooden floor, tethered to a post or wall with a light-colored rope. The dog appears calm and is gazing directly at the camera. The setting is shadowy, with the background featuring a vertical wooden plank wall that displays varied tones of dark reds and browns, giving it an aged or weathered look.\n\nTo the right of the dog, a portion of the wall is not visible, possibly indicating the presence of an entrance or another structure out of frame. The lighting in the photograph accentuates the textured surfaces of the wooden flooring and the wall, while the dimly lit surroundings create a somewhat moody or somber atmosphere. The chosen angle and framing focus attention centrally on the dog, making it the main subject of the image.","title":"Columbia River dock scene","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557637","547059","543261","556421","546382","557676","543031","556549","542874","554951","552611","553481","554126","553089","554537","556171"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["dog","wall","tether","choose","flooring","framing","rope","plank","entrance","gaze"]}
