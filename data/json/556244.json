{"path":"556244.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a compelling moment among a group of people, likely at a gathering or event. In the focused foreground, a woman, sharply in view, appears emotive and perhaps in the middle of singing or speaking. She wears a white, formal uniform with a cap labeled \"MGT\", adorned with a star, possibly indicating a specific group or organization role.\n\nBlurred in the immediate background is what appears to be a man wearing a dark cap with a white emblem that includes \"FOI\", also suggesting a link to a specific group or organization. His expression is less distinguishable due to the focused depth of field centered on the woman.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed is intense and possibly spiritual or ceremonial. The lighting focuses on the woman's face, emphasizing her expression, which is earnest and possibly passionate about the event's context. The partial view of other individuals behind suggests a crowd or a gathering, adding to the sense of a shared experience, focusing on a common cause or celebration.","title":"Religious fervor is mirrored on the face of a black muslim woman, one of some 10,000 listening to elijah muhammad deliver his annual savior's day message in Chicago, the city is headquarters for the black muslims, their $75 million empire includes a mosque newspaper, university, restaurants, real estate, bank and variety of retail stores, muhammad died february 25, 1975","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["558291","556151","558401","553321","553267","554344","543482","547320","547437","551813","554345","544318","556247","558393","556241","556252"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["organization","group","gathering","woman","cap","event","emblem","star","celebration","expression"]}
