{"path":"546166.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of several wildflowers, appearing to be part of the Monarda species, commonly known as bee balm. These flowers display a vibrant purple hue with distinct, tonguelike petals protruding from a central, clustered, bulbous part, which is common to this plant variety. They have a rich floral structure that typically attracts various pollinators.\n\nThe flowers are set against a backdrop of a lush and dense meadow illuminated by what appears to be early or late day sunlight, casting a diffuse, warm glow that highlights the tips of tall grasses blurred in the background. The daylight enhances the gentle bokeh effect created by the blurred grass, adding an ethereal, soft focus to the scene surrounding the sharply focused flowers in the foreground.\n\nThe leaves of the bee balm plants are slender and lanceolate, with a slightly rugged edge, typical of many species in the mint family, to which Monarda belongs. This image captures the wild, natural growth of the plants, showing some signs of natural aging or weather effects on the petals and leaves, such as slight browning and curling edges, contributing a touch of realism to the picturesque, serene meadow setting.","title":"Plants deep in the forest have been damaged from the chemical pollution of Mill Creek.
