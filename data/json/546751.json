{"path":"546751.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene featuring a large cargo ship being assisted by two tugboats. The setting seems to be a busy commercial port or a large waterway given the distant industrial landscape featuring cranes and other marine infrastructures.\n\nThe cargo ship, named \"Chin Hwa Hai,\" is quite substantial in size, with a deep red hull and a black superstructure. It includes various deck equipment and structures, possibly related to loading and navigation. The stern of the ship displays its name and indicates that it is registered in San Francisco. \n\nThe ship appears to be moving or being maneuvered, as evidenced by the churned water around its stern and the tugboats. Two tugboats, one at the bow and one at the stern, are active in guiding and stabilizing the large vessel. These boats generate visible waves in the water due to their movement.\n\nThe photograph's background shows a gray, overcast sky which spreads a soft, diffused light over the scene, muting the colors slightly. This atmospheric condition contributes to a somewhat industrial or utilitarian feel of the photograph. The distant shoreline shows industrial structures, likely part of a port facility, with multiple cargo handling cranes visible.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a dynamic, industrially-influenced maritime operation, showcasing coordination between sea vessels in a commercial port setting.","title":"Towing the tanker \"chevron Hawaii\" to its berth in Baltimore harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546909","546845","550896","551990","546919","550906","550892","546832","555270","546834","549892","548127","546828","545830","545845","550894"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","tugboat","stern","port","cargo","vessel","crane","name","mut","coordination"]}
