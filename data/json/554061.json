{"path":"554061.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene onboard the \"Duke Kaekamahia\" train. The focus is on a woman sitting in the train, facing away from the camera, engaging in photography. She is holding a small rectangular camera with both hands up to her face, appearing to take a picture of something off to her side. She has light-colored hair, partially tied back, and wears what appears to be a tank top.\n\nThe train, painted in vibrant red with bold yellow text spelling \"DUKE KAEKAMAHIA,\" adds a vintage charm to the setting. The windows of the train are open to the outdoors. The surrounding environment, visible through these windows and beyond the train, appears to be rural, possibly a wide field or an agricultural landscape, enhancing the feel of a leisurely excursion.\n\nThe interior of the train carriage is visible with its simple yet functional design, emphasizing the red and white color scheme with wooden panels and metal frames around the windows. The lighting in the image, possibly indicating a time either in late afternoon or nearing sunset, casts soft shadows and a warm tone over the scene, contributing to a serene and nostalgic atmosphere. This composition not only captures a moment of leisure but also contradicts the motion of travel with the stillness of the photography act.","title":"Former sugarcane train is now used for tourists near Lahina.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["556117","555977","556094","555971","556118","556062","555975","556061","555998","555974","556033","556857","556834","556080","556671","556095"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","photography","near","window","excursion","carriage","camera","scheme","act","face"]}
