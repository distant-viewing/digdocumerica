{"path":"545954.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor setting dominated by large trees draped in Spanish moss. In the foreground, there is a pathway made of rectangular, evenly placed concrete slabs set in the dirt, leading to or from the viewer's perspective. Dividing the rough ground and the pathway is a scattering of white rocks, possibly for landscaping.\n\nCentered in the composition is a clothesline strung between two trees. The clothesline holds several large, burlap-like brown sacks that hang loosely. Their placement and sagging forms give a casual, almost desolate feel to the scene, as if the sacks were left hanging in quiet resignation.\n\nThe background hints at a wider landscape with wide fields and sparse tree cover. Near the horizon, another tree somewhat similar in stature to the ones in the foreground is visible. The sky is overcast, casting an even, soft light that mutes the colors and adds to the somber, tranquil ambiance of the setting.\n\nThis photogenic setting, with its elements of rural life and nature subtly intertwined, evokes a sense of quietude and simplicity, reminiscent of a bygone era.","title":"Burlap sacks used for carrying oysters hang on line to dry.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["547522","548672","552541","547649","551091","546332","543198","548756","552515","546985","558101","551100","556491","557013","556541","547654"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["clothesline","sack","pathway","hang","slab","scattering","string","quietude","mute","landscaping"]}
