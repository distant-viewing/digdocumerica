{"path":"544791.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph presents a cityscape viewed from a distant vantage point, with a large mountain looming behind the urban area. The city skyline is somewhat obscured by what appears to be haze or smog, contributing to a muted color palette dominated by blues and grays.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there are industrial or possibly educational buildings, which have flat roofs and are quite utilitarian in design. These are just a small part of the overall landscape that stretches into a dense collection of various other buildings forming the city's downtown, identifiable by the multiple tall skyscrapers that stand out against the lighter colored backdrop.\n\nThe background features a large mountain, its slopes gently sloping down towards the city. The top of the mountain is bare, likely above the treeline, giving it a stark, barren look in contrast to the bustling city before it.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph feels slightly somber due to the dim lighting and the haze, which might suggest air pollution or simply an overcast day. The composition skillfully contrasts human-made structures with the natural grandeur of the mountain, encapsulating the interaction between an urban environment and its surrounding natural landscape.","title":"Smog blankets Salt Lake City","placename":"Utah","location":"Utah","nn1":["544783","552186","544073","553728","542674","542683","548365","548384","551141","548385","545499","542673","549970","552394","550190","548334"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","mountain","haze","slope","smog","treeline","loom","downtown","skyscraper","grandeur"]}
