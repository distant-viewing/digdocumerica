{"path":"544400.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a sweeping landscape, dominated by a vast, arid expanse under a bright blue sky speckled with clouds. In the foreground, rugged, rocky terrain is sparsely dotted with small green shrubs and patches of dry grass, indicative of a desert environment. The ground is uneven, covered with numerous stones and boulders of varying sizes, creating a rough and textured surface.\n\nIn the middle distance, there is a noticeable shift in the landscape. Here, a town or small city appears, marked by a cluster of white and light-colored buildings that contrast starkly with the natural, reddish tones of the desert. This human settlement is quite extensive and spreads horizontally across the landscape, hinting at a possibly bustling community nestled in a remote, harsh environment.\n\nBeyond the town, the terrain opens up to reveal more of the desert landscape, which gently rolls into the distant horizon where low hills or mesas form a silhouette against the sky. The vastness and the emptiness of the area beyond the settlement emphasize the isolation and unique placement of the town within this rugged environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its vast open skies and expansive views, highlights the dramatic and harsh beauty of the desert and the adaptability of human settlements in such challenging environments.","title":"Arizona","placename":"Arizona","location":"Arizona","nn1":["544024","544016","544027","544429","545771","545790","545575","545809","549132","545789","549016","549183","544034","544401","545895","552923"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["desert","settlement","town","emptiness","mesa","placement","speckle","shift","boulder","rug"]}
