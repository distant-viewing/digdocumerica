{"path":"554001.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph showcases a wooden sign with the words “KAPU NO TRESPASSING” painted in black on a plain, weathered wooden background. The word “KAPU” is above “NO TRESPASSING,” indicating a warning in both Hawaiian and English, with \"Kapu\" roughly translating to \"forbidden\" or \"sacred\" in Hawaiian culture. The sign is mounted on a post that appears to be made of rough, dark wood, likely a tree trunk, visible on the left side of the image.\n\nThe background is slightly out of focus and features lush green foliage, indicating that the sign is likely situated in a tropical or semi-tropical environment. The lighting suggests it might be shot during the day under natural sunlight, casting soft shadows on the sign, which add depth to the texture of the wood. The overall color tone is warm, possibly due to the film or filter used when taking the photograph. The presence of the sign suggests it might be placed at the entrance of a private or protected area, common in places like Hawaii where certain locations are considered sacred or private.","title":"\"Kapu\" (keep out)--a familiar sign on this island, most of which is owned by a single pineapple-producing company","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["554103","548846","554060","553956","548836","548845","547123","554168","554119","545248","557441","554038","548063","543168","548670","546386"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["trespassing","sign","word","wood","consider","shoot","warning","black","place","culture"]}
