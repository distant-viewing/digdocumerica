{"path":"557175.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph captures a candid scene of three elderly women engaged in a conversation while sitting outdoors. Here's a detailed description:\n\n1. **People**: There are three elderly women seated on what looks like either benches or chairs. The woman on the far left is wearing a dark blue blazer over a patterned blouse with a white collar, and gingham-checked pants. She holds a pair of sunglasses and a small purse in her lap while leaning forward, resting her chin on her hand, and appears to be listening intently. The middle woman wears a muted green cardigan over a darker dress and a white head scarf tied under her chin. The woman on the right is dressed in a pale blue and white outfit with a golden chain and a white headscarf, also tied under the chin. She holds a small paper plate.\n\n2. **Activities**: The three women are engaged in a social interaction, possibly sharing a meal or attending a gathering, given the paper plate in one womanâ€™s hand. They are attentively involved in a conversation, suggesting a moment of shared communication or a social event.\n\n3. **Background**: Behind them, there is a grassy area with scattered leaves, indicating it's either autumn or fall. We can also see cars parked in the distance, suggesting the setting could be near a public park or a community area.\n\n4. **Composition**: The image is taken during daylight, with natural lighting that casts soft shadows on the subjects. The depth of field focuses on the women, with the background slightly blurred, making the subjects the clear focal point of the photo.\n\nThe overall impression is that of a leisurely, intimate moment among friends or acquaintances, enjoying each other's company in an outdoor setting.","title":"Woman seated at old school desks on the lawn take a break during an auction by eating pie served by ladies of White Cloud Kansas, near Troy.
