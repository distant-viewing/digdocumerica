{"path":"543714.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban landscape peppered with multiple elements of urban development and infrastructure, showcasing the contrast between nature and urbanization.\n\nForeground:\n- The image is dominated in the foreground by sloping green-brown grassy hills, suggesting either undeveloped land or the borders of a highway.\n- There are utility poles prominently lined up, creating a staggering line that moves from the front to the back of the scene, festooned with multiple wires.\n\nMiddle ground:\n- Several commercial signs are visible, including billboard advertisements and road signs. Notably, there is a directional sign for \"North Valley Shopping Center\" and various billboards that include an advertisement for \"Standard 84th Ave Ex.\"\n- Structures such as a motel and some small commercial buildings (including one with the name “AMCO” visible) populate the area. This indicates a suburban blend of commercial and possibly light industrial establishments.\n- A highway runs through the middle ground, with a few cars visible, depicting everyday traffic motion.\n\nBackground:\n- Beyond the immediate urban sprawl, there are more industrial or commercial buildings. The size and density of these suggest a major urban area.\n- A silhouette of a city's downtown skyline can be discerned in the distant haze, featuring several tall buildings that fade into the atmospheric perspective. This indicates pollution or fog, a common element in many urban landscapes.\n\nOverall Composition:\n- The photograph has a somewhat overcast sky, contributing to a muted color palette dominated by greens, browns, grays, and the metallic hues of cars and structures.\n- Given the mix of commercial signage, utility infrastructure, and the visible highway, the image captures the essence of suburban or semi-urban sprawl on the periphery of a major city, emphasizing themes such as development, transportation, and commerce.","title":"Billboards and power lines clutter landscape","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["550153","549523","550018","550143","545382","557340","549638","543106","557341","553936","555630","550556","550167","553130","549224","556951"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","billboard","sprawl","advertisement","urbanization","utility","themes","motel","pepper","development"]}
