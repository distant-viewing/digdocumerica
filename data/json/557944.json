{"path":"557944.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures an old steam locomotive housed under a wooden shelter that appears rustic and somewhat decrepit. The locomotive, positioned on the left side of the frame, is predominantly black and shows signs of age and deterioration. Its surface is rusted, and some elements look like they might be missing or incomplete. The train is supported by stands and blocks, suggesting it is not operational and possibly under restoration or simply in storage.\n\nThe shelter itself has wooden beams and rafters, and the roof is made of metal sheets, some of which are rusty and covered with debris, indicating longstanding neglect. The floors around the locomotive are cluttered with wooden planks, beams, logs, and other miscellaneous items scattered in an unorganized manner.\n\nIn the background, through the gaps in the shelter, a natural, bright daytime setting is vaguely visible, contrasting with the dim, shaded environment inside the shelter. This outdoor glimpse offers a hint of greenery and open space, suggesting the shelter's location is somewhat remote or rural.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a sense of historical significance, abandonment, and the passage of time, with the locomotive serving as a relic from a bygone era.","title":"Steam boiler and engine at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Akron, Ohio.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["556022","542897","557956","556058","547656","556782","557963","556857","557965","554353","549131","552997","557967","545541","554561","554834"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["shelter","locomotive","beam","restoration","deterioration","gap","sheet","stand","significance","manner"]}
