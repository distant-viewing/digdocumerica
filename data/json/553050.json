{"path":"553050.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of a large-scale, terraced landscape, possibly a mining or quarry site. The terraces are arranged in consecutive, multi-layered rows that form a curved pattern along a hillside. Each terrace appears heavily textured, possibly indicating exposed earth or mined material. The photograph shows the terraces in varying shades of dark gray and green, suggesting the presence of vegetation in certain areas, which could indicate some degree of reclamation or natural growth on the less disturbed sections.\n\nIn the background, there is a road running parallel to a river or canal, which curves around the mining site. The road appears quite narrow and is bordered by areas of dense, dark green vegetation on the outer side, contrasting sharply with the stark, terraced landscape. The overall scene is devoid of visible human activity or structures, emphasizing the industrial and largely uninhabited nature of the area.\n\nThe image evokes a sense of the extensive alteration of natural landscapes due to industrial activities, highlighting both the scale of human impact and the isolation of such sites from populated areas.","title":"Aerial of Peabody strip coal mining operation.
