{"path":"545212.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a man standing in a shallow, rocky riverbed. He is actively engaged in the process of casting a large, circular fishing net into the flowing water. The man is dressed in rolled-up dark pants and a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt. The backdrop features rushing water over dark, jagged rocks, indicating a fast-moving stream or river. The scene is illuminated by bright sunlight, highlighting the motion of the water and the white spray generated by the turbulence. The focus and sharpness on the man and the net suggest the action and skill involved in his fishing technique, a combination of tradition and mastery over his natural surroundings.","title":"Netting for smelts on the Oregon coast","placename":"Yachats (Or.)","location":"Yachats, Oregon","nn1":["553332","550317","554519","550047","552271","553953","553339","551408","554520","553337","543076","543033","551394","545386","545085","545306"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","fishing","turbulence","sharpness","tradition","skill","riverbed","technique","spray","man"]}
