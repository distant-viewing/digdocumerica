{"path":"550260.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of considerable devastation likely resulting from a building collapse or demolition. The foreground is filled with a large heap of rubble consisting of broken bricks, tiles, wooden planks, and ornamental architectural debris. This debris is scattered and piled in an unorganized manner, suggesting a recent collapse.\n\nThe background features the remains of a structure, most prominently part of a roof and what appears to be the upper part of a building's fa√ßade. The roof is severely damaged with missing tiles and exposed wooden rafters. An arched window, still partially intact with its frame and some glass remaining, is visible. This arch is flanked by decorative stonework and elements like finials which add to the Gothic or classical style of architecture, indicating the original building was quite ornate.\n\nThe overall condition and style visible in the remains suggest the building may have been a church or a building of significant architectural importance. There is no presence of people or active work in the photograph, which contributes to a still and somber mood. The photograph captures the aftermath of structural destruction, highlighting themes of loss and the passing of time.","title":"Pennsylvania Railroad passenger station, built in 1902 unused since 1965, finally collapsed in 1973 as a freight train passed by.
