{"path":"544837.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a striking natural landscape dominated by a tall, imposing rock formation which rises prominently above a snow-covered mountain slope. This geological feature, known as a butte, towers majestically with its almost vertical walls and a flat top, standing out sharply against a blue sky with minimal cloud cover.\n\nIn the foreground, a dense thicket of leafless, slender trees, possibly aspens or birches, occupies the lower part of the image. These trees with their fine branches devoid of foliage suggest it might be late fall or winter. The tree branches create a natural frame, partially obscuring but also leading the viewer's eye towards the butte.\n\nThe landscape is bathed in bright sunlight, highlighting the white, snow-covered mountain areas and the rocky surfaces of the butte with its crevices and ledges. The entire scene is set against a backdrop of evergreen forests on the lower slopes and a clear sky, conveying a serene and peaceful winter environment, typical of mountainous terrain in a cold climate. The natural beauty and ruggedness of the area are captured vividly in this photo, suggesting a remote or wilderness area.","title":"Chimney Rock","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["544363","555657","545775","545696","544429","550502","555573","555681","545804","544392","543376","555656","550408","550412","544341","544874"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["butte","winter","snow","slope","birch","thicket","branch","crevice","ledge","cover"]}
