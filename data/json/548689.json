{"path":"548689.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts a small boat floating in water, linked by ropes to a rustic dock. The boat has a primarily white body with a distinct green trim around its perimeter. The interior of the boat shows some details such as a wooden plank that serves possibly as a bench or a supporting structure.\n\nSurrounding the boat is the dark, still water which clearly reflects both the boat and the underside of the dock. The dock itself appears old and weathered, constructed of wooden planks with visible wear and tear, adding a texture-rich detail to the image.\n\nLight and shadows play across the scene, highlighting the bright, sunlit areas and cast shadows within the boat and beneath the dock. The reflection in the water adds a sense of calmness and depth to the image, enhancing its serene maritime atmosphere.","title":"Fisherman's dory at dock in downtown Key West","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["549374","550780","551312","544567","557255","548247","548235","551258","547276","551313","547953","547556","543888","544266","544181","551981"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","dock","plank","tear","underside","perimeter","calmness","trim","detail","rope"]}
