{"path":"548648.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph displays a close view of an architectural detail of a building, capturing a part of the façade with a distinct, modern aesthetic. The image shows a large diagonal section of the building that is clad in numerous small, reflective, metallic tiles forming a uniform texture. \n\nThe tiles appear diamond-shaped and are arranged in a tight, repetitive pattern that covers the entire visible surface of the building, lending it a sleek and textured appearance. The edge of the building curves inward slightly, enhancing the geometric effect. The architectural design emphasizes clean, sharp lines and a minimalist approach, which is typical for contemporary architecture.\n\nThe background is a homogenous, clear sky in a light blue color, providing a stark contrast to the darker, metallic surface of the building. This contrast highlights the building's surface and form. The lighting and clarity of the sky suggests the photograph was taken on a day with good weather, likely under bright, sunny conditions that enhance the reflectivity and metallic quality of the tiles.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the interplay of geometry, light, and texture, presenting a part of the building as a significant and striking example of modern architectural elements.","title":"Detail of an old bahama style residence.
