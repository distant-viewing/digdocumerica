{"path":"556903.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures two men engaged in laborious work at an outdoor industrial setting. The man in the foreground is wearing a hard hat, a long-sleeve shirt, and jeans. He is handling some heavy equipment, possibly cables or drilling tools, and is looking slightly towards the camera with a focused expression. The equipment includes visible hooks and metal parts, which suggest they might be used for lifting or securing. This man appears to be preparing or adjusting the tool in front of a rugged terrain covered with gravel and pieces of wood.\n\nIn the background, another man, also in a hard hat, is partially visible. He is standing on the machinery, suggesting they might be working on drilling or extracting something from the ground. There's a sizeable orange-and-brown rig or heavy machinery that dominates the setting, with visible hydraulic components and metal frameworks.\n\nThe entire scene is set in a natural environment that looks somewhat overcast, with trees and grass visible in the distance, but no distinct structures or other elements indicate this as a remote or rural area focused on industrial operations. The overall mood conveys a sense of hard work in a tough and possibly hazardous environment.","title":"Southern railway right-of-way worker and machinery.
