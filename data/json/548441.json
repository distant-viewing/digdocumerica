{"path":"548441.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a suburban street scene, likely from the 1970s, showing a group of people engaged in different activities. The setting features two old-fashioned, wooden-framed houses with distinct architectural details such as ornate, dark-trimmed windows and doors, and aged paintwork revealing some peeling. \n\nOn the left side of the image, four individuals (two who appear to be young men and two young women) are gathered on the stoop of a house. One of the young men is sitting with his chin rested on his hands, looking thoughtfully into the distance. Next to him, a young woman in a colorful blouse leans against the railing, seemingly in conversation with a man standing beside her. The other woman sitting on the steps seems engaged in an animated discussion with a man who is standing nearby, holding what looks like a drink.\n\nIn the foreground, two children and an adult are engaging in a playful activity. The adult, dressed in a red shirt and black pants, stands near the edge of one house, watching a young boy in a white shirt and black pants intent on tossing a red balloon towards a girl walking towards him. The girl, facing away from the camera, wears a short-sleeved white top and a skirt with a red and orange pattern. \n\nThe environment suggests a quiet, residential area with cement sidewalks and without much visible greenery or traffic, contributing to a peaceful, community-oriented atmosphere. The overall mood is casual and leisurely, highlighting an everyday moment in a neighborhood setting.","title":"Southwest side of neptune road","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["549296","555905","547946","552761","551084","557428","557641","547433","556170","545397","557840","557290","545350","557365","557408","556169"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["girl","house","stoop","cement","adult","woman","intent","peeling","balloon","man"]}
