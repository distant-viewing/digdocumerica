{"path":"545709.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of a flowering cactus in a desert environment. The main focus of the image is a cluster of cactus pads, prominently covered in sharp spines. One of the cactus pads features a large, blooming flower, which is light yellow in color and appears quite delicate in contrast to the rugged spines of the cactus. \n\nThe background shows layered rock formations typical of a canyon or desert landscape, suggesting an arid, rocky terrain with minimal vegetation. The rock formations are eroded and stratified, indicative of geological processes at work, possibly shaped by wind and water over millennia. The sky is visible at the top of the frame and seems slightly overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the scene, enhancing colors and details of the cactus and rocky background. \n\nThe composition of the photograph uses a shallow depth of field, with the cactus sharply in focus against a somewhat blurred backdrop of the rock formations. This emphasizes the texture and details of the cactus while providing a sense of the expansive and rugged environment in which it lives. The perspective chosen by the photographer brings the viewer into an intimate proximity with the cactus, making the desert flora the clear subject of the image.","title":"Prickly pear cactus grows in the maze","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544582","554844","545727","544891","544885","544877","555370","544879","545712","545722","545309","555367","555886","545718","544894","544875"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["cactus","spine","pad","desert","formation","rock","choose","millennium","flower","photographer"]}
