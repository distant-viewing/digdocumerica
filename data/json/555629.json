{"path":"555629.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph portrays a rural or possibly industrial landscape viewed from a high vantage point between two large, dark silhouetted tree trunks with branches that are bare and twisted, framing the scene. The environment is predominantly overcast, contributing to a gloomy, moody atmosphere.\n\nIn the middle ground, there's a significant amount of earthwork visible, suggesting recent excavation or construction. Large mounds of reddish-brown soil or clay are piled up, with some tire tracks seen crisscrossing the surface, indicating the recent presence of heavy machinery.\n\nBeyond the immediate excavation site, the landscape gently slopes downwards where a small cluster of white buildings with red roofs is nestled among patches of greenery. This could be a small farm or rural community. The arrangement and isolation of the buildings give a peaceful yet isolated feeling in contrast to the disturbed foreground.\n\nIn the distant background, layers of hazy blue hills rise under the overcast sky, giving a sense of depth and extending the scale of the view. This mix of natural landscape with elements of human intervention highlights a tension between environmental and industrial activities.","title":"Strip mined land meets farmland near the intersection of route #800 and interstate 70 near Morristown, Ohio","placename":"Morristown (Belmont County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["554807","558107","554803","543668","554811","545534","554804","549255","555588","555542","555537","555609","544131","554763","545042","545993"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["excavation","clay","tension","intervention","crisscross","tire","mound","amount","vantage","farm"]}
