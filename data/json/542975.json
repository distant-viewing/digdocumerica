{"path":"542975.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of industrial decay, most likely in a lumber or wood processing facility. At the center and extending towards the background, there are multiple large conical structures that suggest wood chip burners or silos, commonly used in lumber mills. These structures are old and weathered, with visible damage and corrosion. Smoke, possibly from active work or controlled burning, billows in the background, adding a hazy atmosphere to the scene.\n\nThe foreground of the image is strewn with debris and discarded items, indicating neglect or recent industrial activity. Prominent in the foreground is a rusted and discarded metal object, resembling part of a large pipe or machinery. There are puddles of water scattered across the ground, reflecting the sky and contributing to a sense of abandonment and decay.\n\nOverall, the scene is desolate, with no visible human presence or active machinery. The landscape around the industrial site is barren, with only a few sparse trees and a lot of open, muddy ground. The sky is cloudy, suggesting an overcast or stormy day, which adds to the gloomy and forlorn mood of the photograph.","title":"Low tide with wood burner in background","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["544958","550343","547470","556351","556324","557220","546084","557214","543258","546236","550350","555544","545998","550328","545992","555617"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["lumber","discard","burner","decay","corrosion","burning","wood","machinery","chip","puddle"]}
