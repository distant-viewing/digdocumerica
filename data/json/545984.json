{"path":"545984.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures three men sitting at a round table in a room with a distinctly rustic and casual atmosphere. The location appears to be a small, informal dining area, possibly a local caf√© or diner.\n\nOn the left, the first man is seated partly in shadow, gazing directly into the camera with a somewhat serious expression. He has thick, dark hair and a mustache, and he's wearing a light blue collared shirt with a dark vest and light-colored pants. His hands are not visible, suggesting a relaxed or laid-back posture.\n\nThe man in the center is older than the first, with visibly receding, darker hair, and prominent facial lines indicating age. He looks off to the side, seemingly unaware or indifferent to the camera's presence. He's dressed in a practical short-sleeved blue shirt with a white undershirt visible at the neckline, paired with dark trousers. He maintains a stoic expression and an upright seated posture.\n\nThe third man, sitting on the right, has a relaxed posture, leaning back slightly in his chair with one arm resting on the back. He has rugged features, tousled hair, and is dressed in a dark blue sweater over a light shirt and dark pants. His gaze is off to the side, suggesting he is engaged in thought or a conversation outside the frame.\n\nThe table hosts a few items indicating recent or ongoing meal consumption. This includes containers that likely hold condiments, a few glasses, and an ashtray, hinting at the casual dining norms of the setting. Visible in the background are brightly painted walls, partly covered with ceramic tiles, and a white refrigerator, adding to the informal, homely feel of the setting. A simple clock hangs on the wall, and natural light filters through a door or window, casting gentle illumination across the room.\n\nOverall, the scene depicted has an air of unpretense and ordinariness, evoking a sense of everyday life and casual interaction among the subjects.","title":"Mr. Tillman Matherne, a fisherman, his friend John Smith, and his son-in-law relax in the kitchen.","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["557152","545970","553122","557856","545974","554866","553167","545986","552621","557353","543041","547407","551834","555247","554896","557038"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["dining","posture","hair","room","table","condiment","neckline","refrigerator","consumption","diner"]}
