{"path":"555327.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a large, uniquely structured solar energy collector. The main body of the collector consists of what appears to be a large array of reflective panels organized in a grid formation, angled towards the sky to maximize exposure to the sun. These panels are mounted on a robust frame that allows them to maintain this optimal angle.\n\nThe structure is elevated above the ground on a sturdy, white-painted support structure, which includes multiple legs and cross beams, giving it stability and height. The elevation likely facilitates better sun exposure and may also house equipment or mechanisms related to the operation and movement of the collector.\n\nThere are no people visible in the photograph, suggesting either an automated operation or that it was taken during a period of no direct human interaction. The background shows a clear blue sky with minimal cloud cover, ideal for solar collection, along with some sparse vegetation and flat terrain typical of a remote or rural installation.\n\nThe sunlight interacts with the surfaces in the photograph, causing some glare and reflections, especially noticeable on the solar panels, where there is a visible sun flare effect captured by the camera.\n\nOverall, this image showcases a technological installation likely used for renewable energy purposes, emphasizing the structured, functional design and isolated setting.","title":"This parabolic mirror system is part of the solar furnace operated for the u.s.
