{"path":"545909.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rogers, Chuck","caption":"The photograph provides a view of a riverscape under gloomy, overcast conditions. It shows a barge on a river, moving towards the foreground, creating a distinct wake pattern as it moves through the water. The viewpoint is elevated, looking down upon the river.\n\nIn the background, there's a cityscape featuring several buildings, including a tall, dark skyscraper which is the most prominent structure. Beneath this, parts of a bridge are visible; likely a truss bridge given the triangular framework. The weather is foggy or misty, casting a grayish-blue tint over the entire scene, and the atmosphere appears quite dense, slightly obscuring the buildings and diminishing their details.\n\nThe lighting is quite dim, suggesting either early morning or late evening, enhancing the muted tones of the environment and the overall moody aesthetic of the setting. There are no visible people or specific activities apart from the movement of the barge on the river. The composition is a mix of industrial and natural elements, emphasizing a serene yet somewhat melancholic vibe.","title":"Photograph of the Ohio river","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555807","557309","550900","557235","544271","550951","550964","550965","551148","550952","556481","549303","549814","553826","546830","551954"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["barge","riverscape","river","bridge","diminish","grayish","foggy","truss","move","tint"]}
