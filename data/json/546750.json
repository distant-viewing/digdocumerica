{"path":"546750.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures two men engaged in an outdoor activity beside a small stream. The stream, filled with clear water, is lined with rocks and surrounded by a mix of dry and leafy vegetation suggesting a perhaps autumnal or wintry scene.\n\nOne man is bent over, reaching into what appears to be a metal culvert or a similar cylindrical object that is partially submerged at the edge of the stream. He wears a dark blue jacket, jeans, and is focusing intently on his task, which might involve extracting or examining something inside the culvert.\n\nThe other man, standing and facing the camera, seems to be stabilizing a large branch or a piece of timber, potentially to use as a tool or lever. He is dressed in a dark brown jacket and jeans, and has curly dark hair. His expression and posture suggest involvement and aid in the ongoing activity.\n\nThe setting is a natural, outdoor area with leaf-littered ground and a scattering of small trees and shrubs, indicating a somewhat wild or rural locale. The lighting, slightly dim and natural, enhances the rustic and unpolished feel of the environment.","title":"Preston S. Sleeger and Don R.
