{"path":"548339.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph presents a captivating cityscape, likely taken during the dawn or dusk, as indicated by the subdued lighting and hazy atmosphere. The scene centers on a vast urban skyline dominated by densely packed high-rise buildings. Prominently visible in this skyline is a towering skyscraper with a distinctive spire, which is possibly an iconic landmark. \n\nIn the foreground, a large bridge spans across a river, connecting different parts of the city. The bridge, with its robust pillars and network of cables, adds an industrial charm to the otherwise metropolitan view. Below the bridge and alongside the river's edge, there are docks with a few small boats moored and some cranes suggesting ongoing maritime activities.\n\nThe river itself is calm, reflecting slight glimmers of light that manage to pierce through the soft mist enveloping the city. On the far bank of the river, more buildings line up, contributing to the layered depth of the cityscape.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is somewhat serene yet somber, with a palette that consists mainly of muted purples and bluesâ€”colors that emphasize the early morning or late evening setting. There's a poetic stillness to the scene, highlighting a vast urban environment momentarily paused. The haze not only dims visibility but also adds a sense of mystery and quietude to the bustling city life, momentarily hidden beneath this tranquil veneer.","title":"Lower Manhattan skyline and Brooklyn bridge on the east river","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545499","548384","548365","555716","548383","548317","550186","551141","548416","548328","548385","548334","548337","549970","548381","545406"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","river","city","cityscape","skyline","glimmer","captivating","pierce","pillar","centers"]}
