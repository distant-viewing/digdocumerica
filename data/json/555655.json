{"path":"555655.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a panoramic view of a rugged, natural landscape. It features a majestic, snow-capped mountain in the background that dominates the scene. This mountain, likely a volcano given its prominent, conical peak, is further emphasized by lighter, smaller mountain ranges spreading across the horizon. In front of these mountains stretches a vast, dense forest comprised of countless evergreen trees that cover the entire midground.\n\nThe foreground is framed by several taller evergreen trees, likely spruces, which provide a sense of depth and scale compared to the expansive wilderness behind them. Below, slightly visible through the tree line, is a wide river that meanders from the left to the right of the frame. Its silty, perhaps glacial-fed waters contrast with the natural greens and earth tones of the landscape.\n\nThis scene lacks any human presence or man-made structures, highlighting the untamed and serene quality of the natural environment. The photograph, likely taken during the day given the bright lighting and clear skies, captures the pristine and tranquil atmosphere of a remote, wild location.","title":"Mount Drum and the Copper River, looking east to the Wrangell Mountains.
