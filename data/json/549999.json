{"path":"549999.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor urban scene centered around a large, open plaza. The plaza has a distinctive red surface and is dominated by geometric patterns and lines. There are various groups of people scattered across the space, some of whom are walking and others gathered in small groups. Specifically, on the bottom right, a queue of people near a rectangular structure appears to be waiting for some activity or event.\n\nAlong the perimeter of the plaza, there are several prominent buildings with a brutalist architectural style, featuring strong, block-like structures and large, recessed windows. These buildings lend a stark, powerful look to the scene.\n\nThe surrounding area includes additional structures that vary in design, including a building with a curved facade to the left and more traditional looking buildings in the background. The background also reveals a cityscape with numerous other buildings and what appears to be a pointed structure in the far distance, possibly a tower or spire.\n\nThe skyline is bright and clear, suggesting the photo was taken on a sunny day, which is reflected by the shadows cast on the plaza and the bright areas where sunlight hits directly. There are also decorative elements, like spherical lamps spaced evenly across parts of the plaza, adding to the urban design of the space.","title":"City hall plaza","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["557267","550759","550003","553324","553162","551651","550751","551662","551653","549988","550755","551656","551493","551636","553313","550076"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["plaza","space","recess","reflecte","building","hit","perimeter","spire","group","lamp"]}
