{"path":"553128.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph shows a wildfire burning through a landscape. The foreground prominently displays active flames consuming vegetation, possibly a grassland or shrubland. Thick smoke rises and blankets the scene, obscuring much of the background and giving the image a hazy atmosphere. The colors in the fire range from bright orange to deep red, highlighting the intensity of the blaze. The smoke has a dull gray to blue color, contrasting with the fiery foreground. There are no visible structures or people in the image, which focuses solely on the natural elements of fire and smoke in a wild setting. The overall mood is one of a stark and dramatic natural event, capturing the destructive power of wildfire.","title":"Brush fire along Route I-80","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["548591","548597","555156","553843","547728","555157","548592","548590","548595","542712","548853","553560","557577","553561","548593","555113"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["wildfire","smoke","fire","flame","grassland","intensity","gray","orange","power","range"]}
