{"path":"555864.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a landscape that appears arid and flat, interspersed with various water bodies and a straight road or highway stretching across the frame. A series of majestic, snow-capped mountains forms the distant backdrop, adding grandeur to the scene. The foreground features several large, irregularly shaped water bodies, some of which reflect the sunlight, creating bright, white areas that contrast with the darker waters. Surrounding these water bodies are patches of lighter-colored land, which might be salt deposits or dry, barren soil. The straight road divides the landscape and runs directly towards the mountains, flanked on both sides by more vegetation or marshy areas compared to other parts of the image. The overall topography is relatively flat, allowing for an expansive view that stretches to the mountains in the horizon. The clear sky above contributes to the visibility and the colors in the image range from earthy tones to the blues and whites of the water and snow.","title":"Aerial view of the pond when cleanup operations were half finished. The white areas are alkaline, and the Southern Pacific Railroad track is shown. EPA supervised cleanup of the pond to prevent possible contamination of nearby Great Salt Lake and a wildlife refuge. Some 1,200,000 gallons of liquid was treated and trucked away.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["555845","555863","555861","550598","552902","543761","555865","555683","544774","557533","555669","548974","550397","550402","550615","556936"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","snow","water","salt","deposit","body","topography","road","grandeur","white"]}
