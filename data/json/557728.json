{"path":"557728.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction site in a rural or semi-rural area. The central focus of the image is the construction of a building. A wooden frame for what appears to be the roof or upper part of a structure is in an advanced state of being constructed. There are several wooden beams and scaffolding supporting the frame. The lower part of the building features a concrete or cinder block foundation that is partly visible. A person, possibly a construction worker, is standing near the structure, engaged in the construction process.\n\nThe construction site is surrounded by an expansive muddy field with patches of grass and shallow depressions filled with water, indicating either recent rain or an ongoing excavation related to the construction. In the foreground, muddy tracks and puddles reflect recent activity and vehicle movements around the site.\n\nIn the background, the landscape consists of rolling hills and trees, suggesting a serene, natural environment. To the left, there is a large building with a red roof, possibly a farm or another residential structure, that blends with the rural surroundings. The skies are partly cloudy, hinting at possible recent weather changes that could have contributed to the muddy conditions on the ground. The overall scene captures a moment of rural development, combining elements of nature and human activity.","title":"Construction of the first unit of a new alpine village outside of Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553703","553702","549166","550737","556619","557730","556940","543583","547858","550273","546988","547829","547833","555583","553922","553353"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","cinder","depression","foundation","scaffolding","puddle","roof","rain","block"]}
