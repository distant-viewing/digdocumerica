{"path":"554232.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts a winter scene where a structure, partially obscured by tall, thin trees, sits nestled in a snowy landscape. The building appears to be a large residential house, featuring two visible stories and made of materials that give it an orange-brown hue, blending somewhat with the surrounding dormant vegetation.\n\nThe trees in the foreground are leafless but densely packed, likely deciduous, and some branches carry small amounts of snow, suggesting recent snowfall. These trees are thin with smooth, pale bark, which, along with their density, creates a semi-transparent curtain through which the house peeks. The snow on the ground appears smooth and untouched, blanketing the area uniformly and contributing to the serene, isolated ambience of the setting.\n\nThe house itself has large windows, some of which are visible through the trees, and the roof also shows accumulation of snow, enhancing the wintry feel of the scene. Overall, the composition of the photograph, with its natural framing of the house by the trees and the soft light, evokes a sense of quiet and seclusion, typical of winter in wooded areas.","title":"This private home on snowmass mountain is just 75 yards from a ski lift","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554233","556645","556644","553458","557326","554822","552986","558110","543526","556426","557193","557669","555632","556472","550311","545041"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","snow","winter","snowfall","tree","ambience","seclusion","peek","accumulation","curtain"]}
