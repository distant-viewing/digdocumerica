{"path":"550801.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, sprawling landfill or dumpsite, characterized by an abundance of scattered trash and waste materials. The waste is notably varied, including household items, cardboard boxes, metal drums, discarded furniture, and miscellaneous debris. Some identifiable objects among the litter are a red wheel, what appears to be a dilapidated sofa, and various plastic containers.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor area with a large pool of stagnant, murky water, which reflects the gray, overcast sky above and is partially covered by the masses of trash floating on its surface. The edges of the water body are cluttered with debris both in and around it, suggesting possible pollution issues.\n\nForegrounding the scene, there is lush greenery with a mixture of grass, bushes, and flowering plants, which starkly contrasts with the polluted environment just beyond. The background is dominated by a lined tree border, hinting that this dumpsite may be located in a rural or semi-secluded area.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, along with the gloomy lighting and clouded sky, conveys a sense of neglect and environmental degradation. This image serves as a stark visual representation of the impact of human waste on natural landscapes.","title":"Town of Enterprize dump, in Oneida County--on banks of Wisconsin River","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550248","557307","550798","544637","551245","551247","554541","549747","553433","547983","549750","548210","550352","549936","546246","551242"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["dumpsite","waste","trash","sofa","masse","abundance","drum","household","landfill","cardboard"]}
