{"path":"546343.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures two individuals engaged in what appears to be environmental or scientific fieldwork near a body of water. The setting is semi-rural, with lush greenery and a copse of trees in the background, suggesting a possibly secluded or less urbanized location.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a young male is interacting with a large white bucket on the ground, labeled \"E. Coli Dept.\" He is wearing a striped long-sleeve shirt and dark shorts. He seems to be either placing something into or retrieving something from the bucket.\n\nOn the right side, another individual, a woman with long hair, is standing in the water and is in the process of scooping or examining the water using a small mesh net attached to a long handle. She is dressed in a casual, oversized shirt and shorts, which suggests informality and comfort necessary for fieldwork.\n\nThe overall activity hints at water quality testing or biological sampling, particularly given the bucket's label, suggesting a focus on monitoring E. coli levels or similar environmental analyses. The background features calm water and overhanging branches, contributing to a serene but engaged atmosphere.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory personnel are dip netting for contaminated female shrimp.
