{"path":"556847.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"In the photograph, three men are interacting on what appears to be the steps of a building or a similar outdoor structure. Two of the men are wearing police or security guard uniforms; they have caps with badges and dark blazers. The third man, standing in the middle, wears a light-colored shirt with a logo on the left sleeve and carries a camera over his shoulder, suggesting he might be a journalist or photographer.\n\nThe man on the left is holding some papers and speaking, possibly giving instructions or reporting. The setting has a somewhat industrial or urban feel, with metal railings that include ornamental elements, and the ground seems to be paved. The image is partially shadowed, likely indicating the men are standing in an area shaded from direct sunlight. There is visible debris on the ground, adding to the gritty, working environment aesthetic. The focus and lighting are centered mostly around the men, drawing attention to their interaction.","title":"Conductors gather by Amtrak's Broadway Limited at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, before the passenger train pulls out for Washington, D.C. It arrives in Harrisburg early in the morning and is split into sections. One goes to the nation's capital and the other heads for New York City. Some 18 million passengers were carried by Amtrak in 1974, a 10 percent increase from the previous year. The corporation collected revenue of $256.9 million in 1974, and a deficit of $272.6 million.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542757","557856","557838","557867","546657","553189","546676","546633","555287","546680","553182","544969","542759","551853","542546","556247"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["man","guard","security","instruction","photographer","police","blazer","pave","badge","speak"]}
