{"path":"554131.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant and dramatic outdoor scene, featuring a winding road that cuts through a rich, reddish landscape, likely composed of oxidized soil that gives the terrain a distinct, rusty color. The road is asphalt, marked by yellow dashed lines, guiding the path that curves gently through the environment. To the right side of the road, multiple utility poles aligned closely form a striking visual line, draped with numerous power cables that stretch across the frame.\n\nOn the road, thereâ€™s a single white car moving along the path, which adds a sense of scale and motion to the scene. The surrounding vegetation appears sparse and scrubby, typical of a semi-arid or tropical environment, suggesting an area that is not densely populated or heavily developed. The sky is not clearly visible, but the lighting implies either early morning or late afternoon, casting soft light that enhances the deep tones of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the snaking road and utility infrastructure, suggests themes of travel, isolation, and perhaps the spread of human influence into natural landscapes.","title":"Highway 11 passing over 1868 lava flow near Waiohinu.
