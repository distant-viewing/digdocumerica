{"path":"545888.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a large scale excavation operation on an expansive site. In the foreground, a massive red crane with a large bucket is visibly engaged in earthmoving activities. Various piles and exposed layers of earth characterize the site directly around the crane, demonstrating active and heavy excavation work. The crane is stationed on a cleared, flat area with hints of gray soil or debris, which contrasts with the darker soil being dug up.\n\nThe midground of the photo features a long dirt road that runs parallel to the excavation site, accentuated with small groups of trees on either side, creating a somewhat bucolic landscape juxtaposed against the industrial scene. In the background, a vast rural or semi-rural landscape stretches out as far as the eye can see, including patches of fields, clusters of trees, and a faint outline of a distant horizon that suggests a flat topography. This area seems largely untouched by the industrial activity dominating the foreground.\n\nThe composition of the photograph uses a high vantage point, likely taken from a helicopter or a tall structure, lending a comprehensive view of the contrast between industrial operation and natural landscape. The color tone, featuring a mix of dull earth tones, greens from the trees, and the striking red of the crane, adds vibrancy to the scene, emphasizing the industrial machinery.","title":"Big brown coal mine","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545883","555593","545846","545887","557729","545831","555644","551187","554545","547583","548775","545648","549169","547225","555633","555586"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","excavation","site","soil","earth","helicopter","operation","topography","vibrancy","bucket"]}
