{"path":"546491.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph captures an upward perspective of a very tall, narrow building. The edifice's facade is covered entirely in brick, featuring a detailed, textured pattern that is especially noticeable due to the angle of the light. It is hard to gauge the exact height of the building from this angle, but its narrow sides and sharp tapering to the top suggest a towering structure.\n\nThe building appears to have a triangular shape based on the perspective with surfaces converging into a peak that can't be seen, stretching beyond the frame's top edge. On these surfaces, numerous small windows are arranged in a systematic, evenly spaced grid, smaller at the top where the building narrows, although some different window patterns are slightly discernible at the bottom part.\n\nThe sky behind the building is a clear, deep blue with virtually no clouds, enhancing the building's stark, imposing silhouette. There's a tiny airplane visible in the sky near the top right of the building, providing a sense of scale and adding a dynamic element to a largely static scene.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the verticality and architectural uniqueness of the building, encouraging viewers to consider its towering presence and design intricacy.","title":"Tower of first christian church, built in 1942","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["556174","546542","545885","555278","549317","555329","546468","546506","548648","550007","546415","548649","546473","551508","548408","549971"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["building","towering","narrow","angle","verticality","encourage","intricacy","gauge","perspective","consider"]}
