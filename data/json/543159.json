{"path":"543159.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene set against a rural background. In the foreground, there is a large expanse of freshly tilled farmland, characterized by dark brown soil scattered with small patches of green vegetation, indicative of early growth or residual foliage. The focus on agriculture transitions abruptly to an industrial setting in the midground, where a large factory complex dominates the view.\n\nThis factory features multiple structures, including several tall, thin smokestacks that tower over the facility, releasing plumes of white smoke into the air. The complex also includes various large cylindrical storage tanks, and several buildings that house the operations of the plant. There is visible steam or smoke emanating from multiple points in the factory, suggesting active production processes.\n\nThe background of the image softens into a hazy, distant view of mountains beneath a light blue sky, slightly obscured by atmospheric haze or pollution, possibly related to the emissions from the factory. This juxtaposition of industrial and natural elements creates a stark contrast between human activity and the landscape, underlining the impact of industry on rural and natural environments.","title":"California--Moss Landing","placename":"Moss Landing (Calif.)","location":"Moss Landing, California","nn1":["553933","550716","544735","546398","551060","544736","545013","543813","546005","550672","543011","543733","554630","552246","543668","551026"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["factory","complex","smoke","farmland","agriculture","production","emission","midground","plume","steam"]}
