{"path":"550201.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a bleak and somewhat desolate scene featuring a large body of frozen water, possibly a river or canal. The surface of the water appears to be frozen and dirty with several objects floating amid the ice. These objects include an old tire and smaller debris scattered across the surface.\n\nIn the background, there is an old, run-down wooden structure that spans the width of the image. The structure appears to be a dock or a part of a building partially submerged or adjacent to the water. It shows significant wear and decay, with portions of the wood broken or missing, contributing to an overall sense of neglect and abandonment in the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is somewhat eerie and quiet, emphasizing themes of decay and neglect. The lighting is dull, suggesting an overcast day, which adds to the somber mood of the image. No people are visible in the scene, highlighting the isolation and uninhabited nature of the environment depicted.","title":"Greenish color results from discharge by dupont plant into the polluted cuyahogu river","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547622","547582","546913","549306","547890","547584","547893","551984","550368","553428","550947","548105","547581","547689","547594","552213"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["decay","neglect","bleak","emphasizing","object","width","canal","ice","desolate","tire"]}
