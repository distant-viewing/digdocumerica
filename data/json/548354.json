{"path":"548354.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from an urban setting. It features a person, possibly male, who is partly inside an open basement entrance or cellar, visible only from the waist up. The individual wears a grey, winter cap and smeared gloves, indicating engagement in some form of manual labor or maintenance work. The person is surrounded by an assortment of objects that suggest a work scenario: a sizable, greasy metal lid is propped open to expose the area where the worker is situated; a tin bucket with a white substance; another garbage can; and a sack possibly filled with materials or tools.\n\nThe setting includes the basement opening embedded within a concrete surface, fringed by a red-brick wall which runs along one side of the frame, creating a confined, alley-like environment. Various debris, including loose brick fragments and small scraps of trash, litter the ground, indicating a somewhat neglected or under-maintained space. The overall atmosphere emanates a gritty, urban feel, typical perhaps of back-alley maintenance scenes in city environments.","title":"Worker hauls garbage can from cellar of tenement in Harlem.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556447","556158","556177","546027","556444","548372","548371","542497","556513","558307","545151","556427","544832","548455","556391","552748"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["alley","smear","maintenance","brick","tin","sack","fringe","lid","prop","embed"]}
