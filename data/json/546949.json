{"path":"546949.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an agricultural irrigation sprinkler system in operation. The focal point is a sprinkler head mounted on a metal tripod, actively spraying water in multiple high-pressure jets. The water droplets are finely dispersed, creating a hazy mist around the sprinkler and a refreshing sheen seen sparkling under sunlight.\n\nThe background reveals an expansive crop field, uniformly covered with low, dense vegetation, possibly a type of leafy crop. The atmosphere of the image feels moist and fresh due to the active irrigation.\n\nThe color palette of the photograph is a mix of greens from the plants and a bluish tinge, likely from the photographic effects and the droplets in the air which also scatter some sunlight. The lighting in the scene suggests it could be midday or early afternoon, given the brightness and diffuse nature of light, enhancing the visibility of water droplets in the air.\n\nOverall, the picture depicts an essential agricultural activity, demonstrating an efficient method of watering crops, reflecting themes of farming technology and water management practices.","title":"A truck farm on St. Helena'a Island","placename":"Saint Helena Island (S.C.)","location":"Saint Helena Island, South Carolina","nn1":["548953","546825","543650","553432","548875","548869","548950","548877","554014","548991","549178","543777","546829","553652","548901","543792"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["droplet","crop","irrigation","tripod","air","pressure","method","water","jet","tinge"]}
