{"path":"553139.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This image features a close-up view of a large, illuminated sign that spells “Horseshoe” in bold, red typography, outlined in a brighter red and backed by numerous small, round light bulbs. The letters are mounted on a facade textured with circular decorations mimicking the small bulbs. Additionally, there's a vertical panel extending above the text, colored in bands of red and white, with similar circular motifs in white, giving it a vibrant and eye-catching look. The photograph captures the sign from an angle looking slightly upwards, emphasizing the grand scale and decorative details of the signage. The backdrop is a clear blue sky, contrasting sharply with the bright colors and lights of the sign. The image captures a moment of static energy typical of neon-lit commercial signage, typically found in entertainment or casino districts.","title":"Reno is noted for extravagant entertainment","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["549015","549025","549009","549022","549026","553119","545456","551321","554185","545462","555439","549017","555424","553017","555442","547021"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["bulb","signage","red","spell","mimic","entertainment","sign","neon","motif","band"]}
