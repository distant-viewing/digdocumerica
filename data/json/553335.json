{"path":"553335.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a standout moment of outdoor adventure, showing a person in a capsized kayak in a river. The kayak, which is mostly submerged under the surface, reveals only the upside-down hull and part of the cockpit where the individual is trying to hold on or possibly attempting to right the kayak.\n\nThe person appears to be in a struggling or playful posture, partially submerged in water, with only their head and shoulders visible above the waterline. They wear a dark-colored outfit which offers a stark contrast against the light-colored kayak and the glistening surface of the water.\n\nThe setting is a natural waterbody bordered by a variety of trees indicating it might be a secluded or forested area. The water has a brownish tint, typical of many freshwater rivers or lakes in wooded regions. The reflections on the water surface are dazzlingly bright, suggesting the presence of sunlight filtering through the trees, creating dynamic patterns of light and shadow.\n\nForeground elements include thin branches and twigs that hang close to the surface of the water, adding an organic texture to the scene. These details suggest a setting that is somewhat wild and untouched, offering a sense of being close to nature. Overall, the image conveys a moment full of action and enjoyment in an outdoor setting, highlighting themes of adventure, challenge, and a connection with the natural environment.","title":"Tilted kayak equals wet kayaker","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550657","553333","558070","554465","553334","550653","550659","558071","558068","553336","549439","558069","550663","551538","550661","552333"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["kayak","adventure","submerge","surface","waterbody","try","waterline","cockpit","water","offer"]}
