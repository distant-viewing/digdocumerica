{"path":"544834.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph shows a flock of birds in flight over a landscape with several distinct elements. The foreground consists of tall grasses or marshland, indicating a natural, possibly wetland habitat. The birds, numerous in number and captured in various stages of flight, are the primary focus of the image. They appear as dark silhouettes against a softer background due to the lighting.\n\nIn the middle ground, there's a glimpse of a broad, flat area that might be a body of water or a far-stretching field, reflecting light and contributing a brighter horizontal line that contrasts with the rest of the scene.\n\nThe background features towering mountains that fade into a hazy sky, suggesting either the time is near dawn or dusk, or there might be some atmospheric conditions like fog or mist contributing to the subdued lighting and color tones. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is serene and somewhat ethereal, emphasizing the natural beauty and tranquility of the scene.","title":"Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Area on east shore of Great Salt Lake.
