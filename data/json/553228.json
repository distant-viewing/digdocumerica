{"path":"553228.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This image captures a striking silhouette scene set against a twilight sky. It features a series of figures positioned on what appears to be the top edge of a multi-story building. The figures, all in silhouette, are caught in dynamic poses suggesting movement and activity, possibly dancing or engaging in a playful activity. Their elongated shadows stretch behind them, enhancing the dramatic effect of the scene.\n\nThe building itself occupies most of the lower frame, characterized by its stark, dark facade punctuated by a row of bright, evenly spaced, rectangular windows that illuminate sections of the building's interior. This creates a striking visual contrast between the dark outline of the building and the figures against the lighter evening sky.\n\nThe composition powerfully utilizes the contrast between light and darkness, with the human figures forming a compelling narrative element, suggesting a sense of freedom or celebration. There is a simplicity in the color palette—mostly blues and blacks—that draws attention to the forms and movement in the image rather than its colors.","title":"The \"Celebrations Group\" of Marilyn Woods rehearses dance on the roof of the Fifth Third Bank building overlooking Fountain Square.
