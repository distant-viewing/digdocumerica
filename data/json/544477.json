{"path":"544477.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a striking image of a dark-plumaged bird, likely a type of heron, with distinctive long feathers at the back of its head, creating a ruffled appearance. The bird is positioned on branches adorned with small leaves and clusters of tiny berries or buds. It has a sharp, downward-curving beak and a keen gaze that suggests alertness. The background is softly blurred, accentuating the bird as the focal point, and features a muted palette of blues and greens, perhaps indicating a sky or distant foliage. The lighting on the birdâ€™s feathers hints at the reflective quality of its plumage, adding depth and texture to the visual composition.","title":"Florida--Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544489","544539","544547","548885","555010","544543","557604","549115","557628","547593","550388","548731","551378","547318","551379","543922"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["bird","feather","alertness","heron","beak","plumage","bud","gaze","back","head"]}
