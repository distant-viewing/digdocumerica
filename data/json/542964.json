{"path":"542964.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene featuring an elk in a natural setting. The elk is positioned in the foreground, viewed from a side angle. Its coat appears thick and fluffy, silhouetted against a dramatically lit background. The animal's ears are perked up, suggesting alertness, and its eyes are faintly visible.\n\nThe backdrop displays a mysterious and atmospheric quality, characterized by dark shades and an enigmatic mist or smoke that diffuses the light, creating a soft glow around the silhouette of the elk. The ground is dotted with dew or raindrops that sparkle subtly, possibly hinting at an early morning time frame. Sparse vegetation, including grass and some thorny brush, can be seen in the lower parts of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the natural beauty and the almost ethereal presence of the elk in its habitat, enhanced by the moody and dimly lit environment that surrounds it. The use of backlighting highlights the contours of the elk and imparts a sense of quiet solitude and wildness inherent in such a scene.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542962","543022","555068","542599","545902","545898","558368","550495","550494","550380","554621","542778","546163","542959","543369","544916"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["alertness","wildness","dew","silhouette","impart","ear","brush","sparkle","habitat","contour"]}
