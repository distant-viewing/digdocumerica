{"path":"546652.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene from the perspective of an individual seated in the backseat of a car. The viewer peers over the shoulder of the driver, whose arm and rearview mirror are visible in the foreground. The driver’s hand is gripping the steering wheel.\n\nOutside, the image showcases an urban environment with multiple vehicles and a range of architectural styles lining the street. In the immediate view, there is a variety of automobiles—a prominent white van is centrally positioned, and several other cars are visible, hinting at either busy traffic or a stoplight scenario.\n\nBuildings with commercial signage are prominent; one notably features a bright neon sign that reads \"LIQUOR\" above the word \"TRIANGLE\" in a vertical arrangement. This suggests the location could be a commercial district.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is somewhat muted, possibly due to overcast weather, given the diffused lighting. The scene captures a slice of urban life, likely from a few decades ago considering the styles of the vehicles and the neon advertising.","title":"Blocked intersection causes instant traffic jam.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["548272","556709","556752","545216","547369","556724","549882","551913","546716","554297","551135","556225","549856","555782","549872","555450"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["neon","driver","grip","peer","consider","steering","advertising","street","automobile","district"]}
