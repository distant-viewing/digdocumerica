{"path":"548335.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph presents a foggy landscape viewed across a body of water, likely a river. Central to the image is a suspension bridge that stretches across the frame, partially obscured by thick atmospheric haze, hinting that we are viewing this scene either during a heavily foggy day or at a distance. Surrounding the bridge are high-rise buildings that are similarly blurred and faint due to the fog, making the scene appear almost dreamlike. Towards the lower left part of the image, there's a single sailboat on the water, moving quietly and adding a sense of scale and solitude to the image. The overall color palette is muted with shades of grey and pink, contributing to a serene yet somewhat somber atmosphere. The distinct but subdued outlines of the architecture and the bridge suggest an early morning or late evening shot where light and visibility are limited. This photograph captures urban life subtly coexisting with natural elements under limiting visibility conditions.","title":"The George Washington Bridge in heavy smog.
