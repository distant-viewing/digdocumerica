{"path":"549036.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an agricultural scene set in a vast field under a clear blue sky. The main subject is a man, dressed in work attire consisting of a white shirt, jeans, and a baseball cap, engaged in the task of handling a large bag or tarp filled with grain. He is bending over the edge of a metal container or part of a vehicle, which contains a considerable amount of grain. His posture suggests he is either securing the bag or preparing to lift or maneuver it.\n\nThe background reveals a flat, expansive landscape typical of many agricultural regions, with brown and beige stubbled fields stretching out to the horizon. It appears to be harvest time, as evidenced by the presence of harvested fields and rows of stubble. Further back, other agricultural machinery can be seen at work, kicking up dust, which adds a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil rural setting.\n\nThe lighting is soft, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and giving the image a warm, golden tone. This setting underscores the themes of hard work and agriculture, highlighting the man's physical involvement in the harvesting process. The composition focuses on the man and his immediate activity but also effectively conveys the vastness of the agricultural landscape and the scale of operations.","title":"Harvesting barley in the imperial valley--near imperial","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["555619","554203","549259","549048","547734","544250","548985","554047","553665","544371","548976","546986","543845","548979","544246","552576"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["harvest","grain","bag","field","work","kick","tarp","harvesting","involvement","baseball"]}
