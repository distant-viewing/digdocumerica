{"path":"550484.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of vibrant, delicately textured yellow lichen growing abundantly on a darker substrate, likely a rock or tree bark. The lichen appears frilly with intricate folds and ripples that create a somewhat labyrinthine texture. Its bright yellow hue stands out against the stark, mottled gray and dark surface upon which it grows. The depth of field is shallow, focusing primarily on the center of the image where the detail and color saturation of the lichen are most intense, while the periphery of the image gently blurs, bringing the observerâ€™s attention to the lichen's complex structure. There's no discernible background beyond the immediate environment of the lichen, emphasizing its beauty and biological detail.","title":"Close-up of caribou lichen growing in the talus at the foot of Peak 5308","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554594","550476","555018","555014","543147","554571","555053","543149","555182","555026","554993","545718","555025","554580","555181","551355"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["lichen","fold","periphery","observer","saturation","bark","detail","ripple","gray","rock"]}
