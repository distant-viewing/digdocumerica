{"path":"550491.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural, rugged landscape. The foreground is filled with a mixture of small, low-growing vegetation with different colorsâ€”shades of yellow, orange, and green, suggesting the image was taken in either autumn or in a region where these hues naturally dominate due to ecological reasons. There is a noticeable barren patch of earth prominently displayed in the center of the image, which contrasts distinctly with the surrounding vegetated area. A small white ruler or measuring tool lies on the ground near the center, possibly used for scale or as part of a scientific study.\n\nBeyond this immediate area, the landscape opens into a wide, flat field that stretches towards the background. This field is sparsely vegetated, hinting at harsh climatic or soil conditions. \n\nIn the background, there are large, imposing mountain formations under a cloudy sky. The mountains are mostly barren with patches of snow or light-colored rock formations, giving them a stark and majestic appearance. The sky is overcast with grey clouds suggesting an overcast or chilly weather condition typical of high-altitude or northern environments. The overall scenery gives a sense of isolation and the untouched nature of a wild, possibly remote location.","title":"A wolf-chewed caribou thigh bone in the center of the Atigun Valley.
