{"path":"544984.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of an archaeological dig in a coastal environment. There are three people engaged in excavation activities amidst a murky landscape of brown earth. The setting includes large heaps of soil and several dug-out areas covered with black plastic sheets.\n\nOne of the individuals, standing in the center of the image, is wearing shorts and a tank top. They are holding paperwork or possibly a map. To the right, another person kneels while attending closely to an area on the ground, also in casual attire. They appear focused on their task, possibly sorting or examining something with their hand. A third person is partially visible in the edge of the photograph, seemingly working within the pit.\n\nThe background features a tranquil water body with a few small boats floating leisurely, surrounded by forested areas on the far shore under a blue sky, indicating a serene rural or semi-wilderness area. The setting is spacious and airy, giving a sense of openness and natural beauty surrounding the meticulous and detailed labor of the archaeological work.","title":"University of Washington graduate students at the garrison bay archeological dig at english camp","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544162","552495","544158","552496","544366","552286","547117","546334","544763","542601","547504","549059","547020","549326","552278","544085"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["paperwork","dug","map","rural","pit","attend","sheet","out","individuals","heap"]}
