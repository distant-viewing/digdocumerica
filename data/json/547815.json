{"path":"547815.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a single vibrant flower, possibly a type of daisy, displayed prominently against a blurred background. The flower has a rich magenta color with numerous slender petals radiating outward from a darker pink to purple center. The petals have a gradient of color that intensifies towards the tips. There's a subtle hint of a green stem or leaf at the bottom left, just entering the frame. The background features soft, indistinct shades of gray and green, which subtly enhance the vividness of the flower while providing a calm, neutral backdrop. The focus and lighting emphasize the flower, showcasing its delicate details and lively colors.","title":"Wild flower growing in elm fork park nature center in northwest Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["557545","542969","545699","554840","550464","555034","550462","554843","551368","555035","543597","555061","554595","557167","545706","542970"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","daisy","intensify","radiate","tip","pink","leaf","stem","enter"]}
