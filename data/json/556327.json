{"path":"556327.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a dilapidated interior, possibly an abandoned building. The image features a large green metal cage or locker with several compartments, each secured by a door with a simple latch. There are no visible contents within the easily discernible compartments. A crumpled, dirty cloth hangs on one side of the cage, adding to the sense of disorder.\n\nTo the left of this locker, there is a rusted metal barrel with a partially open lid. This barrel is labeled \"CALCIUM CARBIDE,\" suggesting it was used for industrial or construction purposes. There is scattered debris around the floor, including fragments of paper, rubble, and bits of unidentifiable material, suggesting neglect and decay. \n\nThe background shows more of the building's interior, with two windows allowing natural light to spill into the room, casting shadows and enhancing the textured look of peeling walls and exposed wooden elements. Overall, the photograph evokes a strong sense of abandonment and decay, highlighted by the state of the objects and the surroundings.","title":"Mail slots sit among the debris of a deserted store and post office in Crawford, Tennessee, near Cookeville.
