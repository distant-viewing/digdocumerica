{"path":"557121.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and dynamic wildlife scene centered around a large body of water, presumably a lake or wetlands. The primary focus is on a large flock of white birds, which are likely geese or swans, distributed across the water and the surrounding area. Many of these birds are standing in shallow water, while others are captured in flight, soaring above the lake with their wings spread wide.\n\nIn the background, a diverse landscape includes a variety of dense foliage with autumnal colors ranging from green to deep russet hues. A gentle hill or low mountain covered in dense vegetation forms the backdrop, suggesting a secluded or protected natural area.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by the expansive water body, which reflects a bright but slightly overcast sky. The presence of multiple horizontal layers in the water created by variations in depth or mudflats adds texture to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition is bustling with natural activity and presents a snapshot of wildlife in their natural habitat, where the stillness of the landscape contrasts with the motion of birds in flight and the congregation in the water.","title":"Flocks of blue geese and snow geese stop at the squaw creek national wildlife refuge near Mound City, Missouri, at the extreme northwest corner of the state.
