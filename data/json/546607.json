{"path":"546607.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a multi-lane highway cutting through a heavily wooded area. The highway is divided into two parts, each consisting of multiple lanes. On the left side of the divide, vehicles are moving upward in the picture, indicative of heading in one direction, while on the right side, vehicles head downward, suggesting traffic is moving in the opposite direction.\n\nThere are about twenty cars visible, spaced relatively evenly across the lanes, and they appear in various colors such as red, yellow, white, and blue. There is no apparent congestion; each vehicle seems to be moving freely without signs of heavy traffic. \n\nThe surrounding landscape is lush and green, indicating either spring or summer, with dense tree lines flanking both sides of the highway. The central division between the two directions of the highway is a wide grassy median, also suggesting an area thatâ€™s well-maintained. \n\nThe perspective offered by the aerial view provides a sense of the movement within a broader landscape, emphasizing the relationship between human-made infrastructure and the natural environment. The photograph might have been taken during daylight given the good visibility and shadows indicating a bright sun.","title":"Virginia section of the Beltway.
