{"path":"548694.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image features a large roadside billboard with a bold, attention-grabbing message. The sign reads \"YANKEE DON'T GO HOME FOR LAND'S SAKE See JERRY EGAN REALTOR\" in a mix of blue and red lettering against a white background. The word \"YANKEE\" is particularly prominent in blue letters, and red stars are placed around the text for emphasis. Below this section, \"See JERRY EGAN REALTOR\" is indicated in smaller text with a directional arrow pointing right, suggesting the way to find this realtor.\n\nIn the foreground, a part of a vehicle is visible on the right side of the photo, capturing a snapshot of motion, possibly emphasizing the perspective of a passerby viewing the sign from a moving vehicle. The background includes natural vegetation and a few trees, indicative of a somewhat suburban or semi-rural setting. The focus is mainly on the billboard, positioning it as a significant element in the photograph, suggestive of its importance or prominence in the area. The imagery used and the slogan on the billboard potentially imply a local resistance to outsiders or non-local property buyers, aimed humorously or seriously at attracting attention and provoking thought.","title":"Land developer's advertisement","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["548730","543099","547648","543100","554924","546425","544287","547841","543814","543557","546187","557553","547845","544136","549039","548674"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["billboard","buyer","text","slogan","grab","imagery","provoke","arrow","suggestive","bold"]}
