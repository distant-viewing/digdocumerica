{"path":"551444.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures an urban outdoor scene, possibly in a downtown shopping area. In the foreground, two women engage in conversation while seated on a bench. The woman on the left is dressed in a colorful blouse with a mixed print of reds, greens, and yellows, paired with a white skirt and white sandals with black and white striped socks. She holds a white purse on her lap and leans slightly towards the other woman. The woman on the right is wearing a pink dress with neat pleats, a white belt, and a white hat. She accessorizes with a dark purse and a wristwatch, completing her outfit with black flats.\n\nThe background presents a view of a shopping street, bustling with activity. Pedestrians are walking by, including a man and a woman moving towards the right side of the frame. Storefronts decorated with striped awnings and window displays add visual interest and suggest a commercial environment. A bicycle is parked near the curb, enhancing the urban feel. The scene is shaded by lush greenery, with leaves and small branches from overhead trees casting shadows and partially obscuring the view of the buildings. The setting and fashion suggest this photograph was taken in the late 20th century. The atmosphere is lively yet relaxed, characterized by casual urban life and social interaction.","title":"Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551817","551466","551815","547772","551742","548646","546855","543036","557039","556764","550082","554691","545231","558253","556808","549925"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["purse","woman","shopping","flat","wristwatch","sandal","print","awning","sock","lap"]}
