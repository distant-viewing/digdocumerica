{"path":"556646.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of a spacious, rustic cabin featuring a strong wooden architectural theme. The room has a high ceiling with exposed wooden beams and loft areas accessible by ladders. The windows fill the living area with natural light and offer a view of a snowy landscape outside.\n\nTo the left, the wall is adorned with polka dot wallpaper and there are several small framed pictures or mirrors; a narrow hallway leads farther into the cabin. Two older men are seen sitting separately in armchairsâ€”one holding a book and the other a drinking glass, suggesting a comfortable, casual atmosphere. In the foreground, a well-appointed living area includes patterned rugs, a glass coffee table with vases and what appears to be a chess game, and various traditional-style furniture. A stove is installed close to the wall which is possibly used for heating the space.\n\nThe composition gives a sense of warmth and homeliness, emphasized by the wooden tones and the comfortable arrangement of furniture. The scene is likely set during the winter, given the presence of snow outside and the cozy setup indoors.","title":"Interior view of the all aluminum beer and soft drink can experimental house near Taos, New Mexico.  The owners report the house seems to work well so far and gives the feeling of being very solid.  The south facing windows capture heat from the sun, a good feature because the winters of the southwest are severe.  Houses of this type can be built for as much as 20% less than conventional structures because unskilled labor can be employed and the cost of the cans is cheap","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["556647","552114","555310","556627","551267","555295","549193","543041","555289","548454","545518","554696","544865","555393","554233","555231"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["furniture","cabin","armchair","drinking","vase","stove","coffee","instal","ladder","glass"]}
