{"path":"550370.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a river with a striking visual of floating foam patterns on its surface. The foam swirls dynamically, forming complex shapes that are bright white and contrast sharply against the dark color of the water. The river itself appears to flow from the top of the image to the bottom, surrounded by lush greenery on both sides.\n\nOn the right bank, there are dense trees and shrubs that line the river, suggesting a location that is likely away from urban development. On the left bank towards the background, a similar natural environment is visible with thick foliage. In the far distance on the right side, there are glimpses of a residential or a small community area, highlighted by some buildings peeking through the treeline.\n\nThe sky is not directly visible, but the lighting in the photo implies a bright, possibly sunny day, enhancing the reflection and contrast of foam on the water. The textures in the foam range from smooth, large patches to intricate, twisted lines, giving a sense of movement and natural turbulence in the water. This photograph has a mysterious and somewhat otherworldly feel due to the unique patterns created by the foam.","title":"Foamy st.
