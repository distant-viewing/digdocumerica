{"path":"545112.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents a striking landscape with a mixture of natural and industrial elements. In the foreground, lush green grass and patches of wild shrubs dominate the view. These are speckled with white flowers and are bordered by dense forests consisting of tall, dark green trees on the left edge. The middle ground reveals a stark contrast with an industrial setting that includes several large factory buildings emitting white smoke, illustrated against the scenic backdrop. The expansive facility seems to be involved in logging or a similar industry, based on the open, cleared areas and stacks of what appear to be timber or lumber.\n\nBeyond the industrial site, a serene water body is visible, possibly a river or coastal bay, reflecting the bright sky and flanked by wooded hills in the distance. The sky is mostly clear blue with a few clouds, suggesting a sunny day. This photograph captures a moment where nature and human activity intersect, providing a vivid depiction of landscape transformation due to industrialization.","title":"Lumber mill pollutes air in recreation area","placename":"Reedsport (Or.)","location":"Reedsport, Oregon","nn1":["543813","546073","554630","550694","545053","545013","557377","545020","556908","550995","545993","550346","552194","545989","546394","550860"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["transformation","lumber","industrialization","timber","speckle","flowers","logging","depiction","forests","bay"]}
