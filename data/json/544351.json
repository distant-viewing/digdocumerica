{"path":"544351.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph captures a man underwater, seemingly in the midst of swimming or diving. The man is positioned diagonally across the frame, his body angled slightly towards the camera. His face is partially obscured by bubbles emanating from his nose and mouth, indicating that he is exhaling. He appears focused, perhaps on navigating through the water or reaching a specific depth.\n\nHe is shirtless and wearing denim shorts, which is unusual attire for underwater activities, possibly suggesting an impromptu swim or dive. Light from above filters through the water, casting patterns on his skin and creating a dappled effect which accentuates his muscular build.\n\nThe backdrop is a deep, somewhat murky blue of the underwater environment, dotted with small particles or debris suspended in the water, giving a sense of depth and the vastness of the surroundings. The overall composition and the natural lighting create a serene but slightly mysterious atmosphere, drawing attention to the solitary figure moving through this aqueous space.","title":"Bather under water at havasu creek.
