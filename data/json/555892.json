{"path":"555892.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and colorful beach scene. In the foreground, three young girls are focused on playing in the wet sand. Two of the girls are kneeling and touching something on the shore, possibly seashells or small beach finds. One girl, who is standing, leans over to look closely at what the others are examining. They all appear engrossed in their activity, exploring with curiosity.\n\nThe girls wear bright swimwear; one in an orange swimsuit with an orange sandal, one in a yellow and the third in a navy swimsuit.\n\nIn the background, several other people are enjoying the water. Some are standing in the ocean, while others are engaged in playful activities or swimming. The ocean stretches out behind them under an overcast sky, giving a tranquil yet slightly moody atmosphere to the setting.\n\nThe scene is a snapshot of a typical beach outing where both children and adults are enjoying a day at the sea, engaging in various activities. The composition of the photo, combined with the cloudy sky and reflective wet sand, adds to the overall vibrant and dynamic nature of a beach day.","title":"Children at reis park, a public beach in Brooklyn, New York city.
