{"path":"547018.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph features a line of small aircrafts parked on a concrete tarmac. Each plane is positioned diagonally facing the left, creating a perspective that emphasizes the repetition and alignment of the aircraft. The planes are predominantly propeller-driven, with most having a nose-mounted propeller. The color schemes of the aircrafts vary slightly with combinations of white, red, and orange predominantly visible. The cockpits are mostly visible, showing small windows typical of this type of aircraft. \n\nThe tarmac appears somewhat weathered and cracked, indicating it may be situated in an older or less maintained airfield. Sparse grassy areas are visible through cracks in the concrete, adding a touch of natural elements to the otherwise man-made environment. \n\nIn the background, there is a low-lying horizon with trees faintly visible, suggesting a relatively open and flat landscape typical of many rural or suburban airfields. The sky is bright and suggests a clear day, enhancing visibility and adding brightness to the colors of the planes.\n\nNo human figures or animals are visible in the image, focusing the attention purely on the technology and orderly arrangement of the aircraft. The scene suggests a context of either a small airport or a flying club where such planes might be used for recreational flying, training, or short transport flights.","title":"Airport on st.
