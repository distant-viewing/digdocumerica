{"path":"547047.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a tranquil natural scene primarily composed of an expansive body of water under a dramatic sky. The upper part of the photograph features a large, dense bank of dark clouds covering the left side of the frame, obscuring the sun partially. This creates a dim and moody lighting. The obscured sun manages to emit a soft glow that brightens the upper right part of the sky.\n\nBelow this cloud formation, the water body is visible, reflecting the sunlight in a narrow, shimmering path that leads directly from the sun down towards the bottom of the image. The light on the water creates a striking contrast with its surroundings, highlighting the gentle movements of the water's surface.\n\nThe lower foreground of the image seems to be an indistinct, dark land form, possibly a shoreline that is not clearly visible. It does not dominate the view but serves as a base from which the water extends upwards in the composition.\n\nThe overall mood is serene and somewhat somber, characterized by the interplay of light and shadow, the vastness of the clouds, and the quiet of the water. This image effectively captures a moment of natural beauty, emphasizing texture, contrast, and the grand scale of the landscape.","title":"Lake Michigan","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["550391","547352","547057","543611","552142","554405","545213","555396","555717","550493","550389","552319","557572","543058","545907","544570"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sun","cloud","water","brighten","shimmer","dim","upward","manage","emit","bank"]}
