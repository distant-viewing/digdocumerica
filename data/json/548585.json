{"path":"548585.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of elderly individuals seated along the edge of a swimming pool, participating in a water-based activity, likely an aqua fitness class. Most participants are women, except for one man, and they are all wearing swimming attire, including colorful swimsuits and floral swim caps. Many also wear sunglasses or hats to protect from the sun. The individuals are dangled into the water up to their shins and many are smiling or focused as they seem to be engaged in a synchronized exercise involving their legs.\n\nThe pool area is bright and sunny, indicative of a warm, clear day, and the background includes white pool chairs, suggesting a communal or public pool setting typical of a holiday or resort destination. The overall atmosphere is lively and social, with a sense of community among the participants.","title":"Residents of the Century Village retirement community gather around pool for daily exercise session.","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548550","548583","548549","556295","548584","548548","552706","555891","551093","558143","552012","548085","550929","544339","548083","550002"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["pool","swimming","participant","exercise","dangle","holiday","class","swimsuit","resort","destination"]}
