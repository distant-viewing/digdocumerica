{"path":"544323.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural setting with various points of interest. In the foreground, there is an individual operating an old-fashioned tractor on a cultivated field, turning over the dark, rich soil. The tractor is medium-sized, traditional in design, with large rear wheels.\n\nSlightly to the left and behind the tractor, there is a modest, single-story house with a light-brown brick exterior and a darker brown roof. The house has large windows and a centrally located door. There's an antenna on the roof, suggesting the era before digital satellite technology became prevalent.\n\nTo the left of the house, there is a classic car parked beside the building, adding to the nostalgic feel of the scene. Around the house, there are a few sparse grassy areas, but much of the land appears to be used for cultivation.\n\nThe background includes tall, lush trees and a broad hill with a barren, un-vegetated surface, which contrasts sharply with the green foliage of the trees. The sky is a muted tone, possibly indicating overcast weather or the onset of dusk.\n\nThis setting likely represents a typical day in a rural farmstead, illustrating agricultural activities alongside daily living in a peaceful, natural environment.","title":"Navajo plowing his garden.
