{"path":"545840.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a broad industrial setting that appears to be a water treatment facility or a similar utility plant. The scene includes several large, open water tanks. One of the tanks in the foreground features a visible circular walkway or structure, possibly a clarifier or a skimmer in the water treatment process.\n\nIn the middle distance, multiple rectangular basins or tanks are arranged in parallel lines, likely part of the processing sequence. These tanks are interconnected with numerous narrow walkways and pipes, suggesting a complex system of water handling capabilities. Floating objects, possibly debris or treatment media, can be seen scattered across the surface of the water in these tanks.\n\nIn the background, the facility extends with various industrial constructions including more tanks and buildings that house the plant's operational mechanisms. There is a diversity of structures including spherical tanks, tall vertical tanks, and metal framework possibly supporting machinery or pipelines.\n\nThe overall setting is flat and expansive, under a clear sky, indicating broad, open land around the facility. Architectural and industrial details suggest a focus on functionality, typical of utility and treatment plants. The presence of no evident human activity in the photo reinforces the automated or minimally manned nature of many such facilities. The horizon shows minimal vegetation and scattered buildings, compatible with an industrial zone setting.","title":"General tire chemical plant is using cooling towers and settling plants for the removal of effluents from the water it uses forty per cent of the financing for this process is provided by the government","placename":"Odessa (Tex.)","location":"Odessa, Texas","nn1":["548212","547262","543572","545836","543571","543574","548151","547568","548137","551171","548216","542987","543573","547239","549636","546895"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["tank","facility","treatment","walkway","plant","utility","sequence","capability","pipeline","tanks"]}
