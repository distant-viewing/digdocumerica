{"path":"558039.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene suburban street scene during what appears to be autumn, given the colorful foliage. The road bends gently to the right, lined with mature trees in varying hues of yellow, orange, and green. These trees are casting shadows onto the asphalt, indicating a sunny day. Traditional American houses, primarily one to two stories high, are visible on both sides of the street. These homes feature porches and are set back from the road, surrounded by manicured lawns and some shrubbery.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there's a green space which also houses a line of trees shedding their leaves. A single car, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s judging by its design, is traveling down the road, adding a sense of motion to the otherwise tranquil setting. The ground is scattered with fallen leaves, enhancing the autumnal feel. The overall atmosphere is quiet and residential, suggestive of a peaceful day in a suburban neighborhood.","title":"One of the fine period homes in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.
