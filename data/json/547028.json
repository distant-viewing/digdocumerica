{"path":"547028.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up portrait of a middle-aged man who appears deeply contemplative or stern. His face fills most of the frame, emphasizing his facial features and expressions. \n\nHe is wearing a beige baseball cap adorned with a patch featuring a cross with elements resembling the Union Jack and an unknown black and red design. Below the cap, his eyes gaze directly into the camera, creating a strong, engaging connection with the viewer. \n\nThe man has a cigar clamped firmly in the corner of his mouth, with visible smoke curling from the lit end, suggesting a moment of relaxation or contemplation. His skin is weathered, perhaps indicating a life spent outdoors, and he sports some unshaven stubble that adds to his rugged appearance. The tones of his skin are rich and deeply textured, giving the portrait added depth.\n\nHe wears a white, possibly slightly faded T-shirt, visible just below his jawline, which adds simplicity to the photograph, keeping the focus on his face and expression. The background is indistinct, primarily dark with hints of green, suggesting that the photograph might have been taken outdoors, possibly in a shaded area to avoid direct sunlight.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its tight focus and shallow depth of field, draws attention solely to the man's facial expression and the details of his hat and cigar, encapsulating a strong sense of character and personal story.","title":"Andrew Kidd is the head of the Blufton Oyster Co-op, a black-owned business","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["547282","547007","549054","554858","554846","548251","552103","548226","556443","555529","556563","542784","557173","543701","556478","548236"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["portrait","skin","expression","cap","face","cross","baseball","mouth","depth","relaxation"]}
