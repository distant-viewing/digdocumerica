{"path":"551927.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a woman standing in a driveway with two cars; one car has its hood open. The woman appears to be looking at the open engine compartment of a dark green car. She has long, dark hair and stands with her arms crossed, wearing a light-colored, sleeveless mini dress with a checkered pattern and collar, evoking a style typical of the late 1960s or early 1970s.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a partial view of another car, beige or light yellow in color, with its hood raised, showing that this car might also be undergoing a check or repair. In the background, the setting includes a residential area with a visible brick house and shrubbery.\n\nThe scene likely captures a moment related to automotive maintenance or trouble, possibly in a suburban environment. The focus on the woman posing a contemplative or concerned expression suggests she may be assessing the situation with the cars. The photograph uses natural lighting and appears to have been taken during the day.","title":"Commuter waits as her car battery is charged.
