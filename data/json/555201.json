{"path":"555201.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a dense forest scene highlighting multiple tall, leafless coniferous trees. The trees are darkly colored and stand starkly against a lighter woodland backdrop that includes a variety of younger, green trees scattered throughout. The terrain is steep and uneven, with a mix of soil and fallen branches covering the forest floor, indicating a natural or possibly disrupted environment.\n\nThis setting suggests a temperate or cooler climate forest, potentially impacted by natural events such as windstorms or logging, given the presence of snapped branches and tree stumps. The sky is not visible in the picture, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the forest's interior and the vertical lines formed by the upright and fallen trees. The overall mood is somewhat somber or serene, emphasizing nature's quiet and resilience, or possibly its vulnerability.","title":"Cedar trees suffocating because of hillside erosion in olympic national timberland, Washington.
