{"path":"544676.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The image shows an industrial setting juxtaposed against a natural landscape. In the foreground, there is an expansive field covered with tall, golden-brown grasses that gently sway, likely influenced by a breeze, giving the scene a flowing texture. The natural tones of the field contrast with the more mechanical and subdued colors in the background.\n\nIn the background, an industrial complex dominates the view. This facility includes several large structures, including cylindrical silos and rectangular buildings, all interconnected with various pipes and conduits. Some of these structures have staircases wrapping around them, suggesting maintenance or access routes. The industrial complex appears active, evidenced by the large plumes of white smoke or steam billowing from tall stacks into the clear sky above. This smoke spreads across the sky, creating a stark contrast against the otherwise serene, blue backdrop.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph presents a narrative of industrial activity within a natural environment, hinting at themes of development and the human impact on landscapes. The lighting suggests the photo was taken either in the late afternoon or early evening, highlighted by the warm golden hues in the grass and the soft lighting on the industrial complex. The vast open space suggests a remote or less densely populated area. No people or moving vehicles are visible in the image, which focuses purely on the interaction between the industrial elements and the natural environment.","title":"Marsh grass and smoking factory","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["545998","545989","545971","546122","546170","555542","549191","543813","546394","552544","557374","547539","544519","545996","545013","543668"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["complex","conduit","smoke","staircase","breeze","field","silo","grass","route","access"]}
