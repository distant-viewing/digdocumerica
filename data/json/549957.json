{"path":"549957.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a large mound of debris and waste, likely at a landfill or dump site. The foreground features a hill of soil and trash, which includes various pieces of litter scattered randomly atop and across it. The colors of the debris vary, with noticeable whites, browns, and occasional pops of other colors from pieces of plastic or fabric. The top of the mound is somewhat covered with overgrowth, suggesting some age to the accumulated waste.\n\nIn the background, beyond the debris mound, a cityscape is visible, albeit partially obscured by haze or smog, emphasizing an environmental or atmospheric pollution issue. The buildings, appearing as silhouettes, include several high-rises and possibly construction cranes, suggesting ongoing development or urban sprawl.\n\nThe contrast between the natural elements (weeds and soil) and human-made elements (trash and city buildings) in the image highlights themes of environmental impact and urban encroachment. This juxtaposition starkly portrays the intrusion of waste and pollution into natural environments, concurrently with the backdrop of urban growth potentially contributing to the environmental degradation portrayed in the foreground. The overall atmosphere of the photograph conveys a somber and critical look at environmental management and urban planning.","title":"Littered embankment near Vine Street exit of I-95.
