{"path":"543854.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a woman and a young girl sitting closely together on a dirt ground. The woman is positioned behind the girl, wrapping her arms around the child, and they sit with their legs crossed. The woman appears young, possibly in her late teens or early twenties, and has her long dark hair pulled back. She wears a light green, button-up shirt. Her expression is serious as she looks directly into the camera.\n\nThe young girl, likely around four or five years old, wears a blue dress with a red waistband and small white flowers dotted on the skirt. Her dress has a white collar and a decorative white flower pinned to it. She has delicate features and wears a slightly concerned or thoughtful expression while also looking straight at the camera.\n\nThey appear to be sitting in an earthen yard or open field, and there is a grassy area behind them alongside what appears to be wooden planks or debris. The overall setting suggests a simple, perhaps rural environment. The intimacy and protective posture of the woman, combined with their expressions, evoke a sense of closeness and perhaps contemplative or solemn moods.","title":"Young migrant worker with child rests after working in sugar beet fields.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["543863","553543","550090","553496","554921","556144","543898","552931","551473","544215","553544","556145","556607","547055","558186","554900"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["girl","woman","sit","expression","twenty","teen","flower","closeness","pin","intimacy"]}
