{"path":"545304.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph shows a dilapidated, abandoned station wagon in a desolate landscape. The car is severally damaged: the front is crushed, windows shattered, and parts of its body are bent and rusted. The vehicle's doors are open or missing, and the interior is visible, looking extensively worn and vandalized. Scattered around the car are various debris including a red car seat, small fragments of metal and plastic, and other unidentifiable trash strewn across the ground.\n\nThe setting is a barren, rocky terrain with little vegetation, under a clear blue sky. In the background, a mountain range rises up, giving the scene a remote and isolated feel. The ground is covered with small stones and patches of dry grass, suggesting a harsh, arid environment. The overall mood conveyed is one of abandonment and decay, evoking a sense of forgotten history or the aftermath of an event.","title":"Abandoned car in Clear Creek Canyon, near Dumont","placename":"Dumont (Colo.)","location":"Dumont, Colorado","nn1":["552996","549107","553007","544060","553010","547484","553009","543680","554302","547587","547481","553008","544809","547601","547923","555869"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["shatter","car","forget","crush","fragment","wagon","aftermath","history","plastic","strew"]}
