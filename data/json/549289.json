{"path":"549289.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of an old wooden window on a weathered exterior wall of a building. The siding of the building is painted in a faded dark blue, and it shows signs of significant wear and flaking, indicating aging and lack of maintenance. \n\nThe window itself is a traditional double-hung style, with an upper and lower section. The upper part of the window pane is not visible in the image. The lower pane features two glass sections separated by a thin wooden mullion. There is visible wear on the white paint of the window frame, suggesting prolonged exposure to the elements.\n\nInside the window, behind the glass, a small clay pot containing a bunch of blooming yellow tulips is clearly visible. The tulips seem well-cared for and provide a stark, vibrant contrast to the peeling and run-down appearance of the window and the wall.\n\nThere's no visible activity or presence of any person in the photograph, focusing entirely on the juxtaposition of new life (the tulips) against the backdrop of decay (the window and wall). This composition might evoke themes of hope, resilience, or beauty amidst decay.","title":"Peeling paint on this Neptune Road house typifies neglect of exterior home maintenance by residents of this neighborhood interiors, however, are well kept up. Neptune Road borders immediately upon Logan Airport. Residents do not feel that the expense of complete maintenance is justified, when they could lose their homes to Massport (Massachusetts Port Authority) at a fraction of their value.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["547299","548246","548232","543028","551753","552510","548656","543132","552745","543348","544997","558025","555082","552530","549193","544281"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["window","pane","wall","decay","clay","section","glass","pot","aging","paint"]}
