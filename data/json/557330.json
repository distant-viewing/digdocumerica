{"path":"557330.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph shows a group of contemporary buildings situated in a barren, rocky landscape under a largely clear sky with a few scattered clouds. The foreground prominently features numerous small rocks and gravel, indicating a dry, possibly arid environment.\n\nThe buildings highlighted in the image have a distinct, modern architectural style with sharp angles and primarily wooden exteriors. The nearest building is equipped with large solar panels on its slanted roof, suggesting an emphasis on sustainable energy practices. It has an oversized porch or overhang sheltering what appear to be entrances or large windows.\n\nFurther back, two similar structures can be seen, both matching in style and color but varying slightly in size and design details. One of them, like the first, features a large solar panel array on its roof, reinforcing the theme of environmental consciousness. There are no visible traditional energy sources such as power lines, which could imply a self-sustaining setup.\n\nA notable detail is the lack of vegetation and minimal human activity, which along with the buildings' features suggests a focus on sustainability and possibly research or residential usage tailored for harsh environments. The absence of bustling activity or lush landscapes gives the picture a serene yet starkly utilitarian feel.","title":"Solar heating and cooling demonstration project, which is funded by the National Science Foundation","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["555319","555320","555307","555308","555321","555318","557329","544816","548760","547664","555294","555331","555306","547652","556623","545809"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["panel","energy","sustainability","self","overhang","usage","building","roof","practice","gravel"]}
