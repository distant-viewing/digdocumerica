{"path":"553654.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This image presents a concrete dam structure installed across a flowing river. The photograph captures the dam in an almost centered position within the frame. The dam consists of several robust, vertical cylindrical columns that support a horizontal slab, which forms the main platform of the dam. Two large, distinctive black mechanisms are mounted on this platform; they appear to be some form of gate or water control mechanisms, possibly used to regulate water flow or to redirect water. These mechanical structures project upwards and have gear-like components on the top, suggestive of their operation by rotating these gears.\n\nThe body of water passing under the dam is turbulent, indicating the river's substantial flow rate and possibly suggesting recent rainfall or controlled water release from the dam. The scene is shot during a time of day when the sky is partly cloudy, casting shadows over some parts of the dam, resulting in contrasting areas of light and shadow.\n\nIn the background, beyond the river, there is lush, green vegetation, typical of a riverbank ecosystem. A hill or mountain slopes upward from this vegetation, completing the background with a touch of natural ruggedness. The contrast between the man-made structure and the natural environment encapsulates a typical interaction of human engineering with nature aimed at water management and resource use.","title":"Part of the truckee river is diverted by derby dam into an irrigation canal which flows through fallon to the lahontan reservoir and ends in the carson sink and stillwater marches.
