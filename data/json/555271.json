{"path":"555271.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures an expansive, busy cargo port area filled with rows of colorful shipping containers. Some containers are stacked, while others are arranged in long single-row formations aligned with the railroad tracks that crisscross the port. The scene includes multiple tracks that stretch across the composition, suggesting a major logistical hub.\n\nVisible throughout the port are various types of cargo-handling equipment, including large cranes and trucks equipped to lift and transport containers. To the right and in the foreground, a particular crane is prominent, possibly in the process of loading or unloading a container.\n\nThe containers themselves display a variety of colors and some have visible company logos, indicating the global nature of shipping and trade that takes place here. The area is tightly packed, showing an efficient use of space typical of port operations.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate confines of the port, there are hints of a city skyline and open sky, suggesting that this port is near a large urban area. The lighting in the photo indicates either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and enhancing the industrial atmosphere of the port. The overall composition captures the essence of global trade and the vital role that such ports play in the movement of goods worldwide.","title":"Shipping containers cover the docks at the port of Newark New Jersey.
