{"path":"551735.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a casual outdoor scene in a park setting involving three children interacting with a large tree next to a wooden bench. A person, more visible from the waist down due to perspective, is partially up the tree, balancing on a thick branch and holding onto another branch above. This person is wearing blue jeans and brown shoes.\n\nOn the bench, another child stands looking up at the person in the tree. This child is wearing a white long-sleeve top, tucked into brown trousers, and appears to be attentively watching the climbing activity.\n\nA third child, dressed in a blue jean jacket and jeans with striped sneakers, is walking away from the bench towards the left side of the frame, glancing back toward the other two children.\n\nThe setting is lush and green, with the tree in full leaf, indicating spring or summer. It appears to be a well-kept area with a path or road in the background suggested by partial views of a curb and paved surfaces. The scene captures a moment of leisure and playful discovery common in park environments.","title":"In prospect park, Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549274","551734","545311","557410","554899","543791","552033","548492","547188","555546","557983","544739","543238","551681","556290","543466"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","bench","person","jeans","glance","discovery","climbing","branch","sneaker","waist"]}
