{"path":"549426.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and exciting sailboat racing scene. The image focuses on a large sailboat tilted to one side due to the force of the wind in its massive white sail, which fills the majority of the frame. On the sailboat, two individuals are engaging in sailing activities. Towards the bow, one person, wearing red shorts and a white shirt, confidently stands on the very edge of the boat, leaning into the wind and appearing to hold onto a cable or rail for balance. Another person, closer to the midway point of the boat, wears a yellow rain jacket and stabilizes themselves against the boatâ€™s incline while managing the sail or handling other equipment.\n\nThe background shows a cloudy and possibly overcast sky, blending into a dark, choppy sea that sprays water around as the boat cuts through it. Other sailboats are visible at different distances in the background, implying a competitive or communal sailing event.\n\nThe composition conveys movement and the thrill of sailing with an action-oriented, slightly precarious stance of the figures, emphasizing the adventure and skills involved in the sport. The angle of the sailboat and the diagonally captured sail in the frame add a strong sense of motion and urgency to the scene.","title":"On chesapeake bay in the early hours of the Annapolis-Newport race, a biennial sailing event","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549404","549394","549405","549421","549388","548526","549425","549389","549400","548513","549082","547463","549424","549430","547450","549406"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","sail","boat","sailing","wind","thrill","racing","incline","urgency","skill"]}
