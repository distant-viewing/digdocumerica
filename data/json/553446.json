{"path":"553446.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a lively, sunny day at a lake beach. The setting includes a variety of people, mostly children and some adults, engaged in various activities by the water. On the sandy beach, young children can be seen digging and playing with the sand. Several are using bright colored buckets and shovels, likely building sandcastles or exploring the texture of the wet sand.\n\nIn the water, there are more children and a few adults. Most of the children are wading or splashing around in the shallow parts, while others are slightly deeper, swimming or floating with the aid of inflatable rings. A few adults are standing in the water, supervising or interacting with the children. The clear, calm lake reflects a gentle ripple, indicating a light breeze or the movement of the swimmers.\n\nThe background features lush green trees and several European-style houses and buildings, suggesting the photograph may have been taken in a quaint town setting. The houses look old and well-maintained, painted in neutral tones, and several have prominent, steep roofs.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a sense of community and relaxation, capturing a typical summer day where families gather to enjoy the outdoor environment and engage in water-based activities. It gives a nostalgic feel, possibly suggesting that it was taken in the mid to late 20th century, highlighting a moment of simple, joyous leisure.","title":"Here at clinton, in the first quarter mile from its origin below the wachusett reservoir, the Nashua river is still safe for swimming","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553447","557772","551543","558233","554499","554476","554618","544442","545267","550228","553431","543892","546874","550243","550827","547009"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","adult","sand","swimmer","beach","supervise","lake","wade","ring","shovel"]}
