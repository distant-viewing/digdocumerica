{"path":"544619.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a butterfly perched delicately on the petals of a small white and yellow flower. The butterfly, with wings mostly closed, displays a rich tapestry of markings in shades of brown intersected by a network of white lines that form a stunning, almost mosaic-like pattern. Its antennae and part of its body are visible, showing fine details of its delicate structure.\n\nThe flower itself is simple yet elegant, featuring a cluster of small yellow buds surrounded by white petals that radiate outwards. It appears to be a daisy-like flower, but smaller and more delicate, possibly a wild variety. The flower is attached to a stem with several green leaves which have a slightly rugged texture, characteristic of wild foliage.\n\nThe background is beautifully soft and blurred, predominantly dark with hints of green, which helps to highlight the subject at the forefrontâ€”the butterfly and the flower. This artistic choice ensures the viewer's focus remains on the intricate patterns of the butterfly's wings and the subtle details of the flower.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its emphasis on nature's intricate details and the tranquility of the scene, evokes a sense of calm and appreciation for the smaller wonders of the natural world. The lighting is soft, likely natural, enhancing the texture and color depth of the butterfly and the flower, making this a visually soothing and aesthetically pleasing photograph.","title":"Butterfly and wild flowers in Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["544553","544479","543603","544618","544514","544517","547818","544614","551381","544603","544566","554839","543623","548283","555035","554842"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","flower","wing","petal","daisy","detail","wonder","radiate","bud","appreciation"]}
