{"path":"551501.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This image features two ducks perched on a jagged rock that protrudes from a body of water, possibly a river or lake. On the left, one duck stands upright and appears alert, looking off to the side. This duck has a distinct plumage pattern with what seems like brighter colors possibly indicating it is male. The duck on the right is slightly turned away and appears to be more relaxed or at ease. This duck has more muted tones in its plumage, which might suggest it is female.\n\nThe background is out of focus, lending all attention to the ducks. It hints at a natural setting with possibly rough, rocky terrain hinted at in the soft blur of browns and grays. The water surrounding the rock is calm and the lighting suggests this image was captured under natural sunlight, possibly during the golden hours of early morning or late afternoon, enhancing the warm tones of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition focuses tightly on the ducks and the rock, using a shallow depth of field to soften the background and highlight the subjects. The image captures a serene moment in nature, highlighting the beauty and calm of wildlife in their natural habitat.","title":"Ducks perch on rock in the middle of the Mississippi river","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["543663","552221","548542","553408","555551","552993","551377","558092","543918","553346","557490","546086","557120","548840","557122","549553"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["duck","plumage","rock","ease","perch","soften","protrude","hour","calm","habitat"]}
