{"path":"552030.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph shows a large industrial or transport-related structure. This structure has a unique, sweeping arched roof supported by a framework that is visible through the building's open side. The roof appears to be covered in dark material and is quite large in comparison to other elements in the photo.\n\nThere is no significant activity within the frame; however, several vehicles, which look like trucks or possibly construction vehicles, are parked under the structure, suggesting ongoing work or usage. The setting has a somewhat barren appearance, with few other buildings or natural landscapes visible. Instead, the background is dominated by a clear sky and the construction, or perhaps storage, is enclosed by what looks like a high fence with sheets or tarpaulin blocking direct view into or out of the area.\n\nThe ground in the foreground is uneven and covered in patches of grass and dirt, indicating the area may not be meticulously maintained. This gives the space an industrial and utilitarian ambiance, concentrating purely on functionality rather than aesthetics.","title":"New city auditorium, under construction in downtown Niagara Falls","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["546189","543575","557390","546160","546148","555328","555779","546701","549726","547528","551586","553892","556390","556978","546085","556350"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Transportation Hubs"],"terms":["comparison","construction","sheet","usage","roof","functionality","vehicle","framework","transport","aesthetic"]}
