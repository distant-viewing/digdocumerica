{"path":"545769.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"In this photograph, a woman appears to be engaging in an outdoor climbing activity within a rocky, desert-like environment. The woman, who has a cheerful expression, is seated and suspended in mid-air, supported by climbing ropes. She is holding onto one of the ropes with her left hand. She's dressed in casual, rugged outdoor attire: a dark long-sleeve top, gray trousers, and sturdy brown hiking boots. Her climbing gear includes a harness and some carabiners attached around her waist.\n\nThe setting is a narrow canyon or rock formation with reddish-brown walls that enclose the scene. The rock above her forms a sort of archway, curving overhead. The background reveals a sunlit, arid landscape with more rock formations and a clear blue sky. The light casts shadows, highlighting the textures and contours of the rocky surfaces around her. The composition of the photo, with its perspective from within the shade looking out towards the brightly lit exterior, suggests a sense of adventure and exploration within a rugged terrain.","title":"Descending into the maze from near Chimney Rock, using mountaineers' \"rappeling\" technique. In this remote region of the canyonlands there are no trails and no means of access except by rope and, sometimes, by steps cut in the rock.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545785","545773","545777","544906","552334","545697","545599","544924","545781","545768","545300","553370","544902","545776","545595","544931"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["climbing","rope","rock","formation","harness","archway","waist","overhead","hiking","canyon"]}
