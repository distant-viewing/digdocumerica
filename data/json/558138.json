{"path":"558138.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a wooden signpost with multiple directional signs, each indicating a different location along with the distance to that location. The signs are stacked vertically on a central pole, pointing in various directions. They appear to be hand-painted in white on a dark, possibly black background. The text on the signs is in German.\n\nStarting from the top, the signs list the following destinations:\n- \"Domeier's\"\n- \"Hermannsdenkmal 3 km\"\n- \"Stadtmitte 1 km\"\n- \"Berlin 8571 km\"\n- \"Berchtesgaden 8100 km\"\n- \"Duluth Private College 3\"\n- \"MÃ¼nchen (Munich) 7956 km\"\n- \"Bahnhof 1 km\" (meaning train station)\n- \"Mittenwald 8047 km\"\n- \"Flughafen 155 km\" (meaning airport)\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly focused, showing lush green trees, suggesting that the signpost is possibly located in a park or a rural setting. The composition and the handwritten style of the signs add a charming and rustic character to the image.","title":"Signpost in the yard of the domeier grocery store, a neighborhood business, on south Minnesota street in New Ulm Minnesota.
