{"path":"545715.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of several anemone buds, captured in a silhouette against a strongly backlit setting. The light source behind the buds highlights their contours and tiny hair-like structures on their stems and buds, creating a dramatic contrast. The buds and foliage are finely detailed and sharply focused, showing distinct texture, while the background is deeply shadowed, enhancing the visual effect of the illuminated edges of the plants. The dense grouping of the buds suggests a lush environment, albeit not directly visible due to the lighting and focus technique. The overall mood conveys a sense of tranquility and the delicate complexity of nature.","title":"Pasque flowers-this early blooming spring flower survives the late snow storms of the Rocky Mountains.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["557617","555055","555106","557593","553366","553368","553588","554587","543623","554576","544875","544586","555189","557618","555053","555052"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["bud","grouping","technique","stem","close","source","complexity","up","contour","silhouette"]}
