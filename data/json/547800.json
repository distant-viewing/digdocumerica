{"path":"547800.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a poignant scene at a cemetery. The central focus is a grave marker, which bears the name \"Thomas W. Ferguson,\" with details indicating his service as a Private First Class (PFC) in the U.S. Marine Corps from Texas, who served during the Vietnam era, born on November 7, 1946, and passing in March 1988. The marker is adorned with a vibrant bouquet of red, white, and blue flowers, likely symbolizing American patriotism. Beside the grave, an American flag is planted into the ground, its stripes blurred likely due to a slight breeze.\n\nThe setting is a grassy area with numerous other graves visible in the background, each marked similarly with individual gravestones and adorned with floral arrangements or flags. Large trees line the edges of the area, adding a serene, green backdrop under a cloudy sky. The image uses a fisheye lens effect, which curves the horizon and gives a wide-angle view of the environment, emphasizing the solemn and respectful atmosphere of the cemetery.","title":"Vietnam soldier's grave in Van Zandt Haven of Memories Cemetery in Longview","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["547791","544427","544423","550364","552531","544267","546098","555566","547417","547801","546147","544259","546106","545314","545322","554448"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["grave","cemetery","marker","flag","patriotism","gravestone","lens","breeze","stripe","name"]}
