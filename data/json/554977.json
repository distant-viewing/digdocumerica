{"path":"554977.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, venerable tree situated in a dense, misty forest setting. The tree itself is impressive with a notably thick trunk featuring multiple offshoots. Some of these offshoots are intertwined or warped, adding to the tree's ancient and rugged appearance. The surface of the bark looks richly textured and covered with moss, suggesting a damp, cool environment typical of a temperate rainforest.\n\nAround the base of the tree, lush ferns and smaller forest plants can be seen, adding layers of greenery at the lower section of the image and emphasizing the fertility of the soil. The background hints at the thickness of the forest, with various other trees visible among a slight fog or mist, enhancing the ethereal, secluded quality of the setting.\n\nThe photograph captures the essence of a natural, untouched forest ecosystem with a focus on a singular, majestic tree that seems to be a sentinel of the woods.","title":"Sitka spruce growing through and from a nurse stump which is 400 to 700 years old.
