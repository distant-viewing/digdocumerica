{"path":"548428.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of an airport with various activities and structures visible. The image showcases multiple airplanes, some parked at gates with jet bridges connected, while others are taxiing or situated in parking areas. One prominently featured airplane is painted with the \"United\" logo. There are several airport buildings including terminals and control towers, and additional structures that may serve for radar or communications, evident by a large white spherical radar dome on the foreground right.\n\nThe airport has multiple runways and taxiways, which appear well-maintained and marked with signs and ground lights. The scene is set against a broad sweeping view of the horizon that suggests a coastal or flat landscape beyond the airport perimeter. No people are visible in the photo, emphasizing the scale and infrastructure of the airport rather than human activity. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with long shadows and soft light illuminating the scene. The overall composition gives a sense of organized movement and the complexity of airport operations.","title":"Logan Airport--control tower and runways seen from 16th floor observation deck","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548430","556932","554092","550104","553731","548487","548429","547237","550554","548130","548166","548433","547824","548444","548782","547951"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airport","airplane","runway","terminal","taxi","perimeter","gate","jet","communication","dome"]}
