{"path":"546034.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features an urban street scene focused mainly on a vividly decorated storefront named \"Atlas Furniture Co.\" This eccentrically styled furniture store is lavishly adorned with numerous handwritten and hand-painted signs offering various deals and advertising products such as furniture, appliances, and air conditioners. The entirety of the store's fa√ßade is densely packed with these colorful signs, coupled with a plethora of flags and pennants strung above and around the store, adding a festive yet chaotic feel to the scene.\n\nThe building itself appears to be a two-story structure, likely repurposed into a commercial space, surrounded by other urban houses and establishments. One side of the store joins directly onto what looks like a residential building.\n\nIn the foreground, a man casually walks by, captured mid-stride. He wears a light-colored short sleeve shirt, dark pants, and a hat, and is carrying a light-colored bag. His presence adds a dynamic element to the scene, emphasizing the everyday nature of the environment despite the store's visually bombarding aesthetics.\n\nThe street is typical of an urban area, complete with a paved road, sidewalks, and typical street infrastructure such as a streetlamp and a parking meter. The whole atmosphere of the photograph portrays a vibrant, bustling urban community with a notable sense of local character and commercial enterprise.","title":"Small retail businesses on st.
