{"path":"546026.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set during evening or dusk where a group of people, possibly friends or family, are gathered around a large conical structure that appears to be made of wooden sticks and branches. It resembles a type of bonfire or ceremonial pyre, possibly awaiting lighting. A total of four individuals are visible around the structure. Their activities and postures suggest a casual, interactive moment, likely involving the construction or inspection of the structure. \n\nThe environment around them includes a clear sky and sparse, leafless trees suggesting the season could be late autumn or early winter. The lighting implies that the sun is setting, casting a dim blue hue over the scene, enhancing the tranquil and somewhat solemn mood of the photograph. On the left side, thereâ€™s a long object that looks like a bench or a piece of wood lying horizontally at the ground level. The overall tone and setting give an impression of a rural or wilderness area, suitable for outdoor gatherings and activities like this.","title":"The people of the small levee towns between New Orleans and Baton Rouge compete each year for the largest bonfire.","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["557028","548792","551431","551399","545778","553950","551315","554667","551402","548568","546013","548988","557207","546018","554510","544406"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["total","stick","inspection","friend","bench","family","autumn","winter","wilderness","season"]}
