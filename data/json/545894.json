{"path":"545894.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene featuring an adult horse and a foal in a vibrant, flower-speckled field. The adult horse, appearing brown in color, stands elegantly with its head turned slightly towards the right. In contrast, the foal, predominantly white with distinct black patches, stands close to the adult horse, facing the left side of the frame with its head turned back slightly.\n\nThe setting is a flourishing meadow abundant with yellow flowers dotted with a few other colored blossoms, indicating the lushness of spring or summer. In the backdrop, the horizon is mildly sloped and, along with a largely clear sky, hints at a tranquil, open landscape. The light and shadows suggest it could either be late afternoon or early morning, contributing to the overall peaceful and idyllic atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the subjects located centered horizontally and the line of the horizon near the top third of the frame, draws the viewer's attention directly to the horses, emphasizing their positions and connection in this open, natural setting. The image conveys a sense of intimacy and calmness, highlighting the bond between the adult horse and the foal in their picturesque environment.","title":"Mare nursing colt","placename":"Austin (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Texas","nn1":["545890","542619","542972","542622","551229","551327","543678","556958","543726","557186","553064","552501","543784","557988","553116","543788"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["horse","adult","head","bond","flower","lushness","blossom","intimacy","meadow","third"]}
