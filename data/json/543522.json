{"path":"543522.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lake scene, set against a backdrop of majestic, snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky. The lake appears calm and vast, with its waters extending to the horizon. On the right foreground, there's a group of four people in a canoe that's partially on the shore and partially in the water. Three of the individuals are shirtless men, possibly engaging in a conversation or preparing to row, while the fourth, a clothed woman, sits facing them, possibly steering the boat.\n\nThe left foreground features another canoe with two people, both paddling. It's further into the water compared to the first canoe. The surroundings are natural and serene, with small, rocky land extensions into the water and sparse vegetation visible around the edges of the lake. The overall ambiance is peaceful, suggesting a leisurely day of boating in a beautiful, remote setting.","title":"Scum on Lake Tahoe","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552982","544031","544759","554610","550822","543537","543626","543533","554609","543579","554516","552978","543548","557571","544770","550674"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["canoe","lake","extension","water","snow","people","shore","conversation","land","boat"]}
