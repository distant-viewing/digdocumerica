{"path":"550287.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural landscape under a vibrant sky. It features a central church with a tall, white steeple that contrasts with the deep blue sky dotted with fluffy, white clouds. The church building is classic in its design, painted white, with a small portico at the front entrance.\n\nTo the left of the church, there is a smaller white building resembling a typical New England style home, adding to the quaint and peaceful setting. Both structures are surrounded by lush greenery, including dense trees and a well-maintained lawn that extends into the foreground, serving as a meadow or field.\n\nThe background is dominated by a line of dense forest, which acts as a natural boundary and adds a touch of wilderness to this pastoral scene. The composition captures the tranquility of a smaller community, nestled in a natural environment that suggests a slow-paced and harmonious way of life. The overall atmosphere is calm and picturesque, typical of rural American landscapes.","title":"Western Reserve Village, an historic preservation at Hale Homestead","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557952","556480","547440","546455","554035","557951","554207","554033","547343","557758","557088","558024","547324","547346","557954","554208"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["church","steeple","meadow","boundary","lawn","entrance","way","wilderness","home","touch"]}
