{"path":"546381.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of three individuals engaged in dumping and burning waste. They are located in a rugged outdoor setting, which appears to be a makeshift dumping ground. In the foreground, an old, blue pickup truck is visible; its bed is partially filled with garbage. Two men are standing in the bed of the truck. One, wearing a white T-shirt and dark pants, is using a shovel, likely to move trash. The other, in a brown shirt and darker pants, is also holding a tool, possibly assisting in the manipulation of the waste.\n\nOn the left side of the truck, there's a person in a pink shirt, partially inside the vehicle's cab, reaching towards the dashboard or passenger side.\n\nIn the background, large plumes of black smoke rise into the air from multiple spots where trash is actively burning, creating a stark contrast with the natural surroundings. The smoke suggests the burning of a variety of materials, likely contributing to environmental pollution.\n\nThe scene is set against a backdrop of greenery and a hazy blue sky, hinting that this location might be on the outskirts of a rural area. The ground around the truck is littered with more waste and debris, indicating this area is used regularly for trash disposal by burning. The environment conveys a sense of neglect and lack of proper waste management infrastructure.","title":"Burning garbage at an open dump on Highway 112","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546377","543824","551242","550702","549949","551243","545600","550248","542549","546761","543828","549936","543832","542550","554541","549743"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","truck","trash","bed","burning","dashboard","smoke","cab","shovel","shirt"]}
