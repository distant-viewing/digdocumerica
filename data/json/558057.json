{"path":"558057.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a sprawling suburban landscape marked by plenty of greenery and residential areas. The image mainly shows an array of detached houses surrounded by lush gardens and trees, mostly in shades of green, indicating a season of growth with some hints of autumnal color changes in the trees to orange and red hues.\n\nProminently running through the center of the photo is a straight road lined with vehicles, which diminish in density as the road extends further into the distance. The street is flanked by sidewalks and additional minor roads branching off into neighborhoods. Along this main road, there are scattered commercial buildings identifiable by their larger, flat roofs compared to the pitched roofs of the residential homes.\n\nThe area is primarily residential in nature, but the presence of some commercial properties suggests this might be a small town or suburban setting that's well-developed and organized. The overall layout hints at careful urban planning, with clear zoning of residential and lighter commercial areas. There are no visible signs of industrial zones in this part of the photograph.\n\nTowards the edges of the photo, the density of the trees increases, suggesting the presence of parks or less-developed land surrounding the inhabited areas. This setup creates a buffer of natural spaces around the residential zones, enhancing the aesthetic and possibly the environmental quality of the area.","title":"Aerial view of Peninsula, Ohio, located north of Akron looking west at the center of town and Main Street (Ohio Highway 303).
