{"path":"551565.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a large water body intersected by jetties and watercraft. In the image, two prominent jetties extend into the water, creating narrow paths that seem to direct the current. Between these jetties, a large commercial vessel with multiple visible barges attached is seen navigating the waters. The barges are densely packed together, forming a significant floating structure.\n\nThe water shows a distinct color variation, illustrating a mixing of different water flows; one side appears darker, hinting at deeper or cleaner water, while the area around the vessel has a brownish hue, possibly indicating sediment or pollution. Surrounding the water are patches of green land with little to no development visible, suggesting that this area may be relatively remote or reserved for environmental conservation or industrial use.\n\nThe perspective of the photograph includes a part of the aircraft from which the photo was taken, seen in the top left corner. This detail, along with the expansive overview, emphasizes the height from which the photo was shot, giving a comprehensive perspective over this aquatic and landscape interaction.","title":"Clay washed from the banks of the nemadji river gives brownish orange color to the waters of superior harbor basin darker color near docks comes from spillage occurring when iron ore is loaded on ships at burlington northern railroad docks","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["551599","545830","552020","544643","544636","551991","548201","551980","544650","552205","549470","552206","551564","551976","551990","549814"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["jetty","barge","water","vessel","cleaner","watercraft","deeper","shoot","overview","reserve"]}
