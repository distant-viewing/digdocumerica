{"path":"553263.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a unique and visually intriguing scene. A person is sitting on the ground, possibly adjusting or manipulating a piece of technical equipment which is designed to illuminate a large, cylindrical, inflated structure. The structure is quite prominent; it is made of a translucent material with a pale pink hue and stretches across the background of the image tracing a gentle curve.\n\nTo the left, beyond the inflatable structure, there are lush green trees that hint at a park or similarly leafy setting. The sky above appears to be dusky, suggesting this might be in the late evening.\n\nForegrounding the scene on the right, part of another pinkish object is visible which appears to be part of the inflatable setup, partially framing the shot. This section casts a graduated shadow that adds a layer of depth to the composition.\n\nLighting plays a crucial role in this photograph; spotlights placed on the ground cast a bright, cool light against the base of the inflatable structure, contrasting with the overall warmer tones of the setting and enhancing the surreal nature of the scene. The placement of light and shadow, combined with the unusual scale and placement of the inflate structure, gives this photograph an otherworldly feel.","title":"D'aug days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, fountain square.
