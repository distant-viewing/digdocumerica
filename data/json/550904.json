{"path":"550904.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features the bow of a large ship, which is identified by the text painted across it as the \"Exxon Baltimore\" from Wilmington DE. The ship, mostly in grey, features a lot of small windows, decks, and machinery on the upper part which is partly visible in the photo. The funnel of the ship appears prominently in the frame, painted with the Exxon logo in red and white, which stands out against the largely muted colors of the ship.\n\nMultiple seagulls are flying around just above the waterâ€™s surface in front of the ship, and some of them are in motion blur. The waves crashing against the hull create dynamic splashes, emphasizing that the vessel is in a maritime environment. The ship casts a strong shadow down onto the water indicating strong sunlight, possibly suggesting midday or early afternoon. The focus and composition give a sense of the ship's large scale and industrial purpose.","title":"Seagulls swoop for food in the churning wake of an oil tanker in the Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550898","550895","550897","544657","550891","550918","546804","548201","551581","548126","557819","551990","551558","546860","548393","547056"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","pain","crashe","funnel","seagull","midday","wafe","identify","fly","bow"]}
