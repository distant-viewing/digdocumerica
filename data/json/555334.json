{"path":"555334.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures two men inside what appears to be a control room filled with various electronic equipment and instruments. The room has a utilitarian, somewhat dated design, indicative of mid-to-late 20th century technology, with large analog dials, switches, and displays.\n\nOne man is wearing a white short-sleeve shirt with a name tag and is positioned slightly in the foreground, looking off to the side thoughtfully. His posture is relaxed but attentive. The other, in a striped dress shirt and tie, stands further in the background. He too looks off to the side, his arms crossed, suggesting a moment of decision or observation.\n\nThe equipment surrounding them features prominently in the image; large circular gauges, panels filled with knobs, and illuminated displays offer a complex backdrop, indicating the technical nature of their environment. The colors are muted, with shades of gray and green dominating the space, punctuated by the occasional red object.\n\nThe lighting is subdued and functional, coming from overhead fixtures, shining directly on the equipment and the individuals, highlighting their expressions and the details of the machinery. The overall setting suggests a serious, professional atmosphere, commonly seen in industrial or scientific facilities of the era.","title":"Engineers inside the test cab of the solar furnace facility operated for the u.s.
