{"path":"542990.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene centered on a water treatment process or a similar industrial activity involving water. The focal point is an open, rectangular water channel filled with moving water. On the left side, a metal bar runs alongside top of the channel, from which water is bubbling and spilling over onto the channel's edge, creating a frothy, turbulent flow.\n\nAbove the water channel, a metal framework is visible, likely part of the machinery used to regulate or control the flow of water. The colors in the image are dark and moody, predominantly deep blues and purples, suggesting the photo might have been taken either during twilight or under artificial lighting.\n\nThe water's surface reflects the light sources, adding a glistening texture to the image. The entire scene is enclosed, giving it a somewhat secretive or isolated feel, typical of industrial areas or facilities not usually accessible to the public. The photograph does not feature any people, focusing entirely on the interplay of the machine elements and the water.","title":"Sewage treatment","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553901","543810","550720","542988","547568","549564","544052","544040","551180","557247","548212","543649","546907","555794","550684","542982"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["channel","water","flow","public","bar","treatment","metal","purple","source","twilight"]}
