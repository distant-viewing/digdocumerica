The photograph captures a moment where an individual is examining various sea creatures collected atop a wooden sieve-like tray floating in water, probably used for sifting or sorting marine specimens.\n\nThe person, who is seen from the waist down, is dressed in casual beach attire, wearing red and white striped shorts. He is holding a small collection of marine organisms in his left hand, inviting a close inspection. The creatures appear to include crabs and shells, indicating a diverse and rich marine ecosystem possibly being studied or explored.\n\nThe tray is filled with a variety of other marine life, emphasizing the abundance and diversity of species being collected. The backdrop of the image is slightly out of focus, suggesting a natural outdoor setting near a body of water. The lighting is soft yet clear, enhancing the vividness of the scene.\n\nThe general atmosphere evoked by the photograph is one of curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge about marine biodiversity, conducted in a natural, possibly coastal environment. This image effectively documents a moment of active engagement with the natural world, likely aimed at understanding or cataloging marine species.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory: field trip to a salt marsh personnel are washing and sifting bottom mud and sand for marine life","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["552290","545077","547504","548714","543181","546334","549326","549588","549598","546304","546350","549615","545208","552289","555832","557481"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["tray","creature","collect","specie","organism","crab","specimen","pursuit","biodiversity","abundance"]}
