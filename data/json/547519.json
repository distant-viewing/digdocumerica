{"path":"547519.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil and scenic view featuring a body of calm water, likely a river or lake, reflecting the surrounding landscape. On the left side of the frame, dense foliage including a variety of trees, some in the early stages of leafing and others bare, lines the water's edge. One tree in particular, with white bark (possibly a birch), leans markedly towards the water, adding a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nIn the middle and to the right, the focus shifts to a large, old industrial building situated close to the water's edge. This building, characterized by its brick construction and large windows, is typical of early 20th-century industrial architecture. A tall chimney stands as part of this facility, suggesting that it may be a factory or a power plant. The building is reflected partially in the water, enhancing the serene and slightly nostalgic atmosphere of the scene.\n\nFurther enhancing the image, there is visible sky which appears slightly overcast, casting a soft light over the landscape and lending an overall sense of calm and stillness to the scene. No people or moving objects interrupt this peaceful setting, making it an ideal representation of quiet industrial heritage juxtaposed with natural beauty.","title":"Textile mill on the pawtuxet river","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["552040","553393","557377","552139","546007","556504","557376","552194","549555","546118","547807","551519","553462","552070","547890","550332"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["birch","heritage","bare","water","representation","shift","20th","bark","edge","stillness"]}
