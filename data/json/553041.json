{"path":"553041.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial or waste disposal scene. In the foreground, there is a red pickup truck on the right side, partially visible. The truck is in a state of disrepair; its paint is heavily chipped and faded. The bed of the truck is filled with various pieces of disorganized material. To the left and in front of the truck, there are numerous cardboard boxes and other refuse scattered across the ground. The cardboard boxes appear used and contain random discarded items.\n\nIn the middle ground, there's an earth-moving machine, possibly a bulldozer or an excavator, actively working on a dug-out trench. The presence of machinery suggests ongoing work, likely related to excavation or waste management.\n\nIn the background, a series of man-made earthen mounds are lined up parallel to each other in a continuing pattern extending away from the foreground. The overall setting seems to be in an open area with little to no vegetation visible, possibly indicating a landfill or an industrial site used for waste processing or disposal. The sky overhead is cloudy, casting a somber tone over the scene.","title":"Solid waste is dumped into trenches at a sanitary landfill (from the Documerica-1 exhibition.
