{"path":"543619.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic and moody winter scene with a natural water feature, possibly a hot spring, in the foreground. The water is partially frozen and has striking ice formations and vibrant colors ranging from deep blue to murky green, suggesting geothermal activity.\n\nSurrounding the water are snowy and icy patches, with pine trees densely packed around the area. These trees are coated lightly with snow, indicating recent snowfall. The background reveals a gentle slope covered with more trees and sporadic snow patches, which then lead up to hazy, snow-covered hills in the far distance.\n\nThe sky is overcast, and snowflakes can be seen falling, contributing to a serene yet somewhat bleak wintery atmosphere. The overall mood is tranquil and raw, capturing the essence of a remote, cold natural landscape.","title":"Frozen lake shore","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543656","543770","543766","544901","557180","557199","543755","550588","543550","545923","557195","557608","543610","542526","545647","557200"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snow","wintery","freeze","snowfall","ice","strike","patch","essence","winter","spring"]}
