{"path":"545104.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph is a scenic landscape shot capturing a picturesque coastal area during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft, golden lighting. The image is composed primarily of a winding highway to the left which curves gently and leads the eye towards a distant coastal town. The highway features two lanes separated by a white line, bordered by guardrails, and nestled between grassy slopes and wooded hills.\n\nIn the foreground, the side of the road is lined with dry grass and shrubs, indicating a natural, undeveloped terrain. To the right, the landscape slopes downwards towards a body of water that reflects the sky, surrounded by patches of sand and grasslands.\n\nIn the background, the focal point is a charming coastal town situated right at the edge of a large body of water, possibly a river estuary or a coastal inlet. Beyond the town, the coastline is dotted with several rocky outcroppings protruding from the water, creating small islands. These elements contribute to a tranquil and somewhat isolated feel, offering a glimpse of a serene, natural environment coexisting alongside human habitation.\n\nThe overall composition and vantage point suggest that the photograph may have been taken from a higher elevation alongside the highway, capturing both the man-made elements of the road and the natural beauty of the coastal environment in one harmonious scene.","title":"Oregon--near Coos Bay","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["543424","557524","548143","543435","545918","557529","553774","545105","557465","542918","554170","557482","545110","543427","548144","543362"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["highway","town","coastal","outcropping","slope","estuary","guardrail","inlet","charming","downward"]}
