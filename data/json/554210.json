{"path":"554210.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of an ornate tombstone located in a cemetery. The tombstone, constructed of weathered granite or similar stone, is etched with decorative elements and text. At the top, there is an intricate carving of a leafy branch and a circular inset that houses a black and white portrait photograph of a woman with light-colored hair.\n\nThe main body of the tombstone is inscribed with the text \"MOMRAK\", followed by the name \"Alma Geline\" and her dates: \"Jan. 27, 1887\" and \"Oct. 25, 1918\". Beneath the dates, the epitaph reads \"May She Rest in Peace.\" This inscription suggests that the tombstone marks the grave of Alma Geline Momrak, who lived from 1887 to 1918.\n\nThe base of the tombstone is adorned with a placement of vividly colored artificial flowers—red roses, specifically—intermixed with green fern-like foliage, which adds a touch of color and remembrance to the grave site.\n\nIn the background, hints of a green, well-maintained grassy area can be seen, typical of a cemetery setting. Occasional sunlit patches suggest the presence of trees around, contributing to a serene and peaceful environment. The lighting and condition implies that the photo might have been taken during daytime, under natural sunlight.","title":"In the graveyard of St. Pietro's 57-year old Lutheran church at Grygla.
