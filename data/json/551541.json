{"path":"551541.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photo captures a serene sailing scene taken at what appears to be sunset. The image is dominated by a small sailboat with two occupants, backlit by the setting sun, creating silhouetted figures against a warm glow. The sail of the boat is strikingâ€”it has a vibrant red color that beautifully contrasts with the softer tones of the surrounding scene. \n\nThe background is softly focused, featuring the subtle outlines of trees or bushes on the distant shore that are mostly obscured by the light of the sunset. The water reflects the light from the sky, shimmering with hints of yellow and orange, enhancing the overall tranquil and picturesque setting.\n\nThe two people on the boat are engaged in managing the sail, with one person sitting towards the front of the boat, holding onto a part of the rigging, while the other seems to be operating the rudder at the back. Their interaction suggests they are focused and possibly navigating or adjusting the sail. The overall composition and backlighting not only highlight the contours of the figures and the boat but also create a vivid and memorable image focused on the themes of peace, partnership, and the beauty of nature.","title":"No motors disturb the quiet of lake calhoun","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["552345","552344","551539","552039","552343","544669","548118","548117","544224","544667","549413","547273","549411","549415","553990","553991"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","boat","sunset","backlit","rigging","occupant","figure","peace","shimmer","sailing"]}
