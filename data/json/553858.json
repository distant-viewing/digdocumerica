{"path":"553858.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image features a close-up view of a swirling pattern of pollutants or oily substances in water, surrounding a metallic or wooden pole. The colors within the swirl are predominantly dark and grey with hints of blue and white, creating a marble or agate-like texture. The scene suggests something like an industrial or urban waterway subject to pollution. The pole, appearing sturdy and cylindrical, stands contrasted against the chaotic patterns of the surrounding water. The texture of the swirling substances is quite fluid and dynamic, suggesting movement in the water. The overall mood is somewhat grim or concerning, as it displays the interaction of human-made objects with nature in a possibly detrimental way. There are no visible plant life or animals, which focuses the attention solely on the interaction between the pole and the swirling substances in the water.","title":"Water from a pulp mill in Bellingham bay, puget sound.
