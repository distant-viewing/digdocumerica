{"path":"546548.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"In the photograph, there is a busy classroom scene, presumably during an art class based on the objects and activities visible. The room features two desks with large pieces of paper and various art materials spread across them, including frames, scissors, and papers. There are five individuals in the scene, likely high school students, each engaged in different activities.\n\nOn the left, a young boy in a yellow t-shirt sits at a desk, drawing or writing, while speaking to a young girl in a patterned dress who is leaning over the table to talk to him. To the right, another girl, with her back to the camera, wearing a pink shirt and dark pants, seems to be handling some material at another table. Standing by her side is a boy in a white shirt and cuffed jeans, holding a pair of glasses and a soft drink can while glancing to his side at another boy. This other boy, who is partially out of the frame on the right, seems to also be participating in the conversation or the activity.\n\nThe background reveals an educational setting with a whiteboard that has various numbers and words written on it in a grid format, suggesting perhaps a schedule or a class project list. The room is lit brightly, likely by fluorescent lights, and despite the focus on art, the room gives a general educational vibe due to the layout and the materials visible.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a dynamic and interactive moment in what appears to be a creative and collaborative classroom environment.","title":"Columbus east senior high school art department","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["543919","543920","554838","548243","558214","544322","558216","552946","554332","546556","544314","544798","558212","546552","545547","553269"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["boy","art","classroom","class","room","desk","write","girl","material","table"]}
