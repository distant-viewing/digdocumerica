{"path":"546640.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph shows a group of eleven people standing in front of an automotive service center called \"Call Carl\". The building features a large dark facade with the shop's name and services offered (\"Inspection - Repairs\") displayed prominently on a sign above the main entrance. Below this, there are labeled sections for various automotive services such as \"Brakes\", \"Motor Tune-Up\", \"Head Lights\", and \"Diagnostic Center\".\n\nThe people in the image appear to be a mix of staff members from the service center. They are a diverse group, varying in ethnicity and including one woman. Most of the men are dressed in work uniforms typical of automotive technicians, which includes some with name tags and company logos. One man is dressed in a business suit, and another in a white lab coat, suggesting different roles within the establishment. The woman is wearing a bright red dress.\n\nIn the background, on either side of the group, there are two cars parked, which are likely being serviced or have been serviced at the center. The overall ambiance is professional, with the setting clearly aimed at conveying the operations of a functioning automotive service business.","title":"The employees of this computerized auto service center","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["557902","557861","557852","542763","557885","552789","557884","557918","552775","557906","557862","557921","557915","557905","557858","557831"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Infrastructure Maintenance"],"terms":["service","name","group","business","technician","staff","center","tag","lab","company"]}
