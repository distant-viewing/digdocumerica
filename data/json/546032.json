{"path":"546032.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a man in an industrial setting, involved in a task that necessitates safety gear. The man is wearing a dark, soiled jacket and trousers, suggestive of a work uniform, along with a hard hat on his head. He is equipped with a respirator mask covering his nose and mouth, which indicates the presence of potentially hazardous materials or fumes.\n\nIn his hands, he holds a tool that appears to be a spray gun, commonly used in painting or coating applications. Beside him, there is a flat surface that is partly covered with red tiles laid out in an organized manner, suggesting that he might be engaged in a process involving the application of a coating or cleaning solution to these tiles.\n\nThe background is plain and nondescript, primarily a dark, faded blue wall with some visible signs of wear or staining. This minimalist backdrop focuses the viewer's attention on the worker and his activities. The lighting in the photograph casts soft shadows on the wall behind the man, adding depth to the composition while highlighting the textures of his clothing and the objects around him.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment in an industrial or manufacturing process, emphasizing the role of the worker and the importance of safety equipment in such environments.","title":"Workman wears respiratory protection mask while spray painting at Avondale shipyard.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["555263","544171","555245","556391","554043","546041","555243","554953","553610","555239","544316","544835","546036","556315","544822","542497"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["application","tile","safety","fume","worker","gun","cleaning","process","mask","painting"]}
