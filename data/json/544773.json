{"path":"544773.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive wetland marsh environment. The image shows a series of dispersed water pools with irregular shapes amidst large areas of dense, dark green marsh vegetation. These vegetation patches have various shades ranging from dark green to almost brown, suggesting different plant types or water depth.\n\nThe water bodies reflect light, indicating the photo was taken under clear skies. Some areas of the water are darker, possibly indicating deeper or murkier areas. You can see specks of white in and around the water, which may be reflections, small rocks, or debris.\n\nThe background features a mountain range with a hazy sky, which could suggest moisture in the air or a slight fog, typical of marshland areas. The mountains fade into the background with a bluish-grey tint, contributing to a sense of depth in the image.\n\nThe overall composition and the perspective of the photo suggest it might have been taken from a raised viewpoint, looking out across the marsh toward the mountains, capturing the vastness and natural complexity of the wetland ecosystem. There is no human activity visible; this is a natural, untouched landscape photo.","title":"East shore","placename":"Great Salt Lake (Utah)","location":"Great Salt Lake, Utah","nn1":["545114","547500","547532","542525","547544","544515","547589","544530","553856","553085","544593","545033","554717","546205","544786","550345"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["marsh","mountain","marshland","bluish","water","range","photo","speck","disperse","tint"]}
