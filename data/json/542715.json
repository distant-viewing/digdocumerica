{"path":"542715.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up view of a large, rugged tree trunk. The bark of the tree is dark, appearing nearly black in some areas, and is deeply furrowed with a textured, rough surface. The markings of age or possibly disease give it a weathered look. In several places, there is a lighter substance, possibly lichen or moss, that contrasts starkly with the dark bark, hinting at the natural environment's dampness or the tree's old age.\n\nNotably, there is an inscription or graffiti carved into the bark of the tree, prominently featuring numbers or letters that look like \"8942\" or similar. The carving disrupts the tree's natural patterns, suggesting human interaction or visitation to this location. \n\nThe background behind the tree is softly focused, showing hints of a dense, possibly coniferous forest. The undergrowth is visible with small plants and fallen pine needles, adding to the setting's natural, untouched feel, apart from the marked tree itself. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken during the day in a shaded area, possibly under the canopy of the forest, resulting in a serene and somewhat mysterious ambiance.","title":"Discovery of a golden eagle's nest in this tree prompted the Southern California Edison Company to temporarily halt all logging in the area.","placename":"San Joaquin (Fresno County, Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin, California","nn1":["542723","544332","542749","550792","554974","543488","557616","557621","544662","553587","554973","557623","555001","554977","542791","557622"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","tree","dampness","furrow","carving","age","lichen","inscription","disrupt","graffiti"]}
