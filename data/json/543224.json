{"path":"543224.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant moment featuring three African-American individuals—a man, a woman, and a child—seated in a chairlift gondola, labeled with the number 2, against a clear blue sky. The man is seated on the left, sporting an Afro, a thick beard, and sunglasses, dressed in a stylish patterned shirt. Next to him in the middle is a child wearing a bright pink jacket. On the right is a woman who appears to be wearing large sunglasses and a textured white top, overlayed by a pink vest. She’s styled her hair up and has an expression of composed attention, potentially holding something small in her hands. The overall feel is casual and leisurely, as they seem to be enjoying a ride on a skyward-facing transport system, indicative of a relaxed outing, likely at an amusement park or similar setting. The retro fashion style suggests the photo could be from the 1970s or 1980s.","title":"California--Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["554455","551013","557049","556118","556282","551299","554174","554176","553154","553169","556235","556080","553205","545464","554259","547758"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["sunglasse","sty","overlay","stylish","amusement","child","retro","outing","beard","vest"]}
