{"path":"547048.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of an industrial steel mill, specifically identified as United States Steel Gary Works, located by the waterfront. The image is dominated by large, sprawling buildings with angular, dark roofs. There are multiple smokestacks projecting thick smoke into the air, contributing to an overall smoggy and polluted atmosphere. The photograph captures a range of gray, black, and rusty red tones from the buildings and equipment, stark against the soft blue of the background, which appears to be a large body of water (possibly a lake or sea). There are visible transport tracks and some crane structures throughout the site, underscoring the industrial nature of the location. The setting is densely packed with various industrial infrastructures and equipment, all appearing to be in active use, evidenced by the significant amount of smoke and steam being emitted. This scenery provides a visually potent representation of heavy industry and its environmental impact.","title":"U.S. steel plant","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547097","549510","546827","549511","549966","546882","557227","557216","549967","557222","547101","553891","549508","555769","547069","557215"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["smoke","equipment","representation","identify","mill","project","amount","steel","waterfront","steam"]}
