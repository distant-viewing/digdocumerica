{"path":"553078.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor moment featuring two young children running through a meadow. The image shows them from behind, with one child slightly ahead of the other, suggesting a playful chase or race. Both children appear to have long hair, and the leader is wearing a pink top and light-colored shorts, while the following child is dressed in white.\n\nThe meadow is lush with tall, wild grasses that exhibit a golden hue, indicating late summer or early fall. The landscape gently slopes, and the children run towards a background marked by rugged, rocky outcrops. These natural formations add a wild, untouched feel to the scene.\n\nThe sky is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day with good weather, perfect for outdoor activities. In the distance, the silhouette of the coastline or a body of water can be discerned, adding depth and a sense of vast open space to the photograph. Above the horizon, the sky shades into a lighter blue, hinting at the strength of the sun. \n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of freedom, movement, and the joy of a carefree moment spent in nature.","title":"Rock point.
