{"path":"546363.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph features an industrial setting juxtaposed with nature. In the foreground, a sparsely leafed tree with thin, twisted branches dominates the image. The tree's bare branches are finely detailed against a deep blue sky. In the background, the scene is dominated by two large industrial smokestacks, from which white and gray smoke billows upward into the sky. The smokestacks are stout and cylindrical, constructed from concrete or a similar gray material. Surrounding the smokestacks are additional structures of the industrial complex, including metal frameworks and parts of buildings, which seem to be part of a factory or power plant. The industrial elements suggest a scene of active production or energy generation, contrasting sharply with the natural and dormant state of the tree in the foreground. The overall composition of the image creates a stark contrast between the industrial activity and the natural element represented by the tree, possibly hinting at themes of environmental impact or the intersection of human activity and nature.","title":"Smoking chimneys of a cement plant in industrial area of San Juan","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["550999","545035","546141","550997","543013","542997","545989","545113","543009","550998","557225","551059","543813","546073","552156","548195"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","branch","generation","tree","production","intersection","concrete","billow","represent","energy"]}
