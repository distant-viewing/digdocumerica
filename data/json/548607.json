{"path":"548607.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man playing the harmonica. He wears a straw fedora-style hat with a colorful band around the brim. The manâ€™s face is focused and expressive, possibly indicating his deep engagement in the music he is creating. His skin suggests a texture that comes with age, and his gaze is directed slightly above the harmonica, seemingly lost in the melody.\n\nHis attire includes a shirt with a bold black and white pattern, reminiscent of polka dots. Also visible is a harmonica case, partially tucked into his shirt pocket, which has a gold-colored label possibly indicating the brand or type of harmonica. His hands, holding the instrument, are detailed with signs of aging such as prominent veins and wrinkles, suggesting a life rich with experiences.\n\nThe background of the image is blurred, likely indicating foliage or greenery, providing a serene setting that enhances the intimate moment of the man with his music. The overall composition and the shallow depth of field focus all attention on the man and his harmonica, emphasizing his actions and expressions over the environment.","title":"Resident of a retirement hotel in south beach with harmonica","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["548606","558359","558283","557788","558263","558358","554858","548251","548560","554857","548226","556133","556149","556478","548262","556305"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["music","case","fedora","lose","man","vein","wrinkle","polka","gold","aging"]}
