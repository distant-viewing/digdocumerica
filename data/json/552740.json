{"path":"552740.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a large scrapyard filled with various discarded materials and debris. The foreground is cluttered with numerous types of scrap metal, including rusted car parts, iron bars, chunks of metal, and other unidentifiable metal components. There are also fragments of white materials, possibly ceramic or plastic, interspersed among the metallic debris.\n\nThe middle ground of the picture showcases a towering pile of compressed and stacked old cars. The vehicles, predominantly in hues of rust, grey, and faded colors, are piled haphazardly on top of each other, creating a mountainous structure of scrap vehicles.\n\nIn the background, standing in contrast to the chaotic piles of scrap, is a large, lush green tree that appears full and healthy. Its presence adds a natural element to the scene, offering a stark juxtaposition to the man-made waste in the foreground.\n\nThe sky above is clear and bright blue, which further illuminates the scene, highlighting the textures and colors of the materials in the scrapyard. The overall composition of the photograph evokes themes of waste, decay, and the environmental impact of human consumption.","title":"Tree grows in Philadelphia junkyard","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["546267","547625","542585","554318","554357","547611","554300","542656","548109","554320","554301","545010","554335","553006","551244","542660"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["scrap","scrapyard","material","waste","metal","pile","consumption","chunk","iron","fragment"]}
