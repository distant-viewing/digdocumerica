{"path":"547647.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense deciduous forest. The canopy is composed of thick green foliage, allowing dappled sunlight to penetrate through, casting spots of light on the forest floor. Various species of trees can be seen, including ones with smooth and rough bark textures. The ground is covered with lush ferns and leaf litter, indicating a healthy undergrowth. There are no visible paths or trails, suggesting a natural and less disturbed area of the forest. No animals or people are visible in the scene, enhancing the sense of solitude and natural wilderness. The lighting suggests that it might be taken during midday when the sun is high, as the brightness of the light contrasts with the naturally darker areas beneath the canopy.","title":"Forest of oaks and maples","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["554425","554957","546947","543542","550791","545488","554393","554972","554964","549234","555120","555028","558088","558082","555043","554960"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","canopy","fern","undergrowth","leaf","litter","midday","specie","bark","brightness"]}
