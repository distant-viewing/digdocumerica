{"path":"550594.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic mountainous landscape, emphasizing rugged terrain and natural geological features. The scene is characterized by a valley flanked by dark, steep mountains, both of which are predominantly barren with little to no vegetation. The highlight of the composition is a significant glacier or ice flow, extending from the upper right corner and tapering down towards the center of the image.\n\nThe glacier's surface appears textured and creased, showing patterns that suggest slow movement over time. Several meltwater streams can be seen originating from the glacier, forming sinuous paths down the valley floor, converging and diverging, evoking the dynamic nature of water flow in such cold environments.\n\nThe lighting in the image is dim, possibly indicating either an overcast day or a time of day when sunlight is minimal, casting deep shadows and enhancing the moody, almost somber atmosphere of the high-altitude scene. This subdued lighting accentuates the rugged textures and forms of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the image captures a serene yet austere natural environment, showcasing the imposing beauty of mountainous and glacial terrains in a remote setting. The composition and perspective might suggest that the photograph was taken from a higher elevation, looking down into the valley, providing a comprehensive view of this striking and less accessible part of the world.","title":"Denali fault. View east toward Castner Glacier (at left) and Canwell Glacier (extreme right). The fault follows the trench of the Canwell Glacier valley. Here, the pipeline route runs downhill but parallel to the Richardson Highway as it proceeds south across the fault and through the Alaska Range.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550635","550419","550592","550595","550610","550511","550418","550415","555663","550497","550504","550502","550402","550505","542520","550518"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["glacier","valley","flow","ice","time","highlight","world","elevation","altitude","terrain"]}
