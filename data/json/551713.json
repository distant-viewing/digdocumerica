{"path":"551713.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively scene in an urban park during what appears to be springtime. A variety of people can be seen enjoying the beautiful day. In the foreground, a group walks along a pathway: two adults and two younger individuals possibly adolescents. They appear engaged in conversation while walking.\n\nTo the right, another group is gathered around a small table covered with what looks like an array of potted plants, possibly at a small casual outdoor market or stall. Several individuals are involved, seemingly examining or discussing the plants.\n\nThe background reveals the park flanked by young trees with new leaves, suggesting it's either late spring or early summer. There are also multiple park benches along the path, some occupied by other park goers who are seated or interacting with each other. \n\nOverhead, the trees form a loose canopy that filters the sunlight casting dappled shadows across the path and park benches. The setting includes typical urban park features like tall lamp posts and well-maintained shrubbery. Farther back, beyond the park's limits, the outlines of city buildings can be glimpsed, blending the bustling city life with the tranquility of the park. The setting is peaceful yet vibrant, filled with people enjoying the outdoor environment.","title":"Spring festival at carl schurz park between east end avenue and the east river in Manhattan's upper east side","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550074","556296","551678","544808","550075","557257","550302","551771","550071","555947","551815","553065","553193","553043","552036","547756"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["park","bench","goer","path","enjoy","limit","stall","walk","pot","discuss"]}
