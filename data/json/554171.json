{"path":"554171.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a coastal landscape, likely taken from an airplane. In the foreground, a curvaceous sandy beach hugs the edge of a clear, azure bay, the waters of which are translucent enough to reveal the underwater topography near the shore. Surrounding the bay are patches of dense green vegetation, likely tropical foliage.\n\nExtending from the beach, the land transforms into a darker, rugged terrain dotted with more greenery, roads, and paths that carve through the landscape. The coastline continues, with rocky outcrops and small inlets visible. Further inland, the terrain is a mixture of dark volcanic fields and grassy areas, with some roads intersecting the fields. \n\nThe background features a vast mountain range, partially obscured by cloud cover, spanning the horizon under a blue sky scattered with clouds.\n\nThe entire scene is a lush, natural landscape with minimal signs of urban development, emphasizing the beauty and remote character of the location. This picturesque setting portrays a serene and pristine environment.","title":"Shoreline of area near Kamuela which has been rezoned for urban use in the most recent and most controversial land speculation case","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554170","553983","548785","554020","543429","543430","543328","543432","548604","553982","543434","554156","554052","554023","547637","543088"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["bay","beach","transform","hug","underwater","inlet","fields","pat","outcrop","pristine"]}
