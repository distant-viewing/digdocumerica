{"path":"546365.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph features a man opening an oyster using a knife. He appears to be seated outdoors, probably on a beach given the sandy background and bits of grass evident. The man is shown from a slightly raised rear perspective, focusing particularly on his hands and the task he is performing. We can see his left profile, including his sunglasses and the top of his dark-colored cap.\n\nHe holds an oyster firmly with his gloved left hand, which is saddled in a worn glove, while his right hand wields a knife to pry the shell open. The completed action reveals the opened oyster which houses a creamy-colored meat sitting beside another opened oyster in a rough shell. Both sit atop the edge of a plastic bucket, which seems to contain more unopened oysters.\n\nThe colors in the image are vivid, with strong natural light highlighting the textures of the oysters, the glove, and the shells, providing a contrast with the shadows around the man's arm and the bucket. The intricate details of the oyster's rough and rugged shell texture are particularly emphasized in this outdoor setting.","title":"A biologist is removing oyster tissue for chemical analysis.
