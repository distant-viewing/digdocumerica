{"path":"545511.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features two men sitting on the railing of a wooden porch attached to a seemingly dilapidated house. The scene takes place in a neighborhood that appears somewhat neglected, evidenced by the unkept ground and the absence of vibrant vegetation. One man is sitting towards the center of the frame, highlighting his casual pose with one leg hung over the railing, wearing a red fedora hat, a striped polo shirt, and red pants. The second man is positioned slightly behind the first, also relaxed, wearing darker attire and a dark beret.\n\nIn the background, contrast to the foreground's residential setting, is an industrial landscape distinguished by multiple tall chimneys, which bear no smoke, suggesting inactivity or disuse. The industrial site looms over the neighborhood, creating a stark juxtaposition between the residential life and the industrial surroundings.\n\nThe lighting, possibly of a setting sun, casts a warm glow on the scene, emphasizing the end of the day's quietude. This setting evokes a sense of stillness but also implies a narrative about the socio-economic condition of the area, with industrial backdrops influencing the daily lives of the residents. The overall composition marries elements of human presence, architectural decay, and industrial enormity in a single, thought-provoking frame.","title":"In many areas of the city blacks still live in substandard housing.
