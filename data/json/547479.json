{"path":"547479.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene at a beach. The composition highlights the interplay of natural elements under the dim light of the setting sun. In the photo, the sun appears as a vivid, round, orange sphere partially cloaked by a hazy sky, suggesting possibly some humidity or light cloud cover.\n\nThe setting sun casts a gentle pink to purple hue over the scene, with the sky transitioning in colors from a soft purple at the top to deeper shades near the horizon. Below the sun, the vast ocean stretches out, its surface shimmering slightly with the reflected light and dotted with minor ripples indicating a calm sea. The water near the shore breaks into gentle, foamy waves that wash over a sandy beach.\n\nIn the foreground, dark, rugged rocks jut out on the beach, their surfaces are partially illuminated by the fading sunlight, which enhances their textured appearance. The rocks appear smooth and eroded, typical of seaside geology continuously shaped by the water.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is balanced between the elements of sky, water, and earth, providing a sense of tranquility and the majesty of nature at sunset. The beach is devoid of people, adding to the atmosphere of calm and solitude. The overall mood is peaceful, with a strong sense of the natural rhythm of the day coming to a close.","title":"Rhode island sound","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["553989","550288","543144","554075","552335","545238","552294","552338","543064","550296","549847","557447","554074","544707","547483","545234"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["beach","sun","sunset","geology","sphere","humidity","cloak","rhythm","majesty","erode"]}
