{"path":"547580.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph portrays an urban street scene seemingly from a mid-20th-century American city. The main focus of the image is a street lined with buildings and a central set of train tracks embedded into the asphalt. The train tracks, which curve slightly right in the distance, add a perspective element, drawing the eye towards the horizon.\n\nOn the left side of the street, there is a diner—identified by a neon sign reading \"Sterling Diner\"—with a small, single-story structure featuring a flat roof and a cream-colored facade. Adjacent to it is a building with the signage \"Gregson Brownie Termite Control,\" which boldly claims, \"We cost less than any legitimate company,\" implying its services are competitively priced.\n\nOn the right side of the street, there is an enclosed area with walls and a large building extending further back, giving an impression of an industrial site or warehouse district. A tall fence partially obscures this building, and it has a stark, utilitarian appearance.\n\nThe street itself appears worn, with patches and deterioration evident in the asphalt. This gives a sense of age and perhaps neglect, consistent with an older urban area undergoing slow decay or in need of infrastructure investment.\n\nIn the background, the scene extends into a typical cityscape, with various indistinct buildings stretching into the distance under a partly cloudy sky. The street is notably empty of pedestrians and has minimal vehicular traffic, suggesting either a quiet time of day or reduced economic activity in the area. The overall atmosphere is somewhat desolate and reflective of an urban environment in transition or decline.","title":"Waterfront Street","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["550022","550012","552933","550108","556224","555927","557278","543982","549785","550065","550138","555890","556853","558028","555925","555782"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","asphalt","train","track","diner","building","reduce","deterioration","embed","decline"]}
