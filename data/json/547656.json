{"path":"547656.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at an old, seemingly abandoned railway station. On the left side of the image, there's a section of a building with weathered and peeling blue paint on its wood siding. The building shows signs of decay, with parts of its structure exposed and paint stripped away, hinting at neglect and the passage of time. \n\nIn the foreground on the right, there is a platform covered with a few scattered leaves and debris indicating minimal recent foot traffic. The platform is sheltered by a metal structure supporting a roof, typical of train station design, with elegant but rusting metal brackets and a lamp post with a curved design, also showing signs of weathering. \n\nThe background features a set of railway tracks extending into the distance, flanked by grass and small shrubs overgrowing around the tracks. There are a few railway signals visible, and in the distance, more tracks merge and diverge, suggesting this once might have been a busy junction. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a somber, abandoned feel.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of desolation and decay at a once-busy railway station, now quiet and untouched by the bustle that might have characterized it in the past.","title":"Old kingston railway station, still in use","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["554563","556778","547511","556782","552477","556783","544706","556125","554565","557944","556124","550790","556129","544028","556040","556768"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","station","track","abandon","platform","decay","diverge","bracket","junction","stripp"]}
