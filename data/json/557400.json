{"path":"557400.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and active scene within an industrial setting, likely a steel mill or foundry. The focal point of the image is a large bucket, suspended by chains from an overhead crane, tilting to pour molten metal. Bright orange sparks and flames emanate from the molten metal, illuminating the surrounding area with a fiery glow.\n\nThe environment is a large, cavernous space with a high ceiling, supported by metal trusses. Several industrial lamps and natural light sources from windows or skylights at the top of the building contribute to the lighting of the scene. The atmosphere is filled with haze, possibly smoke or steam, which adds a gritty texture to the photo.\n\nIn the background, multiple layers of industrial machinery, scaffolding, and other structural elements can be seen. The scene conveys a sense of robust activity and heavy labor, characteristic of such manufacturing environments.\n\nThere are no visible people in the immediate area of action, suggesting that the operations are controlled from a safer distance or possibly automated. The overall composition uses natural and artificial light to highlight the intensity and heat of the molten metal pouring, while the darker areas emphasize the vast, harsh conditions of the industrial interior. This photograph not only documents an industrial process but also captures the intense, almost otherworldly nature of metalworking facilities.","title":"\"Fugitive smoke\" escapes from the top of the building as metal is poured into a mold at the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. Total plant emissions for the metallurgical furnaces and the powerhouse were reduced 97.7 percent from 1967. A compliance schedule was reached between the corporation and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. EPA stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards. (See fiche #141 to 146)","placename":"Alloy (W.
