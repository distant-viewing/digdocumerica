{"path":"543971.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene featuring a large, traditional riverboat named the \"Belle of Louisville\" cruising on a serene body of water, likely a river, at twilight. The sky has a soft gradient of colors, transitioning from pinkish hues near the horizon to deeper blues above, suggesting that the photo was taken around sunset.\n\nThe riverboat is a prominent multiply-decked vessel, painted mostly in white with red accents on its two visible paddle wheels, which are actively churning water and producing light splashes. The boat's construction includes multiple levels of decks, all lit with warm, inviting lights that stand out against the dusk lighting. On its top deck, the American flag is prominently displayed, gently waving in the breeze. Several smaller flags are also seen on the boat, fluttering delicately atop the boat's structure.\n\nThe water around the riverboat shows gentle ripples, indicative of a calm day with little to no strong winds. There is a subtle reflection of the boatâ€™s lights on the water, adding a sense of tranquility and movement to the scene. The background is mostly silhouetted forested land, hinting at a secluded or less urbanized area.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of peaceful journeying and a timeless appeal of traditional riverboats, set against a naturally beautiful backdrop during a quiet evening.","title":"Steamboat on the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543967","543963","543962","543955","553815","545921","543959","543964","545917","543972","551313","545736","551222","551214","543966","550825"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["riverboat","deck","boat","flag","cruise","flutter","churn","paddle","produce","breeze"]}
