{"path":"550210.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph features an industrial riverscape. In the foreground, a significant amount of foam or pollution is visible on the river's surface, suggesting environmental impact, possibly from industrial activities. The foam extends from the bottom of the frame towards the middle of the river.\n\nIn the middle ground, large industrial structures, including a warehouse and a factory, line the riverbank. Their features are distinctive with large signage and structural components typical of mid-20th century industrial architecture. A tall smokestack emitting a plume of smoke is also visible, adding to the industrial atmosphere of the scene.\n\nDominating the background is a large, metal truss bridge that spans the river. It is a complex and robust structure, likely used for both road and possibly rail traffic, symbolizing the infrastructure critical to industrial operations in the area.\n\nThe overall composition captures a blend of natural and man-made elements, highlighting interactions between industrial development and the natural environment. The image serves as a stark representation of environmental challenges associated with industrial areas.","title":"Discharge of sewage into the Cuyahoga River from the city pump station at the foot of Superior Avenue","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550206","545988","546903","546705","557223","550710","545034","551192","557222","546112","557295","550189","557376","550725","552070","550860"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["foam","riverscape","river","truss","symbolize","representation","warehouse","rail","amount","challenge"]}
