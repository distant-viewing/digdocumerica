{"path":"551895.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph is taken inside a subway station, capturing a dynamic scene of daily life in public transit. The image features a long, curved platform with an arched ceiling. The ceiling and the curvature of the walls are composed of a warm-toned tiling, creating a tunnel-like effect. Rows of fluorescent lights parallel the curvature of the ceiling, providing ample illumination to the area.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a subway train is in motion, appearing as a blurred streak of light and colors primarily in yellow due to the train's speed. This motion blur emphasizes the speed and bustling nature of the subway environment.\n\nThe platform is populated with numerous people. Some are seen standing or walking, engaging in various activities, possibly waiting for another train or just disembarking from the one shown. There is notable diversity in the attire and postures of these individuals, pointing to a typical metropolitan crowd with varying ages, styles, and behaviors. A few individuals are more distinct, such as a person standing calmly in the foreground on the right, facing away from the camera and appearing to observe the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition uses long exposure to capture the movement of the train while maintaining sharpness in stationary objects, creating a vivid contrast between motion and stillness, enhancing the everyday yet dynamic essence of subway transit. The image gives a sense of time and place, capturing a moment in urban life with a strong visual narrative of hurry and wait that characterizes public transport scenes.","title":"A Schnell-Bahn (express) station at Marienplatz, three levels below the street","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551894","551883","556650","556660","556821","556823","556818","556651","556815","548259","551889","556817","554327","556661","556774","556665"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","train","ceiling","curvature","speed","transit","motion","platform","behavior","sharpness"]}
