{"path":"549091.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view that juxtaposes elements of urban and natural settings. The main focus is a large, sturdy bridge spanning a body of water. The bridge, made of stone with classic arches, is adorned with multiple flags, including the American and British flags, which suggest an international or culturally mixed setting.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a vibrant red telephone booth typical of the United Kingdom, adding a distinctly British feel to the scene. Nearby, a directional sign is visible, reading \"Bridgewater Stn. Curios\" and \"Port of London Boutique\", which hints at nearby shops or points of interest possibly related to London-themed goods or services.\n\nThe environment around includes a well-maintained grassy area with a few trees and cut tree stumps near the sign, possibly used as rustic seating or decorative elements. People are present in the scene, casually dressed, walking and enjoying the area, suggesting a leisurely or touristic atmosphere.\n\nThe setting seems to be a blend of leisure park and historical or cultural site, creating a relaxed yet engaging atmosphere where visitors can enjoy both the greenery and the proximity to water and architectural beauty.","title":"London Bridge--pride of Lake Havasu City since 1971--is a popular tourist attraction.","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["549068","551166","548816","548087","551527","548064","546865","543938","547263","549469","557969","558003","544542","542555","546810","557959"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["flag","bridge","telephone","booth","stump","seating","arch","shop","good","visitor"]}
