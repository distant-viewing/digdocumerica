{"path":"550918.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a large, industrial ship moving along a shimmering body of water, likely a river or harbor. The ship is primarily in silhouette due to the backlighting, which also casts glistening speckles over the surface of the water, highlighted by sunlight. The vessel appears to be a cargo ship or similarly purposed vessel, equipped with multiple cranes or loading gear protruding upward, indicating its utility for transportation or goods loading.\n\nThe surrounding water is depicted with detail, capturing the reflective effect of the sunlight in myriad sparkling points. In the distant background, there appear to be waterfront installations, such as other moored ships, possibly docks or industrial structures, which are also primarily in dark silhouette. These elements suggest a busy industrial or commercial port setting.\n\nThe composition utilizes a high contrast between light and dark, focusing attention on the texture of the waterâ€™s surface and the outline of the ship against the brighter background. The scene is devoid of visible human activity or wildlife, concentrating entirely on the maritime and industrial atmosphere.","title":"Tugs guide tanker toward dock near refinery on the Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["544659","544655","550910","548201","550906","555811","544657","551990","555270","547056","547572","547667","551577","547061","552303","547064"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","loading","vessel","backlighting","silhouette","speckle","concentrate","installation","harbor","glisten"]}
