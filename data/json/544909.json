{"path":"544909.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic vista dominated by greenery and mountainous terrain. The foreground prominently features a cluster of tall, slender aspen trees with smooth, light-colored bark, probably white or grayish. The trees are adorned with small, round leaves that appear bright green, suggesting the photo was taken in spring or summer.\n\nThe aspens stand tall, partially framing the view of a rugged mountain in the background. The mountain rises distinctly with sharp, rocky peaks; some of its slopes are covered in vegetation, while others expose bare rock. Small patches of snow are still visible in crevices of the mountain, hinting that it's located in a higher altitude or colder region.\n\nThe sky above is a vivid, cloudless blue, emphasizing the lushness of the trees against the starkness of the mountain. The overall composition juxtaposes the soft, organic shapes of the trees and leaves with the harsh, angular contours of the mountain, creating a dramatic yet serene natural scene. The lighting is clear and appears natural, suggesting midday when the sun is high, casting minimal shadows and bathing the landscape in bright light.","title":"Mt.
