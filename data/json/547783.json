{"path":"547783.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a polluted riverside. In the foreground, there is a body of water where several white geese are swimming. There appears to be a considerable amount of debris and litter floating on the water, including plastic bottles, wrappers, and other unidentified trash. The geese ignore the pollution, with one of them holding a branch in its beak.\n\nThe background features dense green foliage, likely indicating a woodland area beyond the riverbank. The overall setting suggests a contrast between natural beauty and environmental neglect. The river itself reflects a calm, yet lamentably trash-filled water surface. The photo seems to convey a message about the impact of human waste on natural habitats.","title":"Ducks forage in litter left by visitors to White Rock Lake. Once unspoiled and relatively isolated, White Rock has become a city-dweller's weekend mecca. Many now come here just to be where the action is.","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["547753","552993","552811","552098","545945","547524","552127","550812","549951","547537","547520","550352","550800","548308","557122","555228"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["trash","beak","litter","riverside","bottle","message","amount","habitat","riverbank","waste"]}
