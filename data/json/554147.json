{"path":"554147.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photo captures a serene, yet dynamic seaside scene at either dawn or dusk, indicated by the soft and dim natural lighting that enhances the silhouettes in the image. The scene is composed of three primary elements: the ocean, a fishing person, and a boat.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a rocky shoreline partially visible where a person is standing. The person, shown in silhouette, is engaged in fishing; they appear to be casting a fishing line into the sea. Their stance suggests a moment of activity, possibly casting or reeling in the line.\n\nIn the middleground, the ocean's surface is visible, characterized by gentle wave activity that glimmers under the low light, suggesting a calm sea. \n\nIn the background, away from the shore and on the left side of the frame, is a boat. This boat, also silhouetted against the light reflecting off the water, appears to be a medium-sized fishing boat, possibly indicating a popular fishing area or a leisurely expedition.\n\nThe composition is framed on the right side by a blurred foreground of foliage, possibly tree branches, adding a sense of depth and framing the scene naturally. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is tranquil and contemplative, characterized by a harmony between human activity and the natural environment. The color palette is muted with shades of dark blue and black, punctuated by the silvery reflections on the water.","title":"Fishing off the kona coast on the west side of the island","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["545055","547549","547556","545120","547555","552308","543753","552309","547558","545081","552313","551311","543143","552314","554002","550296"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","ocean","person","glimmer","reel","sea","expedition","silhouette","fram"]}
