{"path":"544754.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic moment in a desert-like landscape. In the foreground, a person in military attire is standing on a dusty, red ground guiding an approaching helicopter with hand signals. The helicopter, likely a military type, is positioned just above the ground with its rotors spinning, creating a blur in the image.\n\nThe background features a breathtaking view of a desert valley surrounded by large, rugged red rock formations typical of terrain in regions like Monument Valley. The earth is a rich reddish-brown hue contrasting starkly with the blue sky overhead. There are no clouds, suggesting a clear, sunny day.\n\nOn the upper left, the red rock face is bold and imposing, serving as a natural wall. On the upper right, the landscape extends into a flat land, leading to distant mountains. Scattered sparse vegetation is visible, adding touches of green to the predominantly red and brown environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph, with its juxtaposition of human activity and vast natural beauty, evokes a sense of isolation and the scale of the open wilderness. The image likely captures an operation or exercise, suggested by the remote setting and the military presence.","title":"Area of small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["544766","545642","542577","545637","544741","545638","544771","545755","544737","545800","552690","545696","545596","543846","545575","544016"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","desert","exercise","rotor","breathtaking","dusty","rock","reddish","signal","approach"]}
