{"path":"544993.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph displays a scene at a harbor where three individuals are engaged in activities related to fishing or boating. The image captures a view from inside a dimly lit structure, possibly a boat shed, looking out towards a bright waterfront.\n\nOn the left and throughout the center of the image, the interior of the shed is visible and includes industrial elements like overhead bulbs providing light, and large chains and weights hanging down, likely used for hoisting equipment or portions of boats.\n\nThe main focus is on the three people in the foreground and middle ground, all appearing to be actively involved in either preparing to depart or returning from a trip. One individual appears to be standing on the dock, managing a large shovel or some similar tool, while another one is positioned inside a small boat, handling equipment or perhaps the boat's controls. The third person is assisting, standing beside the boat on the dock, possibly securing or releasing the boat.\n\nThe backdrop exposes a glimpse of the harbor environment with calm water, other docked boats, and industrial buildings nearby, reflecting a typical busy working day at a waterfront. The photo evokes a sense of everyday labor at the sea, highlighting the rustic and hardworking atmosphere of a fishing harbor.","title":"Fish harvesting and processing","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547565","543035","547564","543465","545093","548235","554200","545189","552877","546998","552863","547563","547552","546802","548228","548229"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","harbor","shed","waterfront","dock","fishing","bulb","weight","shovel","boating"]}
