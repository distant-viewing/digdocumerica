{"path":"553490.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a garage or an area where automotive repairs are being conducted. Two vintage cars are prominently featured, both having their hoods open, suggesting maintenance or inspection activities. The car in the foreground is white and shows signs of wear such as slight dents and dirt. The second car, visible in the background, is black and appears to be of a similar or slightly newer model. \n\nA person, partially obscured by the car in the foreground, is working on one of the vehicles. Only the lower half of the personâ€™s body is visible; they are lying on their back underneath the car, likely engaged in some form of undercarriage repair or maintenance. Nearby, some tools or parts can be seen on the ground, indicating the work being done.\n\nThe environment is somewhat cluttered and industrial, typical of a workshop setting, with parts of other cars and objects that resemble mechanical components scattered in the vicinity. The lighting in the photograph seems natural, albeit slightly moody, casting gentle shadows and giving the image a somewhat gritty aesthetic. This setting underscores a theme of manual labor and automotive care common in many mid-20th-century settings.","title":"The Watkins of Mulky Square, a family of eleven, live in the 1600 block of Madison Street, a few blocks from the area being cleared for I-635.
