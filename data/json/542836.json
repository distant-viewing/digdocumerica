{"path":"542836.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph showing a mountainous landscape with a series of winding roads and tracks. The terrain appears rugged and uneven, featuring areas of dense tree coverage as well as exposed earth and rock, indicating possible logging or land clearing activity. The roads carve through the landscape, illustrating intricate patterns as they loop around hillsides and navigate through forested areas.\n\nThe colors in the photograph vary from the dark green of the trees to shades of brown and beige where the ground is bare. The photograph's perspective, taken from above, highlights the contrast between the natural shapes of the land and the geometric patterns imposed by the roads.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or moving vehicles, suggesting that the primary focus of the image is on the landscape and the impact of the roads on it. The image effectively communicates a sense of isolation and the scale of human intervention in a forested environment.","title":"\"Clear cutting\"","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542835","556933","542821","542838","550600","556938","550596","556935","548598","553564","543772","557001","550540","556934","550614","544446"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["road","coverage","land","beige","intervention","logging","pattern","clearing","hillside","landscape"]}
