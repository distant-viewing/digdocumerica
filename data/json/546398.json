{"path":"546398.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid rural landscape with industrial elements. In the foreground, there is a narrow irrigation canal framed by raised dirt edges, leading the viewer’s eye towards the background. On the left side of the canal, there is a lush, green crop field, possibly of corn, showing young plants in rows.\n\nThe middle-ground features an industrial facility with multiple structures, including a large building with a visible metal framework and several smaller outbuildings. Prominently, there is a tall smokestack emitting a thick plume of black smoke, which contributes to a stark contrast against the otherwise natural scene. This smoke drifts towards the lush, rolling hills in the background, which are partially obscured by the pollution.\n\nThe background is made up of those green, tree-covered hills under a light blue sky scattered with fluffy, white clouds. The overall composition juxtaposes the natural beauty of the rural setting with the imposing, pollutive presence of industry. This contrast might invoke themes of environmental impact and the interplay between human activities and natural landscapes.","title":"Sugar refinery","placename":"Mayagüez (P.R.)","location":"Mayagüez, Puero Rico","nn1":["553933","543159","544039","545013","546394","543668","543813","545989","545020","544736","545053","550995","551026","547539","550672","546141"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["canal","corn","drift","outbuilding","irrigation","fluffy","smoke","invoke","hill","lush"]}
