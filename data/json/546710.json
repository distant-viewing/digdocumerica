{"path":"546710.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a birdâ€™s-eye view of a busy urban area, specifically focusing on a major thoroughfare lined with lush greenery. The main road runs vertically through the middle of the image, packed with a multitude of cars suggesting either rush hour traffic or a busy day. This road is surrounded by significant amounts of green spaces which include grassy parks and trees, emphasizing a blend of urban and natural environments.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there's a parking area filled with cars, adjacent to more green park space where few pathways and scattered trees can be observed. To the right of the main road, the landscape continues with similar green areas, and another parking lot is visible.\n\nThe background features rows of high-rise buildings, likely residential or commercial, which frame the road on both sides. These buildings provide a contrast between the natural setting of the parks and the urban environment, indicating this scene is likely near a downtown or central business district of a city.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures both the congestion of city life and the attempts to integrate nature into urban planning. The view is from an elevated position, looking down on the scene, which provides a comprehensive view of how the elements of the city interact.","title":"Rockville pike at bethesda naval medical center, looking south","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546574","546616","546707","546617","546579","546624","546718","546745","546730","546703","549476","546698","547765","546713","555743","546678"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["road","city","parking","park","thoroughfare","attempt","congestion","multitude","rush","downtown"]}
