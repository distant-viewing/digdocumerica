{"path":"545495.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene focused primarily on tall grass or reeds, silhouetted against a softly lit sky during what appears to be either early morning or late evening. The grass or reeds, filled with feathery plumes, occupy most of the lower and central parts of the frame, stretching upwards towards the top of the image. Their stems and plumes are dense and seem lit from behind, creating a slight glow around their edges which hints at the soft, ambient light from the sky.\n\nThe sky itself is clear, displaying a gradient of colors from a darker blue at the top transitioning to a lighter, perhaps a pale pink or soft purple near the horizon, affected by the natural light conditions of either sunrise or sunset. The general atmosphere of the scene is tranquil, with no discernible wind or movement captured in the shot.\n\nThe image has a vintage or aged look, inferred from the slightly grainy texture and the muted colors. The four edges of the photograph are bordered with what looks like a black vignetting, possibly due to the type of camera or the method used in developing the photo, giving it an enclosed, intimate feel. Overall, this is a serene natural landscape image focused on the beauty of the plants and the subtleties of natural light.","title":"Weeds outlined against the red-orange smoke of the steel plant","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545069","552312","557559","546154","557104","547547","545209","550389","557191","549233","551370","553084","557111","549847","547540","545018"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["reed","plume","infer","method","stem","affect","light","grass","sunrise","edge"]}
