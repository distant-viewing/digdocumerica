{"path":"553666.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene. Three individuals are positioned on the shore facing a vast body of water, each sitting on different types of chairs. The person on the left is sitting on a foldable, fabric beach chair and appears to be fishing, actively holding a fishing rod. The middle person is comfortably seated on a wooden log, wearing a cowboy hat and is also holding a fishing rod. The individual on the right is seated on a metal and fabric lawn chair, and he appears to be simply observing the environment or watching the others fish.\n\nThe background features a tranquil and expansive lake stretching to the horizon. The far shore exhibits a series of low hills under a clear blue sky. The shoreline is visible, lined with driftwood and small rocks, suggesting a natural and somewhat remote setting. The lighting is bright and sunny, indicating a daytime setting, with shadows hinting that it might be either morning or late afternoon.","title":"Paiute Indian fishermen at Pyramid Lake, center of the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["549935","552029","543164","553082","550851","542564","546941","544274","554517","554198","551024","553081","554493","550217","552291","548737"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["chair","fishing","fabric","rod","shore","sit","driftwood","seat","lakeside","person"]}
