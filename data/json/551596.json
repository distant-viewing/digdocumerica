{"path":"551596.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph displays a young woman engaged in feeding or interacting with fish in an aquarium. The view is from inside the aquarium, looking outwards, providing a unique perspective. The woman appears focused on her task, as she holds a small container from which she might be feeding the fish. The aquarium is populated with several large, striped fish that are partially visible, swimming near the surface of the water.\n\nThe young woman has curly hair, styled away from her face, and she wears a white blouse with a slight ruffle or decorative detail. The image captures her from the chest up, and she is leaning over the open top of the aquarium, making her the central focus of the scene.\n\nIn the background of the image, a shelf or cupboard can be seen, containing stacks of folders, documents, or books, suggesting an office or a study-like environment. Lighting appears to be artificial, likely ceiling lights, reflected subtly on the surface of the water. The overall ambience is one of tranquil engagement with aquatic life, set against the setting of a functional, utilitarian space.","title":"National Water Quality Laboratory","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["551597","551589","543179","544957","549346","546313","544965","543180","551283","549350","553657","545165","551598","545206","546361","549339"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","folder","woman","chest","document","ambience","shelf","study","book","ceiling"]}
