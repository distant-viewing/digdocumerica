{"path":"545965.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In the photograph, a young man and a little girl are featured sitting on a uniquely designed bicycle. The bike appears to have a high front handlebar, two seats in a tandem arrangement, and three wheels, giving it stability. The young man, who is sitting in the rear seat, has medium-length brown hair and is wearing a denim shirt and jeans. The young girl, positioned in the front seat, has blonde hair and is smiling brightly. She's dressed in a patterned light dress with a knee-length hem and seems to be enjoying the ride or the idea of steering this unusual cycle. Both individuals are wearing boots.\n\nThe setting of this image is an outdoor area, clearly in a rural or semi-industrial environment given the presence of industrial plants in the background, which include tanks and complex machinery possibly related to processing or manufacturing. The sky is blue and clear, suggesting a nice weather day, and the surroundings include some bare trees and patches of grass.\n\nThe ground where the bike stands is graveled, and behind the subjects, there is a small building that might serve an operational purpose for the nearby industrial facility, and a fence that appears to enclose the area. The overall scene combines a personal, leisurely moment with a backdrop that suggests industry and perhaps rural life converging.","title":"A fisherman and his child on a homemade tricycle, with gas installation in background.
