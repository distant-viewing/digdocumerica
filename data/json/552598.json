{"path":"552598.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a scenic view of a metal truss bridge spanning a calm river at what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the soft golden lighting and long shadows. The river reflects the sky and parts of the bridge, enhancing the serene and tranquil atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe bridge, which is painted white, has a curved arch structure, accentuating its elegant engineering. Below the bridge, the river flows gently, flanked by lush, tree-covered riverbanks. The trees are in autumn colors, adding rich orange and yellow hues to the image, contrasting beautifully with the cool tones of the river and the sky.\n\nIn the background, distant mountains stretch across the horizon, partially obscured by a soft haze, possibly mist or the gentle glow of the low sun. This creates a sense of depth and vastness in the landscape. The sky above is clear with just a few scattered clouds, reflecting a light orange-pink color near the horizon, transitioning into a deeper blue towards the top of the frame.\n\nIn the foreground, there are power lines and utility poles that run parallel to the river, suggesting this is a blend of natural beauty and human infrastructure, typical of landscapes where development meets nature. The presence of these elements adds a layer of everyday reality to the otherwise idyllic scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its combination of natural beauty, architectural elegance, and hints of human presence, creates a peaceful yet striking visual narrative.","title":"Rifle, the major town of the piceance basin is located on the Colorado river.
