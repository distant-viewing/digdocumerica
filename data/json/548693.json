{"path":"548693.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a moment on a sunny day on a two-lane bridge over a body of water. It depicts a young woman standing on the left side of the frame, viewed from behind and slightly to the side. She wears a loose, sleeveless, bright orange top and brown shorts, with her hair tied back, and is holding a red flag in her left hand. She appears to be watching an approaching truck on the right side of the frame.\n\nThe truck, a large white vehicle with a container, is driving towards the left side where the woman stands. It has a \"FLASHER AHEAD\" warning sign in an orange diamond shape mounted on its front. The road shows signs of wear with visible cracks.\n\nThe bridge is equipped with simple metal guardrails on both sides, and beyond the railing on the left, the expansive blue ocean can be seen under a partly cloudy sky. The scene conveys a sense of stillness and anticipation, emphasizing the isolation of the bridge and the singular interaction between the pedestrian and the approaching truck.","title":"Female road worker directs traffic during repairs on the overseas highway leading to Key West","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["546859","549861","546724","544542","551236","552708","544292","547703","548401","547836","549879","543323","547490","546870","550836","542755"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["bridge","approach","truck","side","diamond","anticipation","guardrail","warning","crack","drive"]}
