{"path":"546100.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning sunset scene. The sky dominates much of the view, showcasing a dramatic blend of colorsâ€”vibrant hues of pink, purple, and a bit of orange streak across the horizon, fading upwards into darker blues and grays where scattered clouds are visible. Below, the skyline is defined by the silhouettes of rolling hills which appear dark and almost black against the vivid sky.\n\nIn terms of objects and activities, there's little to suggest human presence or motion; it's purely a natural landscape. In the foreground, dark outlines of trees or shrubs are perched atop the nearest hill, enhancing the feeling of an untouched wilderness area.\n\nOverall, the composition uses horizontal layers, with the bushy silhouettes grounding the image at the bottom and the expansive, color-drenched sky drawing the eye upward, giving an impression of tranquility and natural beauty.\n","title":"Sunset over the hills of Leakey","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["554396","552896","552335","550646","547719","557497","557560","544944","542680","552338","548123","548909","552895","545000","542678","547731"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["silhouette","streak","hill","term","purple","bit","outline","gray","wilderness","sunset"]}
