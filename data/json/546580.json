{"path":"546580.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features an interior scene framed by a darkened foreground that creates a vignette effect around the central image. The composition is split into two main visual areas: the upper part showcases a suspended light fixture featuring multiple globe-like bulbs arranged in a geometric pattern that emits a warm, inviting glow. This lighting arrangement is set against a ceiling and an obscured upper room that suggests a larger space, possibly an office or conference room.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, through a doorway, one can view a room where a man sits at a desk. The man, wearing a red shirt, appears to be engaged in office work or studying, focusing intently on either a document or a screen we cannot see from this angle. He is situated by the window, through which natural light is visible despite being diffused by translucent curtains, adding to the roomâ€™s soft illumination. The workspace is orderly, with just a few visible items including what appears to be a notepad, pen, and perhaps a telephone on the desk.\n\nThe atmosphere conveyed by the image is calm and somewhat introspective, partially attributed to the lighting and the solitary figure engrossed in his work. The contrast between the brighter and more detailed workspace and the dark, shadowy area from which we view the scene gives the photograph a sense of depth and intimate observation, almost as if the viewer is unnoticed, observing a private moment.","title":"Interior of cummins corporate office","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546572","546471","546486","552647","555290","555332","546483","546479","556016","546500","548864","547720","544437","544326","557038","555297"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["room","desk","workspace","office","attribute","globe","vignette","darkened","screen","bulb"]}
