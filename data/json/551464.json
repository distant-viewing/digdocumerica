{"path":"551464.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a striking, vivid yellow bicycle positioned prominently in the foreground. The bicycle has a sleek frame and is equipped with thin road tires and drop handlebars, suggesting it is designed for speed and efficiency. The pedals appear robust, suitable for secure footing. The bike is strategically placed to be the main focal point, and due to the angle of the shot, it visually intersects with a city background.\n\nIn the background, there is a busy urban setting that juxtaposes with the stationary bike. A police car, marked \"PCT 6,\" is parked on the street, hinting at a city environment where law enforcement presence is notable. The police car is partially obscured by the bicycle, providing a layered dimension to the scene.\n\nFurther to the right in the background, there's another individual partially visible, who gives a casual urban feel to the scene, possibly a pedestrian or another cyclist beyond the immediate focus of the camera.\n\nThe setting includes buildings that line the street, typical of a downtown area in a city, with large windows and what appears to be a commercial district. The sunlight casts strong shadows of the bicycle onto the paved street, suggesting it is a bright sunny day. This lighting enhances the vividness of the bicycle's yellow color and adds to the dynamic quality of the image with its contrasts and depth.","title":"Regular police patrols help keep down the number of bicycle thefts on Nicollet Mall.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551465","557535","551456","551443","547032","545328","551645","551445","554312","546169","547389","547199","550073","547400","556708","551303"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["bicycle","bike","police","city","street","enforcement","law","handlebar","cyclist","efficiency"]}
