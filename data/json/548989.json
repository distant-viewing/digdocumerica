{"path":"548989.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a vivid view of a large body of water, likely a lake or a reservoir, with several small islands or peninsulas scattered across it. The predominant color palette includes shades of blue for the water and brownish-reds for the rocky, barren landforms that emerge from the water.\n\nOn the closest peninsula, several people can be seen walking or standing, some are near the edge looking out onto the water. This peninsula is connected to the mainland (or a larger mass of land) via a narrow strip of land that seems almost submersed, suggesting possibly low water levels or a deliberately submerged path.\n\nIn the water, there are various boats adding a dynamic element to the scene. There's a sailboat with its white sails fully unfurled, drifting peacefully. Several smaller boats or personal watercraft are visible in the near distance, moving through the water or moored near the islands.\n\nFurther in the background, the terrain becomes more mountainous, and there's a visible contrast between the lush green vegetation further away and the arid, rocky foreground islands. The overall composition, with its vivid colors and varied landscape, captures a lively yet serene recreational scene, possibly on a warm, sunny day.","title":"Lake mead","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["555701","544006","544383","552234","554022","555710","552921","555388","544025","550640","552886","549030","548919","555707","552355","552222"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["peninsula","island","water","brownish","drift","watercraft","reservoir","sails","landform","land"]}
