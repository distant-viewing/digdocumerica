{"path":"556477.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a complex transportation infrastructure nestled within a semi-urban environment. The image includes several key features:\n\n1. **Railway Yards**: Prominently displayed are curved railway tracks lined with numerous coal cars, indicating this might be a major hub for goods transportation. There appears to be some activity with freight as the cars are densely packed in sections of the railway yard.\n\n2. **Highways and Bridges**: Overlapping the railway yard is a multi-lane highway bridge, showcasing a significant civil engineering structure that permits vehicular traffic over the railway lines. This could facilitate efficient cross-town traffic flow separate from the railway operations.\n\n3. **Canal**: Adjacent to the railway lines, a canal is visible, which closely follows the curvature of the railway. This canal might be used for small boats or for drainage purposes.\n\n4. **Residential and Commercial Area**: Bordering one side of the railway tracks is a residential area with houses spaced closely together. The area includes smaller streets and some patches of green. On the other side of the tracks, there are more industrial-looking buildings, perhaps linked to the railway or manufacturing. \n\n5. **Landscaping and Terrain**: The area is flat, which is typical for rail and road infrastructure that requires level grounds. The vegetation around is moderate, with a mix of small patches of wooded areas and open grassy fields.\n\n6. **Overall Composition**: The perspective is top-down, with excellent visibility over the entire scene which provides a comprehensive overview of how the different aspects of transportation and residential life intersect. The image is rich in detail, allowing an understanding of the functional layout of this particular area, possibly aiming for an efficient logistics hub. \n\nThis image is likely used for planning or analysis purposes in urban design and transport logistics, providing a clear and structured layout of a multi-use area blending transportation and residential zones.","title":"Aerial of rail yards in danville, West Virginia, near Charleston, the second largest in the world behind Williamson West Virginia.
