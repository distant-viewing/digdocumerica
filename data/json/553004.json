{"path":"553004.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a densely packed car junkyard. The image is filled with a large number of vehicles in various states of disrepair and dismantlement. Many of the cars have their hoods open, showing rusted and abandoned engines. Some vehicles are stacked on top of one another, while others are tilted or turned on their sides.\n\nThe cars vary in model and color, including hues of white, black, blue, and red, though many are faded and covered in rust and dust. The junkyard setting includes scattered auto parts, debris, and overgrown vegetation creeping up around and over the vehicles, suggesting the area has been untended for some time.\n\nIn the background, lush green trees are visible, indicating the junkyard is likely located in a somewhat rural or suburban area with substantial vegetation. The overall composition of the photograph is cluttered and chaotic, providing a detailed portrayal of mechanical decay and the final resting place for these vehicles.","title":"Auto dump.
