{"path":"554236.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant winter scene at a busy ski resort. In the foreground, several skiers are seen descending a gentle slope. Some are upright and gliding, while others are slightly bent as they maneuver. Multiple skiers, clad in colorful ski gear such as reds, yellows, and blues, populate the slope, adding to the lively atmosphere of the setting.\n\nNestled in the middle ground of the image are rustic-style buildings, possibly lodges or resort facilities, featuring dark roofs laden with snow. These structures emit a cozy, inviting ambiance amidst the cold, snowy environment.\n\nBeyond these facilities, the background is dominated by majestic mountains draped in snow, creating a dramatic and picturesque backdrop. The mountains have various tones of dark and light areas, indicating ridges and valleys, and are partially covered by sparse vegetation.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with skiers in the foreground, architecturally intriguing buildings in the middle, and the grandeur of snowy mountains in the back, combined with the clear blue sky, evokes a sense of adventure and the serene beauty of winter sports and landscapes.","title":"Condominiums built alongside the ski slope at Snowmass Mountain.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554235","554253","554292","550004","554257","554234","554254","554255","550017","554251","554242","554249","554279","554275","554252","554245"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["skier","resort","winter","mountain","slope","snow","lodge","ski","facility","ridge"]}
