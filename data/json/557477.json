{"path":"557477.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a field of young plants, each supported by thin vertical stakes, a common sight in agricultural settings. The plants appear to be small and bushy, possibly young tomato plants or another vegetable crop, with the stakes used for support as they grow.\n\nIn the background, several large billboards are visible, contributing a contrast between the natural agricultural foreground and the commercial background. The billboards advertise a variety of subjects, including locations like Lake Tahoe and a California tennis club, implying the setting may be in or near California. One billboard prominently reads \"THE SHORES LAKE FRONT APARTMENTS,\" offering rentals with daily, weekly, and monthly rates, along with a provided phone number.\n\nThe horizon shows a clear sky with broad daylight illuminating the scene. Additionally, power lines can be seen extending across the field at the top of the frame, further suggesting the juxtaposition of rural and urban elements. The photography technique used here focuses on the farthest objects, the billboards, slightly blurring the foreground stakes, which adds depth to the image and draws the viewerâ€™s eye toward the signs.","title":"Development signs border one of a few remaining farm fields near the ocean in fast growing orange county.
