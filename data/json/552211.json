{"path":"552211.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a moody and atmospheric industrial landscape alongside a body of water, likely a river or a lake. In the foreground, a prominent sign reads \"NO TRESPASSING KEEP OUT,\" mounted on a simple post directly in front of the camera. The sign implies restricted access, contributing to an overall sense of forbidding or exclusivity in the scene.\n\nThe view beyond the sign shows a wide expanse of water reflecting a cloudy sky with hints of blue and patches of light, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. Along the left bank, there is a narrow, sandy shoreline lined sporadically with grassy vegetation. This natural scene contrasts with the industrial setting visible in the background.\n\nIn the distance, industrial structures dominate the landscape. A tall, thin chimney stands out, emitting a plume of smoke that drifts across the sky. This chimney, along with other low-lying industrial buildings, hints at the area's industrial usage, possibly a factory or a similar facility. Additionally, some smaller structures and vehicles are faintly visible, suggesting ongoing industrial activity or stored equipment.\n\nThe overall setting evokes a blend of natural beauty and industrial intrusion, marked distinctly by the environmental impact suggested by the factory emissions. The photograph invites contemplation on the interplay between industry and nature and the boundaries set by humans that often exclude or restrict the natural landscape.","title":"PulPage waste water treatment lagoons at Weyerhaeuser and St. Regis pulp mills","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552212","552014","550995","552194","547539","550694","544527","544328","552139","551576","552188","555382","550710","548248","550332","545988"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["restrict","chimney","factory","trespassing","drift","intrusion","sign","usage","emission","keep"]}
