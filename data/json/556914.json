{"path":"556914.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a scenic landscape dominated by dense forest and clearing boundaries. In the foreground, a relatively large cleared plot of land sticks out amid the surrounding dense evergreen trees. Several buildings, possibly homes or farm structures, are scattered across this clearing, connected by visible paths or small roads. Parallel to the clearing is a major road lined with occasional vehicles, hinting at some connectivity to nearby areas or regions.\n\nThe middle-ground slowly transitions into a body of water that stretches horizontally across the frame, leading the eye towards distant snow-capped mountain ranges seen prominently in the background under a clear sky. The natural terrain, water, and the distant mountains create a tranquil and secluded environment, typical of a rural or semi-wilderness area. The vastness of the forest and the minimal human development suggest a region that is either preserved or used sustainably, likely supporting a small community with a strong connection to the natural surroundings.","title":"Aerial view looking southwest showing farms adjacent to clear creek road in the foreground and the navy's Bangor annex Douglas fir re-growth land in the center of the photo.  Hood canal and the olympic mountains are in the background.  A trident submarine base will be built at the Bangor annex u.s.  Navy installation.  The facilities are expected to result in population growth and affect the lives of the people and animals who presently live there","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["556915","556916","556918","556904","556937","556997","556938","556931","556907","557003","556913","550533","556920","550642","556919","556996"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["clearing","region","connectivity","mountain","plot","preserve","forest","stick","clear","road"]}
