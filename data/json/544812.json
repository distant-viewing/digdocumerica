{"path":"544812.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction or excavation site possibly on the outskirts of a town or city. In the foreground, the ground is uneven and littered with debris, including chunks of broken concrete and wooden poles sticking out of the earth. Some of these poles are freestanding while others appear toppled or leaning.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by heavy construction machinery, including several yellow earth-moving vehicles like bulldozers and dump trucks, which are actively engaged in work, evidenced by visible dirt trails and disturbed earth around them. There is also one smaller vehicle that appears to be a car or a small truck.\n\nIn the background, there is a densely packed residential area with numerous houses and buildings. The architecture is modest, mostly one or two stories high, and the buildings are closely spaced. The area has a hilly terrain, and beyond the residential area, hills can faintly be seen, suggesting the location might be in a valley or a similar geological formation.\n\nThe sky is clear and the environment looks dry, indicating the photo might have been taken in a semi-arid or arid region. The overall scene captures a moment of transformation where land is being prepared for development adjacent to an already established community.","title":"Trash, blowing over the fences of Jefferson County's open dump, often ends up miles away.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["553378","557479","552814","553382","555608","555583","551187","547225","545665","552031","553383","545652","547833","543105","547591","549169"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["earth","truck","pole","transformation","chunk","disturb","construction","establish","bulldozer","dump"]}
