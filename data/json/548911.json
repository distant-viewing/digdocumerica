{"path":"548911.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a light-colored helicopter labeled with \"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\" on its side and \"17736\" near its tail. The helicopter is a large utility type, predominantly white, with a single main rotor and a tail rotor. \n\nIt is parked on a fairly wide airstrip. The ground is made of concrete, marked with some lines, suggesting structure such as a helipad or a section of an airport specifically for helicopter operations. The backdrop is a stark, flat landscape that appears arid, suggestive of a desert. The sky is clear, indicating fair weather with ample sunlight.\n\nTo the right, there is a man, dressed in a dark-colored cap, a light-colored long-sleeved shirt, and darker pants. He stands facing the helicopter, one hand raised as though gesturing or operating a device on his left hand, which could be related to the helicopter's operation or communication equipment.\n\nOverall, the setting suggests an official or government-related operation, likely in a remote or isolated location, facilitated by the Environmental Protection Agency, which hints at an environmental monitoring or investigative activity.","title":"Epa helicopter","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545642","552383","546683","545637","552372","555835","545638","552370","544771","552365","545685","544766","544754","544737","545681","544741"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","rotor","tail","operation","government","airport","relate","communication","monitoring","facilitate"]}
