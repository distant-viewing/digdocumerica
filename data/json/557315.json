{"path":"557315.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a complex array of industrial HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) equipment in a mechanical room. The scene is filled with various industrial components including pipes, tanks, and air conditioning units, mostly in shades of gray, green, and black. To aid in identification and operation, numerous yellow labels with descriptive text are attached to different parts of the equipment. Key labels include \"AIR HEATING COIL,\" \"ARKLA 3-TON BT Li BR ABSORPTION AIR CONDITIONER,\" \"STORAGE TANK WATER TEMPERATURE,\" and \"HOT WATER PREHEATER.\"\n\nThe mechanical equipment is organized with precision, with pipes running vertically and horizontally, demonstrating a well-planned layout that maximizes the space used. There are also several gauges and control systems visible, which are presumably used to monitor and regulate the temperature and flow of air and water through the system. Overhead, the complex metal framework supporting the ceiling is exposed, adding to the industrial feel of the space. The environment suggests a focus on functionality and efficiency typical of industrial or commercial building infrastructure.","title":"Part of the plumbing and associated equipment for the solar heating and cooling demonstration project, funded by the National Science Foundation.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["555352","557316","545844","558365","543158","557387","544153","552003","555330","544818","555328","543800","556389","546767","558371","544822"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["conditioning","air","label","pipe","equipment","system","tank","heating","identification","efficiency"]}
