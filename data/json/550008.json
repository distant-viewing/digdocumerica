{"path":"550008.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures an image of a weathered, old wooden door featuring two distinct parts and six windows (three in each part). The door appears to be constructed from dark toned wood arranged in both vertical and diagonal patterns, suggesting a herringbone style within the framed panels. Only four of the windows are intact, with glass panes set into small, square frames; these windows, marked by small muntins, have a classic aesthetic. The remaining two window areas are panelled off, each containing one dusty, rust-stained white porcelain bowl. The bowls seem out of place, making their purpose or reason for being there uncertain. The combination of the door's battered condition and the oddly placed bowls adds a unique, perhaps historical or neglected, character to the scene. The overall impression is rustic and carries an air of abandonment or disuse.","title":"Rear of Lord & Jealous wool mill at City Mills, industrial town on the Charles River","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["545821","552511","557081","549193","543348","557649","552510","555295","543028","553479","547808","557640","557633","555605","543339","553478"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["bowl","door","window","reason","disuse","pane","combination","rust","panel","character"]}
