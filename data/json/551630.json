{"path":"551630.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene in an urban setting, specifically in front of 15 Gramercy Park as indicated by the signage on the canopy. The image shows a young person engaged in gardening along a sidewalk. The person, who appears to be a young male, is squatting over a small garden bed, surrounded by various plants and flowers. He is focused on planting or tending to the garden, holding gardening tools, and there is a box labeled “PINNACLE” and a metal basin nearby, likely containing gardening supplies or dirt.\n\nThe setting is characterized by classic city elements such as wrought iron railings, well-maintained facades, and a tree-lined street. The buildings in the background have traditional architectural features, suggesting a well-established, affluent neighborhood. A man can be seen walking in the background, adding a sense of everyday urban life to the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken on a sunny day, casting clear shadows and highlighting the greenery and the activities of the person gardening. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on a quiet, personal moment amidst the bustling city environment, evokes a sense of tranquility and the personal satisfaction derived from caring for plants.","title":"The old fashioned homes and gardens of Gramercy Park have been beautifully maintained since 1831.
