{"path":"547567.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil suburban landscape featuring a small collection of houses. The scene is taken during the day under a clear, bright blue sky which suggests it might be summer or a season of good weather.\n\nIn the forefront, a dirt road stretches from the paved foreground deeper into the image, dividing slightly as it leads to three houses. The road appears somewhat worn and sandy, typical of coastal or rural areas. A street sign on the left identifies the area as \"Sunset Blvd 401\".\n\nThe houses are modest, two-story structures, characterized by a simple architectural style. Each house has a different exterior color paletteâ€”grey, orange, and pale yellow. They are raised on stilts, which likely serves as protection from potential flooding, indicating that the area may be near water. Each house has stairs leading up to the first floors, emphasizing their raised design. The underparts of the houses are utilized differently; one seems to be an open garage or storage area, while the others are enclosed possibly for privacy or additional security.\n\nThe surrounding area is relatively sparse and natural, with sandy soil, patches of grass and wild undergrowth. There are no trees immediately visible close to the houses, suggesting a landscape that might commonly experience strong winds or salt spray, which can limit vegetation growth. One electricity pole is visible, indicating that the area has basic utilities.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its leading lines of the road and the placement of the houses, creates a sense of quiet residential life, possibly in a beach or coastal community. The image evokes a feeling of peaceful isolation, typical of less densely populated areas.","title":"Houses on the dune","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["551164","557454","556950","546430","556601","553928","556433","547433","556395","553705","553929","556333","557405","557547","556436","556426"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","road","security","stilt","privacy","electricity","salt","flooding","undergrowth","protection"]}
