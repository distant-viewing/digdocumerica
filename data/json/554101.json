{"path":"554101.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene coastal scene, probably capturing a small town or village nestled beside the sea. The focal point of the image is the vast, calm blue water in the foreground, upon which a small boat with two occupants is gently advancing. The boat appears to be a simple motorboat and the occupants are visible but not detailed due to the distance.\n\nIn the background, a densely packed collection of houses and structures can be seen, many with red roofs contrasting against the lush greenery encompassing them. These buildings are varying in size, suggesting a residential area mixed possibly with some small commercial or communal facilities. The overall vegetation is dense and tropical, indicating a possibly warm and humid climate.\n\nThe undulating terrain in the background, along with the patches of green fields, hint at the rural and possibly agricultural nature of the region. The location is marked by a striking natural beauty, demonstrated by the juxtaposition of human habitation with the surrounding landscape and ocean.\n\nThe composition of the photo places the boat and the ocean at the lower third, which helps emphasize the expansive seascape and the peaceful activity of boating. It's a picturesque scene that conveys a sense of tranquility and simple coastal living.","title":"Shoreline scene in the Hilo area","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["542908","542877","542903","542907","548733","542870","555694","557813","547556","542910","548763","545057","544554","553925","542918","549380"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["occupant","boat","ocean","village","encompass","motorboat","seascape","boating","third","demonstrate"]}
