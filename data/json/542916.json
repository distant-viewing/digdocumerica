{"path":"542916.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image captures a serene rural landscape during the early hours of the day, with dawn's gentle sunlight permeating the atmosphere. The scene is extensively dominated by a vast, lush field that stretches across the foreground and leads the eye towards a small cluster of buildings positioned moderately toward the center but slightly to the left. These structures include a red-roofed barn and a larger white house with noticeable architectural details, perhaps featuring a porch and several windows.\n\nIn the background, large, smooth hills or mountains, devoid of any trees or visible vegetation, rise majestically. The slopes are bathed in a mix of shadows and light, which adds a sense of depth and dimension to the scene.\n\nThe morning light creates a somewhat hazy, glistening quality on the surface of the field, possibly kissing dew upon the grass. The overall mood of the photograph is tranquil and somewhat isolated, evoking a sense of peaceful rural life. The sky above the landscape is clear, with a few streaks of light possibly indicating the sun just out of view. The image's composition uses the rule of thirds effectively, placing the horizon and main subjects in a balanced manner that draws the viewer's eye naturally across the scene.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["557023","549146","547428","554819","556963","545040","549261","547309","553809","554801","557087","555537","557946","549256","557519","554767"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["rule","dew","dimension","eye","devoid","glisten","third","streak","field","manner"]}
