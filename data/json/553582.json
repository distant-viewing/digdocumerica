{"path":"553582.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph appears to be a close-up shot of a rough, textured surface, possibly a type of soil or sediment. The variety of colors predominantly range from dark browns to grays with speckles and streaks of black material scattered throughout. The texture is quite detailed and irregular, featuring patches that resemble frost or a crystalline structure which could suggest moisture or mineral deposits. There are no objects, people, activities, or any discernible background elements other than the close-up detail of this surface. The composition focuses entirely on capturing the intricate physical characteristics of this terrain-like surface, emphasizing its natural patterns and complexity.","title":"In August 1973, a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora, in the \"Granite Creek\" section of the burn area.
