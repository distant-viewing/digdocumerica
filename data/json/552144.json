{"path":"552144.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures a stunning aerial view of a mountainous landscape. In the background, a magnificent range of snow-covered peaks stretches across the horizon, their white tips standing in stark contrast against the deep blue sky above. The mountains appear rugged and majestic, likely part of a significant mountain chain.\n\nIn the foreground, the terrain is composed of a series of darker, forested mountains and valleys, creating a rich tapestry of greens and browns. The lower mountains show clear signs of logging or forest management, as evidenced by large swaths of cleared patches that zigzag across the slopes. These cleared areas are lighter in color, likely due to exposed soil or young vegetation, and they create geometric patterns against the darker hues of the dense forests.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its layered perspective from the verdant forelands rising to the high, snowy peaks, offers a vivid portrayal of a diverse and dynamic landscape, likely viewed from an airplane or a high vantage point. The photo conveys a sense of the vastness and the untouched wilderness of these mountain ranges.","title":"Olympic Mountains near Port Angeles.
