{"path":"552606.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures the reflection and details seen through the window of a café. The most prominent feature in the image is the large white lettering spelling out \"CAFE\" on the window, which is designed to be read from the outside and is reversed in the image due to the reflection.\n\nThe window also contains several posters and advertisements, including political campaign posters for \"Mike Strang\" and \"Pete J. Mattivi\". These posters include photographs of the candidates, campaign slogans, and reminders to vote. Additionally, there's another poster regarding an event or location named \"ALEY\".\n\nThe reflection in the window shows a street scene with buildings across the street, a clear blue sky, and part of a truck parked in front of the café. The background buildings and the vehicles are somewhat distorted and overlaid by the details on the window, creating a layered visual effect. The color of the building where the café is located has a deep red or brick hue, adding warmth to the scene. The edges of the window are framed by brickwork, enhancing the quaint and rustic feel of the setting.","title":"Rifle, the major community of the piceance basin, is a small town with a one-street business district","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["558123","542894","544144","542802","542799","543132","545380","547809","543028","551867","555942","545869","546521","547805","544882","549656"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["café","poster","campaign","window","reflection","slogan","overlay","spell","distort","regard"]}
