{"path":"545856.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a silhouette of a windmill set against a vivid, deep red-orange backdrop. The sun is directly behind the windmill, illuminating its outline and creating a dramatic burst effect through its blades. The windmill silhouette shows its circular head with numerous radiating blades and a connected vertical support structure, all standing prominently in the image. The blades have a slight curvature and geometric spacing that captures and intricately disperses the backlight of the sun, thus enhancing the visual prominence of the windmill against the relatively darker surrounding scenery. Below the windmill, the image fades into shadow, drawing attention primarily to the illuminated and striking parts of the windmill and the sunâ€™s glow. The overall mood is dramatic and slightly mysterious due to the color tones and silhouette effect.","title":"Sunset behind windmill","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545852","545848","547283","547347","547345","549212","555291","545832","549216","549210","547293","548886","545418","549213","549211","547341"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["windmill","blade","silhouette","sun","backlight","curvature","effect","prominence","support","scenery"]}
