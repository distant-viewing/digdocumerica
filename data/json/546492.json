{"path":"546492.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph shows an urban setting focusing on a brick building and its surroundings. The predominant feature is a cluster of spherical, silver street lamps mounted on a dark metal pole, situated in the foreground but slightly left of the center.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a figure (presumably a young woman based on the hairstyle and attire) is sitting on a low wall of the brick building, engaging in a leisure activity, possibly reading a book or using a small device. The personâ€™s position appears relaxed and pensively engaged in the activity.\n\nThe building itself has a relatively plain and sturdy appearance, characteristic of post-war architecture, with visible details including a rough brick texture and a simple, linear design. A concrete overhang can be seen at the top, suggesting part of a larger structure possibly extending beyond the frame.\n\nAdjacent to the building and to the left in the frame, there is lush green foliage, adding a touch of natural elements contrasting with the urban environment. The overall composition uses natural light, casting soft shadows and highlights, which contribute to a serene and somewhat introspective ambiance in the scene.","title":"Cleo Rogers Memorial Library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546470","546474","546431","551741","551489","551496","551477","553156","556249","553188","546493","547748","551461","549281","557281","550031"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["brick","hairstyle","overhang","building","book","lamp","device","mount","use","situate"]}
