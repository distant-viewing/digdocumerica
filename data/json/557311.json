{"path":"557311.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a surface with a hexagonal pattern, resembling a honeycomb structure. The cells of the structure are uniform in shape, each having six sides, and create a tightly packed grid that covers the entire image. The coloring of this honeycomb pattern ranges from a very light, almost white hue at the center, fading into a progressively darker blue towards the outer edges.\n\nThe center of the image is highlighted with a relatively bright white light, possibly indicating a light source shining directly onto or through the surface. This light source causes a gradient effect in terms of color brightness and saturation. The intensity of the white light fades as it moves outward towards the edges of the image where the blue becomes deeper.\n\nThe composition appears to be a meticulously captured detail of a texture that might be found in nature or a synthetic material designed to mimic natural structures. The overall feel of the image could be considered both artistic and scientific, as it captures the intricate pattern and color transition with a fine level of detail. There's no contextual scenery or identifiable objects besides the patterned surface itself, creating a strong focus on texture and color interaction.","title":"Closeup of an experimental solar heating flat plate collector using bonded honeycomb material for an air heating system","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["555155","556641","550606","557626","555177","543149","553582","555841","557314","555172","552239","552980","557609","555226","544682","555837"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["source","pattern","coloring","surface","blue","saturation","intensity","term","brightness","detail"]}
