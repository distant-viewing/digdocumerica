{"path":"552080.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of environmental pollution near a body of water, showcasing a stark contrast between natural and man-made elements. In the foreground, there is a large accumulation of garbage piled up on the shore. This trash includes various discarded items such as metal cans, plastic bottles, a rusty barrel, and other debris, creating a cluttered and chaotic appearance.\n\nThe middle ground of the picture features a river running horizontally across the frame. The water appears calm and occupies a significant part of the scene, reflecting a serene contrast to the polluted shore. \n\nIn the background, one can see the opposite bank of the river, which is lined with green vegetation, possibly trees and bushes. This natural backdrop across the river contrasts with the polluted condition of the foreground, emphasizing the impact of human waste on natural environments.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its sharp juxtaposition between the polluted foreground and the more pristine water and distant shoreline, serves as a powerful visual statement on environmental degradation. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, casting a soft light over the scene and enhancing the colors and details of both the trash and the natural surroundings.","title":"The south bank of the Kansas River on the east side of Lawrence has become a much used dumping ground.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552098","550687","550352","549820","547524","552100","547525","552811","550812","551247","552082","551440","551531","555228","547907","545945"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["trash","river","shore","statement","barrel","accumulation","garbage","can","degradation","bottle"]}
