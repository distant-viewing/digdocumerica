{"path":"548643.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of a developed area situated within a coastal and forested region. In the foreground and extending towards the middle part of the image, there are a series of parallel white strips that resemble roads or pathways laid out in an organized grid pattern. Each strip is bordered by small patches of greenery, possibly bushes or small trees, lending a manicured and structured appearance to the area. Alongside these strips, towards the left of the image, there is a curved white sandbank or beachfront facing tranquil blue waters, enhancing the coastal vibe of the scene.\n\nThe backdrop consists of dense greenery, indicating a heavily forested area, with smaller islands and bodies of water visible in the distance, contributing to a scenic natural landscape surrounding the developed sections. The vast coverage of the forest compared to the structured area underscores a contrast between human development and natural environment.\n\nOverall, the composition reflects a blend of human-made infrastructure integrated into a coastal and forested environment, likely designed for specific functional or recreational purposes given the proximity to the water.","title":"Land development at big pine key, showing the typical scraped land and \"plugged\" canals of the developers in this area permits to open artificial waterways to the sea are hard to get developers dig the canals anyway, but stop them just short of open water.
