{"path":"551453.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant, sunlit scene at a public park with a fountain as the central feature. The circular fountain spurts jets of water upward, creating a refreshing and lively ambiance. Two young adults, a man and a woman, are sitting close to the fountain on what appears to be a raised platform or border of the fountain. They are engaged in conversation, facing each other. The woman is wearing a sleeveless white top and shorts, and the man is in a short-sleeved black shirt and jeans.\n\nIn the middle ground of the photo, behind the conversing pair, a young girl rides her bicycle along the edge of the fountain. She is focused on her path, navigating comfortably around the water.\n\nThe background shows the edges of the park, with other park visitors seen distantly. Among them appears to be another person who is walking through the park. Tall trees and well-maintained lawns suggest that the setting is a well-kept urban space. The atmosphere is casual and leisurely, typical of a pleasant day in a community park.","title":"Hand-in-hand on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551449","551451","550752","551772","550072","551640","551667","551793","553207","553185","552737","549982","557258","550747","550763","551636"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","park","jet","bicycle","converse","woman","keep","edge","ride","lawn"]}
