{"path":"549322.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a scene by a body of water, likely a river dock or quay, with an urban environment as the backdrop. The image has a slight vintage feel, suggested by the wear and haze of colors, typical of older photographs.\n\nThe main focus is a woman seated on the edge of the dock. She is dressed casually in a blue t-shirt and jeans, with her hair pulled back from her face, and appears deep in thought or relaxation, enjoying the moment as she looks towards the water. Nearby, a bicycle lies on its side, leaning against the dock; it has a wicker basket attached to the front which suggests it might belong to the woman.\n\nThe background displays an urban setting with aged and industrial features. To the left, older model cars are parked along the street that runs parallel to the waterside where other individuals can be seen. These people appear to be engaged in various activities: one person is bending over possibly picking something up, and another is walking by. This suggests the area might be frequented by locals for daily activities or work-related tasks.\n\nThe composition of the image, characterized by its relaxed yet slightly melancholic ambiance, mirrors the solitary nature of the woman's pose and the somewhat dilapidated condition of the surroundings. The lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, a time when the sun casts shadows and enriches the colors of the scene.","title":"Pause for relaxation on a pier overlooking the Hudson River a few blocks north of Lower Manhattan's newly built World Trade Center.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550940","548523","543465","551448","547594","553156","545911","555945","552026","544260","552806","544266","554486","550268","551828","546223"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["dock","woman","local","basket","bicycle","t","thought","relaxation","pose","vintage"]}
