{"path":"546824.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a group of workers, likely at an industrial site. They are dressed in work attire appropriate for a labor-intensive environment. Several of them are wearing hard hats, some marked with numbers like \"04\" and \"74\", which possibly suggests a numbering system for identification or group assignment purposes. The foreground prominently features one man who seems to be engaged in conversation or making a point, highlighted by his open-mouthed expression and direct gaze possibly towards another person or group outside the frame. The others are either looking away or appear to be listening attentively.\n\nTheir clothing is quite rugged; some wear jackets and others layered shirts, suitable for outdoor work conditions. One noticeable feature is a worker on the left side, smoking a cigarette, adding a casual element to the scene. Their expressions range from serious to slightly weary, hinting at either a challenging workday or a serious discussion.\n\nIn the background, there is a faint outline of a large structure, possibly a warehouse or a large industrial building, contributing to the authenticity of an industrial setting. The overall mood is one of a no-nonsense work environment where practical attire and safety gear are paramount. The slight blur and grain in the image suggests that the photograph might be from an older film camera, giving it a historical or documentary feel.","title":"Unloading a container ship at dundalk marine terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["556376","556339","556391","556893","543995","556866","556335","553160","546933","556864","543651","542989","545537","544022","544171","553636"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["group","worker","work","workday","authenticity","identification","cigarette","other","grain","discussion"]}
