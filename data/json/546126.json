{"path":"546126.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural landscape, possibly in a rural or semi-rural setting. The primary focus is a small, muddy creek that winds through the center of the image, surrounded by dense vegetation. The water in the creek is reddish-brown, likely due to soil erosion, and it flows gently, with some ripples visible, suggesting a mild current.\n\nThe creek is flanked on both sides by lush, tall greenery, including various types of wild grasses and bushes. The banks of the creek are not sharply defined, blending softly with the surrounding vegetation, which suggests a natural, untamed environment.\n\nOn the right side of the image, in the background, there is a traditional white house with a blue roof. The house, which appears quite small from this perspective, adds a human element to the landscape, indicating that this area is not completely isolated. There is also a water tower visible far in the background, adding another layer of human habitation to the scene.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, with large patches of blue and fluffy white clouds, suggesting a fair weather day. The light appears soft and diffused, possibly indicating either early morning or late afternoon. This lighting adds a calm, tranquil mood to the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, the meandering creek, the lush greenery, and the distant human elements, all contribute to a peaceful, pastoral scene that invites contemplation of nature and its interactions with human environments.","title":"The beginning of mill creek, which carries waste material from the calcasieu paper mill in Elizabeth, la., deep into surrounding forests","placename":"Lake Charles (La.)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["547487","545473","557736","546896","555211","553434","542653","553427","545008","555575","549187","556964","552108","550782","550656","557106"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["creek","house","current","flanke","greenery","habitation","define","contemplation","meander","erosion"]}
