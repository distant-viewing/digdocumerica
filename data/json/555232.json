{"path":"555232.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a partially constructed wooden structure, presumably a building, situated in a dense forest. The structure appears to be in an early stage of construction, where only the wooden skeleton has been erected. Visible architectural elements include several steeply pitched roof trusses, some of which are only partially completed with cross bracing and roof sheathing.\n\nThe framework consists of multiple vertical and angled support beams, creating a geometric pattern throughout. These support beams are interconnected to form a series of triangular roof structures, indicative of an A-frame design, commonly used in cabins or similar rustic-style buildings. The roof trusses are not uniformly covered; some areas have sparse wooden planks laid across them, suggesting an ongoing process of adding a roof.\n\nThe setting is heavily wooded with tall, dense trees surrounding the site, enhancing the secluded feel of the location. The forest floor is visible with scattered leaves, small plants, and bits of snow, indicating a cold climate or season when the photo was taken.\n\nThe construction materials used, primarily unvarnished and rough-cut wood, blend into the surrounding environment, giving the building an organic and natural aesthetic. There are no people or tools visible in the frame, leading to an undisturbed and serene atmosphere, focusing entirely on the architectural structure and its natural surroundings.","title":"A house being built for a private owner three miles east of Matlock, Washington.
