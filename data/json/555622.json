{"path":"555622.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, expansive mining or quarry site. The foreground shows piles of rubble and soil of varying colors—from dark browns to purplish hues—indicative of recent excavation activities. A muddy, brown water pool collects at the center of the image, surrounded by steep, eroded walls. This suggests active or ongoing excavation work in the area.\n\nThe middle ground further illustrates the scale of the operation with exposed earth and additional piles of extracted materials, extending towards the background. Several layers of the earth's strata are visible, providing a cross-sectional view of the geological compositions.\n\nIn the background, a dense line of trees is visible, marking the edge of the disturbed land and contrasting sharply with the barren, worked-over landscape in the foreground. The sky above is clear and blue, adding a fresh, open-air feel to the scene, despite the industrial activity displayed.\n\nThe overall scene is devoid of visible human presence or machinery, which might imply either a temporarily inactive site or a perspective focused purely on the environmental impact and physical scope of the quarry or mine. The location radiates a sense of raw and rugged terrain under human alteration.","title":"Buttes, mesas and canyons are created after coal companies strip mine land in southeastern Ohio.
