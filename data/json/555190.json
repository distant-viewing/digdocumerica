{"path":"555190.jpg","date":"March 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up image of a fern leaf, possibly backlit to enhance the contrast and colors. The fern is depicted in a striking deep red and pink hue, which is not common in natural settings, suggesting the use of a colored filter or special lighting effects that imbue the scene with a dreamlike, surreal quality. \n\nThe image focuses on the intricate details of the fern's structure, prominently showing the pinnate leaf arrangement where smaller leaflets (pinnae) are attached to a central stem. Each leaflet is slightly curled and has a textured appearance, with distinct lines running parallel along its length which might indicate desiccation or a particular phase in its life cycle.\n\nThe background is dark and blurred, providing a stark contrast that makes the red fern leaf stand out vividly. This lends a sense of depth to the image, emphasizing the leaf as the central subject. The overall mood conveys a touch of mystery and highlights the natural beauty and complexity of fern leaves.","title":"Ferns burned from overexposure to the sun because the land was clear-cut and burned six years earlier in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554729","553590","555049","555191","555192","553589","554744","554996","555053","554577","553358","554743","557593","555050","543620","557168"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["fern","leaf","phase","cycle","filter","stem","mystery","complexity","length","arrangement"]}
