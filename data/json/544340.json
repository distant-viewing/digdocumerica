{"path":"544340.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic, lively moment at what appears to be a natural waterfall with multiple cascading tiers of water. The setting is lush and verdant, suggesting a tropical or subtropical locale.\n\nThe waterfall consists of several levels with water flowing over them, creating smaller pools at each tier before reaching the main body of water at the bottom. Each cascade forms foamy white water, contrasting with the calmer, clear blue pools that form at the foot of each tier.\n\nSeveral people are enjoying the waterfall and its surroundings. On the right, two individuals are standing close to one of the falls, apparently engaged in conversation or simply admiring the view. Towards the left, another person is seen climbing the rocky edge of a pool, while further to the left a person is reclining in the water, enjoying the natural beauty of the area.\n\nTrees and other greenery surround the waterfall, adding a sense of isolation and tranquility to the scene. The natural color tones—shades of green from the foliage, blue of the water, and the earthen browns of the rocks—are vivid and rich, enhanced by the bright sunlight filtering through the foliage.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the natural environment and the human element enjoying this pristine setting, is both vibrant and calming.","title":"Bathers cool off at Havasu Falls.
