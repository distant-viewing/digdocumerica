{"path":"547107.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a cityscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft light and rich, colorful sky. The scene is dominated by numerous brick buildings with multiple chimneys rising prominently from their rooftops. Each chimney is rectangular in shape and exhibits a reddish-brown color, typical of brick structures. The roofs of these buildings show some reflective surfaces, indicating the presence of, perhaps, metal elements or glass. These architectural structures are tightly clustered together, creating a dense and compact city environment.\n\nIn the foreground, leafless trees suggest that the image might have been taken in late autumn or winter. Behind the chimneys and buildings, there is a vast expanse that appears to be either a low-lying plain or a body of water, subtly differentiated from the sky by the horizon line. Throughout the sky, scattered clouds are visible, painted in hues of purple, pink, and dark blue, lending a dramatic and somewhat melancholic atmosphere to the scene. The overall composition reflects an urban environment during change or transition, highlighted by the lighting and perspective focusing on the industrial aspect of the city through its numerous chimneys.","title":"Rooftops in Chicago's north side","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551141","555737","552165","547206","547207","551140","552188","545406","545499","557411","549970","545239","557233","546042","547090","548337"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["chimney","brick","plain","city","rooftop","purple","change","autumn","transition","winter"]}
