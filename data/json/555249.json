{"path":"555249.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a laboratory, portraying a scientific setting involving equipment and a researcher. On the left side of the image, there’s a large equipment panel featuring a vertical strip chart recorder at the front, recording real-time data on a paper strip. This recorder has an analog display with scrolled data, marked by various hand-written annotations indicating specific points of interest or measurements.\n\nIn the foreground, part of a bench or shelf hosts an array of laboratory glassware which includes flasks, beakers, and other assorted small bottles, perhaps containing chemical reagents or samples. These materials and equipment suggest an experimental or analytical process is underway.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a man dressed in a white lab coat is actively engaged in an experiment or process. He is adjusting or examining something in his hands, potentially related to the experiment monitored by the equipment beside him. His attention is focused on his task, illustrating hands-on scientific work. \n\nThe background reveals a clean, clinical laboratory environment with a plain white wall and minimal adornment, focusing the viewer’s attention on the equipment and the researcher’s activities. The overall setting suggests a professional research environment, likely dedicated to scientific or medical studies.","title":"Pesticides are separated and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively by a gas chromatograph at the Mississippi test facility environmental protection agency laboratory in bay st louis","placename":"Mississippi","location":"Mississippi","nn1":["555248","549333","546285","546278","546284","555280","555281","549607","549608","555250","555265","546277","542666","549332","542665","548862"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["laboratory","researcher","equipment","datum","experiment","strip","hand","chart","glassware","flask"]}
