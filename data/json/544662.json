{"path":"544662.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a tree trunk, displaying detailed texture and patterns on its bark. The bark is rough and rugged, primarily grayish-brown in color with darker areas where the texture is more pronounced. Notably, the trunk is peppered with numerous small, black, hollowed-out holes, likely made by insects or birds such as woodpeckers searching for insects. The arrangement of these holes is irregular but dense in certain areas, suggesting significant activity from the tree's inhabitants or visitors.\n\nThere is no clear background visible in the image as the focus is tightly on the bark's surface, highlighting the natural details and patterns created by the interaction of the tree with its environment. The light falls unevenly on the surface, creating shadows and highlights that enhance the texture and depth of the bark. This photograph could be of interest in studies related to forestry, entomology, or simply appreciated for its aesthetic depiction of nature's intricate details.","title":"Woodpecker holes in Australian pine TaMiami Canal area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554974","553587","557616","553586","554592","551355","542749","545288","550703","542774","545292","557621","555001","554604","543488","550792"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","insect","hole","trunk","inhabitant","texture","forestry","depiction","pattern","highlight"]}
