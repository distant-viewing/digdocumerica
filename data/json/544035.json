{"path":"544035.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial landscape set in a rugged, hilly terrain under a dramatic sky. The foreground shows rocky, barren ground that slopes downwards towards the central area of the image. At the center, a striking feature is a very tall, slim, dark-colored chimney standing out against the lighter background. This chimney appears inactive as there's no smoke coming from it.\n\nBelow and to the left of the chimney, there are various buildings, including one with a bright yellow roof, which adds a spot of color to the predominantly earthy and dull tones of the scene. Parallel to these buildings runs a long freight train, composed of boxcars, suggesting transportation or distribution activities linked to the industrial operations.\n\nThe middle ground is relatively clear with minimal vegetation, emphasizing more human-made structures and continuing the industrial theme. In the background, rolling hills extend into the distance, giving a sense of isolation and remoteness. The sky above is covered in sweeping, wispy clouds, and the light appears to be that of either early morning or late afternoon, which casts a soft glow and long shadows across the terrain, enhancing the dramatic and somewhat stark industrial ambiance.","title":"Abandoned mine","placename":"Clifton (Ariz.)","location":"Clifton, Arizona","nn1":["552188","544777","557374","543668","546760","547539","552190","557220","551026","557299","557373","545503","557375","545239","545446","557381"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","remoteness","distribution","freight","link","continue","come","terrain","train","spot"]}
