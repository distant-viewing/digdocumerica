{"path":"557257.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant, bustling urban scene, likely in a public square or park surrounded by tall buildings. The foreground features lush greenery and vivid pink flowers in well-maintained flowerbeds, providing a colorful contrast to the urban setting. Several people are scattered throughout the scene, mostly seated on benches or edges of planters, enjoying the sunny day outdoors. There are men and women visible, dressed in casual and semi-formal wear, indicative of a diverse urban population partaking in leisure activities or perhaps on a lunch break.\n\nThe architecture surrounding the park is varied. On the left side of the image, there is a large, ornate building with many windows and classic detailing, possibly an early twentieth-century office building. To the right, there is a darker, more modern building with fewer details and a simpler facade, showing the architectural evolution of the city. In the center background, a church spire rises prominently, lending an old-world charm and a hint of historical significance to the location.\n\nThe sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting a pleasant, warm day. The overall composition of the photo, with its focus on both the natural elements in the park and the imposing urban architecture, paints a picture of a lively city center where history and modernity coexist.","title":"Mellon square in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
