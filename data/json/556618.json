{"path":"556618.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a young man standing in the doorway of a room. The door is open and the man is partially framed by the doorframe. He is wearing a dark blue jacket with buttons, and has a serious expression on his face. His hair is dark and cut short.\n\nThe most striking feature of the image is the wall in the room, which is entirely covered in a mosaic of concave circular elements. These elements appear metallic and create an unusual and textured surface. Each circle reflects light differently, adding complexity to the visual texture of the image.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph casts shadows and highlights on the metal circles, enhancing the three-dimensional effect. The setting inside the room has a slightly mysterious vibe, due to the dim lighting and the unique wall material.\n\nOverall, the composition balances the human element with an intriguing architectural or artistic feature, creating a visually fascinating photograph that evokes a sense of curiosity about the space and the person within it.","title":"Empty steel beer and soft drink cans are being used to build experimental housing near Taos, New Mexico. Designer Michael Reynolds stands next to an interior wall in one of the structures. The inside walls are built with cans in the position shown. The outside walls are constructed using an eight-can unit as a building block. (See #14164.) Some 70,000 cans are needed to build a house, which Reynolds says can be built as much as 20% cheaper than conventional homes.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["557648","551975","554340","546105","547427","556443","544437","557034","552104","543028","555297","557035","546500","546471","555317","557892"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["circle","room","mosaic","wall","doorway","button","curiosity","highlight","feature","complexity"]}
