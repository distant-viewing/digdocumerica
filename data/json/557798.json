{"path":"557798.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene at a community event featuring a hot air balloon. In the foreground, the balloon is prominent, partially inflated, and suspended above a large wicker basket. A bright burst of flame from the burner is visible, fueling the inflation, while a ripple of yellow and black can be seen on the part of the balloon that is inflated, suggesting these might be part of the balloon's colors.\n\nSurrounding the balloon and its basket, numerous people form a semi-circular crowd. The crowd is composed of men and women who appear engaged and excited, some pointing and others looking intently at the balloon set-up. They are dressed in casual attire typical of an outdoor, summertime gathering—jeans, t-shirts, and light jackets.\n\nIn the background, there are more attendees and a white tent, possibly for event logistics or concessions. The setting includes a green, leafy backdrop provided by a line of trees under a clear, blue sky speckled with fluffy clouds, indicating it’s a pleasant, sunny day.\n\nThis image captures a moment of community interaction and recreational activity focused on the hot air balloon spectacle—showing both the communal enthusiasm for such an event and the detailed process involved in preparing a hot air balloon for flight.","title":"Hot air balloon is prepared for an ascent at the fifth annual Oktoberfest at Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown.
