{"path":"544888.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene dominated by agricultural activity. In the foreground, there's a striking image of farm work involving a red tractor. The tractor, equipped with attachments for cutting or handling hay, is driven by an individual wearing a hat. The tractor is in motion, actively working on a lush, green field, leaving behind rows of neatly arranged cut grass, which is likely being prepared for drying into hay.\n\nThe background features a gentle hill, beyond which rise taller mountains partially obscured by a soft haze, indicating either a distance or the presence of mist. The terrain is mostly open and spacious, punctuated only by a few sparse trees and what appears to be a wooden fence running parallel to the field. The sky is overcast, suggesting an overlying cool or mild weather, enhancing the greens and the rustic feel of the landscape.\n\nThe composition, set in expansive countryside, conveys a sense of serene, ongoing labor within a vast, natural environment, contrasting man-made agricultural endeavors with the natural beauty of the rural setting. The overall atmosphere is one of peaceful coexistence between human activities and the natural world.","title":"Ranch in the San Luis valley","placename":"San Luis (Colo.)","location":"San Luis, Colorado","nn1":["552577","549258","547436","551333","543667","551158","547297","555879","553665","554204","557753","557521","544323","544319","555874","555878"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tractor","hay","cut","attachment","countryside","field","endeavor","coexistence","drive","world"]}
