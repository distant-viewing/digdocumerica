{"path":"551409.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a lively moment between two young women playing in a body of water, possibly a river or large puddle, in a natural outdoor setting. The woman on the left has short brown hair and wears a sleeveless white blouse tucked into dark-colored, calf-length overalls that are now wet from the water. The woman on the right, with long blonde hair, sports a red shirt layered under a tan, knee-length dress with suspenders, which is also wet.\n\nBoth women are barefoot, splashing water vigorously as they hold hands, appearing to either dance or playfully try to make each other lose balance. The blonde woman's hair is tossed wildly to the side, indicating brisk, sudden movement.\n\nThe environment around them includes a sandy shoreline cluttered with small rocks, debris, and occasional litter. In the background, a calmer patch of water is visible along with a sandy embankment that leads to a grassy area. There is some refuse noticeable on the shore, suggesting this area is used by visitors but not meticulously maintained.\n\nThis scene is imbued with a sense of joy and carefree energy, evoking a nostalgic ambiance of youthful spontaneity and friendship. The overall mood is playful and light-hearted, with a focus on the interaction between the two individuals.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
