{"path":"557034.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a man who appears to be in his thirties or forties. He has thick, black rimmed glasses and his hair is mid-length, somewhat tousled, and dark brown. His expression is thoughtful or perhaps slightly concerned, as he is gazing directly at the camera with furrowed brows.\n\nHe is leaning his head on his right hand, with his elbow propped up, possibly on a table or railing (though it's not visible in the shot). The man is wearing a buttoned-up coat or shirt which has a herringbone pattern and a texture that suggests it might be made of a thick, woven fabric suitable for cooler weather.\n\nThe background is blurred, emphasizing the subject, but hints of a neutral, possibly outdoor setting can be observed. There are tones of gray and hints of a wooden or metal structure, suggesting an urban or constructed environment.\n\nThe composition focuses closely on the manâ€™s face and upper body, filling the frame with intimate detail that captures a reflective, personal moment.","title":"Concerned about Trident board member Philip Best, Bremerton, Washington, attorney, attends a board meeting at a Kitsap country house, at Bainbridge Island, near Seattle.
