{"path":"558022.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph shows a dark blue wooden door set into a white siding wall. A worn sign hangs on the door, announcing the \"Home of The Grand Army of Republic,\" and noting that it is available for Sunday private dinners and parties, including a phone number. Above the door, there is a small black lantern-style lamp mounted on the wall.\n\nTo the right of the door, placed on the ground, is a stack of three bright red plastic crates, with the top one labeled \"Hood\" and \"Redi-Cut.\" The ground consists of a dark, somewhat muddy surface, possibly after rain, with some grass and leaves visible around the edges.\n\nThe overall setting appears somewhat aged and rustic, with a sense of quiet and stillness, suggesting a photograph taken in a small, possibly rural, town. The lighting is dim, enhancing the moody, serene ambiance of the scene.","title":"Closeup of a door to G.A.R. (GRand Army of the Republic) Hall, an historic landmark in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron. Built in the 1880's, it was the social center for the village, where weddings, funerals, plays, and games were held as well as G.A.R. meetings. Authentically restored with antiques, it is used for Sunday meals and by groups. National Trust officials report it is the only such meeting place of its type still standing in the United States today.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["548654","552511","547808","550008","552490","557649","555377","555640","552463","545821","552467","552681","544373","554707","557873","552964"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["door","lantern","crate","phone","wall","hood","plastic","rain","one","stillness"]}
