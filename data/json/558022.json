{"path":"558022.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph shows a dark blue wooden door set into a white siding wall. A worn sign hangs on the door, announcing the \"Home of The Grand Army of Republic,\" and noting that it is available for Sunday private dinners and parties, including a phone number. Above the door, there is a small black lantern-style lamp mounted on the wall.\n\nTo the right of the door, placed on the ground, is a stack of three bright red plastic crates, with the top one labeled \"Hood\" and \"Redi-Cut.\" The ground consists of a dark, somewhat muddy surface, possibly after rain, with some grass and leaves visible around the edges.\n\nThe overall setting appears somewhat aged and rustic, with a sense of quiet and stillness, suggesting a photograph taken in a small, possibly rural, town. The lighting is dim, enhancing the moody, serene ambiance of the scene.","title":"Closeup of a door to g.a.r.  (gRand army of the republic) hall an historic landmark in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.
