{"path":"546143.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by numerous large structures typical of a chemical or processing plant. The image shows a complex array of towering metal stacks, some of which emit smoke or steam. The stacks vary in color and condition, ranging from clean and metallic to rusted and deteriorated, indicating varying ages and levels of maintenance.\n\nThe facility is densely packed with these cylindrical structures, alongside rectangular buildings and a network of intricate piping and staircases connecting the various levels and components. Safety railings and maintenance platforms are visible around the cylinders, suggesting routine human access for operational tasks. The backdrop is a fairly neutral sky, hinting at an overcast day which adds a somber tone to the industrial setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a robust, functioning industrial facility, likely involved in manufacturing or energy production, characterized by its complex infrastructure and environmental impact, visible through the emissions from the stacks.","title":"Smokestacks of chemical plant","placename":"Corpus Christi (Tex.)","location":"Corpus Christi, Texas","nn1":["557304","549713","546107","557305","548376","544691","549960","550958","550168","544495","545925","545841","552003","548336","549967","547010"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["stack","maintenance","level","cylinder","piping","facility","staircase","production","emission","chemical"]}
