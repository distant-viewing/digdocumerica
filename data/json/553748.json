{"path":"553748.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image provides a scenic aerial view of a coastal city adjacent to a vast ocean. The focus is on a densely populated urban landscape stretching along the shoreline. In the foreground, the deep blue ocean is dotted with the gentle textures of small waves, leading up to the city's coastal edge which is marked by what appears to be a pier or a docking area. Numerous tall and compact buildings, indicative of a vibrant urban environment, amass along the beachfront.\n\nThe city is nestled between the ocean and a series of low-lying mountains or hills visible in the background, with clouds hovering above them, suggesting either an early morning or late afternoon time frame given the soft light conditions. There are several distinct geographical features, including a prominent headland or peninsula towards the right side of the image, adding to the natural beauty of the scene.\n\nIn the far distance, the ocean meets the horizon in a calm expanse, underlined by a slightly overcast sky that casts a diffuse light over the entire scene. No boat traffic or people are immediately visible in this high-altitude shot, emphasizing the tranquility and broad scope of the landscape. The overall composition captures a harmonious blend of natural and urban elements typical of coastal cities.","title":"Raw sewage discharging into the ocean three miles from waikiki beach (background).
