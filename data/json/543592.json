{"path":"543592.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts a bustling construction site. It shows several workers engaged in various tasks related to building foundations. The dominant element is a worker in the foreground, dressed in a white tank top and dark pants, wearing a red hard hat. This worker is handling large gray concrete blocks, seemingly organizing them or preparing for their placement.\n\nThe setting is expansive and appears to be in a scenic area, as there are mountains visible in the background, some parts of which are covered with residual snow. The sky is very clear and blue, indicating good weather conditions.\n\nThroughout the scene, you can see piles of similar concrete blocks, placed methodically around dug trenches lined with rebar and wooden forms to structure the concrete work. Other workers can be identified in the middle and farther parts of the image, performing tasks like measuring, digging, or constructing. There are also various construction tools and wooden platforms scattered around the site.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate construction area, there are timber-roofed buildings, possibly indicating the developing neighborhood or community facilities supporting the construction. The mountainous backdrop provides a striking contrast to the busy work environment of the construction site.","title":"Condominium construction","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["556635","553394","553385","547989","556643","556940","543591","556642","550284","547833","547829","543583","553391","546414","544167","544828"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["worker","construction","concrete","site","block","platforms","measuring","digge","trench","foundation"]}
