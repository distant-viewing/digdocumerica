{"path":"552399.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor setting in a lush garden or park. In the foreground, a person is actively taking a photograph using a camera mounted on a tripod. This individual is focused on their task, standing on a neatly trimmed grassy area.\n\nIn the mid-ground of the image, there's a wooden bench on which a family is positioned. This family consists of an adult standing to the left of the bench, two women seated in the middle, and another adult standing to the right of the bench, who is leaning slightly towards one of the seated women. A young child is positioned in front of the seated women, standing on the grass. They all appear to be dressed casually and are enjoying their time in the park.\n\nIn the background, we can observe a variety of trees and a meticulously maintained garden blooming with flowers in vibrant colors. The presence of many trees and flowering plants suggests that this place is well-cared-for and designed for relaxation and recreation. The atmosphere is peaceful and leisurely, emphasised by the expansive green spaces and the dense, leafy trees that frame the scene. The setting suggests that this is a public park or botanical garden intended for community enjoyment and nature appreciation.","title":"Family group poses for picture in queen victoria park Niagara Falls, ontario","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["551682","551027","552033","552396","553065","552036","553043","555947","557985","552407","543238","557933","549516","551942","550302","551678"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["bench","garden","family","tripod","adult","park","woman","flower","maintained","appreciation"]}
