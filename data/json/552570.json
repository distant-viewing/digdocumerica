{"path":"552570.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene featuring a young man in the foreground, engaged in manual labor related to fencing. He is wearing a cowboy hat, a long-sleeved green shirt, blue jeans, and gloves, indicating work involving some level of physical effort. The man is holding a tool, possibly pliers, and is interacting with a barbed wire fence, suggesting that he might be mending or constructing it.\n\nThe background features a rural setting: sparse vegetation that looks dry and suited to a semi-arid environment, small shrubs, and a clear blue sky suggesting a sunny day. Interestingly, in the mid-ground, there is a red pickup truck parked on what appears to be a dirt road, adding to the rustic and utilitarian atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe composition of the image with the focus somewhat on the manual task and the natural environment provides a sense of openness and the vastness of the landscape. The perspective shows a harmony between human activity and the rugged outdoor environment, typical of rural or agricultural settings. The use of natural daylight enhances the colors and shadows, adding depth to the overall visual narrative of rural work life.","title":"Fence mending at the Oldlands' summer cow camp, 15 miles south of their Piceance Creek Ranch.
