{"path":"549845.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man sweeping a littered street. The man is wearing a light-colored cap, a grey shirt, dark pants, and is bent over using a push broom to clear trash that's scattered across the pavement. The items on the ground include crumpled paper, pieces of cardboard, and other small bits of waste.\n\nThe setting is an urban environment, as suggested by the visible portions of a black wrought iron fence and the brick wall of a building beside the man. There are also a few green plants emerging along the curb and through cracks in the pavement, adding a small hint of nature to the otherwise stark setting.\n\nThe perspective of the photo is from above, looking down at the scene, giving a comprehensive view of the effort the man is putting into cleaning the street and the extent of litter around him. The colors in the image are somewhat muted, suggesting overcast weather or the worn and dirty nature of the urban setting.","title":"\"super\" sweeps the sidewalk in front of his building on 172nd street in Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552748","556177","551869","552085","549836","549784","551248","547202","542550","549842","558307","546902","549839","545520","550060","550162"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["pavement","broom","sweep","put","extent","man","clean","iron","cardboard","curb"]}
