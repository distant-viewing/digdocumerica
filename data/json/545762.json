{"path":"545762.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a breathtaking scene of a rugged desert landscape, believed to be in a canyon or plateau region. The focal point of the image is a hiker, a man walking from right to left. He is equipped with a large orange backpack and is dressed in outdoor clothing that includes a long-sleeve shirt, shorts, and hiking boots. His attire suggests he is prepared for variable temperatures and terrain.\n\nThe landscape around the hiker consists of expansive, layered rock formations with earthy tones ranging from deep reds to pale creams. These strata are highlighted against the sky, showcasing nature's erosion over millennia. The foreground features rocky, uneven terrain with a mix of snow patches and dark soil, presenting a challenging walking surface.\n\nThe sky is clear with a few small clouds, indicating good weather conditions for hiking. In the background, distinct landforms that resemble towers or small peaks can be seen on the horizon, enhancing the sense of depth and vast openness typical of canyon landscapes.\n\nThis scene likely captures a moment of solitude and exploration in a remote desert setting, emphasizing the beauty and grandeur of the natural world juxtaposed with the small, solitary figure of the hiker. This image evokes a sense of adventure and the scale of human presence within the vast environment.","title":"A hiker in the Maze, a remote and rugged region in the heart of the Canyonlands.

But the rewards are great, and many people feel that this is the only way to truly experience the Canyonlands.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545759","554507","545766","544305","545697","544903","545700","544917","545755","544902","543378","544928","545758","545772","545781","545753"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["hiker","hiking","canyon","desert","plateau","millennium","stratum","walking","temperature","landform"]}
