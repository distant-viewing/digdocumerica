{"path":"554564.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph displays the exterior of a rustic and somewhat aged building labeled \"Station Studio\" where art classes are apparently held. The architecture has a historic, utilitarian charm, characteristic of older, weathered wooden structures. \n\nIn detail, the building's facade is clad in horizontally-aligned wood siding, which shows signs of peeling paint and weathering, contributing to a look of genteel decay. This texture is accentuated by sunlight, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the rough texture of the wood.\n\nThe entrance features a simple wooden door, beside which a handwritten notice is posted, suggesting a personal or community-centric approach. A traditional paneled window next to the door enhances the quaint, artistic vibe of the place.\n\nAbove the door, a worn wooden sign hangs from a metal bracket. The sign, painted dark with peeling white letters, reads \"Station Studio\" and beneath in a smaller panel, \"art classes.\" The signs, hanging askew, evoke a sense of casual, creative use.\n\nA set of wooden stairs to the right of the door leads to an unknown destination, perhaps additional spaces related to the studio or other parts of the building. The stairs and the upper levels are constructed with similar materials, maintaining the coherent aesthetic of aged wood.\n\nThe immediate surroundings are similar in style, suggesting that the building is part of a larger complex or a neighborhood with similar vintage architecture, possibly an old industrial, railway, or warehouse district repurposed for artistic and community activities. The overall impression is one of a creative enclave, quietly aged but vibrant in purpose.","title":"Abandoned railroad station and freight room of the New York central were converted to an art studio (the station studio) and art shop (the shack by the track) near Old Forge, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552511","554563","547808","544824","545355","550006","543348","553479","557643","548654","544911","552968","545334","543339","547894","549221"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["door","class","stair","art","peel","wood","sign","handwritten","hang","repurpose"]}
