{"path":"547122.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a bird's-eye view of an industrial landscape bathed in a hazy, purple hue. In the foreground, a looping section of a multilane highway is visible, featuring light traffic. Beside the highway, other smaller roads and tracks intersect and run parallel.\n\nThe image captures several bodies of water, including a river that meanders through the area, bordered by trees and green spaces on its banks. A densely packed parking lot, filled with rows of cars, is situated near the river, emphasizing the busy nature of the area.\n\nThe background is dominated by a sprawling industrial complex. There are multiple large structures, including warehouses and production facilities, whose precise nature is not clearly identifiable from the image. Billowing smoke and steam erupt from several tall smokestacks, filling the sky and contributing to the overall haze of the scene.\n\nThe atmosphere of the image is somewhat moody, accentuated by the dominant purple and pink tones that give the photograph an almost surreal appearance. The perspective offers a comprehensive view of the juxtaposition between the built environment and the natural landscape, highlighting the industrial activity and its impact on the immediate environment. The photo captures a moment in time that seems both calm in everyday activity but also tense with the environmental implications of such an industrial setting.","title":"Indiana Toll Road, with light traffic.
