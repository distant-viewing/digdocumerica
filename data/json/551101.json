{"path":"551101.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural township nestled in a valley between heavily forested mountainsides, suggesting a peaceful, secluded community. The foreground of the image is framed by shadows and outlines of foliage, providing a natural border that leads the viewer's eye into the scene.\n\nThe main part of the image shows a variety of residential buildings that seem to be typical of small-town architecture, with houses sporting shingled roofs and some with visible front porches. The homes are closely spaced but not densely packed, and a few appear to be single storied while others might have two levels.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a dirt road or pathway winding through the community, which provides a sense of the layout and scale of the town. The natural landscape plays a major role in the composition, with lush green hills dominating the background. These hills rise steeply from the edges of the town, emphasizing the close relationship between the community and its surrounding natural environment.\n\nThe photograph, likely taken in the morning or late afternoon given the soft lighting, captures the essence of a serene rural life, with the mountains providing a dramatic and protective backdrop to the small community living in harmony with its surroundings. The overall mood conveyed is tranquil and somewhat isolated, typical of a mountainous rural setting.","title":"Cedar grove homes, looking toward kanawha river from route 60","placename":"Charleston (W.
