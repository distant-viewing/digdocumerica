{"path":"546733.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a highway system amidst lush greenery. The highway curves gently and splits into different routes, surrounded on all sides by dense forests. This scene shows a mix of traffic on the road, with several cars and trucks visible, suggesting the photo was taken during a time of moderate traffic. \n\nTo the left side, adjacent to the highway, there is an area with industrial or storage buildings characterized by large, flat structures and white roofs. The background extends into a flat horizon, showing a landscape that gradually fades into haze, suggesting a vast, flat terrain beyond the wooded areas. \n\nThe composition of the photograph balances the man-made elements of the highway and buildings with the natural, expansive forest, highlighting the interface between human activity and nature. The lighting in the image suggests it was taken during the daytime with ample natural light, probably late afternoon given the softness of the light and mild shadows. The angle of the photograph and the wide field of view give a comprehensive overview of this segment of the transportation network and its surrounding environment.","title":"Rush hour traffic jam where three lane Maryland beltway enters two lane Virginia beltway and northern end of the george Washington parkway","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546603","546587","546721","546714","556934","546725","546720","546607","546571","546711","556935","558049","546583","550613","546718","547294"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","traffic","interface","softness","overview","split","forest","route","segment","daytime"]}
