{"path":"556316.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures an individual seated on a bench, seemingly during a break from work, in a setting that appears to be a break room or similar informal workplace area. The man is dressed in work attire: a light blue long-sleeve shirt and dark trousers, both of which are visibly worn and stained, suggesting physical labor. He wears a hard hat with a camouflage pattern, indicating his occupation may involve construction, mining, or another industrial field.\n\nHe is smiling and seems to be enjoying a moment of relaxation. In one hand, he holds a small paper bag, possibly containing food, and in the other hand, he lightly holds a sandwich, partially wrapped in paper. His posture is relaxed, with one leg crossed over the other and his body angled towards someone or something off-camera that seems to be the source of his amusement.\n\nTo the man's right, on the bench, there are a few personal items: a red and white thermos, a small white cup, a container possibly holding condiments or utensils, and some paper items that could be napkins or work-related papers.\n\nThe background features a simple lime green wall with light fixtures and a beige window covering that vaguely resembles a blind or curtain, partially obscuring what seems like a barred window. The atmosphere of the photograph suggests a candid and informal moment during a routine workday, highlighting a sense of camaraderie or relaxation amidst physical labor.","title":"Miner spreads his lunch out on a bench in the shower and time card room of the Virginia-pocahontas coal company mine #3 near Richlands, Virginia.
