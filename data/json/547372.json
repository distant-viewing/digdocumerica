{"path":"547372.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged woman crouching on the ground in the foreground. She is wearing large, square-framed glasses and a striped shirt with tones of yellow, white, and pink. The woman is smiling and looking towards the camera. In her right hand, she holds a small rectangular object that looks like a photograph or a book.\n\nThe background features a rural setting that includes a large dark wooden structure which appears to be a barn or shed. The structure has a flat roof and sits slightly to the left in the image, with a visible tractor or similar agricultural machinery parked beside it. The area surrounding the woman and buildings is covered with brown leaves, suggesting that the season might be autumn. There are also leafless trees in the background, further indicating the autumn season. A hint of residential buildings and possibly more trees are visible in the far background, suggesting that this scene might be on the edge of a rural town or a suburban area. The overall lighting of the photo is subdued, conveying an overcast day.","title":"Mrs. Art Schaefer of Garland plants her spring garden.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547281","556487","554051","552398","556541","547385","550048","552680","554798","550679","556498","556961","544747","544311","557113","543853"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["autumn","season","woman","tractor","square","shed","barn","book","town","leave"]}
