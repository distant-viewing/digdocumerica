{"path":"543048.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a windy seaside scene. The beach is expansive and appears almost deserted except for a solitary figure walking along the shoreline. The foreground of the image reveals a littered beach with a variety of debris scattered across the sand, including driftwood and possibly some washed-up refuse. The sea is rough, with numerous white-capped waves indicating strong winds and turbulent ocean conditions.\n\nThe horizon is distinct, showing a slightly hazy but visible mountain range in the far distance under a mostly bright sky with minimal cloud coverage. The overall mood of the scene is slightly bleak, enhanced by the presence of wind and a seemingly cold, harsh environment. The color saturation suggests an older photograph, with a stronger bias towards blues and purples.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548051","543078","543244","543055","547607","546953","543069","547943","547139","547015","546970","543255","544989","557470","542887","542890"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["wind","beach","seaside","refuse","coverage","driftwood","saturation","purple","sand","shoreline"]}
