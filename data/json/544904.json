{"path":"544904.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a snake in a natural habitat. The snake displays a detailed and striking pattern of brown, black, and white scales along its body. Its head is slightly lifted and turned towards the camera, showcasing its eyes and the textures on its head prominently.\n\nThe snake is positioned amidst a setting of soft dirt or sand, and there are dry, straw-like plants and small twigs surrounding it, adding a touch of ruggedness to the scene. The background is slightly out of focus, which emphasizes the snake as the main subject of the photograph. The lighting appears natural, likely sunlight, which casts shadows and highlights the intricate scale pattern of the snake's body.\n\nThese elements together portray a vivid snapshot of wildlife, specifically a snake, in its natural environment, likely in a desert or dry, arid area. The composition of the image, focusing closely on the snake with a blurred background, draws attention directly to the animal and its detailed textures.","title":"Harmless bull snake Great Sand Dunes National Monument","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555065","544908","549459","543286","544900","551375","545561","543778","551374","551366","545553","551250","555196","543264","544622","544546"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["snake","head","twig","scale","straw","ruggedness","pattern","habitat","wildlife","texture"]}
