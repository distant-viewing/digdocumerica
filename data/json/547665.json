{"path":"547665.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape that is heavily disrupted, possibly by industrial or construction activities. The main focus is a large, muddy pool or pond of water that has accumulated, reflecting a murky blue sky. Around the water, the ground is uneven and littered with various debris, including large stones, rubble, and scattered waste materials.\n\nThe surrounding area is composed of piles of soil and more debris, suggesting recent excavation or dumping. No vegetation is visible, which conveys a barren, desolate environment. This setting appears uninhabited and devoid of any active human presence.\n\nThe sky above is fairly clear with minimal cloud cover, indicating a sunny day, which brightens the scene despite the desolation. The colors in the image are relatively muted, with earthy tones dominating the scene, contrasted against the somewhat brighter blue of the water and sky.","title":"Land advertised for sale by developer at point judith, on Block Island Sound","placename":"Narragansett (R.I.)","location":"Narragansett, Rhode Island","nn1":["544580","547661","552427","545680","554546","552169","544803","555559","555610","551562","544810","551559","546913","543818","555846","544775"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["brighten","dumping","accumulate","disrupt","rubble","debris","reflec","desolation","pond","pool"]}
