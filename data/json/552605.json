{"path":"552605.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an older, urban street scene at dusk. The primary focus is on a brick building, prominently featuring the \"Midland Hotel.\" The hotel's name is displayed on two neon signs, one projecting perpendicularly from the building and another on the side of the awning. The red brick architecture of the hotel, along with opulent decorative woodwork under the awning, has a classic early 20th-century feel.\n\nBeneath the awning, there is a sign for a \"Bus Station\" pointing to the left, suggesting the hotel also serves as a transit hub, specifically for \"Continental Trailways,\" as indicated on another sign. A metal trash can stands near the sidewalk, contributing to the urban environment. The street is mostly empty, adding a sense of quietness or abandonment to the scene, though there is a car visible in the distant background under the soft evening sky where the moon is faintly visible. The overall ambiance is slightly eerie yet nostalgic, hinting at a once-bustling location now quieted, possibly in a state of decline or at a serene moment.","title":"Rifle, the major community of the piceance basin, is a small town with a one-street business district","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["547580","551322","555446","547799","547790","546668","556983","552526","550108","546440","545618","554550","556077","550127","550138","551085"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["hotel","awning","moon","brick","woodwork","quietness","sign","neon","decline","street"]}
