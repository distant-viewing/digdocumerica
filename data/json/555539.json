{"path":"555539.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"This photograph captures a winter scene where a group of people, including both adults and children, are enjoying a horse-drawn sleigh ride across a snowy landscape. The sleigh, which appears to be a large, flat platform with side railings, is drawn by two large, brown horses. These horses have harnesses and are wearing winter blankets.\n\nThe group on the sleigh is dressed warmly in various winter clothes such as hats, scarves, and heavy coats, indicating the cold weather. Some individuals are waving towards the camera, adding a sense of joy and activity to the scene.\n\nThe background features a forested area with leafless trees, predominantly in browns and greys, interspersed with snow-covered patches, suggesting this activity is taking place in a rural or possibly park setting. The ground is completely covered with white snow, enhancing the winter atmosphere. The colors in the image suggest it might be late afternoon or early evening due to the soft lighting and subdued color tones.\n\nThis photograph blends a sense of traditional winter activity with a convivial atmosphere among a group likely sharing a leisurely outing.","title":"Every February on Brookfield Pond area there is a traditional ice-cutting festival where free rides are offered in a horse-drawn sleigh.","placename":"Barre (Vt.)","location":"Barre, Vermont","nn1":["548153","558247","552675","552557","558248","558246","555538","554257","554274","543841","550017","557181","557988","554263","543366","554690"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["winter","horse","group","snow","harness","scarf","ride","blanket","joy","outing"]}
