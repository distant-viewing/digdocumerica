{"path":"542991.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This is a high-altitude or satellite image that captures the rugged and intricate details of a mountainous landscape. The photograph shows a winding, frost-covered river slicing through dark, dense terrain. Surrounding the river are jagged mountain edges, highlighted by sunlight, which creates a dramatic contrast between the snow-capped peaks and the shadows in the valleys. The terrain is mostly dark, suggesting dense forest cover or shadowed areas, which makes the bright white of the snow and river stand out sharply.\n\nThe image orientation makes the river appear vertically aligned, stretching from near the top left corner to the bottom of the frame, roughly dividing the image into two darker regions. The overall composition provides a sense of isolation, wildness, and the stark beauty of an untouched natural landscape. There are no visible human activities or constructions, emphasizing the pristine and remote nature of the location. The viewpoint is from directly above, providing a comprehensive overview of this geographical feature and its surroundings.","title":"California--Silver River","placename":"Silver Fork American River (Calif.)","location":"Silver Fork American River, California","nn1":["550410","550518","550507","550526","550498","550523","550522","550512","550500","550503","550577","550633","550529","550508","542701","550519"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["river","snow","frost","wildness","orientation","overview","viewpoint","altitude","terrain","white"]}
