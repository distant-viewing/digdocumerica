{"path":"556682.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a bustling subway station scene that seems to be from a past decade, likely the 1960s or 1970s, given the fashion and style visible. We see a line of people waiting, presumably to purchase tickets or interact with a station employee, as evidenced by the presence of a ticket booth.\n\nOn the left of the image, there is a young woman wearing a patterned dress with long sleeves and a collar that appears to be in a floral print, paired with flesh-colored pants. Her blond hair is worn loose and she holds a black handbag in her left hand.\n\nNext to her, a middle-aged man wearing a light brown suit and holding a briefcase and an umbrella, appears to be waiting in line as well. His head is turned away, looking at something off-camera. Behind these two, slightly out of focus, is another man whose face is mostly obscured.\n\nIn the forefront on the right, a man in a dark overcoat and hat is seen interacting with a station attendant inside the booth. Both are engaged in conversation or a transaction. The attendant is behind a protective window with a small pass-through area.\n\nThe background includes tiled walls of the station, various posters and signs with directions like \"DOWNTOWN\" and \"UPTOWN\". A motion blur of a passing individual adds a dynamic element to the image, suggesting the hurried pace typical of a subway environment. Their presence adds a ghostly feel as they rush by, captured in a flurry of motion.\n\nThis photograph captures the typical urban monotony and hurried nature of daily commutes, framed in the distinctive aesthetic of past decades. It emphasizes a moment of stasis (the waiting line) against dynamic movement (the blurred passerby).","title":"Passengers waiting in line to buy subway tokens at the 8th Avenue line of the New York City Transit Authority. In 1970 an average of 2.1 million persons rode the subway each day, which is 47 percent of the work force. The system is of crucial importance to the city, but the voters have refused to authorize new funds for any more improvements, or to increase the 35-cent fare to cover management costs.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556819","556821","556818","556814","551886","556815","556779","556648","556663","551890","556774","548259","556660","556823","551893","556650"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["station","attendant","ticket","booth","subway","decade","overcoat","monotony","transaction","employee"]}
