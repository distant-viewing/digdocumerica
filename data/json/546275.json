{"path":"546275.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a detailed and technical laboratory setting focused on chemical processing or experiments. The central visual elements are numerous intricate glass apparatuses, such as flasks, tubes, and Bunsen burners, arranged meticulously on a sturdy, metallic workspace. These glass pieces are filled with substances and connected via tubing, suggesting ongoing chemical reactions or distillations.\n\nThe glassware is infused with shades of pink and purple lighting, perhaps from the laboratory equipment itself or external lighting, which adds a vibrant and scientific ambiance to the scene. The apparatus configuration indicates a setup for complex chemical experimentation, possibly for research or industrial quality control.\n\nIn the foreground, a person's hand (only the hand and part of the forearm are visible) is interacting with the experiments. The individual appears to be adjusting or controlling one of the apparatuses or perhaps adding a chemical substance. This action indicates active engagement in the laboratory work.\n\nThe background is minimally visible due to the focus on the glassware; however, it supports the clear and systematic arrangement of the equipment, emphasizing a professional and possibly research-oriented environment. The control panel in the foreground, laden with knobs and dials under the workspace, further establishes this environment as highly specialized and technical.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of scientific activity, focusing on chemical experimentation within a clean, well-organized, and technically equipped laboratory setting.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Chemistry lab.
