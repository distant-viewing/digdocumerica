{"path":"549028.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a candid scene involving four young girls dressed in white dresses and veils, suggesting they are participating in a religious or ceremonial event, likely a First Communion. Each dress is adorned with lace and frills, and the girls also wear white socks and shoes.\n\nThree of the girls are actively engaging with each other. To the left, one girl appears to be adjusting another girl's collar or necklace, showing a moment of care or preparation. The girl being adjusted holds a folded paper, potentially a program or card related to their event. Another girl stands somewhat apart, observing the interaction with a thoughtful or contemplative expression, her hand partially covering her mouth.\n\nTo the right, another girl stands with her back partially to the camera, fussing with the back of her veil or perhaps her hair, indicating a moment of self-preparation or adjustment.\n\nIn the background, the setting appears to be a suburban area with residential houses, a neatly kept lawn, and a sidewalk. A classic car is parked on the street, adding a quaint or historical touch to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is tender and gentle, capturing a significant and possibly solemn occasion in the lives of these children, marked by their interaction and preparations.","title":"These excited 7 and 8 year olds have just received their first communion at St. Joan of Arc Church.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["553880","558238","558236","547930","553507","551005","555943","558405","558239","555941","556233","546210","557639","545379","558407","558237"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["girl","veil","preparation","dress","card","adjustment","self","lace","necklace","event"]}
