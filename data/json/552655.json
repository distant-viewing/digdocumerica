The man, smiling broadly, carries a toddler on his shoulders. The child, who appears to be a boy, has light blonde hair and is wearing a patterned sleeveless dress or top, detailed with small flowers or designs, suggesting a casual, playful outfit suitable for a day out.\n\nThe scene captures a sense of happiness and familial affection. The young boy seems curious and observant, looking slightly to the right of the frame, possibly watching something interesting at the event. His posture, with one arm casually draped over the man’s head, suggests comfort and familiarity with his carrier.\n\nThe man, likely the boy’s father, shows joy and engagement. His attire consists of a light-patterned, collared shirt, typical of casual public event wear.\n\nThe background reveals other attendees, hinting at a crowded event. You can spot parts of parked cars and a glimpse of another individual wearing sunglasses, adding to the communal atmosphere. Overall, the image conveys a sense of community, joy, and a spirited daytime outing.","title":"Labor Day brings the annual Garfield County Fair parade.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["558292","547135","543866","553094","553142","551810","545464","556525","556527","553282","551811","549320","556531","556235","551011","551028"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Family Activities"],"terms":["boy","joy","event","father","affection","familiarity","happiness","toddler","child","man"]}
