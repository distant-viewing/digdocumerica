{"path":"548774.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene likely related to mining or material processing in a coastal or waterfront area. In the foreground, there are several bodies of water, possibly man-made, reflecting the sky. These bodies of water are separated by narrow strips of land, which are covered with a light-colored substance, likely sand. The middle ground of the photo features several large heaps of what appears to be sand or salt, suggesting that this site may be used for salt extraction or a similar mining operation.\n\nOn the right side of the image, positioned near the largest pile, there is a crane with a long, extended boom that hangs over the pile, indicating ongoing work or loading activities. Adjacent to this crane, there is a smaller, rust-colored vehicle, possibly a bulldozer or another piece of heavy machinery, which is either moving materials or helping to manage the site.\n\nThe background shows a sparse landscape with low vegetation and few discernible features, leading to a line of water at the horizon, under a bright, clear sky suggesting that the location is quite open and possibly in a warmer climate. The general setup and equipment present strongly highlight the industrial nature of the activities taking place in this area.","title":"Land development near Boca Chica Key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548775","548644","552427","551612","547171","551575","551532","544650","554546","554545","545648","555593","548641","544753","545655","555809"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["salt","mining","crane","sand","present","pile","site","boom","loading","extraction"]}
