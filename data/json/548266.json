{"path":"548266.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph features a subway train stopped on elevated tracks. The train is heavily covered in graffiti, with various styles and colors of spray paint across its entire surface. Tags and art include multi-colored letters, abstract shapes, and several legible words or initials, possibly representing the creators of the graffiti.\n\nThe train itself is made up of multiple cars, and each car displays a unique combination of graffiti. The visible car numbers are 2417 and 7400. There's a complex interplay of red, yellow, blue, green, and white spray paint that provides a vibrant if chaotic look to the train.\n\nIn the background, there are large apartment buildings, suggesting an urban environment. The buildings themselves appear large and somewhat austere, constructed from brown and gray materials that contrast starkly with the vivid colors on the train.\n\nThere is no visible activity or people in the scene, indicating that the main focus is the train and its colorful 'decoration'. The tracks on which the train sits appear weathered, typical of many urban elevated train lines.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a gritty, urban aesthetic typical of certain periods and places where subway cars became canvases for graffiti artists.","title":"Subway trains, like this one, have been spray-painted by vandals","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554325","548263","548258","556811","548265","554324","548253","556652","556690","556653","548261","556693","555749","556814","553823","548260"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","subway","graffito","car","elevate","artist","track","paint","abstract","become"]}
