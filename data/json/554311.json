{"path":"554311.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a heap of crushed and compacted cars at a scrapyard. The focus of the image is on a compressed vehicle in the front which still faintly shows its original brown color with a white roof. The car is significantly deformed, with its sides crumpled and parts like windows, doors, and the chassis twisted and ruptured. Surrounding this car, there are numerous other vehicles in a similarly demolished state, piled up into a large mound of metal scraps. The entire scene is characterized by a chaotic jumble of metal, with colors mainly ranging from rusted browns to dull blues and grays. The background is slightly obscured but appears to be an overcast sky, enhancing the grim, industrial feel of the setting. There are no people or any signs of ongoing activity visible in the image; the focus is solely on the wreckage.","title":"Auto scrap yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["552738","554348","554352","547476","542656","551517","554320","546172","553005","545303","553006","545545","555492","552739","544819","542590"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["chassis","car","scrapyard","wreckage","scrap","heap","metal","mound","vehicle","gray"]}
