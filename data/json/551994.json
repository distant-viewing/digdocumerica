{"path":"551994.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph offers an extensive view of an industrial facility, likely a power plant or processing complex, positioned next to a body of water. In the foreground, a large, rectangular multi-story building, painted in shades of yellow and brown, dominates most of the space. Attached to this building and throughout the facility, there are numerous large steel structures, including tall, narrow smokestacks and smaller silos, which all appear to be part of the operational infrastructure. The smokestacks do not show any visible emissions in this image.\n\nTo the right of this central building, thereâ€™s an elaborate network of conveyors and additional industrial constructions, which appear to be used for transporting materials within the plant. Large rounded storage tanks and various other industrial components are present, suggesting complex production or energy generation processes.\n\nThe facility is situated beside a waterway, with several barges and small boats docked along the waterfront, implying that the location uses water transport for shipping or receiving goods or materials. The presence of these vessels indicates active movement and operation at the site.\n\nThe background extends into a sprawling industrial area littered with more storage tanks and infrastructure. Beyond the immediate industrial vicinity, the area opens up to what appears to be a large open space, under a sky partly cloudy, reflecting the possibly extensive environmental footprint of this facility.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of busy, heavy industry, with a focus on energy or material processing in an extensive, highly equipped industrial landscape.","title":"Public service and gas in foreground with hess oil in background.
