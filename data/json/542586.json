{"path":"542586.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photo depicts a bustling street scene, capturing a vibrant, vintage urban landscape that appears to be from the 1970s based on the style of vehicles and signage. The street is lined with a mix of architectural styles, ranging from single or two-story buildings that house various businesses.\n\nThe street is filled with a variety of vehicles, mostly cars, typical of the 1970s automobile design, featuring different makes and models, including sedans and station wagons. The cars are densely packed along the street, indicating either slow-moving traffic or a jam. The scene is viewed from an elevated position, looking down the street which gives a good perspective of the congestion and the array of business signage.\n\nOn each side of the street, there are numerous signs advertising a plethora of services and shops. Prominent among these are a \"HAR\" sign, \"Insurance\" agency, \"Hotel Victory,\" and an electronic appliance store indicated by signs such as \"TRG\" and \"Color TV.\" The signage reflects a commercial hub with a variety of services available ranging from hospitality to household appliances.\n\nIn the background, a hilly terrain can be observed suggesting that the town is either surrounded by hills or set in a hilly region. The era is further echoed by the design and fonts of the business signs and the overall facade of the buildings which appear well-used and practical.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a slice of life from a past era, characterized by its community business environment and the typical vehicular congestion of a busy town street. Such a scenario is indicative of everyday life in an active commercial district during the mid-20th century.","title":"California--Sonora","placename":"Sonora (Calif.)","location":"Sonora, California","nn1":["545216","554551","547369","549872","551135","551125","545614","556224","556709","556724","556718","548388","554297","556225","550139","557705"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["street","business","appliance","signage","congestion","sign","service","town","tv","1970"]}
