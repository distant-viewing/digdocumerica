{"path":"555882.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a large expanse of rough, barren terrain dominated by deep tire tracks crisscrossing the surface, suggestive of heavy machinery having passed through. The ground appears dry and compact, with a mixture of dark and light soil, creating a somewhat patterned texture. The tire tracks create varied patterns and depth, indicating multiple passes in different directions.\n\nThe perspective of the photo shows this landscape extending toward the horizon, where a flat, unobstructed sky meets the land. The horizon is lined with intermittent utility poles and minimal sparse vegetation, emphasizing the arid and undeveloped nature of the area. The light in the photograph indicates either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows that accentuate the rugged contours created by the tire tracks.\n\nOverall, the scene presents a stark and possibly disturbed natural environment, commonly seen in areas used for industrial or agricultural purposes where machinery frequently moves. The absence of visible life forms and the significant alteration of the terrain highlight human impact on this landscape.","title":"Down to earth view of the five acre pond covered with earth after cleanup operations were complete. The cleanup resulted in some 1,200,000 gallons of acid water and oil sludge being removed and treated before disposal at a nearby site. The work was supervised by EPA personnel and prevented possible contamination of nearby Great Salt Lake and a wildlife refuge.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["545604","549179","544508","549180","555883","547523","547979","544428","552004","554804","545533","554802","543112","552420","545677","555610"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["tire","track","machinery","alteration","highlight","horizon","absence","terrain","mixture","contour"]}
