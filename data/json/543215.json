{"path":"543215.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene with multiple subjects and natural elements. In the foreground, a child with long, dark hair stands on a skimboard at the wet sand's edge, looking towards the ocean. The child is wearing dark swim shorts and the posture suggests a momentary pause either before or after skimming.\n\nThe background features an impressive sandy cliff divided by a natural archway near the center, under which the tide appears to be coming in. The cliff is adorned with vibrant patches of pink vegetation, adding a splash of color to the otherwise earth-toned landscape. The texture of the cliff is rugged and eroded, indicating the natural weathering processes at work. Atop the cliff, two people are visible, standing and possibly observing the scene below or enjoying the view.\n\nThe sky above is clear and blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day, with light reflections visible on the wet sand, enhancing the overall luminosity and picturesque quality of the scene. The composition of the photograph, with its symmetry and the natural framing of the arch, coupled with the reflections and vibrant colors, provides a visually appealing capture of a peaceful moment at the beach.","title":"Skim-boarding","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["543493","557507","543310","543252","552341","543225","547009","555402","548280","547612","550233","543322","543287","547867","546982","547676"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","sand","luminosity","beach","reflection","archway","symmetry","child","pause","swim"]}
