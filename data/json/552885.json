{"path":"552885.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a large number of storage barrels, densely packed and covering what seems to be an outdoor area. The barrels are mostly similar in shape and size but vary in color and condition. Many of the barrels have visible rust and signs of wear, and some are covered with tarpaulins or lids that are either bulging or partially open, suggesting they might contain materials. Puddles of water are visible on some of the barrel tops, reflecting the environment and suggesting recent rain or exposure to elements.\n\nIn the background, you can see a line of trees indicating that the location might be in a rural or semi-rural area. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting variable weather conditions at the time the photo was taken. The scene suggests an industrial, storage, or waste disposal setting, raising concerns about environmental safety and management practices. The overall appearance gives an impression of neglect or abandonment.","title":"About 3,000 drums containing hazardous industrial wastes have been stored for six months in this swampy field near Ville Platte. Wastes were trucked in from industrial sites in the Houston-Beaumont (Texas) area by a company called B.W. & S., Inc.
