{"path":"555453.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph features a scene likely at the edge of a rural area. In the foreground on the left side of the image, prominently placed, is a road sign that reads \"SPEED CHECKED BY RADAR\" in capital letters. The sign is typical for traffic regulation, mounted on a single metal pole and situated in a grassy area. \n\nFurther toward the center and right side of the image, there is a dark horse standing on a muddy and grassy field. The horse is saddled but seems to be unattended, as there is no visible rider or person nearby. The saddle is light-colored, likely brown, and there's an item resembling a saddle blanket beneath it. The horse's reins are loosely touching the ground, suggesting a moment of rest or abandonment.\n\nThe background of the photo consists of dense, leafy trees and shrubs, which indicates that this area is probably adjacent to a wooded region. There is a mix of shadow and sunlight dappling through the trees, indicating either early morning or late afternoon light. Overall, the image conveys a serene yet somewhat ironic juxtaposition, with modern traffic control methods contrasted against a more traditional and pastoral mode of transport represented by the horse.","title":"A saddled horse stands next to a radar sign and waits for its rider during the energy crisis","placename":"Lake Oswego (Or.)","location":"Lake Oswego, Oregon","nn1":["544425","544395","544308","543726","554867","554161","556548","557186","544955","544362","542805","554689","545345","550005","543044","549198"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["saddle","horse","rein","traffic","mode","dapple","capital","regulation","method","rider"]}
