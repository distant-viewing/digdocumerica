{"path":"551148.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river scene in what appears to be the early morning or late evening, given the soft, dusky lighting that bathes the entire scene in shades of purple and blue. The calm river surface reflects these gentle colors, enhancing the peaceful ambiance.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a small motorboat speeding across the water, creating a distinct, frothy wake trailing behind it. The boat is likely occupied, but the occupants are not clearly visible due to the distance. This boat adds a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil water.\n\nFurther back on the river, there is a large barge being pushed by a tugboat. The barge appears to carry some sort of cargo, though it's not specific what the cargo might be. The tugboat, small and sturdy-looking, is essential for navigating and directing the much larger barge.\n\nThe background features dense, lush greenery covering hilly terrain. Some buildings, possibly industrial facilities, are partially visible through the trees. These structures are large and utilitarian in appearance, suggesting that this area might serve industrial or commercial purposes.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph balances elements of nature and human activity, capturing a moment of daily life and work against a naturally beautiful riverscape.","title":"Pleasure boat and barge on the kanawha river","placename":"Charleston (W.
