{"path":"553505.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph features a young boy in a candid, close-up shot. He appears to be in his pre-teen years and is smoking a cigarette held in his right hand. The boy is shown in partial profile looking off to the right side of the frame. His expression is serious and focused.\n\nThe boy has short, curly hair and wears a lightly colored, possibly white t-shirt that seems worn or lightly soiled. His facial features exhibit a mix of youthful innocence and a premature harshness possibly due to the context of smoking at such a young age.\n\nThe background of the image is blurred, with hints of greenery and a bicycle, suggesting that the setting might be a park or a similar outdoor area. The colors in the image are muted with a soft, natural light that focuses on the boy and slightly dims towards the background.\n\nThis image captures a striking moment that juxtaposes childhood with an adult behavior, creating a powerful visual narrative about youth and the choices or circumstances faced by young individuals.","title":"Donny, a neighborhood youngster, drags on a cigarette passed to him by an older boy","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["555529","553494","556588","556606","553168","553504","557359","553054","553495","543870","556138","543704","553170","558394","544222","553553"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["boy","smoking","dim","harshness","behavior","innocence","youth","choice","mute","cigarette"]}
