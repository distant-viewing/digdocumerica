{"path":"554820.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic, countryside scene focused on a large red barn. The barn is prominently painted with a vintage advertisement for \"Mail Pouch Tobacco,\" featuring the slogan \"Chew Mail Pouch Tobacco Treat Yourself to the Best\" in bold white and black lettering. The structure of the barn appears traditional, with a symmetrical triangular roof and two visible doors: one is slightly ajar, revealing darkness inside.\n\nTo the left side of the barn, there is a partial view of a white trailer with evident signs of wear and tear, parked adjacent to the barnâ€™s wall. This suggests the area might be used for storage or agricultural purposes. To the right of the barn, there is a smaller outbuilding or shed that looks rather dilapidated with part of its roof missing, adding to the rustic and somewhat abandoned feel of the scene.\n\nThe surroundings are a flat, grassy landscape with a clear, yet overcast sky visible in the background, suggesting it might be a cool or cloudy day. The overall mood conveyed by the setting is one of a bygone era, reflecting a sense of rural history and the fading presence of agricultural advertising in America.","title":"An abandoned farm building near strip mining off route 808 near Fairview, Ohio, and Steubenville","placename":"Fairview (Ohio)","location":"Fairview, Ohio","nn1":["550019","543343","550693","552537","554782","555627","554821","552536","555612","557991","542805","552448","547128","552462","556586","549194"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","triangular","rustic","outbuilding","tear","countryside","fading","advertising","roof","trailer"]}
