{"path":"543465.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts two individuals at a waterfront setting. The main subjects are seated and standing on a weathered wooden structure, likely a dock or pier, which extends into calm blue water. The person seated appears to be a young man wearing dark clothing and casual shoes, he is sitting on one of the pier's beams with his hands folded, looking towards the water. The other individual, standing, is dressed in darker, possibly work-related attire, and holds what appears to be a bag or catch, suggesting they might be engaged in a task related to fishing or maintenance.\n\nIn the background, the scene is busy with an array of moored boats of various sizes and designs, including a prominent white and red boat that seems to be a small fishing trawler. Other boats visible include sailboats and smaller motorboats, all docked in a marina setting. The backdrop is rich in detail, with an array of masts, cabins, and maritime equipment, giving the impression of a bustling, utilitarian waterfront area.\n\nThe overall composition blends elements of daily life and work in a maritime environment, characterized by a serene water surface, utilitarian wooden structures, and evidence of an active boating community. The lighting suggests it might be midday, with clear skies reflected in the vibrancy and clarity of the colors throughout the scene.","title":"Southern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544306","546998","544260","551228","548078","545928","547549","543035","546939","548235","547557","544266","547553","547559","552291","547556"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","pier","waterfront","array","fishing","dock","motorboat","fold","relate","marina"]}
