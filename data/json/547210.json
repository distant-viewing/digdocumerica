{"path":"547210.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph presents a high-altitude view of an urban landscape that predominantly showcases dense residential and commercial structures. The photograph is taken during the day, under a clear blue sky which adds brightness to the overall view.\n\nIn the foreground, one can see tightly packed buildings with various architectural styles, indicating a possibly historic neighborhood where modern influences have also started infiltrating. Several buildings cast strong shadows, suggesting the photo was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe focal point near the image's center is a spacious, curved road junction, forming a loop and intersected by several roads. This road structure has a central grassy island and is surrounded predominantly by large buildings with flat roofs. There are noticeable traffic flows on these roads, hinting at an active, busy environment.\n\nDominantly featured in the photograph's left-center is a grand building with a green dome and an ornate architectural style, possibly a significant historic or governmental building, which serves as a landmark contrasting starkly with the surrounding simpler and more functional architectural styles.\n\nPerspective lines drawn by the streets create a vanishing point that draws the viewer's eye towards the other half of the photograph, which gradually shows a transition to a more spaced residential area with less densely packed structures as the city spreads out into the horizon. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with a mix of architectural styles and the busy intersection, speak to the vibrant urban life of a bustling city. The clarity and broad range of the view suggest it was taken from a very tall building or a helicopter, providing a comprehensive overlook of the cityâ€™s layout and activity.","title":"Aerial view of downtown Washington","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["551510","549979","551506","555743","548392","549476","548364","546678","548318","546624","549477","553001","552233","547755","546745","556180"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","building","roads","loop","vanishing","junction","draw","style","helicopter","styles"]}
