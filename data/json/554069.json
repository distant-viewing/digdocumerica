{"path":"554069.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a striking and highly stylized image. The entire scene is suffused with a deep, monochromatic red tone. The central subject of the image is a group of three bird silhouettes reflected on what appears to be a water surface, creating a double image of each bird.\n\nThe silhouettes are sharp and detailed against the uniform red background, with the reflections slightly more diffused. Each bird is captured in a different stance, suggesting movement. They have elongated legs and pointed beaks, typical of wading birds, perhaps resembling sandpipers or similar species.\n\nThe background is devoid of any additional detail or variation in tone, focusing all attention on the elegantly simple interaction between the birds and their reflections. The composition is minimalist, using the contrast between the dark bird figures and the vibrant red background to dramatic effect, conveying a sense of tranquility and isolation.","title":"Stilt birds live protected in kanahe pond, in a conservation district surrounded by an urban area.
