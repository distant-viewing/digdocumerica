{"path":"548056.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene aquatic scene featuring several floating houses docked on a calm body of water. In the foreground, a small, empty rowboat made of dark material is visible, gently floating on the water's surface. The central part of the image shows a grouping of quaint houseboats, each with differing designs but similar structural elements like pitched roofs and wooden exteriors. Some of these floating homes have additions like decks and small balconies, and one displays a prominent chimney.\n\nThe houseboats are anchored to a pier system, visible as the wooden walkways connecting each home. Various objects such as chairs and marine paraphernalia can also be seen on the decks, suggesting a lived-in and personalized touch to each residence. Utility poles and mooring piles are interspersed among the homes, contributing to the functional aspect of this floating community.\n\nIn the background, the shore is lined with more industrial-looking structures and vegetation, faintly visible through a light haze which might be indicative of the early or late hours of the day. The overall palette of the image is subdued, with the blues of the water reflecting the sky and contrasting against the muted tones of the houseboats and greener hues of the distant shore. The scene exudes a peaceful, almost timeless quality, encapsulating a unique waterside living arrangement.","title":"Houseboats on the Columbia River slough","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["545197","548052","548086","558062","545067","542650","548048","547953","544243","542908","548763","548235","544567","552270","547965","542872"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["float","home","deck","personalize","differing","grouping","shore","mooring","greener","waterside"]}
