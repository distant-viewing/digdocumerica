{"path":"546243.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of road construction. A large, complex piece of machinery occupies the forefront, laying down what appears to be a fresh layer of concrete or asphalt onto the road. This machine is fitted with various components and several workers are visible operating or supervising the equipment.\n\nIn the foreground, a significant feature is a grid of rebar, suggesting that the road being constructed will have a reinforced concrete base. Directly next to this installation, we see a series of trucks pouring concrete into another part of the heavy machinery, which spreads and smooths the mixture onto the surface.\n\nIn the background, the scene extends to an operational part of the road where traffic, including cars and trucks, is visible. The landscape surrounding the construction site features open areas with grass and sparse woodland, typical of a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe setting suggests a major infrastructure project aimed at either expanding existing roadway capabilities or building a new section of road. The presence of various construction vehicles and the organized nature of the site indicates a well-coordinated effort involving substantial manpower and mechanical resources.","title":"Steel rods, made from shredded autos, are being used for road reinforcement in this section of i-55, north of durant.
