{"path":"546884.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting, likely a steel mill or a similar factory, with significant environmental pollution. The image is dominated by a backdrop of billowing smoke and steam being emitted into the air from multiple tall smokestacks. The smoke varies in color from bright white to dark gray, indicating different temperatures or types of emissions.\n\nThe structure of the factory is complex, featuring multiple layers of buildings, metal frameworks, and pipes. There are a few prominent structures that resemble furnaces or boilers, typical of heavy industrial operations associated with metal production. A bridge, possibly for carrying materials or workers, can be seen extending over part of the facility.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is somewhat somber and blurs the line between industrial power and environmental impact. There is a hazy sky, possibly overcast or suffused with pollution, which adds a gritty, textured look to the scene. Lighting conditions and the film quality give the photograph a slightly faded, dated appearance, common in mid-20th century industrial documentation. There are no visible people or moving objects, suggesting the photo aims to emphasize the starkness and scale of the industrial activity and its environmental implications rather than daily human activity in the factory.","title":"Bethlehem steel plant at sparrows point","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["545447","550172","557215","549967","550868","557218","546908","550328","550181","550981","550176","546808","550195","546882","545445","545507"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["factory","suffuse","documentation","pollution","furnace","implication","starkness","smoke","temperature","mill"]}
