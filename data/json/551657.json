{"path":"551657.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing scene set in an urban environment, likely a plaza or a public space sandwiched between large office buildings. The foreground shows a covered apse-like structure with its roof supported by metallic beams. Under this shade, a man dressed in a white shirt and dark trousers is performing an activity on a large black sheep, apparently shearing it, due to the clumps of wool scattered on the ground.\n\nA group of about twenty spectators, a mix of men and women dressed in 1970s/1980s casual and work clothing, surrounds the area, observing the activity with interest. Some individuals are taking pictures or recording the scene. The background features tall buildings, probably skyscrapers, visible above the top of a railing that encircles this spectacle. The setting suggests that this event was an unusual or special occasion, drawing the attention of people passing by in what appears to be a busy part of a city. The day seems clear with ample sunlight enhancing the vibrant urban backdrop.","title":"Sheepshearing, one of the demonstrations in the rockefeller center festival of folk arts and crafts","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551655","554884","554893","554892","553271","552568","544391","551654","554886","554883","551656","554894","553264","554880","554881","553319"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["wool","sandwich","record","spectacle","sheep","encircle","clump","occasion","plaza","spectator"]}
