{"path":"544547.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary bird perched on a slender branch within a loosely entwined network of thin branches and leaves. The avian subject, characterized by its dark plumage and prominent beak, stands slightly towards the right side of the frame, angled such that its posture and gaze are directed outward, away from the camera. The branch on which it is perched is part of a larger foliage comprised of green leaves that show some variations in tone, possibly due to lighting or the age of the leaves themselves.\n\nThe background of the image is a muted gradient mix of blue and light gray, suggestive of a sky that may be slightly overcast. The lighting on the bird and branches indicates that the source of light (likely the sun) is diffused, adding to the overall softness of the image. There's a hint of a faded, rainbow-like coloration, perhaps a lens flare or a subtle natural arc in the distance, contributing an additional element of depth and natural phenomenon to the scene.\n\nOverall, this image emphasizes the serene and solitary nature of the bird in its natural habitat, with a composition that highlights the interplay between the organic forms of the branches and the stillness of the bird against a calm, somber sky.","title":"Green heron","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557628","548885","555010","551378","547318","543595","554601","544477","557204","544489","550388","555013","557208","547322","548832","551379"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["bird","branch","leave","rainbow","beak","phenomenon","arc","plumage","flare","softness"]}
