{"path":"543643.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and expansive landscape dominated by a large body of water, presumably a lake, reflecting subtle shades of blue and gray under overcast skies. The lake is surrounded by rolling hills and rugged mountains, creating a textured horizon of earthy tones ranging from deep browns to lush greens. The mountains are densely forested in some areas, while others are barren or sparsely vegetated, revealing rocky surfaces and dramatic geological formations.\n\nThe background features mountain peaks shrouded in mist, enhancing the atmospheric depth of the scene. The overall mood is tranquil and somewhat mysterious, accentuated by the low clouds or fog clinging to the crests of the distant mountains. There are faint traces of human presence, possibly small boats or floats in the water, which are tiny and barely noticeable against the vastness of the natural landscape. The composition emphasizes the grandeur and tranquility of nature, inviting viewers to contemplate the beauty and scale of the wilderness.","title":"Blue Mesa Reservoir created by the damming of Gunnison River","placename":"Gunnison (Colo.)","location":"Gunnison, Colorado","nn1":["554399","555692","543816","552894","554616","550579","552904","550641","550493","543761","552336","556926","555388","552900","554652","555130"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","contemplate","lake","crest","cling","trace","shroud","fog","vegetate","grandeur"]}
