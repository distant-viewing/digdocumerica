{"path":"545934.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image provides an aerial view of a dramatic coastal landscape. On the left side of the photograph, you can see a steep, craggy coastline with cliffs dropping off sharply into the ocean. The ocean appears vast and merges with the sky at the horizon, its surface periodically broken by white wave caps near the shore. \n\nThe rugged cliffs are irregular and extensively textured, suggesting they have been shaped by both the erosive force of the ocean and weather elements over time. Near the coast, right at the foot of some of the cliffs, a narrow beach can be seen, though it is minimal and stony rather than sandy.\n\nTo the right side of the image, gradually receding from the coastline, the terrain rises into what appears to be hilly, possibly mountainous areas. These are covered in a variety of vegetation which gives a richer, greenish-brown hue to the landscape. Low lying clouds or fog slip into the valleys, adding a mystical quality to the scene. The creeping mist partially obscures the land features, creating a soft, dreamy look.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of wild, untouched natural scenery, viewed from an elevated perspective that captures the show of nature's texture and scale.","title":"California--near Eureka","placename":"Eureka (Calif.)","location":"Eureka, California","nn1":["543045","543328","543300","543061","543430","545125","543428","547991","545222","543085","543184","545122","545129","543433","543434","553775"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","ocean","coastline","slip","drop","coast","foot","recede","fog","merge"]}
