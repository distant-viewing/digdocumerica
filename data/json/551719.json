{"path":"551719.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and colorful outdoor scene, likely at a community event or festival. The setting appears to be in a public park or recreational area, with various people engaged in different activities.\n\nIn the foreground, several children are seated around a large table covered with a white paper roll, engaging in painting activities. They are using paints and brushes to create artwork, each focused on their task. Around five children are visible, all seemingly concentrated on their painting, each with a paint container and brush at hand. One child, partly seen on the left edge, appears to be an observer or waiting for a chance to join in.\n\nTo the right side and background, adults are supervising and socializing. A woman standing close to the painting activity table wears large sunglasses and holds a bag, observing the children, likely a parent or guardian. Another man, standing further to her right and also likely a parent, is dressed in a denim jacket and is conversing with a woman who is holding a baby wrapped in a cozy, red, padded jacket.\n\nIn the background, the park atmosphere is enhanced by various other attendees walking around, some partially visible. There is also a sense of diversity among the people, both in terms of age and ethnic backgrounds, indicative of a community gathering.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph uses depth effectively, utilizing the activity at the table as the focal point while still capturing the broader, bustling environment of the park. The photograph also conveys a sense of the era, potentially in the late 20th century, suggested by fashion such as the bell-bottom jeans and the style of sunglasses and hairdos.\n","title":"Youngsters enjoy painting materials provided free at the spring festival at carl schurz park in Manhattan's upper east side overlooking the east river and the north tip of welfare island, the park is the site of historic gracie mansion, now the residence of the mayor of New York","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551677","551716","551688","553262","546821","551676","551736","555947","553269","556230","557410","545311","558294","552946","557259","543919"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["painting","parent","child","table","brush","socialize","join","broader","baby","supervise"]}
