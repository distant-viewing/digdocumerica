{"path":"552121.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a scene under a bridge, characterized by a large steel structure of the bridge visible overhanging from the top of the frame, creating a silhouette that contrasts against a bright sky. Beneath the bridge in a flat open area, the image shows a car connected to a trailer which is carrying a boat, suggesting preparation or the return from a nautical activity. The car, appearing to be a model from the late 1950s or early 1960s, is white in color. The boat on the trailer is mostly a cream or light color, fitted with seats and possibly ready for water-based activities.\n\nThe ground is unpaved and covered in gravel or dirt, suggesting a rustic or undeveloped area. In the background, beyond the immediate area underneath the bridge, there is a winding dirt path that leads up a grassy slope to a higher elevation. The landscape under the clear sky appears serene and lightly vegetated, indicating possibly a rural or semi-rural setting. There are no people visible in this photograph, emphasizing the stillness and the focus on the vehicle and boat setup for leisure purposes. The overall atmosphere is calm, and the composition frames the juxtaposition of technological human-made structures with the natural environment.","title":"Warren Freeman, 50, built a cottage on an island in the Kansas River.
