{"path":"554734.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph displays a tranquil autumn scene featuring a stand of birch trees. The trees have white bark that stands out against the colorful foliage in hues of green and yellow, indicating a change in seasons. In the background, there is a glimpse of a lake or river, its surface reflecting hints of the blue sky above. The water is partially obscured by the density of the trees, providing a sense of depth and seclusion in the landscape. The undergrowth is modestly covered with grass and smaller shrubs, some of which are taking on autumnal colors. Sunlight filters through the canopy, casting patches of light and creating a warm, serene atmosphere. The composition focuses on the vertical lines of the trees, setting a contrast against the horizontal line of the water body in the background, which helps in drawing attention to the natural beauty and calmness of the forest setting.","title":"Trunks of paper birches and red maples, at Chapel Pond","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554733","543700","554528","553075","554735","550650","554737","554738","554751","550603","557159","554649","554400","554732","554718","554758"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["birch","undergrowth","seclusion","stand","calmness","tree","bark","line","density","change"]}
