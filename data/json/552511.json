{"path":"552511.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of the wall and door of an aged and textured wooden building. The building's surface is primarily covered in vertical wooden planks that have been painted in a deep burgundy or maroon color. The paint shows signs of wear and fading, contributing to a rustic and weathered look.\n\nThere is a door prominent in the left part of the image, made distinctive by its use of contrasting, unstained wooden planks arranged vertically. These planks are lighter in color, showing natural wood tones of creams and light browns. The door is framed with a simple darker edging which blends with the rest of the building's facade.\n\nAcross the top of the image, the word \"BROWNING\" is painted in large, white, block letters that are also showing signs of age and chipping paint. This gives a vintage, industrial feel to the scene.\n\nThe setting and precise details suggest a functional, possibly rural building, perhaps used for storage or another utilitarian purpose. The composition of the image, focusing on textures, colors, and the typography of the paint, gives it an aesthetically intriguing quality that focuses on the signs of age and usage.","title":"Deserted railroad station in browning","placename":"Springfield (Ill.)","location":"Springfield, Illinois","nn1":["543348","545821","552463","543339","552964","553479","550008","549193","543330","547894","553478","554564","545355","547808","557081","555295"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["paint","plank","door","age","burgundy","maroon","sign","building","usage","prominent"]}
