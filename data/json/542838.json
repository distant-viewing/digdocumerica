{"path":"542838.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph provides a birdâ€™s-eye view of a rugged landscape, characterized by sinuous roadways meandering through a primarily mountainous terrain. The roads carve through the terrain with many curves and loops, indicative of a challenging, hilly topography. The earth is dark and varied in texture, with hints of sparse vegetation in certain areas, suggesting that this could be a semi-arid or mountainous region.\n\nThe rich detailing in the landscape showcases different shades, possibly due to variations in soil, rock type, or sunlight. Darker areas may indicate denser vegetation or shadows cast by the terrain's elevation changes, adding depth to the visual composition. It is evident that this is a remote or less developed region due to the minimal human intervention visible besides the snaking roads. There are no visible buildings or other structures, emphasizing the natural and untouched aspect of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the image captures a sense of isolation and the raw beauty of challenging landscapes shaped by natural forces and minimal human influence.","title":"'Clear cutting'","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550600","550596","543772","542836","553785","549016","550614","555873","543665","554154","557558","550598","552560","550615","542821","555553"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["loop","terrain","region","influence","intervention","topography","detailing","force","elevation","landscape"]}
