{"path":"554943.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a man in the process of skinning or preparing animal pelts on a wooden table. The man wears a red cap, glasses, and a light-colored long-sleeve shirt. He is using a tool, possibly a knife or scraper, on a pelt laid out on the table. There are multiple animal pelts hanging from a bar above the table, displayed prominently in the background.\n\nThe setting appears to be an open shelter or structure with columns and a roof, but open walls, allowing clear visibility to the outdoors. In the background, a car is parked outside, suggesting the area is near a road or in a rural setting. An empty black plastic bucket is also visible in the foreground, placed on the ground near the corner of the table. The natural lighting and casual attire of the man hint at a work environment focused on practical tasks related to hunting or fur processing.","title":"Fur skins of fox, raccoon and bobcat being prepared for market in Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554944","546094","554925","554940","554675","554934","554941","546133","554926","554952","552587","546132","552634","545980","552649","554676"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["table","animal","hunt","process","bar","lay","hind","outdoor","shelter","bucket"]}
