{"path":"550160.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a suburban neighborhood with single-story homes, captured under a clear blue sky. The residential area features a sequence of houses that display similar architectural stylesâ€”mostly A-frame roofs with attic vents and a mixture of siding materials. Several houses are visible; the one in the foreground is white with contrasting dark shutters, featuring a small front porch and a neatly trimmed yard.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a car parked outside the nearest house, which appears to be a yellow sedan from the era when the photo was taken, likely the late 20th century. The street appears quiet and devoid of significant activity or people.\n\nDominating the composition is an airplane flying unusually low over the houses. The plane is directly aligned with the street, suggesting it might be approaching or departing from a nearby airport. Its close proximity to the residential area is striking and somewhat unusual, as planes are generally not seen flying at such a low altitude in residential zones.\n\nThe surrounding environment does not show many trees, but there is one notable tall evergreen near the center-right of the image. The overall feel is of a typical suburban setting with an unexpected element introduced by the presence of the low-flying aircraft.","title":"Brook park homes are in landing pattern of hopkins airport jet planes","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550156","547769","549071","556975","556956","548484","553700","553970","547211","548824","557405","544550","551102","544510","557454","548469"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["fly","plane","house","sequence","depart","evergreen","airport","vent","shutter","airplane"]}
