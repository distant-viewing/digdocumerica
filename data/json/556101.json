{"path":"556101.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at the Glacier Park train station. In the foreground, a vintage luggage cart with red metal wheels and a wooden platform is prominently displayed, casting a long shadow across the platform due to the bright, presumably late afternoon sunlight. The platform itself is made of concrete with tracks on either side, designated for trains.\n\nThe main building, labeled \"Glacier Park\", is a classic railroad depot with dark wooden siding and a gabled roof. It extends along the platform, punctuated by evenly spaced doors and windows and an extended roof providing shade to the platform. Groups of people are visible near the building, appearing to be passengers either arriving or waiting.\n\nThe background shows a clear sky and a flat, open landscape suggestive of a rural or semi-rural environment typical of areas surrounding national parks in the United States. Overall, the image captures a nostalgic, serene moment at a train station that serves as a gateway to natural wonders, likely taken during the mid to late 20th century based on the color and style of the photograph.","title":"Rustic station at East Glacier Park, Montana, where one Chicago bound and one Seattle, Washington, bound train stop each day during the summer. Amtrak, which assumed major responsibility for U.S. intercity rail passenger service in 1971, is working to Renovate many of the stations. Ridership is increasing as new equipment replaces older material inherited from the nation's railroads.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556040","556782","556074","555984","556124","556100","556063","555985","556857","556044","556091","547511","556768","556784","556024","556102"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["platform","train","station","depot","wonder","luggage","cart","railroad","roof","concrete"]}
