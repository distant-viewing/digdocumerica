{"path":"552851.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a severe flooding situation. The main focus is a large white dome-like structure surrounded by extensive flooding. This dome has a conical peak, possibly indicating a specialized building like a storage silo or sports arena, and industrial equipment can be discerned adjacent to it, including what appears to be a crane or lifting arm. The water has inundated the surrounding area, submerging roads and threatening a number of smaller buildings and residential homes interspersed amongst the trees.\n\nThe landscape around the flooded area is lush and green, suggesting the flood has occurred in a typically verdant area possibly near a river, given the visible expanses of water in the distance beyond the immediate flooded region. No people or moving vehicles are visible; the scene is static, suggesting either evacuation or avoidance of the area due to the flooding. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the cloudy, overcast sky and the vast water coverage is one of somber tranquility and the power of natural forces.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi river reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
