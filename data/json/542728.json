{"path":"542728.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a lush forest, notable for its large and majestic trees, most likely sequoias, indicating that it might be a national park. Centrally featured is an enormous tree trunk, demonstrating significant girth and height, dwarfing the nearby visitors.\n\nSurrounding the base of this tree is a small crowd of people, with around fourteen individuals visible. The group appears to be engaged in a sightseeing or educational activity, looking up at the tree and pointing. Some of the individuals are taking photographs, while others seem to be in conversation or observing the tree's immense size.\n\nThe attire of the visitors suggests a casual outdoor setting, with hats, sunglasses, and light jackets visible, appropriate for a day out in a wooded area. A few visitors are closer to the camera, and their poses and directions vary, ranging from facing towards the tree to looking at other elements in the environment.\n\nThe setting is serene and well-maintained, evident from a clear walking path and low fences designed to protect the natural vegetation while providing access to tourists. The background is dense with similarly towering trees, reinforcing the grandeur of this natural habitat. The lighting in the photo, likely taken during daytime, illuminates the scene adequately, with shadows cast by the towering trees adding to the depth and richness of the forest environment.\n\nOverall, the scene is tranquil and picturesque, capturing a moment of human interaction with nature in a setting that emphasizes conservation and admiration for ancient natural landmarks.","title":"Holiday crowds visit General Sherman Tree","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["543446","542748","554966","545290","543445","554995","542750","542745","542732","543447","554999","543442","545278","543448","553357","554967"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["visitor","tree","admiration","sightseeing","walking","richness","pointing","tower","forest","landmark"]}
