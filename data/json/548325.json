{"path":"548325.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This image features a prominent industrial tower, likely part of a power plant or manufacturing facility, dominating the foreground. The tower is tall and cylindrical, constructed of concrete with visible vertical streaks and marks consistent with weathering or industrial use. Smoke or steam is emanating from the top, suggesting the tower is in operation.\n\nSurrounding the tower base, various details provide insight into an industrial setting. To the left of the tower, there are railroad tracks populated with a range of train cars. This area is bustling with transportation activity, indicating the site's connection to broader industrial or commercial networks.\n\nIn the background, the image spans over a dense urban landscape packed with residential and commercial buildings. The area is thoroughly developed, with tightly packed houses and the occasional small patches of greenery. The visibility is slightly hazy, possibly due to the weather or airborne particulates from industrial activities.\n\nThe perspective suggests the photograph was taken from a high vantage point, looking down onto the tower and across the cityscape, capturing the juxtaposition of industrial infrastructure and residential areas, highlighting themes of urbanization and industrialization.","title":"Smokestack of the Consolidated Edison power plant in Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550177","550168","548376","549710","548321","550982","545912","556075","555737","555761","555791","557374","548379","557225","555617","546862"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["tower","urbanization","pack","insight","industrialization","emanate","streak","railroad","weathering","concrete"]}
