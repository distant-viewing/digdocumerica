{"path":"551333.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a pastoral scene set in a rural area. The foreground shows a field that appears to be recently harvested, showcasing rows of cut hay or similar agricultural material. A person on a tractor, possibly towing mowing equipment, is seen working or moving through this field, contributing to a sense of ongoing agricultural activity.\n\nIn the middle distance, the landscape is marked by rolling hills dotted with patches of trees and shrubs. Two buildings are visible: to the left, there's a dilapidated barn with a rusty metal roof, surrounded by overgrowth, suggesting it may no longer be in active use. To the right stands a more prominent, well-maintained two-story house, painted white, positioned atop a slight hill and partially obscured by trees. This building has a traditional architectural style, indicative of a rural homestead.\n\nThe background consists primarily of more tree-lined hills, creating a closed-off feeling that suggests this scene is somewhat secluded from urban environments. The overall effect is serene and bucolic, with an emphasis on nature and rural life. The image has a slightly grainy quality and a color palette dominated by greens and earth tones, enhancing its vintage or timeless appeal.","title":"Valley farm hay baling operation on the niangua river just above point where the river joins the lake proper off route j.
