{"path":"547414.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a traditional church scene that seems taken from a gathering or event, possibly after a service based on the people gathered outside. The church, prominently featured in the center of the image, is a classic white wooden structure with a steeple and bell tower at the top. A round window is placed just beneath the steeple, and there are two pointed-arch windows flanking the main entrance, all of which are traditional elements in such buildings.\n\nIn front of the church, a group of people can be seen assembling and mingling. The attendees wear semi-formal to formal attire, suggesting a special occasion such as a wedding or a significant church service. There are both adults and children in the group.\n\nIn the foreground, a vintage car is parked, which looks like it might be from the late 1960s or 1970s, adding a historical element to the scene. The setting is rural or semi-rural, indicated by the simple dirt road in front of the church and another parked car next to the first one, which is also from the same era.\n\nOverhanging branches slightly obscure the top left corner of the frame, giving a natural frame to the scene and suggesting that the photograph might have been taken from a slight distance or in a discreet manner to capture a candid moment. The overcast sky contributes to a soft lighting in the image, enhancing the serene and timeless feel of the scene.","title":"After service at the Immanuel Lutheran Church on Highway 34 near Garland","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557951","558397","556480","558034","554207","542797","546233","558023","554035","547333","558024","556240","556460","557758","547346","557666"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["church","steeple","service","bell","occasion","front","attendee","group","manner","arch"]}
