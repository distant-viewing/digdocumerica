{"path":"547232.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene likely at a mining or large construction site. In the foreground, a large dump truck, painted in white, is visible hauling dirt or debris along a dirt road; it's an older model with six wheels and a substantial dirt-hauling bed. On a raised mound of earth in the background, two larger vehicles are visibleâ€”a massive yellow dump truck and a yellow bulldozer. The dump truck is parked and appears slightly covered in dust, indicating it's been at work recently. The bulldozer is engaged in moving or leveling the ground.\n\nThe terrain is rugged and uneven, characterized by large piles of earth and crushed stone. This textured landscape suggests ongoing heavy construction or earth-moving activities. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a clear day. There are no trees or buildings in sight, highlighting the remote or undeveloped nature of the location. This setting is typical for industrial operations that require large vehicles and substantial space, pinpointing an active and possibly expansive work zone.","title":"The Blue Plains sewage treatment plant is located along the Anacostia River.
