{"path":"554201.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly man standing next to a large, colorful wind sculpture in a grassy yard. The sculpture is intricate and vibrant, featuring various elements such as wheels, hubs, and propeller-like parts painted in reds, blacks, whites, and metallic hues. Parts of the sculpture are in motion, suggesting a breezy day.\n\nThe man is dressed in a dark leather jacket, glasses, a flat cap, and appears to be observing or admiring the sculpture. Behind him and the sculpture, there's a small, traditional white house with a grey roof, which adds a quaint, homely feel to the scene. Additional smaller sculptures or garden ornaments can be faintly seen in the background, indicating a garden rich with decorations and creativity.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of peaceful domesticity, highlighting a sense of personal creativity and pride in home gardening and decoration. The focus on the wind sculpture alongside the presence of the man suggests a personal connection or interest in the artistic or mechanical aspect of the garden display.","title":"This Greenbush resident's hobby is building windmills.","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["544295","557681","546520","556488","548660","545091","551269","558333","546512","553254","548998","550059","557115","558269","544236","552112"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["sculpture","creativity","garden","decoration","admire","propeller","ornament","wind","pride","leather"]}
