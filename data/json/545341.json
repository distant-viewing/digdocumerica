{"path":"545341.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts a semi-arid, desert-like landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the subdued lighting and purplish hue of the sky. The view is angled along a dusty dirt path that runs through the center of the image from the foreground towards the background. Along the path, there are visible footprints indicating recent passage.\n\nThe surrounding ground off the path is scattered with dry grass and sparse vegetation, which includes small bushes and a few plants. The soil appears to be dry and packed, typical of arid landscapes.\n\nIn the background, the silhouette of a mountain range can be seen under a sky that spreads widely across the horizon, hinting at a vast, open, and remote environment. On the right side, there is a line of utility poles parallel to the path, which adds a sense of human presence and infrastructure to the otherwise natural and wild scene. These poles feature wire lines connected between them, progressively diminishing into the distance.\n\nOverall, the setting evokes a feeling of isolation and the ruggedness of a deserted natural landscape, highlighted by the gritty texture of the ground and the stark, simple life forms adapted to survive in such an environment.","title":"This land in the Rio GRande Valley has been subdivided and sold for housing.","placename":"Albuquerque (N.M.)","location":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","nn1":["553057","545604","545895","548673","545879","545575","549183","554774","545593","544019","544027","549016","544428","549179","552897","544178"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["path","pole","footprint","ruggedness","passage","line","wire","dawn","desert","feeling"]}
