{"path":"548565.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a scene featuring a group of people, most likely at an outdoor public event under a clear sky, as indicated by the bright lighting and casual summer attire. Central to the composition are individuals wearing white straw hats and clothing that reflects a relaxed, warm-weather setting. The foreground of the image is dominated by various boat tillers (or handles), characterized by their distinctive hooked ends and long shafts, likely used for steering small boats. These tillers are contrasted against a somewhat blurred background which includes other similar objects and groups of people further away, creating a general sense of a grouped social gathering or a boating-related event. The photograph uses a shallow depth of field, where the focus is on the person in a white hat to the right of the frame, wearing sunglasses, which implies a candid, dynamic moment among attendees engaged in conversation or observation.","title":"Photograph of line waiting to play shuffleboard at the Century Village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["545728","558295","549373","549939","548513","549416","549411","543943","553275","549397","551228","549408","555718","544260","557054","557040"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["shaft","event","handle","hat","boat","boating","attendee","straw","group","observation"]}
