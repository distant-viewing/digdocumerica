{"path":"554894.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural, agricultural scene involving three individuals and a flock of sheep inside a wooden pen. The setting is outdoors, possibly on a farm or ranch, with lush green trees and a hilly landscape visible in the background, suggesting a temperate rural area.\n\nThe three people in the image are likely engaged in a farming activity, possibly tending to or managing the flock of sheep. On the left, there is a young child, wearing a light orange sweater and jeans, standing next to an adult male who is clad in a denim jacket and jeans. The adult could be guiding or teaching the child about the farming process. These two individuals appear slightly to the front of the densely packed group of sheep, with the adult holding onto a red object, which he seems to be using in managing the animals.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, another adult male stands partly inside the pen. He is wearing a cowboy hat, a long-sleeve shirt, and jeans, and is reaching out towards the sheep, possibly to touch or direct one of them. This individual's pose and attire suggest a hands-on involvement with the livestock.\n\nThe sheep are densely packed within the wooden pen, with many of them looking directly at the camera. Each sheep is marked with a reddish-pink hue on their wool, which might be an indication of recent vaccination, medication, or selection for some procedure. The predominant colors in the image are the earthy tones of the wooden pen, the greenery in the background, and the predominantly white color of the sheep, accented with the red marks.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of daily life and work on a farm, highlighting human interaction with livestock and possibly depicting a teaching or guiding moment involving the younger individual.","title":"Sheared sheep on a ranch near Leakey, Texas, awaiting transport to a slaughter house on return to pasture near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554880","554883","554886","554882","554881","544391","552573","552568","547396","554892","554884","554928","554887","547326","544426","554779"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["sheep","pen","flock","livestock","adult","jeans","male","farm","manage","marnks"]}
