{"path":"554166.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a somewhat isolated and barren landscape, characterized by a seemingly desolate environment with dry and scrubby terrain. The main features of the image are a network of curving roads that create an intricate pattern across the scene. These roads are paved and marked with white sidelines, and though they intersect and wind around, there are no visible vehicles or people on them. Situated amidst this road network is a lone structure, possibly a small house or shed, which has a noticeable brown-colored roof, possibly featuring solar panels or metallic material.\n\nThe environment surrounding the roads and building is arid, with scattered shrub vegetation and patches of bare ground. The color palette of the terrain is primarily brown and beige, suggesting a desert or semi-desert region. There are street lamps evenly spaced along the roads, enhancing the sense of this being a developed yet uninhabited or rarely visited area.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of isolation and the quietness of an expansive natural space intersected by human-made infrastructure, portrayed from a high vantage point that emphasizes the layout and emptiness of the area.","title":"Most recent and most controversial land speculation in Hawaii centers on this area near Kamuela.  Land use commission staff recommended total denial of developers' petition for rezoning.  The commission, however, permitted 3,414 acres of the 5,000 requested to pass over to urban use.  Since then, 900 lots have been sold but little building has been done, leaving an empty subdivision to be protected by county services","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554165","555888","544564","553125","554164","555881","549016","542518","555783","555844","555863","549067","555865","544816","545604","547657"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","intersect","network","emptiness","quietness","visit","pave","shed","space","lamp"]}
