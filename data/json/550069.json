{"path":"550069.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures three cyclists in motion on a sunny day, positioned increasingly further away from the camera in a diagonal line from the left to the right side of the frame. The first cyclist, closest to the camera, is riding a bicycle with a darker frame and appears to be in a casual posture, wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt and dark pants. The second cyclist, in the middle distance, is on a lighter-framed bike and wears a darker tank top and lighter shorts, also in a relaxed riding stance. The third cyclist, furthest from the camera, appears similar in attire to the first, with short sleeves and darker shorts, also riding a darker-framed bicycle.\n\nThe scene is captured with a motion blur effect that conveys the speed of their movement, lending a dynamic quality to the image. The background features lush, green trees and a bright, clear sky that suggest a rural or park-like setting, with a gravelly path indicating a possibly less urban environment. The lighting is strong, indicative of outdoor daylight conditions, enhancing the natural greens of the trees and the overall vividness of the setting.","title":"Enjoying the new bicycle path in Rock River Reservation, part of the metropolitan park system.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547209","552340","553908","543719","545287","551545","551303","555499","555500","548574","545282","547241","543715","546540","553955","548572"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["cyclist","bicycle","camera","short","riding","sleeve","motion","bike","stance","blur"]}
