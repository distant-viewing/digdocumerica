{"path":"542556.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a quiet, introspective moment of a person crouched on a rocky shore by a body of water. The individual, a man, is wearing a light-colored, long-sleeve shirt and brown pants, and is engaged in an activity involving a white bucket, possibly collecting water or examining something within it.\n\nThe background features calm, blue-green water that fills much of the frame, indicating the proximity to a river or lake. The transition from the pebbly shoreline to the water is seamless, suggesting a gentle slope. The stones on the shore vary in size and are mostly smooth, adding texture to the scene.\n\nLight plays a significant role in this image, highlighting the ripples on the water surface and casting shadows that add depth and dimension. The overall ambiance is serene and natural, focused entirely on the simple act of interaction between the man and the water environment. The setting and the person's focused activity converge to create a peaceful, meditative atmosphere.","title":"Polluted water from gravel plants upstream","placename":"Merced County (Calif.)","location":"Merced County, California","nn1":["550826","548972","546298","545095","550268","554848","549012","545940","545077","549007","548831","547913","548956","547712","550235","548291"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["water","shore","dimension","act","person","bucket","proximity","role","transition","ripple"]}
