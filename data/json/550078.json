{"path":"550078.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a young male in action, mid-swing with a baseball bat, hitting a pink ball. He wears a blue t-shirt, white shorts, and black footwear, and is intensely focused on the ball. The scene takes place in an urban space, characterized by a cobblestone ground and a wall covered in various graffiti. The graffiti on the wall is colorful and includes names and phrases such as \"CORA\", \"ON Y KAD\", and other partially visible tags that suggest a space frequently visited by locals. The background behind the wall shows dense foliage, indicating that this place might be on the verge of a more natural or neglected area. The lighting suggests it's a sunny day, casting strong shadows and highlighting the vivid colors of the graffiti and the lush greenery. The atmosphere of the scene combines a sense of playful leisure with a rough, urban environment.","title":"Graffiti artists were at work in this vacant area earmarked for use by the planned interstate highway.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["555916","546272","549271","556507","553042","549318","556583","551094","556303","552024","551103","555936","555915","552755","551768","551973"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["graffiti","ball","wall","footwear","local","phrase","swing","hit","visit","tag"]}
