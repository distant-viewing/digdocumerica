{"path":"548903.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of two tractors working on a large agricultural field. The field presents a textured pattern possibly due to recent plowing or planting lines, enhancing the visual depth with its dark soil contrasted by the parallel lines in lighter shades. The two tractors, which are located towards the mid-left and bottom-right of the image, are actively engaged in dispersing a white substance, likely to be fertilizer or pesticide, which creates prominent plumes of dust or spray behind them. This action generates a dynamic and visually impactful scene, emphasizing the expanse and the systematic agricultural activity taking place. The setting appears to be in a rural area under clear lighting conditions, presumably either early morning or late afternoon, given the softness of the light and the length of shadows cast by the tractors. The open landscape lacks apparent natural or built structures in the immediate vicinity, focusing the viewer's attention squarely on the agricultural process.","title":"Fertilizing","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549104","553048","548898","545893","553881","548902","547297","557521","548820","554202","547436","547301","548907","544319","555879","553665"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["tractor","pesticide","planting","softness","field","substance","dust","vicinity","line","plume"]}
