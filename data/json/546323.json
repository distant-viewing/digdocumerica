{"path":"546323.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a focused scene in a scientific laboratory environment where a woman is engaged in detailed, meticulous work. She appears concentrated on a task involving small petri dishes, which are spread across a large worktable. Her head is bent forward and close to the object of her study, and she is using a pipette, perhaps transferring a substance or conducting an experiment.\n\nShe is seated at the table, surrounded by various scientific apparatuses and materials. To her right is a sizable microscope, indicative of the microscopic analysis involved in her work. Arrayed in front of her and to the sides are numerous petri dishes, some stacked atop each other, suggesting an ongoing or extensive series of tests or observations.\n\nThe woman is dressed in a floral-patterned blouse, her hair falling over her shoulders, conveying a casual yet professional appearance appropriate for a lab setting. In the background, a bookshelf filled with volumes and binders suggests an environment rich in research material and scientific literature, indicating that this is likely a serious research facility or an academic setting.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of intense scientific inquiry and precision, emphasizing the discipline and attention to detail typically required in scientific research. The image captures a moment of intellectual engagement and contributes to the traditional portrayal of a scientist at work.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory: Fishery biologist conducts studies of shrimp and crab larvae.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549342","546327","546288","548860","542737","548862","548856","551594","548891","549332","546344","549608","546278","542666","549339","546328"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["research","dish","microscope","bookshelf","inquiry","work","transfer","test","scientist","analysis"]}
