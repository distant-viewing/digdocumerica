{"path":"551857.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment of two children playing near a water feature. The setting appears to be an urban park or plaza, distinguished by the presence of a large, sloping fountain cascading water down its tiled surface. The image focuses on a young boy in a red shirt, beige pants, and brown footwear. He is seemingly captured mid-play, turning towards the camera while his small backpack or pouch swings by his side. Next to him is another child, probably younger, dressed in a dark outfit, observing the running water intently.\n\nThe atmosphere around the water feature is softened by the reflection in the water, showing a blurred mirror image of the two children. The background hints at casual urban life, with benches occupied by people and assorted personal items around them, suggesting a public, communal area. The lighting, possibly dawn or dusk, casts a soft hue over the scene, emphasizing the playful yet serene interaction of the children with their environment. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on youth and exploration amidst urban elements, evokes a sense of innocence and curiosity.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
