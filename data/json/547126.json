{"path":"547126.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of an industrial complex. The image captures large factory buildings with slanted roofs, arranged in a systematic pattern, occupying the central portion of the composition. Extensive infrastructure surrounds these buildings, including multiple railway tracks and some roads. Several billowing smokestacks can be observed emitting thick, white and gray smoke, which spreads across the sky, indicating heavy industrial activity. These emissions contribute to a somewhat hazy atmosphere visually impacting the clarity of the far background.\n\nAdjacent to the factory area, there are storage tanks and other smaller industrial units that are part of the complex. The color tones in the image are predominantly purplish and bluish, possibly due to the time of day or the type of film used for photography.\n\nThe background features a distant view of what might be other industrial installations or a populated area, but details are obscured due to the smoke and distance. The expansive area suggests that this facility is a significant operation, likely central to the local economy, with possible impacts on the environment suggested by the prominent emissions visible.\n","title":"U.S. Steel on Lake Michigan","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["555771","549727","548376","547066","549968","544495","546908","546862","555761","555774","550866","549506","548340","555779","546087","550339"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["emission","complex","factory","economy","smoke","impact","installation","photography","film","clarity"]}
