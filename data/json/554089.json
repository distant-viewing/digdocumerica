{"path":"554089.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up shot of the sun as it appears low in the sky, likely during sunrise or sunset. The sun is mostly obscured by a thin, darkened cloud that stretches across its middle, creating an effect that partially hides the sun while allowing the glowing orange and red hues to illuminate the edges and gaps in the cloud formation. The background of the image is a dark, indistinct haze that further accentuates the vivid, fiery colors of the sun and the silhouette of the cloud. There is a natural gradient from dark to light colors, transitioning from deep purples and blues at the borders of the sun to the brighter orange and reds at its center. The overall appearance is dramatic and highlights the dynamic interplay between light and darkness in nature.","title":"Sunset over Maui","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["552337","555070","542679","557629","553844","553993","542678","542680","547356","543410","557588","557957","555164","554396","550429","552896"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","hide","gap","darken","brighter","cloud","transitione","darkness","sunrise","purple"]}
