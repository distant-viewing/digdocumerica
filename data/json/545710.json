{"path":"545710.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a breathtaking natural scene with a group of four individuals engaging in outdoor activities against the backdrop of towering snow-capped mountains. The mountain peaks are staggered, with lush, wooded slopes leading up to them and patches of snow scattered across their elevations, suggesting a spring or early summer season.\n\nIn the foreground, a vibrant field of yellow wildflowers adorns the scene, adding a vivid contrast to the green of the grass and trees. This flora-rich field is beside a serene body of water, reflecting part of the majestic mountains. \n\nThe four individuals appear to be engaged in a casual excursion or hike. They are spread out across the meadow, with some bending towards the ground, possibly examining the plant life or adjusting their footwear. Their attire – consisting of casual outdoor clothing suitable for hiking – suggests they are prepared for a day exploring nature. Their relaxed demeanor and the scenic environment suggest they are enjoying a peaceful, leisurely day out in a remarkable natural setting. \n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its natural grandeur and human element, evokes a sense of tranquility and the pleasure of being immersed in the great outdoors.","title":"Aspen residents help U.S. Forest Service personnel plant seedlings at Marron Lake campground, 12 miles north of Aspen. The native Aspen trees in this popular camp area have been dying of a root disease. The USFS didn't have enough people for the replanting job, so citizens volunteered their services.
