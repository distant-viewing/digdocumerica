{"path":"543256.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph offers a picturesque view framed through a rocky cave opening, which shapes an irregular and somewhat jagged silhouette around the edges. The view captured is of a sunlit beach differing strikingly with the dark, shadowed interior of the cave.\n\nWe see a vividly blue sky and turquoise-hued sea. The beach is sandy and mostly deserted, stretching along the coastline which is dotted with several large, dark rocks both close to shore and in the water. Waves gently crash against the rocks and roll onto the sand with white froth.\n\nIn the background, lush green hills or mountains rise steeply from near the shore. They appear smooth and are uniformly covered in green vegetation, enhancing the natural untouched look of the landscape. There are no visible buildings or signs of heavy human presence, suggesting a remote or preserved location. Light plays a significant role in this composition, highlighting the contrasts between the bright exterior and the dim interior, drawing focus to the natural beauty of the coastal and mountainous landscape observed through the cave's opening.","title":"View from cave","placename":"Garrapata State Park (Calif.)","location":"Garrapata State Park, California","nn1":["543299","545106","543250","543289","543287","543297","543328","548706","543430","543237","543425","545173","551554","543252","543432","543300"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cave","opening","interior","beach","differ","froth","shore","turquoise","crash","shadowed"]}
