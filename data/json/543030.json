{"path":"543030.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a man in profile standing in the foreground with bright sunlight creating a silhouette effect. He appears to be middle-aged and is wearing a dark suit jacket over a business-like outfit, including what seems to be a tie. He is smoking a pipe, and his expression is not visible due to the lighting. Besides the man, the background features a street scene with an array of one and two-story rectangular buildings that have a typical mid-20th-century commercial architecture style.\n\nThe buildings are various colors, including pale yellows and blues, and storefront signage is partially visible, suggesting a small town's main street. These buildings look functional with simple, straightforward designs, typical of many American towns from that era. There is minimal traffic, with only a few cars visible parked along the street or in motion. The street itself is cast in shadows, contrasting with the brightly lit sky. The overall tone has a nostalgic or retro ambiance, evoking a sense of a bygone era in a small American town.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557708","558321","546097","547310","556733","547329","550114","557805","547715","548373","546419","545351","545368","549973","550130","548888"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["town","street","era","retro","profile","yellow","pipe","tie","suit","signage"]}
