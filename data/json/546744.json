{"path":"546744.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image appears to capture an aerial night-time view of an urban area, likely taken from a high vantage point. The central focus of the photo is a long straight road that cuts through the middle of the image, heavily lined with vehicles whose headlights create a luminous trail along the street. This road stretches from the foreground into the distant center, where it fades into the shadows of the terrain.\n\nSurrounding the road on both sides is a dense mix of buildings, typical of an urban downtown setting. The buildings are various sizes and shapes, suggesting a mix of residential, commercial, and possibly industrial properties. They are mostly unlit, giving the scene a somewhat gloomy or subdued tone.\n\nIn the background, just beyond the point where the road disappears, there is a significant body of water, reflecting light and contributing to the overall ambiance of the scene. Also noticeable is a large arched bridge spanning the river, partially illuminated and serving as a prominent landmark in the composition.\n\nThe sky above is twilight or dusk, casting a dark blue hue over the scene. The overall atmosphere is somewhat mysterious and moody, emphasized by the low light and predominant shadows. The photograph likely dates back to the mid-20th century, given its color tone and the general aesthetic quality of the image.","title":"M Street in Georgetown looking west to Key Bridge and Potomac River","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547051","546575","543957","546586","553846","555446","546684","546591","545451","542682","553721","549846","556681","547168","551239","549857"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["road","disappear","mix","headlight","downtown","landmark","point","date","night","property"]}
