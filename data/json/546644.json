{"path":"546644.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling highway scene during what appears to be evening or night, illuminated primarily by the headlights of numerous vehicles. The wet surface of the road reflects the car lights, creating a slightly glossy look and enhancing the visibility of the vehicles. The composition shows multiple lanes of traffic heading in the same direction, with three lanes filled with cars and mostly sedans and coupes visible. Several vehicles are closely packed, suggesting heavy traffic or potentially slow-moving congestion.\n\nA distinctive feature in this image is a bus in the right lane, with its round, bright headlights and distinctive front design, making it stand out among the smaller vehicles. Additionally, there's a road sign visible on the left side of the highway, potentially indicating directions or traffic rules, although the specifics are not clear.\n\nThe background is much darker, limiting the visible details of the environment, which suggests that the focus of the image is on the highway and the traffic itself, rather than the surrounding area. The overall mood of the shot is captured with a blueish hue, typical of the photographic film often used during the evening hours, giving the scene a somewhat cold and busy atmosphere.","title":"Photograph of Shirley Highway during evening rush hour traffic","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546739","546747","553894","546629","542764","553726","546586","546591","549902","547811","549890","553727","546610","546571","555437","556194"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["traffic","lane","highway","headlight","vehicle","direction","rule","evening","coupe","specific"]}
