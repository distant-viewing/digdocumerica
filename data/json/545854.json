{"path":"545854.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph captures a somewhat industrial landscape featuring a calm body of water that reflects a cloudless blue sky. This water body is bordered on its near side by a blackened, polluted shore where patches of dead vegetation can be seen, indicating environmental degradation. To the right of the image, there is lush greenery, with thick, healthy bushes and occasional wildflowers at the forefront, juxtaposing the damaged area to the left.\n\nIn the background, several industrial elements are visible. There are cranes and other construction machinery situated on the far side of the water, indicating ongoing industrial activity. A large electrical pylon, carrying high-voltage lines, stands prominently, underlining the industrial theme of the landscape. Overall, the setting suggests a contrast between nature and industrial development, with a hint of environmental issues likely tied to the presence of industry.","title":"Construction of solid waste disposal settling tank on Simms Bayou.
