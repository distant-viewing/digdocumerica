{"path":"553633.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photo captures an atmospheric and somewhat eerie scene within a forested environment. A solitary vehicle, echoing the form of a traditional sedan, navigates a winding dirt road amidst a landscape visibly affected by fire or similar devastation. The car is white and is located near the center of the image, moving away from the viewpoint along a track muddied and slick with moisture, evident from the sheen on its surface.\n\nThe surrounding trees are dark and skeletal, stripped of foliage, indicating recent or ongoing exposure to extreme conditions like fire. The overall tone of the image is a somber palette of blues and greys, and a haze or mist, possibly steam or smoke, faintly rises from the ground, contributing to a sense of dampness and residual heat.\n\nThe ground is covered with what appears to be a mixture of ash and mud, enhancing the post-apocalyptic mood of the scene. The lighting suggests either dawn or dusk, given the limited natural light filtered through the haze and the trees, casting elongated shadows across the road.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a moment of solitude and the grim aftermath of environmental destruction, with the vehicleâ€™s journey adding a human element to the desolate landscape.","title":"In August 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain range near Sonora, California. Salvage operations on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly. A water truck is used to dampen down the thick carpet of soot and ashes.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["554805","542925","557116","553007","549002","542862","547771","547659","554832","549107","545739","554810","554131","547979","555199","547535"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["fire","haze","dampness","ash","echo","devastation","heat","sheen","destruction","journey"]}
