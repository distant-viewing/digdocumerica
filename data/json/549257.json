{"path":"549257.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural setting, highlighting the tranquility of agricultural life. The image is centered on a dusty, reddish dirt road that stretches from the foreground into the distance, gently curving upward and to the left, under a muted, cloudy sky. Flanking the road to the left, there's a lush green field fenced with simple wooden posts and barbed wire. Several large, brown hay bales are stacked near the bottom of the field, adding a touch of rustic workmanship to the scene.\n\nTo the right of the road, another wide, verdant field rolls gently upward, also enclosed by a similar rustic fence. The landscape is predominantly green, suggesting it's either late spring or early summer.\n\nIn the upper left quarter of the image, elevated on a small hill, there are farm buildings, including a large barn and possibly some sheds or grain silos. These structures are fairly simple and functional in design, painted in light colors that blend with the rural environment. A few trees dot the landscape around the buildings, enhancing the pastoral feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition and the soft, natural light evoke a sense of peacefulness and simplicity, characteristic of many agricultural landscapes. The image captures the beauty of rural life, untouched by the hustle and bustle of urban settings.","title":"Road leads to the Bud and John Redding ranches in Sarpy Basin.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["554819","554800","555635","547300","547316","555818","549222","549256","549261","557748","547304","555624","549235","557946","554767","545040"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["field","quarter","bale","road","hay","bustle","hustle","grain","peacefulness","silo"]}
