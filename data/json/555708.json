{"path":"555708.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking aerial view of a red fishing boat moving through a shimmering expanse of blue water. The sunlight interacts with the water around the boat in intricate patterns, casting dynamic, textured ripples across the surface of the sea. As the boat sails forward, it leaves a pronounced wake behind, characterized by a V-shaped spread of white froth mixed with darker trails in the water. This wake disrupts the uniform shimmer of the waterâ€™s surface and trails behind the boat, gradually widening as it extends further away.\n\nThe composition emphasizes the isolation of the boat in the vastness of the sea and the interplay of color and light. The boat itself is small in comparison to the vast body of water, underscoring a sense of solitude. The overall effect is a visually captivating scene that conveys a sense of motion and tranquility in a vast, open space.","title":"The \"Alaska standard\" is typical of the small old vessels which carry petroleum products (not crude oil) to coastal communities","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547674","555715","549380","545900","557813","543888","546317","550914","547276","545043","547685","545120","556911","557818","544142","552310"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","trails","wake","captivat","froth","pronounced","sea","comparison","disrupt","water"]}
