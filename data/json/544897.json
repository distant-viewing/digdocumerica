{"path":"544897.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive outdoor scene featuring a main focus on a large red sandstone formation prominently displaying the painted words \"HOLE N' THE ROCK\" in white. An arrow points rightward to a similarly marked direction reading \"Entrance 200 Ft -> Souvenirs Food\". This indicates that the rock formation likely houses a tourist attraction.\n\nThe setting includes a two-lane road that stretches horizontally across the foreground, leading the viewer’s eye toward a vehicle—a station wagon with a travel trailer attached—traveling away from the vantage point of the camera. The road is framed by small white roadside markers and sparse vegetation, typical of arid desert environments. The landscape around the formation is barren and rocky, indicative of a desert-like region, with scrub and small bushes scattered throughout. The land rises gently into hills covered with more dense vegetation in the backdrop, creating a layered effect.\n\nThe overall composition captures a moment of travel and exploration in a rugged, natural setting, positioned under a clear blue sky that suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, based on the softness of the lighting. The imagery is vivid in color, emphasizing the stark contrast between the earthy tones of the landscape and the deep blue of the sky.","title":"Sign for roadside curio shop","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545606","545605","544397","545764","545601","545804","545596","545550","544429","545749","545585","552445","545584","544903","545760","554805"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["formation","travel","desert","scrub","sandstone","imagery","arrow","attraction","softness","hole"]}
