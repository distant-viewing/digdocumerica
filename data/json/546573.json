{"path":"546573.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a bustling and complex urban scene featuring a large roadway system. Three main highways intersect, filled with dense traffic comprising various vehicles such as cars and trucks, which are either moving or parked along the roads. The curved and merging design of the road system highlights the intricate nature of urban transport infrastructure.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a red-brick building with a green rooftop, representing a more historic style of architecture, contrasting with the modern roadways. Adjacent to the roadways are several smaller structures, possibly commercial or industrial, and a part of the area is undergoing some form of construction or maintenance, noticeable by the visible equipment and materials scattered around.\n\nThe photograph also includes a body of water at the bottom, alongside which some boats are docked, indicating a nearby recreational or commercial marina. Trees and green spaces are interspersed throughout the urban environment, softening the industrial feel of the scene. \n\nOn the extreme right, a section of a large, arched stone bridge is visible, complementing the historic vibe given by the red-brick building. Overall, the composition effectively showcases a dynamic urban landscape where architectural history meets modern infrastructure demands.","title":"The Key Bridge, between Virginia and the District, crosses the Potomac at Georgetown.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546616","546689","546578","555745","546678","546574","546704","548363","546709","547770","546698","555781","546686","548358","546726","547764"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["roadway","system","demand","brick","infrastructure","marina","rooftop","history","road","vibe"]}
