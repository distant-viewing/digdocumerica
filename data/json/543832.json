{"path":"543832.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive landfill site in a scenic, rural area with striking natural beauty in the background. The landfill is cluttered with a variety of waste including paper, plastics, household items, and larger debris, spread unevenly over a muddy and uneven ground. Several people are actively engaged in the process of dumping or sorting through the garbage, although their specific activities are not entirely clear due to the distance of the shot.\n\nThere are multiple vehicles at the site—trucks and cars—some of which appear to be used for transporting the trash. These vehicles are parked intermittently around the landfill, contributing to the chaotic and busy nature of the scene.\n\nBehind the immediate ugliness of the trash heap, the landscape opens up into a vast green field, leading towards a range of majestic mountains under a dynamic sky filled with large, fluffy clouds. The contrast between the foreground—marked by human waste and activity—and the serene, untouched natural beauty in the background is stark, highlighting environmental themes and the impact of human activities on natural landscapes.","title":"Boulder County's landfill dump.
