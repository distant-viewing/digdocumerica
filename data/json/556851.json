{"path":"556851.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a view from directly above a railroad. The image shows two parallel rail tracks stretching into the distance and curving slightly to the left as they disappear into the horizon. The tracks are flanked on either side by rocky ground with sparse green vegetation.\n\nTo the right side of the tracks lies a small town or community. The foreground shows a cluster of buildings, including what appear to be houses, painted in light colors. A notable feature is a building with prominently large windows that could serve as a shop or warehouse. Visible among the structures is a parking lot or paved area where an assortment of vehicles are parked, including cars and a green tractor. One car, in particular, is a vintage model, emphasized by its rounded design and distinctive white color.\n\nThe environment around the community and the railroad appears lush with dense trees lining the background and hill areas beyond the town, suggesting this might be set in a valley. The setting suggests a quiet, possibly rural, atmosphere, highlighted by the natural greenery and modest infrastructure. The sky above is clear with ample sunlight bathing the entire scene, creating deep shadows and enhancing the contrasts within the composition.","title":"View from an amtrak passenger train enroute from harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington d.c.
