{"path":"544871.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph beautifully captures a dynamic, rushing river as it moves forcefully through a forested area. The focal point of the image is the water, depicted in vivid detail, with its surface agitated and white from the rapid flow and turbulence. The fast shutter speed of the camera freezes the motion of the water, resulting in a textured and swirling effect where the light plays across the surface, creating sparkling highlights.\n\nSurrounding the river, tall, dense evergreen trees tightly line the banks, almost as if standing guard. The trees are mostly in shadow, suggesting that this photo may have been taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon when the sunlight is not directly overhead. The undergrowth beneath the trees appears lush, and hints of sunlight dappling through the dense foliage add a touch of brightness to the otherwise darkened forest backdrop.\n\nNo people or animals are visible in the scene, adding to the untouched, pristine quality of the landscape. The setting evokes a sense of serene isolation and the raw power of nature, highlighting the riverâ€™s unbridled energy as it cuts through the tranquility of the forest. The composition and exposure balance the vibrant activity of the river with the static, calm density of the woods, offering a snapshot that is both energetic and peacefully natural.","title":"East Dallas creek","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["553855","550658","553416","542743","549550","548156","550742","550843","549442","544861","550682","544856","542844","542537","555075","546171"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["river","guard","freeze","turbulence","dapple","shutter","rush","undergrowth","darken","forest"]}
