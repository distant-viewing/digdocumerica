{"path":"548257.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph shows an indoor setting that appears to be a subway station. It captures multiple reflective surfaces created by vertical metallic columns that divide the space into several mirrored segments.\n\nIn the foreground, a woman stands prominently amidst these reflections. She is dressed in a classic style with a dark coat, light-colored scarf, and a beret, holding a patterned bag in one hand. She appears to be in mid-stride or standing still, looking forward with a watchful expression.\n\nThe background reveals more of the station environment, characterized by a bustling atmosphere. Other individuals are visible, including a person walking away in a striped shirt and another in a red outfit moving towards the platform area. The flooring is a speckled tile, extending throughout the photo, and there are signs hanging from the ceiling, possibly indicating directions or advertisements, adding a realistic touch to the setting of public transit.\n\nThe lighting in the station is fluorescent, casting a stark, even glow over the scene and enhancing the reflective quality of the metal columns. The composition of the photo, with its interplay of reflections and urban life, creates a multi-layered perspective on everyday public transportation.","title":"Herald Square subway station","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548274","556682","551886","551890","556821","556054","556815","551879","548255","551893","551887","551889","551883","556779","551895","556648"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["station","column","flooring","reflection","stride","scarf","subway","tile","transit","segment"]}
