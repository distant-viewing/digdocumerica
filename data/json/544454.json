{"path":"544454.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of devastation, likely following a disaster such as a tornado or demolition. At the forefront, a set of concrete stairs stands prominent, leading to nowhere, signifying the location of a building that used to stand there. Debris is scattered all around these stairs, consisting of broken pieces of concrete, rocks, various unidentifiable rubble, and some minor vegetation like small plants and twigs.\n\nAs the viewerâ€™s eye moves beyond the stairs, the scene of destruction extends into the middle ground of the photograph, where more scattered debris can be seen. There is a notable absence of standing structures which suggests the area has been cleared or flattened. However, in the background, intact buildings and a line of trees indicate that the impact of the destruction either lessened with distance or was localized to the foreground.\n\nThere is a grassy area towards the middle and background of the image, and several cars are visible parked along a road in the distant background, suggesting that life and daily activities continue nearby. The sky is clear and blue, which might indicate that any disaster events have passed and weather conditions have improved.","title":"Guadalupe river flood damage","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["544467","544583","544468","544463","547888","544466","553470","547598","547868","557350","544797","548742","557993","544464","547130","553556"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["stair","disaster","destruction","concrete","flatten","demolition","intact","devastation","broken","twig"]}
