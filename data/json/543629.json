{"path":"543629.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of water droplets on a plant stem, exemplifying a detailed macro shot. The focus is mainly on the slender plant stem, which appears to be a twig with a snapped or cut end. Upon this twig rest several clear, glistening water droplets of varying sizes. The water droplets are positioned along the stem and one large drop is especially noticeable dangling at the end of the stick, reflecting light and holding a microcosm within it, possibly elements of the surrounding environment.\n\nThe background is out of focus, showcasing a gentle brush of greens and darker tones, suggesting the presence of other foliage and perhaps a shaded, natural setting. This bokeh effect particularly emphasizes the sharpness and clarity of the water droplets at the forefront.\n\nThe color palette consists of earthy brown tones of the twig contrasted with the vibrant, fresh green and dark blurred shades in the background. The overall mood evoked is one of freshness and tranquility, a typical scene after rainfall or dew in a forest or garden setting, highlighting the beauty and simplicity of nature.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["558077","543565","543564","555184","555032","555044","553853","557592","547287","543623","547312","557593","551357","557625","551371","543560"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["droplet","twig","stem","end","exemplify","freshness","dangle","sharpness","dew","drop"]}
