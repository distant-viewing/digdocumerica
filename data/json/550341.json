{"path":"550341.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a natural wetland scene with various visual textures and elements. The primary focus is a body of shallow water, which is quite still, showing a reflective surface mirroring some sparse foliage and the sky. The water's edge is intricately patterned with different layers and colors of sediment and organic matter, suggesting a mixture of mud, sand, and possibly decomposing plant life, which creates an irregular mosaic of brown, beige, and off-white hues.\n\nIn the top left quarter of the image, there are many fallen branches and small logs submerged or semi-submerged in the water, creating a natural woody debris field. These branches vary in size and color, contributing to the area's rough and somewhat chaotic texture. This part of the scene is under the shadow of nearby trees, providing a darker contrast to the rest of the brighter environment.\n\nThe surrounding area is lined with clusters of trees and other vegetation, subtly reflected in the calm waters. The overall atmosphere of the scene is quiet and serene, likely situated in a secluded, possibly wild area away from human activities. The light exposure and color saturation suggest this photo was taken during daylight, possibly under partly cloudy conditions due to the soft, diffuse lighting. No human or animal presence is visible, emphasizing the untouched, natural state of the environment.","title":"Leachings from Georgia Pacific Paper Company's waste bark and chemicals pollute a tributary of the St. Croix River","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["544765","550786","554717","554603","558009","550345","545923","550788","551352","545008","545033","547589","546066","542526","546963","543561"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["quarter","decompose","mosaic","branch","matter","beige","saturation","mud","water","sediment"]}
