{"path":"552701.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, there is a young male seated in a squatting position on a stone surface. He is shirtless and wearing dark blue shorts. His hands are pressed together in front of his face, as if he is in a state of contemplation or meditation. His eyes are closed, and his expression appears serene and introspective.\n\nThe background features a large, blurry water fountain, which creates a sense of dynamic movement and possibly suggests a public or urban setting. The lighting is soft, casting gentle shadows and highlights over the subject's skin, enhancing the texture and muscular definition. The overall mood of the image is calm and introspective, emphasizing a moment of solitude and peacefulness amidst a potentially busy environment.","title":"Cooling off in one of the fountains around the Philadelphia Museum of Art","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["553281","547712","548842","551860","548291","557035","549335","542556","553504","542784","550826","552971","543503","553487","552723","556318"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["fountain","peacefulness","skin","highlight","male","contemplation","position","short","state","solitude"]}
