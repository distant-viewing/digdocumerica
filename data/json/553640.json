{"path":"553640.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image features a close-up view of what appears to be a section of a tree, likely freshly cut, displaying the inner wood and bark. The focus is on a specific area of the tree that shows a clear, horizontal cut across the trunk, revealing light-colored wood beneath the darker outer bark.\n\nA human finger points towards the freshly cut section, indicating a point of interest or perhaps demonstrating the thickness of the bark or a particular feature of the wood. The fingertip is blurred, suggesting movement or a close proximity to the camera which places it slightly out of the depth of field.\n\nThe surrounding area of the trunk features rough textures and bits of bark and wood debris, possibly from the cutting process. The background is dark and indistinct, providing a contrast that emphasizes the textures and details of the tree's surface. The lighting appears to be natural, possibly filtered through a canopy, creating a soft overall illumination with some shadows that enhance the three-dimensional effect of the grooves and textures in the wood.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora, California. Salvage operations on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly. Forester chips base of tree to inspect cambium (a protective layer between bark and inner wood). If this is damaged, tree cannot survive and will be marked to cut.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["554604","555141","553586","553587","554974","544662","557616","542749","542774","551355","557621","555001","543488","550792","554592","550703"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["bark","wood","trunk","thickness","cutting","groove","texture","finger","section","cut"]}
