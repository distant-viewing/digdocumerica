{"path":"548705.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and moody storm scene over a coastal area. The foreground features lush green foliage that appears to be part of a dense thicket or mangrove, suggesting a tropical or subtropical locale. Beyond the vegetation, a wide expanse of calm water stretches towards the horizon, its surface reflecting variants of blue and gray that blend seamlessly under the overcast sky.\n\nThe sky dominates much of the view and is filled with heavy, ominous storm clouds rolling in from the distance. These clouds are densely packed and range in color from light gray to nearly black, indicating the intensity and nearness of an approaching storm. The thick, dark clouds seem to cover most of the sky, and what might be a rain curtain can be seen in the darker sections of the storm, suggesting that rainfall is either currently happening or imminent over parts of the water.\n\nThe scene is devoid of human presence or activities, giving it a natural and untouched appeal. The overall mood is tense and expectant, with the calm seas and still foliage contrasting sharply with the turbulent sky above. The lighting is natural, possibly filtered through storm clouds, casting a subdued and cool tone over the landscape, reinforcing the impression of a typical stormy day by the sea.","title":"A stormy sky gives the camera a clear view of the clouds of silt in the waters off saddle bunch keys in the lower Florida keys silt occurs naturally in the formation of coral reefs, but the amount shown here could only be produced by the extensive dredging of the land developers","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["550291","548704","550618","547047","553857","552483","547057","550391","547793","544701","543025","544944","544570","543138","544123","548241"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["storm","cloud","mangrove","thicket","sea","happen","foliage","locale","rainfall","appeal"]}
