{"path":"551326.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The image features a serene rural scene, capturing a moment outdoors with a natural ambiance. It is dominated by lush green tones. In the foreground on the left, there is a tall tree with a dark, textured bark, providing a strong vertical element to the composition. The tree bark has visible details, highlighting its roughness and natural patterns.\n\nTo the right of the tree, prominently positioned within the frame, is a white chicken walking on the grass. The grass is tall and dense, suggestive of a less manicured, wild meadow environment. The chicken stands out against the greenery due to its bright white feathers, contrasting sharply with its surroundings. The chicken is captured in profile, showcasing its rounded body, plump with feathers, and the distinct red coloration of its comb and wattle, adding vibrant splashes of color to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, on the bottom left side, there is a rustic wooden fence post, partially out of frame. Behind this post, a wire fence can be seen, indicating the boundary of the area in which the chicken is roaming.\n\nThe background is less discernible, predominantly consisting of more greenery and possibly trees or bushes, contributing to an overall sense of seclusion and tranquility in a natural setting. The overall mood of the image is peaceful, with elements of rustic charm and simplicity.","title":"Foraging beyond the barnyard--on a grassy hillside along Route 5 near Versailles, Missouri","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["554946","554914","554927","547404","543117","549154","544484","554161","546102","550471","545040","557212","555577","551378","546154","554800"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["feather","bark","post","fence","meadow","seclusion","coloration","tree","grass","greenery"]}
