{"path":"544565.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic view with a contemporary architectural structure as the focal point. The structure features a futuristic design with multiple vertical slabs arranged symmetrically, rising to different heights, and a wrap-around circular ramp with an open guardrail system encircling it. This unique building is situated in a lush green landscape.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows a body of water, possibly a small lake or pond, reflecting some of the surroundings. Along the edges of this water body are various trees and bushes, some of which lean into the water, adding to the tranquility of the scene. The background is made up of a lightly cloudy blue sky that contrasts nicely with the greenery and structural elements.\n\nThe overall composition suggests an emphasis on a blend of nature and modern architecture, conveying a serene yet dynamic setting without any human presence visible in the shot.","title":"The Shark Valley ranger station and tower","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544561","546530","544537","546481","546464","546480","546473","546539","546460","546543","546531","555326","548870","546463","548180","546485"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["slab","ramp","guardrail","encircle","wrap","emphasis","pond","shot","height","system"]}
