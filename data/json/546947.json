{"path":"546947.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense forest setting. The composition prominently features tall, slender trees, which likely belong to species typical of a temperate or subtropical woodland. The tree trunks are predominantly straight, rising vertically with minimal branching until higher up, where a canopy of foliage begins, indicating the trees are fairly mature. The trees are abundantly covered in a greenish-brown bark, and some sunlight filtering through the canopy casts highlights and shadows across the scene, creating an interplay of light that adds a nuanced texture to the scene.\n\nThe undergrowth is lush and composed of various types of smaller plants, including some with large, rounded leaves, possibly a type of palm or similar broad-leaved plant. This vegetation at the ground level seems thick, with multiple layers of foliage, suggesting a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem. No footpaths or clearings are immediately visible, underscoring the natural, untamed quality of the forest.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is serene and somewhat shadowy, with the light predominantly coming from above and only partially penetrating the dense canopy, casting the majority of the forest floor in relative darkness compared to the sunlit upper sections of the trees.\n\nThis composition does not include any visible human activity or artificial structures, focusing entirely on the natural scenery. The image is a snapshot of a tranquil, wooded landscape, capturing the quiet and complexity of a forested area.","title":"Primeval forest on bulls island, a national game refuge","placename":"South Carolina","location":"South Carolina","nn1":["550791","554425","542725","558012","555114","555118","555116","549234","555120","553574","545488","555054","554958","554990","547011","554965"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["canopy","forest","greenish","tree","reound","type","begin","undergrowth","majority","foliage"]}
