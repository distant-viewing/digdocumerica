{"path":"550832.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil and somewhat eerie flooded woodland scene. The image captures numerous trees, standing partially submerged in water. The reflective surface of the water mirrors the trees and the patches of sky visible through the canopy, creating a serene and symmetrical visual effect.\n\nThe trees are densely gathered, showcasing various trunk sizes and some with visible root structures interacting with the water. Their bark is dark, likely wet from the watery surroundings, contributing to the somber atmosphere of the scene. The water itself is covered in patches by what appears to be duckweed or a similar type of small, free-floating aquatic plant, accentuating the green hues in the photo.\n\nIn the background, beyond the trees, more flooded areas can be seen, suggesting a large expanse of flooded woodland rather than an isolated pond or area. The light appears to be dim, either due to the time of day or overcast weather, casting an overall gloomy ambiance across the scene.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or animals in the photograph; the focus is squarely on the interaction between the natural landscape and the water. The composition leans into the natural symmetry and the contrast between the dark trunks and the lighter water and vegetation, making it a compelling depiction of a flooded forest environment.","title":"Fishing on the fox river west of montello in central Wisconsin","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["552438","552440","546066","554608","543700","554525","554717","553075","552834","550788","547011","552847","544241","552853","558009","553465"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["woodland","trunk","water","symmetry","root","flood","tree","depiction","bark","pond"]}
