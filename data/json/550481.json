{"path":"550481.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged natural landscape dominated by steep, imposing rock formations. The central feature is a narrow gorge or slot canyon with vertical or near-vertical walls that have been deeply eroded, creating a textured surface. The rock appears to be stratified, showcasing layers of sediment that have compacted over geological time periods. \n\nThe composition focuses on the vertical ascent of this rock formation, which draws the viewerâ€™s eyes upward towards a narrower opening at the top where the sky might be visible, though the sky is not prominently featured in the image. The overall color palette is deep and moody, primarily consisting of dark greys and browns, which suggests this image might have been taken under overcast lighting conditions or during a time of day when the sun does not penetrate deeply into the canyon.\n\nThere are no visible plants, animals, or human figures in this remote and harsh terrain, emphasizing the raw and uninhabited nature of the landscape. The focus and exposure are set in such a way to capture the textures and undulations of the rock surfaces, highlighting the natural beauty and the dramatic, powerful forms carved by natural processes.","title":"Detail of water eroded chimneys on north face of peak 5308 four miles east of pipeline crossing in the gorge","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["545795","550480","545805","545800","544950","555047","544745","545802","545796","544363","545792","545799","550428","545750","552890","544376"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","canyon","gorge","formation","penetrate","undulation","compact","erod","carve","time"]}
