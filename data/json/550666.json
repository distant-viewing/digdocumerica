{"path":"550666.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a serene outdoor scene featuring a man fishing at the edge of a dark, shimmering body of water, which appears to be a river or lake. The man stands towards the bottom-right side of the frame, and he is attired casually in jeans, a long-sleeve shirt, and a straw hat, hinting at warm weather or a sunny day. He is holding a fishing rod with both hands, suggesting he is either casting or retrieving the line.\n\nThe environment around the man is richly wooded, with a dense background of tall evergreen trees suggesting a remote or natural area. The trees are lush, indicating the season could be spring or summer. The water is calm, reflecting the sky and flanked by small patches of tall, wild grass, enhancing the sense of tranquility and isolation.\n\nThere's a general mood of peace and contemplation, as the man is seen from behind, focused on his activity without any visible companions or disturbances. The lighting is fairly even with the shadows indicating either a cloudy day or a time when the sun is not at its peak. The composition instills a sense of solitude and connection with nature, capturing a moment of leisure and escape.","title":"Fishing in the Androscoggin River, one mile below the bridge at Errol.
