{"path":"547653.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a desolate and devastated landscape, reminiscent of an industrial or post-disaster area. The foreground is dominated by a rough, partially destroyed asphalt road, which leads towards a barren field scattered with debris and rocks. On the road, a few elements such as a broken yellow fire hydrant, a manhole cover, and small remnants of infrastructure hint at previous human activity or urban setup. \n\nDominating the center of the image is another fire hydrant, yellow and partially shadowed, standing intact yet isolated amidst the desolation. The background features another scantily visible structure that appears to be a small white building with a gabled roof, suggesting some form of remote industrial or agricultural use. \n\nThere are no visible plants or trees thriving in the immediate vicinity, only what appears to be winter-bare trees lining the distant horizon under a clear blue sky. The overall impression is of abandonment and decay, possibly following an industrial collapse or environmental calamity. The lack of any human presence in the image enhances the feelings of isolation and neglect.","title":"Hydrant marks land cleared for housing development at point judith","placename":"Narragansett (R.I.)","location":"Narragansett, Rhode Island","nn1":["544751","555544","549119","555103","549118","547130","547979","557350","547527","555199","544060","556313","544468","544080","555597","555872"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["hydrant","fire","bare","destroy","collapse","thrive","asphalt","desolation","isolate","vicinity"]}
