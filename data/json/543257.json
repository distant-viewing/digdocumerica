{"path":"543257.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a coastal industrial scene characterized by decay and abandonment. In the foreground, a large, rusted pipe dominates the view, extending from the bottom right towards the center left of the frame, raised slightly above a cluttered mix of stones and smaller, broken pieces of metal and wood. This pipe appears aged and corroded, hinting at long-term exposure to the marine environment.\n\nAbove the main pipe, there is a makeshift platform constructed from uneven planks of wood supported by metal rods or pipes. On this platform rests an old metal bucket and what seems to be a rusted tin can, possibly used informally by workers or visitors to the site.\n\nThe background features a relatively calm sea with waves gently lapping against the rocky shore under a cloudy sky. The horizon is visible in the distance, showing a thinly populated or natural coastline that contrasts with the immediate industrial foreground.\n\nThis setting suggests a coastal industrial area that may have once served a specific utilitarian purpose but now lies neglected, facing the elements along a rugged shore. The overall mood evoked by the picture is one of nostalgia and neglect, highlighted by the natural beauty of the surrounding seascape against human-made decay.","title":"Pipeline","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543320","547581","549307","543154","543405","547622","554041","543364","547582","543359","543242","547579","551985","556324","547575","551984"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["pipe","platform","decay","metal","tin","shore","wood","nostalgia","seascape","rod"]}
