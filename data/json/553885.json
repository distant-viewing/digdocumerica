{"path":"553885.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image features a large cooling tower, typical of nuclear power plants, standing prominently in the frame against a moody sky. The cooling tower is slightly conical and tapers towards the top, characteristic of such structures designed to dissipate excess heat. The tower is grey and looms over the scene, giving a stark industrial feel to the natural landscape around it.\n\nIn the foreground, a body of water reflects the somber sky and the outline of the tower. The water is slightly rippled, indicating mild wind or movement. To the right of the cooling tower, construction activity is visible, highlighted by the presence of a tall crane and what appears to be a partially constructed building. This suggests ongoing development or maintenance work on the site.\n\nThe environment is wooded, with coniferous trees flanking the tower and construction area, blending the industrial elements with nature. The overcast sky and the dark tones of the photo contribute to a somewhat ominous atmosphere. Overall, the image captures a dynamic scene where nature and human engineering intersect, underlined by a sense of industrial progress or change.","title":"Trojan nuclear power plant on the Columbia River.
