{"path":"546110.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph portrays an aerial view of a striking landscape predominantly featuring natural textures and colors. The frame is filled with a mix of textures that appear both fluid and solid, creating an almost abstract composition. The upper two-thirds of the image display a greyish-white surface with intricate patterns resembling cracked or drying mud. This surface gleams slightly, suggesting the presence of moisture.\n\nDominating the lower third of the image is a fiery red-orange feature, which gives the impression of a spreading stain or perhaps a mineral deposit within a body of water. This vibrant area has tendrils of color extending into the surrounding lighter areas, and it reflects light, which enhances the sense of fluidity and depth. \n\nThe contrasting colors - the pale, earthy tones against the intense reds and oranges - are visually striking and may indicate different natural elements or materials. The photograph may capture a natural scene involving water bodies mixed with mineral-rich soils or areas of geothermal activity. It does not feature any human activity or man-made structures, focusing entirely on the natural geological or environmental features.","title":"Contaminated water in drainage ditch behind Pittsburg Glass Co","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["550740","552426","555553","550395","544745","543148","545799","545795","550397","553867","552420","545623","543521","555029","555885","545656"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["third","orange","fluidity","stain","deposit","mud","moisture","mineral","feature","texture"]}
