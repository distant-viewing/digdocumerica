{"path":"556463.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image provides an aerial view of a curvy road weaving through a small, densely populated valley surrounded by steep, forested hillsides. The landscape shows signs of sparse vegetation, perhaps indicating an early spring or fall season due to the lack of dense foliage on the trees. The valley consists of several residential houses, a reasonable number of which are small, closely spaced, and similarly structured. \n\nAdditionally, there are multiple large buildings that might be commercial or industrial, indicated by their larger footprints and different architectural styles compared to the homes. One large building in the central part of the image at a road junction appears to be a significant community structure, possibly a school or administration building. \n\nThere is also an area that looks like a small industrial compound, with aligned white structures that could be storage units or temporary worksite buildings. The main road that snakes through the town is bordered by sidewalks, and there are several vehicles visible, suggesting normal daily activity. \n\nVisually, the town appears to be nestled in a natural corridor, with the road providing a lifeline through it. The topography and layout suggest that this might be a small, isolated community relying significantly on the surrounding natural resources, possibly in a rural or semi-rural region. The aerial perspective allows a comprehensive view of the town's compact nature and its adaptation to the geographical constraints of the valley.","title":"Aerial view of Chattaroy, West Virginia, near Williamson showing the school near the top of the picture. There is no industry in the town. Most of the people survive on welfare, pensions, social security and black lung benefits. A few people drive to nearby Williamson to work. It is a nice and clean town.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550583","557653","543746","556469","543738","552595","548199","550558","551050","556394","553971","557651","556585","550639","558058","549116"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["valley","town","road","rely","compound","junction","corridor","adaptation","footprint","community"]}
