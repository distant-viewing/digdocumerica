{"path":"553790.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a densely built urban area alongside a coast, capturing a detailed cityscape and adjacent waterfront features. The city is densely packed with high-rise buildings, mainly featuring modern architectural stylesâ€”tall office buildings with reflective glass facades dominate the central part of the image. These skyscrapers cluster at the city's core, indicating a commercial or downtown area.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several large, rectangular and square-shaped structures projecting into the water, likely marinas or docks, lined with neatly arranged boats and surrounded by calm blue water. These docks form a geometric contrast with the natural coastline.\n\nTo the left, the cityscape transitions into a more residential or possibly mixed-use area with lower buildings, and the terrain gently rises into green hills in the far background, suggesting the outskirts of the city. Toward the horizon, the landscape flattens and extends into a broad plain filled with more buildings and urban infrastructure.\n\nThe ocean is visible on the right, meeting the coastline, and the overall lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting soft shadows and enhancing the texture of the cityscape and water surfaces.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a comprehensive view of a vibrant urban center, its interaction with a waterfront, and the interplay of natural and built environments.","title":"Hawaii--downtown, Honolulu (Oahu i)","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["549480","549505","553677","552233","553679","556947","555756","552133","553672","552231","556952","549477","548453","557462","553678","555768"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cityscape","coastline","waterfront","city","build","core","dock","flatten","marina","coast"]}
