{"path":"554957.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dense and lush forest predominantly composed of various shades of green. The image shows a variety of tree species and abundant foliage. In the foreground, large fern-like plants with arching fronds are noticeable, giving a textured appearance to the composition. The background is somewhat obscured but consists of many tree branches entangled with smaller leaves, possibly shrubs or smaller trees, adding depth to the greenery.\n\nThe forest appears rich in biodiversity and has a layered structure with darker greens at the bottom grading up to lighter greens at the top, suggesting the presence of different types of flora. The lighting suggests that the photo was taken in natural daylight, perhaps under overcast conditions due to the diffuse and soft quality of light. There are no visible human activities, pathways, or artificial structures, emphasizing the untouched and natural state of the scene. The image overall conveys a tranquil and secluded feeling, characteristic of a dense, temperate rainforest environment.","title":"Western red cedar, hemlock and vine maple growth on the west bank of the East Fork of the Humptulips River in Grays Harbor County in the Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
