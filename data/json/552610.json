{"path":"552610.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly woman standing outdoors while holding a black and white cat. The woman is wearing round glasses and has her hair neatly pulled back. She is dressed in a black dress that features white cat-shaped patterns on it, which interestingly match the cat she is holding. The woman's expression is soft and serene, looking directly at the camera.\n\nShe stands in front of a rustic background featuring the weathered logs of a wooden cabin, giving a quaint and traditional feel to the scene. The logs add a rich texture and a sense of historical context to the photograph. To her left, there are some stacked construction materials, possibly indicating ongoing work or maintenance near the site.\n\nThe overall composition reflects a harmonious and affectionate relationship between the woman and her pet, emphasized by the matching cat motifs on her dress and the actual cat in her arms. The setting invokes a sense of peaceful, rural life. Itâ€™s a simple yet poignant image that portrays the bond between human and animal, as well as hinting at a lifestyle closely connected with nature and tradition.","title":"Rifle resident mana agna was born here in 1890","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552611","546990","554051","553485","557842","553481","553484","556594","552680","556487","552398","554798","555530","548246","556176","558319"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["woman","match","log","pet","bond","tradition","motif","relationship","invoke","lifestyle"]}
