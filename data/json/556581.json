{"path":"556581.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a man and a woman sitting closely together outside, against a grey concrete wall on which a bright \"Royal Crown Cola\" advertisement poster is hung. The man is seated in a wheelchair, wearing a dark blazer, light-colored pants, and is smiling towards the camera. His right arm is resting comfortably on the wheelchairâ€™s armrest, adorned with rings on his fingers.\n\nThe woman, seated to his right but slightly turned towards him, is wearing a white blouse adorned with colorful patches, dark pants, and red open sandals. She has dark, shoulder-length hair and is wearing glasses. She appears to be engaging in a moment of personal connection with the man, possibly speaking to him or simply enjoying the moment together.\n\nVisible in the background to the right side of the image, there's a blurry hint of a curtain or some other fabric, suggesting that this scene may be adjacent to a doorway or window. The overall ambiance is informal and intimate, depicting a moment of leisure and companionship.","title":"Jack and della mae smith in front of the beer joint he operates in Rhodell, West Virginia, near Beckley","placename":"Rhodell (W.
