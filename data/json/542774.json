{"path":"542774.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a textured surface that appears to be the bark of a tree. The focus is primarily on a particular area where there is a visible accumulation of some sap or resin, which seems to be exuding from the tree bark. This sap is a lighter, whitish color, contrasting starkly with the predominantly dark brown color and rough texture of the bark.\n\nScattered across the surface of the bark and partially embedded in the sap are several small, rounded objects. These objects are dark, possibly black or brown, and could be seeds, small fruits, or some type of insect.\n\nThe depth of field in the image is shallow, with the central area of focus on the sap and the immediate surrounding texture sharply detailed, while the periphery gradually blurs into the background, emphasizing the detailed textures in the central focal area. The overall composition invokes a sense of natural detail and the intricate interactions that occur within a tree's ecosystem.","title":"Cryptolaemus lady beetle being used to desTroy infestation of comstock mealy bug","placename":"Porterville (Calif.)","location":"Porterville, California","nn1":["554986","551355","544662","553586","554974","557616","553587","545288","550703","554592","557169","542749","555181","555188","545292","557621"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","seed","exud","insect","fruit","periphery","texture","embed","objects","invoke"]}
