{"path":"554436.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph shows a small cabin or shelter, semi-hidden among dense trees in a forest setting. The cabin has an octagonal shape and features a moss-covered roof, indicating it may have been there for some time and/or is in a moist environment. The moss gives the roof a green coloring that blends smoothly with the natural surroundings. The roof also appears to be made of shingled tiles. Some of the shingles show wear or aging.\n\nThe walls of the cabin are dark, possibly made of wood, with several rectangular windows. The sunlight filters through the trees, casting light and shadow patterns across the scene, enhancing the serene and somewhat secluded look of the place. The trees around are slim, and the ground is covered with fallen leaves and small plants, suggesting that the season is either fall or spring.\n\nNo people or animals are visible in the shot, focusing entirely on the cabin and its natural context. The setting suggests a tranquil retreat or a neglected structure in a forest area. The atmosphere conveyed is one of peacefulness and seclusion, far from urban disturbances.","title":"Summer cottage with moss-grown roof and stone chimney.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["555231","554438","554556","554696","557600","554401","558102","549193","543587","554084","551076","557691","554440","555295","554786","543350"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cabin","moss","roof","coloring","hide","retreat","shingle","tile","seclusion","forest"]}
