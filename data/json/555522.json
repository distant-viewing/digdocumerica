{"path":"555522.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a lush, plant-filled urban balcony set against a backdrop of skyscrapers, capturing an essence of both natural beauty and city life. The balcony itself is tightly packed with a variety of green plants and colorful flowers, all in numerous pots of different sizes and shapes. Some plants are placed on the balcony floor, while others are elevated on stands or hang from the railings, creating a multilevel green space.\n\nThere is a person dressed in a vibrant red shirt and dark trousers, standing near the corner of the balcony and tending to the plants. The person appears engaged in the activity, possibly watering or pruning the plants.\n\nThe balcony floor features visually striking red mats that cover most of the visible area, contributing to the vibrant color scheme. There's a small round table near the foreground with a yellow tabletop on which a pair of sunglasses and a magazine or book rest, suggesting leisure or a break.\n\nIn the background, beyond the confines of the balcony, numerous buildings with various architectural styles and heights can be seen under a clear blue sky, which suggests a bustling urban environment. The overall atmosphere of the image blends elements of vibrant, personal living space with the expansive, somewhat distant cityscape.","title":"Apartment terrace garden of a family at 170 west end avenue in New York city","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555523","551685","551625","551626","551627","551755","551705","546795","551743","550119","557266","551628","551649","551777","550764","548442"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["balcony","plant","floor","confines","magazine","mat","pots","ten","strik","styles"]}
