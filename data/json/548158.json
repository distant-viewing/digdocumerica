{"path":"548158.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures two informational signs positioned against a natural lakeside backdrop. The left sign, leaning slightly and mounted on a short post, states \"NO PARKING BETWEEN SIGNS\" and features some weathering and apparent age. Adjacent to it, a taller and more upright sign reads \"USE LITTER BARRELS KEEP IDAHO CLEAN,\" promoting environmental cleanliness.\n\nBoth signs are positioned near a large trash receptacle, partially visible at the bottom left of the frame, which displays an upside-down label indicating its purpose for litter. The background features a serene view of a beautiful lake with calm water reflecting a clear blue sky. Densely wooded hills rise from the far side of the lake under the expansive sky.\n\nThe image, set under bright daylight, uses natural colors with a high contrast that emphasizes the signs in the foreground against the picturesque, natural landscape of Idaho. The scene not only conveys a message of environmental conservation but also showcases the tranquil beauty of the location.","title":"On Coeur d'Alene lake, evidence that littering rules are sometimes obeyed","placename":"Coeur d'Alene (Idaho)","location":"Coeur d'Alene, Idaho","nn1":["554567","550688","555385","545298","544813","554483","544177","553729","554119","545517","547992","543552","546805","546386","547854","553669"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","cleanliness","down","lake","clean","promote","weathering","conservation","lakeside","position"]}
