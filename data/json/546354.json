{"path":"546354.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up scene involving a hands-on activity, likely related to some form of aquatic life handling or study. An individual (only the hands and part of the arms are visible) holds a small scoop made of paper or a light material over an open jar. The jar has a label on it with handwritten text that reads \"5 shrimp,\" suggesting that the jar either previously held or is intended to hold five shrimp. The hand is positioned as if reaching in or taking out something small, possibly a shrimp, focusing intently on the task.\n\nThe jars, including the one being interacted with and others nearby, are housed in a sturdy frame structure painted in a vivid green color, which gives a bright, lively look to the setting. One of the jars next to the one being accessed appears to be empty, while a few others might contain water or other substances not directly visible from this angle.\n\nThe environment suggests a controlled setting like a laboratory, educational setting, or an exhibit where specimens such as shrimp are possibly displayed, studied, or handled for educational purposes. The person interacting with the jars appears methodical and is perhaps conducting an experiment, feeding, or sorting the contents related to the study or care of shrimp.","title":"Mobile lab of the Southeast Water Laboratory in Athens, GA. The biologist is conducting a static bioassay test on shrimp that have been exposed to industrial waste. This is part of a study of the continuous fishkill in Escambia Bay.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546353","546364","546350","546309","546289","543916","543905","546270","546308","546279","546292","553657","549342","549061","549339","542737"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["jar","study","one","hand","scoop","specimen","exhibit","experiment","other","laboratory"]}
