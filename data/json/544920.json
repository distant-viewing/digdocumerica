{"path":"544920.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a person examining a geological formation in a striking outdoor natural setting. The individual, who is squatting, appears to be engaged in either collecting samples or conducting some type of field study. They are equipped with a geological hammer, often used to breakdown or collect rocky samples, and they are holding a clipboard, possibly for taking notes or recording observations.\n\nThe setting itself is quite dramatic and visually striking. The scene is situated under a large overhanging rock formation, with vibrant reddish-brown hues dominating the rock, suggesting an iron-rich composition like sandstone or similar sedimentary rock. The curvature of the overhang creates a natural alcove, providing a shaded area where the person is working. There is a noticeable contrast in color where moisture or different mineral content has darkened parts of the rock surface, adding diversity to the textures and colors in the scene.\n\nThe ground beneath the overhang is sandy and covered in tracks or patterns that could be from water flow or movement of smaller rocks and sediments. The patterns in the sand add an interesting textural layer to the photographâ€™s foreground.\n\nIn the middle ground, beneath the span of the rock overhang, another stretch of this natural environment is visible, showing more of the sandy ground and a continuation of the rock formations, which recede in layers emphasizing the depth and scale of the area. The distant background under the shelter of the overhang is darker and less defined, which might suggest a deeper cavity or another intriguing geological feature. \n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights the rich textures and colors of the rock formation and seems to integrate the person smoothly into their environment, emphasizing a sense of exploration and interaction with the natural world.","title":"Escalante Canyon","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["545567","545571","544898","543802","544341","544931","558083","554410","543838","544085","545697","545608","544902","558078","545592","551233"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["overhang","rock","formation","sample","person","recording","clipboard","layer","sandstone","curvature"]}
