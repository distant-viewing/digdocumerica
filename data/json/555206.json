{"path":"555206.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph contains a striking silhouette caught against an evening or morning sky. The dominant feature on the right side of the image is a dark, jagged silhouette of a steep cliff or rock formation. On the cliff's edge, there appears to be a growth of vegetation, possibly shrubs or a small tree, its roots and branches starkly outlined against the sky.\n\nThe background sky is dramatic, with fluffy, dense clouds scattered across it, tinted with shades of blue and grey, suggesting an overcast day with breaks in the clouds allowing some light to pass through. On the left side and near the center of the image, a region of the sky has a lighter, possibly golden hue, which could be where the sun is positioned behind the clouds, causing a diffused glow.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moody, natural landscape scene likely taken during dusk or dawn, emphasizing the contrast between the earthy solidity of the cliff and the ethereal, transient quality of the sky. The photograph evokes a sense of solitude and the grandeur of nature.","title":"Exposed tree roots are silhouetted on an eroded hillside in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557591","544359","543127","544392","544376","545775","550428","550429","545375","544363","555140","550521","544944","544123","545907","555592"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cliff","cloud","silhouette","root","pass","tint","cause","grandeur","sky","growth"]}
