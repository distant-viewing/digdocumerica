{"path":"558013.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures the overgrown remains of a structure, possibly an old building or wall, that is enveloped by nature. The main focus is on a long, concrete wall that stretches from the left to the right side of the frame. The surface of the wall is mottled and stained, showing signs of wear and the passage of time. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting soft, patterned shadows across the surface of the wall.\n\nTo the left and foreground of the image, a large tree with a thick trunk stands close to the wall. Its bark is rough, and its branches extend out of the frame. The area is thick with undergrowth, including small plants with broad leaves and various smaller trees and branches that add a sense of depth and density to the scene.\n\nThe background is a mixture of light and shadow, with the dense foliage partially obscuring whatever lies beyond. The photograph conveys a sense of quiet and solitude, emphasizing the interaction between the man-made structure and the encroaching natural environment. This creates a mood that is both serene and a little melancholic, highlighting themes of decay, the passage of time, and the enduring power of nature.","title":"Bed of the Ohio-Erie Canal located in Stumpy Basin is overgrown with trees and vegetation, northeast of Peninsula, Ohio near Cleveland. The canal carried heavy commerce between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi river systems between 1833 and 1913 when a flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business. The valley now is part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located in a 20-mile stretch between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["557997","551330","546971","552101","554565","558010","551329","547518","557995","551344","544468","551328","543198","544281","557140","552550"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["wall","passage","branch","remain","undergrowth","time","bark","density","left","mixture"]}
