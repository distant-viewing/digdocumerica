{"path":"555962.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a grand railway station. The interior is characterized by its architectural elegance, featuring curved ceilings, grand arches, and detailed wall moldings. The overall atmosphere is somewhat dimly lit, imparted with a moody, nostalgic ambiance by ambient lighting and possibly the time of day.\n\nIn the foreground, a group of elderly travelers are seated on longitudinal benches that are dark and glossy, possibly made of wood or a similar material. They appear to be waiting, with some engaged in conversation, while others look contemplative. The travelers have suitcases beside them, indicating they are either awaiting a train's arrival or departure.\n\nAbove them hangs a large, ornate chandelier with multiple light elements, adding a touch of grandeur to the setting. It provides a soft illumination that highlights the texture of the walls and the ceiling.\n\nThe background is characterized by a large, arched doorway that leads to other parts of the station. Through the arch, more of the station is visible, along with a few more people in the distance, suggesting the vastness and busy nature of the place.\n\nFurthermore, the image has a slight graininess that suggests it could have been taken on film, adding to its historical or archival feeling.","title":"Amtrak passengers waiting for passenger trains in the interior of the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal, which was built for the 1932 Summer Olympics in that California city. Shops, stores, and offices will be added to the station's interior. Some of the terminals will be refurbished nationwide, and others will be replaced with new facilities.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556024","556131","556828","556122","556686","556069","555963","556680","556679","556070","556055","556049","556648","556103","556073","555960"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["traveler","station","arch","ceiling","arrival","graininess","await","suitcase","molding","departure"]}
