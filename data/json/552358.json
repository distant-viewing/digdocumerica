{"path":"552358.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up of a person's hands holding a white electronic device from VIZ Manufacturing Co., based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The device appears to be mounted on a stand that is designed to be adjusted at various angles. It has a rectangular body with buttons and input ports that suggest it could be some type of measurement or monitoring equipment. There is minimal labeling visible apart from the manufacturer's details. The background of the photo is softly focused, showing what seems to be an outdoor setting with parts of trucks and red agricultural machinery under a clear sky, suggesting this might be a working environment, perhaps a farm or an industrial site. The lighting indicates it is either early morning or late afternoon, given the warm tone and low angle of the sunlight.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["553907","549625","548879","557829","542663","546269","555374","555348","547740","548450","551595","542661","546283","542765","558371","542662"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["device","angle","measurement","stand","close","port","button","up","farm","truck"]}
