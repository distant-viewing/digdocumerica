{"path":"547035.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image depicts a dramatic and somewhat eerie scene at a beach where multiple cars have been abandoned and partially submerged in seawater. The photograph shows at least six older model cars that are heavily corroded and damaged, indicating they have been exposed to the elements for an extended period. These cars are scattered haphazardly along the shoreline, with some vehicles partially buried in sand and others more exposed with waves washing around them.\n\nThe beach itself is pebbly with scattered debris, including pieces of wood and smaller stones, suggesting recent storm activity or neglect. The background is dominated by a clear sky and a calm sea extending to the horizon, which casts a sparkling reflection of sunlight on the water, contrasting sharply with the dilapidation in the foreground. The sun is positioned high, indicating it might be around midday.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, combined with the condition and placement of the cars, evokes a sense of abandonment and the enduring impact of natural forces on human-made objects. There is no sign of people present in the scene, enhancing the feeling of isolation and desolation.","title":"Aftermath of severe storm that caused flooding in Zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547923","547132","546173","547484","546318","547601","543680","547835","547481","547911","555850","555849","548752","552073","547869","544433"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["car","beach","placement","storm","midday","desolation","force","abandonment","neglect","sand"]}
