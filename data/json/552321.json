{"path":"552321.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a moment in outdoor recreational fishing. In the image, two individuals are actively engaged in handling fishing equipment. One of the persons, predominantly in the foreground but slightly out of focus, is holding a large fishing net. This net is hoisted upward, and a sizable fish, seemingly a trout or similar species, is suspended inside the net, indicating a successful catch.\n\nThe background is out of focus but features a brilliant blue sky with minimal cloud cover, suggesting a clear, sunny day. The lighting conditions, with bright sunlight, enhance the silhouettes of the individuals and the sparkling details of the wet net and fish.\n\nBoth individuals are dressed in cold-weather attire, with the person holding the net wearing a cap, suggesting that the setting might be in a cooler climate or during a cooler part of the year. The overall composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on the action of lifting the net with the catch, and the clear outdoor environment, portrays a moment of triumph in a fishing adventure.","title":"Fishing for true cod in southern Puget Sound near Point Defiance.
