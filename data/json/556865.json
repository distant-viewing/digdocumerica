{"path":"556865.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph features a man operating a large, complex piece of machinery, likely related to railway maintenance or construction. The man is seated within the structural framework of the machine, surrounded by numerous levers, gears, and mechanical components that appear weathered and greasy. He is dressed in a workman's outfit comprising of a denim-like jumpsuit and a safety helmet. The background behind him is slightly blurred, but it hints at an outdoor setting with trees and possibly a building that may be part of a larger industrial or construction site.\n\nThe machinery itself has a heavy duty and rugged look, with visible chains, metal frames, and hydraulic or pneumatic systems suggesting its use in tasks requiring significant power and precision. His posture and hand placement on one of the levers suggest that he is either operating the equipment or adjusting settings. The setting conveys a sense of industrial activity, possibly related to railroad track laying or maintenance. The lighting and the color saturation give the image a slightly dated quality, suggesting that it may have been taken several decades ago.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way repair worker on a machine used to position the rails that are being replaced near Culpeper, Virginia. The company had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working throughout Southern's 10,531-mile system. On a good day, when a crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of quarter-mile-long sections of track.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556861","556892","556315","556901","556320","544379","552112","556866","556771","542497","558379","556875","556871","556187","544835","555954"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["lever","jumpsuit","maintenance","machinery","construction","precision","placement","railroad","saturation","duty"]}
