{"path":"547172.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene along a coastline, perhaps during sunrise or sunset, as evidenced by the deep, vivid colors in the sky. Multiple smokestacks emit large plumes of smoke, contributing to a dense and dramatic cloud formation above the facility. These clouds vary in color from soft pink to darker shades, possibly due to the lighting at the time of day and the smoke's interaction with the atmosphere.\n\nThe industrial facility includes several large structures, such as silos, conveyor systems, and possibly processing plants, visible in the foreground against the coastal backdrop. There appears to be a heavy industrial operation, likely involving manufacturing or processing materials, given the infrastructure and smoke emissions.\n\nThe foreground is composed of a rough, wavy sea, which adds a natural element contrasting with the man-made industrial complex. The overall composition divides the image into layers of sea, industry, and sky, each distinctly colored yet interconnected through the environmental impact depicted. The photograph has a somewhat haunting quality due to the pollution visible and the stark contrast between natural beauty and industrial activity.","title":"Steel mill waste along the southern shore of lake Michigan","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547084","544684","544173","550821","544696","547539","545446","545987","544708","550344","547090","551026","542999","545268","552188","545438"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","haunt","sea","interconnect","facility","pink","conveyor","silo","cloud","sunrise"]}
