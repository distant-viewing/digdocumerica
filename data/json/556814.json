{"path":"556814.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a subway station, depicting several people interacting near the doors of a graffiti-tagged subway car. The subway car, featuring prominent graffiti and a somewhat tarnished exterior, is central to the image, suggesting an urban setting likely from an earlier decade, judging by the style of clothing and the overall atmosphere.\n\nThere are multiple people in the shot, appearing to be either waiting to board or just alighting from the subway. On the left side of the image, a group of individuals is seen up close by the door of the subway car. This group includes a tall man speaking to a woman in the foreground. The woman is dressed in light summer clothing, and she stands facing a child who is somewhat obscured by her position. Another woman, with her hand almost touching the man’s shoulder, is looking into the subway car, whereas another person partially obscured and facing away from the camera is also part of this group.\n\nOn the right, there is a line of people waiting alongside the subway car. They are dressed in typical casual and formal mixed attire that might suggest a period setting possibly from the 1970s or 1980s—marked by a man wearing a blazer and another in a button-up shirt with high-waisted trousers. These individuals seem to be waiting patiently, possibly observing the activity around the subway car’s doors or just casually conversing among themselves.\n\nThe overall composition and the slightly washed-out color tones evoke a gritty, retro aesthetic typical of urban public transportation settings in past decades. The environment appears dimly lit, likely underground, with artificial lighting casting a soft glow on the scene.","title":"Passengers boarding a Lexington Avenue line subway car operated by the New York City Transit Authority. The 232-mile system is the longest in the world and is of crucial importance to the city. In 1970 it carried 2.1 million persons daily which amounted to 47 percent of the work force. Despite this importance, New York City voters have refused to authorize any new funds for more improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be raised to cover operation costs.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556652","548261","556653","556811","556682","556779","548253","556665","556774","556780","556660","548265","556813","554325","556821","556819"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","car","wait","graffiti","door","decade","group","woman","clothing","retro"]}
