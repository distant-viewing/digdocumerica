{"path":"553870.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a grassy outdoor area scattered with numerous old and rusty bicycles and tricycle parts. The setting is unkempt with visible patches of soil and clumps of grass interspersed with clusters of yellow dandelion flowers. Several wheels and frames lie abandoned on the ground, some upright, others overturned. \n\nThe bicycle parts vary in size and type, suggesting a mix of children's tricycles and bicycles. None of the bicycles or tricycles are intact; most are missing wheels or other components. There are also some unrelated objects visible, such as a vacuum cleaner out of context with the rest of the scene.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred but hints at a rural or semi-rural landscape with no buildings or people in sight. The focus is on the discarded and broken bike parts, creating a sense of abandonment and disrepair. The image evokes a poignant or nostalgic feeling, perhaps reminiscing about childhood or the passage of time.","title":"Near a recreational area on the seekonk river.  (from the sites exhibition.
