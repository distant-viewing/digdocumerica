{"path":"551848.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant sidewalk café scene. There are two women seated at the forefront at a round mosaic-tiled table. The woman on the left, with a pink dress and sunglasses, her hair styled in a bob, is calmly seated with crossed legs, an elbow on the table, and her purse on the ground beside her. The woman on the right is wearing a patterned shirt and has her hair in a perm; she's animatedly holding a conversation, gesturing with her hands.\n\nAround them, other patrons, men and women, are engaged in various activities: conversing, reading, and enjoying the café ambiance. The café is lined with intricate white metal chairs, and behind the patrons is the façade of a building with classic European architectural elements and large arched openings along its length.\n\nIn the background, the street is bustling with people walking by, and further in the distance, a grand European-style building with spires is visible under a clear, deep blue sky. The scene appears lively yet relaxed, typical of a European city's outdoor café culture, bathed in sunlight.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
