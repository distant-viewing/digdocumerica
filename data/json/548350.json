{"path":"548350.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a large landfill area where waste management activities are ongoing. The image features a vast expanse of scattered refuse covering the land area, which appears muddy and uneven. Central to the scene are three heavy machinery vehicles engaged in managing the waste. To the left, there is one machine with an open box bed, possibly dumping more waste onto the pile. The other two machines towards the right look like bulldozers; they appear to be spreading or compacting the garbage.\n\nThe background shows a relatively barren landscape with sparse vegetation. The colors in the image are a bit faded, suggesting that the photograph may be older or taken under overcast weather conditions, adding a bleak, grim aesthetic to the scene. The overall composition captures the scale of waste human societies generate and the ongoing efforts to manage it in a contained environment.","title":"Dumping area of New York City's Sanitation Department at Fresh Kills, Staten Island.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546231","543821","546235","550252","549936","546250","546246","543828","548210","549794","549943","546251","546257","546238","548322","546234"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["waste","machine","refuse","landfill","bulldozer","garbage","bed","box","bit","effort"]}
