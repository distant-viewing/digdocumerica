{"path":"549835.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph shows an intricate and shadowy collection of lines and shapes projected against a semi-transparent curtain, creating a silhouette effect. The primary elements depicted appear to be television antennas and their associated elements, such as vertical and horizontal rods and various cross-linked elements, which form a complex and somewhat chaotic lattice. \n\nThe background of the image is a softly lit curtain marked with delicate patterns that might suggest light passing through a window shade or glass with a textured surface, contributing to the gentle diffusion of light in the composition. This lighting and the curtain's texture add a dreamy quality to the image, focusing more on the abstracted play of light and shadow rather than on clearly defined objects.\n\nThe lower section of the image reveals a darker, solid horizontal silhouette that hints at the edge of a building or a window frame through which the photograph has been taken. The overall composition is abstract, emphasizing geometric forms and the interplay between light and shadow, evoking a quiet, contemplative mood.","title":"TV antennas at sunset, Upper Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555020","549827","544012","542766","546389","557310","555714","553883","557581","549805","553839","549880","547763","553226","546156","549826"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["curtain","diffusion","television","silhouette","lattice","antenna","light","rod","window","collection"]}
