{"path":"545473.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a natural scene featuring a narrow, slightly meandering creek surrounded by lush greenery and eroded banks. The creek, filled with murky water, exhibits few floating debris pieces reflecting a possibly stagnant flow. Its banks are notably steep and composed of deep orange-brown earth, exposing the soilâ€™s clay-based characteristics. The vegetation enclosing the creek consists predominantly of dense trees and various shrubs, likely part of a woodland area.\n\nIn the upper section of the photograph, there's a glimpse of two individuals along the top edge of the creek bank. They are slightly blurred due to the focus on the creek itself, suggesting they might be observing or inspecting the waterway or its surrounding environment. They add a human element to the otherwise natural landscape.\n\nThe photograph has a rich, moody color palette dominated by greens and earth tones, creating a sense of tranquility and isolation from urban settings. The composition focuses on the contrast between the lush vegetation and the eroded, bare earth, underlining potential themes of natural beauty and environmental degradation. The careful framing and natural light highlight both the serenity and the raw vulnerability of the environment depicted.","title":"A polluted creek bordering Route 269 north of Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["553434","546126","547487","551351","546896","555211","553427","546922","550351","557736","549641","552055","550717","554406","544470","552023"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["creek","bank","earth","clay","vulnerability","serenity","characteristic","degradation","framing","waterway"]}
