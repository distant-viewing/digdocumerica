{"path":"546542.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a large, elongated building with a series of regular, vertical window structures extending across its façade. The building is likely a significant, possibly governmental or institutional structure judging from its large size and stern architectural style. Its exterior seems to be made of concrete, with a flat roof that includes some mechanical equipment visible, suggesting functional or industrial usage. \n\nThe viewpoint of the photographer places the building partially obscured behind the dense, sunlit foliage of a tree in the foreground, giving the composition a natural frame and a sense of depth. The leaves are sharply defined against the skyline, with light filtering through them, creating patterns of light and shadow. The building itself appears in the background under a clear blue sky, indicating it might be a day with good weather.\n\nThe contrasts between nature and architecture, the play of light and shade, and the perspective looking up slightly at the building give the image a dynamic quality, while also conveying a sense of the building’s dominance in its environment.","title":"Cummins Engine Company main plant, designed by Harry Weese","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546481","546539","548866","546473","556174","546464","546456","546460","546491","546468","553743","548649","546531","542593","546702","546485"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["building","dominance","photographer","filtering","usage","façade","concrete","viewpoint","play","exterior"]}
