{"path":"544969.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts two men, who appear to be conversing in a construction site setting. Both men are wearing uniforms that suggest they might be officials or supervisors, possibly associated with park or forest services, indicated by one of the men wearing a patch on his sleeve with a logo resembling a bird over a landscape. The uniforms are similar in style: tan, button-down shirts with darker tan, flat caps.\n\nThe man on the right faces the camera with a serious expression. He is older, with features that indicate weariness or concern. His cap is positioned forward over his eyes, which adds to his intense appearance. The younger man on the left is shown in profile, smiling slightly as he looks at the older man, suggesting a friendly or respectful interaction.\n\nThe background shows an extensive construction site with a large, open pit lined with wood and steel reinforcements. The pit is in various stages of development, filled with concrete and steel rods protruding from the bases. In the distant background, there are workers and heavy machinery active in the area. Further back still, forested hills under a clear blue sky frame the construction site, indicating the location might be in a rural or forested area. This outdoor setting is bright with sunlight casting vivid contrasts of shadow and light across the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of oversight or inspection, conveying a sense of authority combined with the diligence and cooperation necessary in such large-scale outdoor projects.","title":"Fish hatchery on the Quinault Indian Reservation","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542546","542607","555563","556335","543651","547987","553606","542547","549947","547382","556864","556903","556868","554444","546824","556320"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["pit","site","man","steel","construction","uniform","official","reinforcement","oversight","cap"]}
