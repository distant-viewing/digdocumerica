{"path":"552776.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph features a lime green, compact car (labeled as a GM model) with a hatchback design, seen from the rear at a slightly tilted, upward angle. The hatchback of the car is propped open, revealing three men seated inside the car facing away from the viewer, appearing engaged in a demonstration or discussion. Outside and standing by the car, another man is observed in a suit and tie, his attention directed towards the open hatch and the occupants within. \n\nThe car is adorned with a white cross decal centered on the hatch, suggesting that the vehicle may be equipped for or involved in some form of special service or testing. The license plate of the car indicates \"MICHIGAN - GREAT LAKE STATE.\"\n\nThe setting around the car is a parking lot area with visible pavement and a curb. Adjacent to the scene is a building with a contemporary design, featuring a dark roof and partial brick walls. The sky overhead is overcast, lending a moody atmosphere to the setting, and despite the outdoor location, there are no visible natural landscapes or other distractions from the central activity around the car.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
