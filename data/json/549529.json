{"path":"549529.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and dynamic construction scene at what appears to be near a large body of water, possibly by a waterfall. The image shows a group of workers dressed in yellow safety gear, including helmets and jackets. They are dispersed along a maze of temporary wooden walkways and platforms that snake across and around rugged terrain featuring rocky outcrops and water channels.\n\nThe water, appearing powerful and foamy white, contrasts with the solid dark rocks and the brown hues of the wooden structures. Some sections of water are in motion, captured as they splash against the rocks or flow past the construction area, which contributes to an atmosphere of intense natural force juxtaposed with human endeavor.\n\nMist or spray rises from where the water meets the obstacles, softening the scene with a haze that partially obscures the view in some areas, adding a sense of the water's brisk movement and energy.\n\nThe workers seem to be engaged in various construction-related activities, possibly building or maintaining the wooden infrastructure. Their presence in the challenging and potentially hazardous environment underscores a theme of human interaction with and adaptation to powerful natural elements.\n\nThe composition and perspective of the photo, likely taken from an elevated position, make for a compelling visual narrative that highlights both the grandeur of the natural environment and the intricacies of human engineering and labor in such a demanding setting.","title":"Looking down on \"Cave of the Winds,\" at the base of the cliffs on Goat Island between the American and Canadian Niagara Falls from this viewing stage, visitors--protected by yellow waterproof clothing--get a head-on view of the central, or \"Bridal Veil\" American Falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["553392","545635","553375","556940","547989","545648","545657","545631","546252","546929","555795","545661","553380","547218","553923","553924"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","obstacle","worker","water","intricacy","adaptation","outcrop","rock","spray","endeavor"]}
