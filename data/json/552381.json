{"path":"552381.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts two men inside a vehicle, most likely a bus, focused on their respective tasks. The individual on the left, wearing a plaid yellow and black shirt and dark-framed glasses, is engrossed in writing on a clipboard that holds a blue sheet possibly filled with data or logs. The other man, on the right, is driving the vehicle. He is wearing a light green shirt and khaki pants, looking ahead attentively while his hands are on the steering wheel.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle shows a spartan design typical of industrial or commercial use, including a simple dashboard with essential controls and large windows that provide a view of an urban setting outside, displaying some buildings and a clear road.\n\nThe expression and attire of the individuals, along with the simplicity of the vehicleâ€™s cabin, suggest a work-oriented environment, perhaps part of their job routine which involves travel and record keeping. The ambiance shows a blend of concentration and normal daytime activity, indicated by natural lighting and the casual attire of the men.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["556741","556747","548999","556086","556756","556748","556739","557913","556789","556752","557830","549798","548272","556797","557855","556113"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["vehicle","record","job","dashboard","clipboard","khaki","datum","steering","sheet","routine"]}
