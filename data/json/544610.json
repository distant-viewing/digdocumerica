{"path":"544610.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a fairly unique and interesting scene where an older, large propeller-driven airplane is mounted atop tall metal stilts, elevated above a two-story building. The airplane, an older model with a rounded nose and multiple windows along its fuselage, bears faded markings and shows some signs of weathering on its exterior.\n\nThe underlying building appears to be a mixture of utilitarian and mid-20th-century architectural styles, featuring a flat roof, multiple row windows, and a simple fa√ßade. The lower part of the building has several doors and additional windows. The exterior walls are painted in a pale green and beige, with the staircases visible on the left side leading to the upper floor.\n\nThe surroundings are characterized by a bright, sandy ground, likely indicating a coastal or semi-tropical location. Sparse vegetation can be seen towards the horizon, and the sky is mostly clear with some cumulus clouds indicating fair weather. The overall setting and the composition suggest that this might be an aeronautical museum, educational facility, or a similarly themed venue, designed to attract attention with its distinct display of an airplane. The presence of the airplane on stilts above the building certainly makes it a striking feature within likely an otherwise ordinary setting.","title":"Super Constellation fuselage displayed above building deep in Everglades","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548447","544491","542496","548484","548469","548446","548448","546178","548485","553888","545221","545935","542507","542577","544606","542499"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["airplane","stilt","museum","propeller","window","cumulus","nose","venue","staircase","building"]}
