{"path":"546388.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene marina scene with multiple boats moored closely together on calm waters. The boats vary in size and design but primarily include motorboats with enclosed cabins and raised flybridges. Each boat has visible hulls and superstructures mostly in shades of white, with some featuring accents in colors such as yellow and blue.\n\nIn the foreground, the shoreline is visible with scattered rocks and some debris, suggesting a low tide. The water reflects the boats and the clear blue sky above, creating mirror-like images on the surface and enhancing the tranquility of the setting.\n\nFarther to the back, a few poles stand in the water, possibly part of a disused pier or docking structure. In the distance behind the boats, there is the far shore lined with trees and vegetation under a partly cloudy sky, giving a hint of a natural landscape beyond the immediate vicinity of the marina.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is of a peaceful, bright day ideal for boating, painted with vivid blues from the sky and the reflections in the water, contrasted by the white and varied colors of the boats.","title":"Caribbean harbor outside","placename":"Salinas (P.R.)","location":"Salinas, Puero Rico","nn1":["543246","542904","542871","543545","556191","552028","548546","546935","546877","548969","548515","548247","548078","557450","548763","542912"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","marina","superstructure","docking","tide","motorboat","boating","accent","ideal","mirror"]}
