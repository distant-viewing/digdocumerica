{"path":"554633.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene rural landscape during autumn. In the foreground, there's a rustic, dark-roofed cabin with a visible chimney and a small front porch. The cabin is partially enveloped by shadows, indicating either sunrise or sunset. Surrounding the cabin is a vast field, partially covered with grass and patches of bare earth, suggesting recent agricultural use or fallow land.\n\nIn the middle ground, interspersed deciduous and coniferous trees are seen. These trees are in the midst of seasonal change, displaying a vibrant palette of fall colors ranging from bright yellows to deep reds and oranges.\n\nThe background is dominated by majestic rolling mountains covered with dense forests. The mountains exhibit a gradient of colors due to the varying elevation and density of foliage, with higher altitudes showing darker hues, possibly indicating evergreens or shadows cast by the angle of the sun. The sky above is overcast, contributing to a moody and dramatic atmosphere, yet it does not detract from the vivid autumn colors displayed across the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights the tranquility and the natural beauty of an autumnal rural setting, emphasizing the contrast between the simplicity of a single human dwelling and the vastness of the natural world surrounding it.","title":"One of the few mown fields in the Adirondack Forest Preserve with a dramatic backdrop of one of the region's highest sections.
