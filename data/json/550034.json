{"path":"550034.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat nostalgic maritime scene, presumed to be taken from aboard a sailing ship. The perspective is from the ship looking towards a distant city skyline under an overcast sky. On the right side of the frame, part of the ship is visible, including the bow and a section of the rigging. The rigging is complex and consists of numerous ropes and nets attached to a wooden structure, likely a mast. A covered part of the ship, perhaps a boom or front deck, also stretches into the frame reflected on the bottom right corner.\n\nThe left and central parts of the image offer a view of a calm sea extending towards a horizon where the outlines of a cityscape are silhouetted. The skyline features a series of blocky, high-rise buildings that contrast sharply with the somewhat muted tones of the sky and water. This juxtaposition likely gives a sense of distance and separation between the peacefulness at sea and the bustling urban environment.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the elements of the ship to frame and draw attention towards the distant cityscape, emphasizing a sense of journey or travel towards or away from the civilization represented by the urban skyline. The mood is tranquil, reflective, and tinged with a sense of exploration or departure.","title":"\"Westward\" sails back to Long Wharf from outing at Great Brewster Island, one of the islands in Boston Harbor.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["555721","555800","556190","555789","547147","549892","555722","544657","544672","550025","544697","548393","544655","545277","555716","550754"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["ship","rigging","skyline","cityscape","civilization","departure","sea","separation","boom","mast"]}
