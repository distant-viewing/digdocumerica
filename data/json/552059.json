{"path":"552059.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph shows a parched landscape featuring a dried-out soil surface with prominent deep cracks. The dominant feature is a collection of dead plant roots or stems that stands out because of its burnt black color. These roots intersect in various directions, creating a chaotic pattern. They are devoid of leaves, indicating they are dead or have been burnt.\n\nSmall green sprouts emerging from the cracked, barren ground around the plant base suggest new life or an attempt of regeneration amidst harsh conditions. The overall atmosphere evoked by the image is one of resilience in a drought-stricken or wildfire-affected area. The background and edges of the image blur slightly into the distance where the cracked soil texture continues uniformly, emphasizing the extent of the arid condition.","title":"Trees and brush uncovered by the receding waters of the Kansas river in the area of the 12th street bridge sewer outlet.
