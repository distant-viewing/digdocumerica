{"path":"542961.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a group of deer in motion across a grassy field, set against a backdrop characterized by dark woods. The lighting in the scene suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, as the warmth of the sunlight softly illuminates the field, creating a stark contrast with the shadows of the tall trees in the background. The deer, possibly three to four in number, are depicted mid-stride, suggesting they are either running or briskly moving. The photograph has a slightly grainy quality, typical of a film camera, enhancing the natural and wild feel of the scene. The composition skillfully uses the light to draw attention to the deer, highlighting their movement and the serene, yet dynamic environment they inhabit.","title":"Deer and moose","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["546198","546232","544914","542963","544114","546088","542959","542955","545902","544571","553808","558368","543326","554621","549219","546163"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","inhabit","stride","field","warmth","film","number","mid","draw","motion"]}
