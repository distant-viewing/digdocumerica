{"path":"551132.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from an urban area, possibly during the mid-20th century. The central focus is on a small, brick-walled corner grocery store named \"DeFRANCO GROC.\" The store features two large, traditional sunshades (awnings) over its display windows, which advertise products such as ice cream, milk, and meat. Several signs are visible, including those for \"Royal Crown Cola\" and \"DeFRANCO GROC.\"\n\nAdjacent to the grocery store is a large sign for the \"Triangle Urban Renewal Project W.VA.R21,\" indicating an urban development initiative. The sign explains that the renewal of the area is financed by the \"Renewal-Assistance Administration, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,\" and is managed by the \"Charleston Urban Renewal Authority\" in cooperation with the \"City of Charleston, West Virginia.\" The sign, featuring white and red texts on a dark background, is partly obscured by foliage from overgrown shrubs.\n\nIn the scene, a young woman stands on the sidewalk facing away from the camera. She has long hair and is wearing a patterned dress with a light color, holding what appears to be a small bag or purse.\n\nThe setting shows other elements typical of a residential urban area, including overhead power lines, paved streets, and a parked car in the background. The atmosphere conveys a sense of a modest, everyday life in a neighborhood likely experiencing changes due to the urban renewal efforts mentioned on the sign.","title":"Triangle section, site of urban renewal project","placename":"Charleston (W.
