{"path":"542707.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant field of poppies, showcasing a variety of colors including red, yellow, pink, and white. The flowers are in full bloom, densely packed, and occupy the foreground of the image, creating a colorful tapestry. In the background, contrasting with the natural beauty of the flowers, is an industrial setting. The industrial site includes large structures like silos or processing plants, complex frameworks of metal construction, and various pipes and chimneys, suggesting a plant related to manufacturing or processing.\n\nAdditionally, there are some white-covered structures, possibly greenhouses, adjacent to the industrial plant, which indicate agricultural activity possibly linked to the flower field. A few evergreen trees are visible near the industrial structures, adding a touch of greenery to the otherwise mechanical backdrop.\n\nThe image juxtaposes the industrial with the natural, highlighting a stark contrast between the man-made and organic elements. The sky appears overcast, with white to gray clouds, which softens the light and enhances the vivid colors of the flowers. The overall composition of the photograph effectively captures the intersection of industrial development and natural beauty.","title":"Flower fields behind which is grefco inc., dicalite division manufacturers of diatomaceous earth","placename":"Lompoc (Calif.)","location":"Lompoc, California","nn1":["542552","542709","546170","543913","542642","552538","557541","544676","552741","557433","557733","554111","545989","545971","542641","545993"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","processing","plant","greenhouse","tapestry","field","soften","silo","intersection","link"]}
