{"path":"551526.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a serene riverside scene. In the image, a white house, possibly a one-story suburban-style home with a flat roof, is partially obscured by lush green trees. This house is situated on the riverbank, elevated slightly above the water level, protected by a steep embankment.\n\nAt the base of the embankment, directly adjacent to the river, there are large, scattered rocks or chunks of concrete, suggesting either natural river debris or remnants of a rock barrier possibly to prevent erosion. The foliage is dense around the house, providing a feeling of seclusion and natural beauty. The verdant trees cast shadows and speckles of sunlight pierce through them, dotting the scene with contrasts of light and shade.\n\nThe river itself is calm, with its surface reflecting a bit of the greenery and sunlight. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is one of tranquil, rustic seclusion, likely taken during the sunny months. No people or moving objects are visible in the scene, adding to its stillness and tranquility.","title":"West bank of the Mississippi River near 55th Avenue, North, in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis.
