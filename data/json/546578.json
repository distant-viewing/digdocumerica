{"path":"546578.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of a bustling urban area with a complex system of highways and infrastructural elements near a large body of water. On the left side of the image, there is a dense concentration of roads that intertwine and loop around each other, showing multiple levels of freeway overpasses. These roads are filled with numerous vehicles, indicating heavy traffic flow.\n\nA prominent waterway extends horizontally across the right side of the photograph, with a bridge crossing it. Alongside the water's edge, there is a large marina filled with various sizes of boats. Adjacent to the marina are more roadways, densely packed with cars, suggesting more traffic congestion.\n\nNear the top left, large buildings with flat roofs dominate the cityscape, and they appear institutional or industrial in nature. The area is surrounded by a lot of greenery and smaller buildings offering a contrast to the central busy highways and large structures.\n\nThe overall impression is of a dynamic urban environment, heavily centered around transportation and water-based activities, possibly indicating a major city with significant commuting and logistical activities.","title":"Rush hour traffic.  14th street bridge in foreground.
