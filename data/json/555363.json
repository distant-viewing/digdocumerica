{"path":"555363.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a lush tomato plant bearing several large, unripe tomatoes. The tomatoes, greenish in color, suggest that they are not yet mature, hanging heavily from the branches which are supported by unseen stakes or trellises typical in tomato cultivation. The plant appears robust with an abundance of dark green leaves thickly clustered around the tomatoes, providing a dense foliage background.\n\nIn this image, the focus is on a particular cluster of tomatoes in the center, highlighted by subtle light that seems to filter through a greenhouse roof, suggesting that the scene is likely within a controlled agricultural environment. This is supported by the hint of structural elements like metal or plastic that are barely visible in the soft-focused background, typical of greenhouse structures. There are no visible human activities in the photograph; rather, it captures a moment of natural growth within a cultivated setting. The overall composition emphasizes the health and potential of the tomato plant, symbolizing care and precision in agricultural practices.","title":"Closeup view of tomatoes inside one of the solar greenhouses at the University of Arizona Environmental Research Laboratory at Tucson.
