{"path":"542602.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features an interesting composition where the foreground is dominated by a close-up view of a pine cone and pine needles, creating a blurred, natural frame. Through this natural frame, two men are visible in the background, set in a wooded setting that suggests a forest or a similar natural environment. One man appears to be in a dynamic pose, perhaps walking or adjusting his position, while the other stands more relaxed, facing slightly towards or talking to the first man.\n\nThe environment around them includes several trees and what looks like fallen branches or cut wood on the ground, suggesting recent activity in the area, possibly related to forestry or a nature walk. The sky is visible through the canopy of the trees and is brightly lit, hinting at a sunny day. The overall image exudes a sense of exploration or work-related activity in a forest setting, captured in a creative and visually engaging manner.","title":"John Kruse and Joe Tanski of the U.S. Forest Service inspect a five-acre site which has been chosen, because of the quality of its trees, as a planting area for pine tree seedlings.","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["553638","542603","542732","542604","542771","543445","544632","553601","549226","547045","543446","557005","545088","558078","545060","544003"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["cone","walk","forest","forestry","needle","manner","pose","man","position","exploration"]}
