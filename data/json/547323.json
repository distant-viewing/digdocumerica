{"path":"547323.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a crowded scene of spectators at an outdoor event. The image is vibrant with a wide array of bright and pastel colors predominantly displayed in the attendees' clothing, featuring many reds, whites, yellows, and blues. The crowd is diverse, consisting of people of various ages and gender, many wearing attire that suggests a casual outdoor gathering. Several individuals are seen wearing hats, ranging from simple caps to more decorative hats, possibly indicating sunny weather. Some spectators are using binoculars and cameras, suggesting they are there to closely watch a distant event, like a sports game or race.\n\nThe seats are arranged in ascending rows, typical of stadium seating, which allows everyone a clear view of the event. The general mood appears relaxed and engaged, with some people in conversation, while others look intently towards the action not visible in the photograph. The background is almost entirely filled with people, with no distinct architectural features or natural landscapes visible, focusing all attention on the gathered crowd and their colorful attire. The era of the attire and the style of the photograph suggest this might be from the mid-20th century.","title":"The annual spring football game at the university of Nebraska is a stadium-packing event.
