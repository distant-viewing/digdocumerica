{"path":"555189.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a single yellow flower against a softly blurred background. The flower, which appears to be a type of daisy, is illuminated from behind or above, casting parts of its petals in silhouette and highlighting others against a rich, dark blue backdrop. This backlighting creates an ethereal glow around the flower's edges and reveals delicate details within the petals and the flowerâ€™s structure.\n\nAdditionally, several buds and branching stems can be seen beside and behind the flower. The buds are closed and rounded, suggesting they are yet to bloom. The stems have a thin, wiry appearance, contributing to the overall delicate and intricate composition of the scene.\n\nThe background is artistically unfocused, featuring bokeh effects with large, irregular light patches ranging from bright white to deep blue, which add depth and a painterly quality to the image. These light shapes might be a result of sunlight filtering through other foliage or reflective surfaces out of frame, manipulated by the camera's optics.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of quiet isolation of a single flower, highlighted by natural light, amidst a soft and indistinct surrounding, emphasizing the beauty and fleeting nature of life in nature.","title":"Flowers growing in a meadow edged by 80-year-old age class timberland on Green Mountain, Kitsap County, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545699","543623","543596","542969","545706","551369","555033","551368","555055","554586","545695","544875","557617","554580","555035","547642"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","bud","petal","stem","daisy","backlighting","manipulate","result","bloom","close"]}
