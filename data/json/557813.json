{"path":"557813.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil oceanic scene from an elevated vantage point. Dominating the composition is the vast expanse of the sea, which exhibits a gentle gradient of blue tones, ranging from a darker hue near the top to a lighter, more turquoise shade towards the bottom.\n\nCentrally positioned in the image is a solitary white boat, which appears to be a medium-sized vessel, possibly a yacht or a small ship. This boat is the focal point against the vast, relatively featureless backdrop of the water.\n\nThe texture of the water around the boat suggests a calm sea, with minor ripples that softly distort the reflection of light, creating subtle variations in the color and appearance of the waterâ€™s surface.\n\nThere are no visible landforms or other objects in the visible frame, emphasizing the isolation and peacefulness of the scene. The broad, open water suggests a sense of solitude and may evoke feelings of tranquility or introspection in the viewer. The composition is simple yet striking, with a clear focus on the boat and the expansive sea around it.","title":"Charter fishing boat in a dumping area for acid wastes in the New York bight near New York city.  The area is not considered good for fishing.  Some boats spend time in the waters to clean off the bottoms of their vessels.  The u.s.  Coast guard is responsible for monitoring all ocean dumping.  The national oceanographic and atmospheric administration is conducting a marine ecosystems analysis program in the bight.
