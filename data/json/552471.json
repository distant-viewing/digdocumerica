{"path":"552471.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image captures a sweeping view of a large, semi-circular dam or weir, over which water is flowing smoothly, creating a curtain-like effect. The water cascades evenly along the curvature of the structure before forming white, frothy waves at its base where it meets the river below. The dam appears to be relatively large, suggesting a significant body of water behind it.\n\nIn the background, the opposing bank of the river is visible. It features verdant greenery and a line of trees along the shore. Beyond the tree line, several houses or small buildings can be seen. These structures are spaced apart and partially obscured by the trees. The overall area surrounding the river seems to be a mix of residential and natural landscape, typical of a region that might be just outside of a suburban or rural area.\n\nThe sky above is mostly clear with a few small clouds, indicating a bright and possibly warm day. There is a hint of another shore far in the background across the water which supports the wide reach of the river. The overall feel of the image suggests a serene, if engineered, natural environment, likely used for both recreational and functional purposes related to water management.","title":"Lake Bloomington and spillway","placename":"Lexington (Ill.)","location":"Lexington, Illinois","nn1":["549486","551580","553654","551212","553372","549497","553137","553349","550654","548940","548925","548007","549004","548309","548016","551190"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["dam","river","reach","shore","curvature","water","curtain","line","base","management"]}
