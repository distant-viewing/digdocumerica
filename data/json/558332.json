{"path":"558332.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Phillips, Kathy","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man with a joyful expression, seated and possibly in a wheelchair, given the glimpse of a handle and the hint of wheels visible behind him. He has white hair, distinct laugh lines, and is wearing a pale yellow shirt. The focus of the image is on his face, capturing a smile that conveys a warm and inviting demeanor.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but includes a visible artwork, a stylized painting or print of a ghost-like figure, predominantly in shades of yellow and black. This is centered and mounted on a green wall. The overall lighting of the photograph is gentle, lending a calm and serene atmosphere to the scene. The use of shallow depth of field ensures the man is the focal point of the image, while his background surroundings appear less distinct, emphasizing his expression and adding a personal touch to the photograph.","title":"Senior citizens find that New Ulm, Minnesota is a good place to retire.
