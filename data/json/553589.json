{"path":"553589.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a detailed yet serene woodland scene. A single fern is prominently positioned in the foreground, standing out with its vibrant green color against a darker and softer background. The fern is placed on what appears to be a wet or moss-covered rock, adding a texture contrast to the smooth leaves of the fern.\n\nThe background is composed of a dense forest with numerous trees, whose trunks are dark and somewhat blurred, suggesting low light conditions within the woods. There is no visible sky, and the overall lighting is dim, emphasizing a mood of tranquility and perhaps the cool, shadowy environment typical of densely wooded areas.\n\nNo people or animals are visible in the image, focusing the viewer’s attention entirely on the natural elements and the tranquil forest setting. The composition uses the contrast between the sharply focused fern in the foreground and the dimly lit, blurred trees in the background to draw the viewer’s eye directly to the small plant, highlighting its delicate structure and the resilience of life in a quiet, natural environment.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora. Thirty days after the fire, in the section of the burn area known as Granite Creek, a bracken fern has sprouted and grown to a height of nearly two feet. Nature is already beginning to rebuild the forest.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553590","553358","554996","555191","555049","555192","555054","555057","545285","554729","555183","543581","555043","554993","551367","554998"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fern","forest","viewer","moss","resilience","woode","animal","trunk","compose","draw"]}
