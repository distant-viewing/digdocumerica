{"path":"546587.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a busy highway system partially enveloped by lush greenery. The curving highway consists of multiple lanes that bifurcate and merge at several points, evident through the presence of both overpasses and merging lanes. The traffic on the highway indicates a dense flow of vehicles, with a noticeable congestion on some parts while other stretches appear to flow more smoothly.\n\nThe surrounding area is predominantly forested, suggesting the highway cuts through a largely undeveloped or rural area. On one side of the curving highway system, a line of traffic congestion stretches back quite far, indicating either a traffic jam or slow-moving traffic. In contrast, the opposite direction on another part of the highway shows lighter traffic conditions.\n\nThe predominant colors in the photograph are the deep, verdant greens of the trees, the grey of the concrete highway, and the varied colors of the vehicles. The pattern of light and shadow, possibly due to cloud covers or the angle of the sun, plays across the scene, adding depth and highlighting the sinuous layout of the roadways. Overall, this image captures a typical scenario in a busy, traffic-heavy highway surrounded by natural beauty, viewed from an aerial perspective.","title":"Rush hour traffic, 4:30 to 6:30 pm.
