{"path":"549071.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a suburban area, capturing a multitude of single-story houses, likely residential, laid out in a well-organized, patterned neighborhood. The houses are mostly rectangular, featuring flat or slightly sloping roofs, and are fairly uniform in size and spacing. Many of the homes have attached garages, visible driveways, and compact yards. \n\nThe streets weave around the neighborhood in a curved and swerving pattern, marked with smooth asphalt. There is minimal visible traffic on the roadways, although several cars can be seen parked along the curb or in driveways. The empty streets create a peaceful suburban atmosphere. \n\nThe neighborhood is sectioned by larger roads that border and intersect the area, which can be discerned by the slightly busier traffic flow and the strategic placement of traffic junctions. There are patches of green lawns and small garden areas associated with each property. \n\nThe landscape outside this immediate neighborhood appears less developed, suggesting that this area might be on the outskirts of a larger city or in a suburban zone. The overall layout and design indicate a planned community probably built to accommodate a growing suburban population. The aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of the suburban development and layout, illustrating the residential planning common in many suburban expansions.","title":"Housing in Las Vegas","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["547769","553699","547435","548824","547211","544510","556975","546399","544550","553700","553937","545914","553934","551198","553970","553939"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["neighborhood","driveway","traffic","layout","population","junction","house","expansion","multitude","asphalt"]}
