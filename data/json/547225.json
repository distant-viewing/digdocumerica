{"path":"547225.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive industrial site characterized by various construction and excavation activities. The site appears large, spanning across most of the image, presenting a mixture of dug earth, water-filled pits, and piles of debris or materials.\n\nIn the foreground, towards the top portion of the frame slightly off-center, is a large, dark, oily pool surrounded by mounded earth and large rocks. Nearby, there is construction equipment, which includes what appears to be an excavator. The dirt around this area shows signs of heavy machinery movement, evident from the tire tracks and disturbed soil.\n\nMoving to the midground, the landscape is covered with more industrial equipment and vehicles, possibly including dump trucks and other construction machinery dispersed throughout the site. The terrain here is uneven with varying colors ranging from dark browns to muddy yellows, indicative of the different materials being moved or processed.\n\nThe background of the photo reveals a more urban environment with several buildings visible, suggesting the proximity of this site to a populated area. The skyline is relatively flat, indicating a possibly suburban or semi-industrial area.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph highlights the scale of construction or mining activity in relation to its surrounding environment, focusing on human alteration of the natural landscape and industrial efforts.","title":"The blue plains sewage treatment plant is undergoing sorely needed expansion","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["552004","543785","552814","549169","547591","551611","544498","555634","554765","543861","555633","542513","552422","549148","554764","549168"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["site","construction","relation","dug","earth","machinery","excavator","alteration","pit","move"]}
