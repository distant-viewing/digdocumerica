{"path":"555976.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside the cabin of a boat, likely a ferry or a tour boat, characterized by its large windows providing an encompassing view of the surrounding water. The interior has a vintage appearance, hinting at a time period that might be from the 1970s or 1980s, given the style of clothing and decor.\n\nThe cabin is equipped with several rows of soft, cushioned seats. Some of the seats are reclining and arranged to face both forward and sideways, enabling passengers to enjoy the view or engage in conversation. The upholstery varies, with patterns such as plain dark colors and floral designs visible.\n\nThere are five people in the cabin, each engaged in different activities:\n1. In the foreground on the left, there’s a man with dark hair, wearing a yellow jacket, intently reading a magazine or newspaper.\n2. Next to him, a man with glasses and a white-and-blue striped shirt looks out the window, seemingly lost in thought or enjoying the view.\n3. Sitting in the same direction but further back, an older man with glasses, clad in a checked shirt and dark pants, has his hand to his chin, giving an impression of reflection or slight weariness.\n4. Towards the back, two girls, likely young children, are standing by the window. They appear to be gazing out at the water or possibly spotted something of interest outside, judging by their focused attention in that direction. The girl closest to the right is wearing a pink top, while the other girl’s clothing isn’t as discernible.\n  \nThe ceiling of the boat is fitted with several overhead lights, and reflections on the windows suggest either early morning or late afternoon lighting. The overall mood is peaceful, with passengers seemingly relaxed and absorbed in their own thoughts or the serene water landscape visible through the expansive windows.","title":"Arizona and New Mexico scenery attract passengers to the dome car of the Southwest Limited, an overnight train from Los Angeles, California, to Albuquerque, New Mexico.
