{"path":"546152.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The image depicts a strikingly textured terrain with a vivid and somewhat alien appearance. Featuring predominant hues of deep red and patches of silver, the landscape seems unearthly and somewhat resembles an extraterrestrial surface, possibly Martian. The terrain is rugged and covered in numerous rocky outcroppings and depressions, creating a dynamic and uneven visual. These rocks and geological formations have a rough, gritty texture, accentuated by the image's high detail and color contrast.\n\nSilver-colored elements, suggesting mineral deposits or ice, streak across parts of the rocks, adding a vivid contrast to the dominantly red environment. This could indicate geological processes at work, such as the presence of water or other volatiles in the past or currently sublimating materials.\n\nThe background is enveloped in a shadowy, dark red mist or atmosphere, contributing to the otherworldly feel of the setting. There's a general lack of identifiable figures or objects made by humans or any known life forms, which reinforces the isolation and wild nature of the depicted scene.\n\nThis photograph could be of scientific interest, perhaps taken by a space probe or rover exploring different planets or moons in our solar system, capturing geological and atmospheric details critical for studying extraterrestrial environments.","title":"Oil pollutes water in drainage ditches which surround Olin-Mathieson plant.","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["543148","552423","550442","555793","545799","543842","546110","552426","552420","555885","550395","545792","544745","555182","555029","555553"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["silver","outcropping","depression","moon","visual","past","deposit","rock","streak","ice"]}
