{"path":"549942.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a garbage truck in the act of dumping waste at a landfill. The truck is predominantly black and blue, with white text on its side that reads \"Fairfield\" along with a phone number \"277-5363.\" Its dump body is tilted upward, discharging debris onto the expansive rubbish heap below. The scene indicates a clear, sunny day given the brightness and deep blue sky.\n\nThe landfill itself is strewn with various types of trash, predominantly consisting of smaller debris that could include household and industrial waste. It covers a vast area, and in this frame, it is cluttered with scattered refuse.\n\nIn the background, there are distant mountains, which are slightly hazy, possibly due to atmospheric conditions or dust from the landfill. The overall setting evokes a sense of crowded and unmanaged waste management practices, typical of many landfills. The scene underscores environmental concerns associated with large-scale waste disposal and its potential impact on surrounding natural landscapes.","title":"Dumping garbage at Croton landfill operation","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["548210","549749","549949","550256","554541","546246","546761","549748","549746","546235","550248","549737","543832","549936","543821","549794"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["landfill","waste","truck","dump","phone","refuse","household","act","disposal","debris"]}
