{"path":"549892.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph captures a striking view of a maritime scene set against an iconic urban skyline. In the foreground, a large red ship, likely a cargo vessel, dominates the water. It has numerous visible masts or cranes, hinting at its function in freight transport. Alongside it, a considerably smaller black tugboat appears, possibly assisting or guiding the larger ship through the busy waters.\n\nThe background features the skyline of a major city, densely packed with a variety of buildings including skyscrapers. Prominently towering over the others are two very tall towers with a slight reflective surface, which serve as immediately recognizable landmarks. The skyline suggests a bustling, modern city atmosphere, likely a financial or commercial hub.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is balanced between the activities on the water and the architectural display of the city. The gentle hues and outdoor lighting indicate that the photo was taken during daylight, under clear weather conditions, enhancing the visibility of the cityscape. The angle of the shot and the breadth of the scene suggest that it was taken from a considerable distance, likely from another boat or a distant shore, providing a comprehensive view of this dynamic interaction between maritime and urban environments.","title":"World trade center (left) and lower Hudson River shipping seen from the Staten Island ferry","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555800","555721","555722","546925","548403","550025","552265","555789","548393","551990","550034","550910","555810","548320","544657","548400"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["skyline","ship","city","breadth","tower","freight","tugboat","mast","landmark","hub"]}
