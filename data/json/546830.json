{"path":"546830.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph features a maritime scene with a large focus on industrial water vessels. In the center of the image, there is a sizable barge equipped with heavy machinery, including cranes and piles of what could be construction or industrial materials. This barge is being towed or positioned on the water by a tugboat, identifiable by its robust and compact design, equipped with a prominent bridge and powerful propulsion visible in the rear.\n\nThe backdrop of the picture is a hazy skyline that likely includes distant shores or docks suggested by a faint outline of cranes and other structures similar to those on the barge. The water appears calm with some ripple textures, and the sky is overcast, blanketing the scene in soft, diffuse light which casts a somber tone over the scene. The overall color palette is muted with blues, grays, and blacks dominating, conveying a cool and industrial atmosphere.\n\nThe scene lacks visible human activity, focusing instead on the mechanical and industrial components of maritime logistics and construction work. Overall, this image captures a moment in the daily operations of industrial maritime machinery, emphasizing themes of industry and transport.","title":"Residential street near Locust Point terminal.
