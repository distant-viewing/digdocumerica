{"path":"552618.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor scene of a formal meeting taking place in a room that appears to be a civic or governmental setting. The room is functionally furnished with wooden paneling on the walls and features a row of large American flags and another unidentified flag (possibly a local or state flag) against the wall behind the main table. There is also traditional decor including framed pictures and bulletin boards.\n\nAt the center of the image, a large table occupies the foreground where several individuals sit facing towards an audience. These individuals are a mix of men and women, and they appear to be engaged in a discussion or presentation, with some papers and documents visible in front of them on the table. \n\nThe audience, seated on folding chairs, consists of approximately a dozen adults of varying ages and genders. They are facing the people at the table, suggesting that they are attendees or participants of the meeting. The audience members are dressed in casual to semi-formal attire.\n\nThe overall lighting in the room is moderately bright, emanating from fluorescent lights fixed on the ceiling. The atmosphere seems to be serious and attentive, typical of a town hall, council meeting, or a similar gathering. The room also has a couple of open doors, suggesting accessibility and an informal feel despite the formal proceedings.","title":"Rifle city council meeting","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["547284","547365","556451","557027","557704","547362","547407","548237","552616","556450","549073","547368","543925","547320","546299","547367"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["meeting","audience","room","table","flag","proceeding","furnish","dozen","paneling","gender"]}
