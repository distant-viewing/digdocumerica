{"path":"550618.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and atmospheric landscape scene dominated by an expansive view of natural terrain under a stormy sky. The primary focal point is a local rainstorm or heavy rainfall visible in the distance, where a concentrated downfall creates an opaque, curtain-like effect, obscuring part of the landscape. The rain appears to fall directly from a large, dark cloud overhead, which is part of a broader, cloud-filled sky suggestive of ongoing or impending stormy weather.\n\nThe landscape below is a mix of dark and light patches, indicating varied vegetation or wetness, possibly consisting of grasslands, marshes, or mossy areas, which reflect different levels of light absorption and moisture. Some areas of the landscape are brighter, likely due to pooling water catching light, while others are darker, hinting at denser vegetation or shadows cast by the cloud cover.\n\nThere are no visible structures or people; the scene is entirely natural and wild. The composition uses a combination of natural lighting and shadow to convey a mood of solitude and the dynamic, changing nature of the landscape under weather influences. The image evokes a sense of isolation and the raw beauty of unaltered nature.","title":"Rain squall over the marshy land and taiga forests that characterize this region.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552483","550390","548705","544944","547793","544116","545639","545375","544123","550604","550391","548673","557575","550486","555087","546385"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["wetness","mossy","landscape","marsh","grassland","influence","overhead","weather","rainfall","curtain"]}
