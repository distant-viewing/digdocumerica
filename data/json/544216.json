{"path":"544216.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene focusing on recreational fishing at a rural location. On the left side foreground, there is a prominent sign that reads \"Fishing 50Â¢ Per Person\" mounted on metal poles, indicative of a managed fishing area where a fee is required. The sign has a rustic appearance, with handwritten lettering.\n\nIn the background, a person wearing a hat and a light-colored dress is seated near the edge of a water body, actively engaged in fishing. They seem to be sitting on a makeshift stool or a similar object, strategically placed close to the water. The individual appears to be using a simple fishing rod, aiming towards the water which shows gentle ripples likely caused by the movement of fish or the breeze.\n\nThe water body appears calm and is surrounded by greenery and vegetation, contributing to a tranquil, natural setting. The road next to which the person is seated is unpaved and composed of gravel, curving off into a grass-covered area further on. The sky is partially filled with fluffy, white clouds, suggesting a bright sunny day, ideal for outdoor activities. Overall, the composition captures a peaceful moment of solitude and recreational activity in a rural setting.","title":"Preparing to fish for supper on the banks of the bayou","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553081","551024","551025","550666","550665","552026","555576","550313","550217","549935","548138","550851","554519","545968","550317","554520"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","person","stool","seat","breeze","ideal","require","aim","rod","cause"]}
