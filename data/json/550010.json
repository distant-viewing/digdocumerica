{"path":"550010.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene dominated by a two-story wooden structure that appears to be a watchtower, perhaps for a railroad crossing. The tower, featuring multiple windows and a short chimney, stands to the left and has an external staircase leading to its upper level. The building is set slightly back from a road lined with utilitarian fencing.\n\nThe scene is set under a clear blue sky with trees interspersed in the background, indicating a suburban or semi-rural setting. On the road in front of the tower, there's significant vehicular activity with several cars visible, including a white car and a blue car in motion, suggesting a moderately busy thoroughfare.\n\nTo the right, a prominent railroad crossing gate with alternating black and white stripes is visible in the raised position, signaling that it is safe for the cars to pass. The road continues into the distance, flanked by utility poles and additional wires stretching overhead.\n\nVisible further down the road are commercial or residential buildings, incorporating both traditional and more modern architectural elements. Overall, the composition conveys a dynamic, slightly dated snapshot of suburban America, with elements like the classic cars and the older-style railroad infrastructure hinting at the historical period of the photograph.","title":"Switch house and taunton railroad crossing","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["558020","555988","556853","556331","548474","550111","558028","556127","550065","546700","551106","557805","547944","547580","550203","556435"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["railroad","crossing","car","road","alternate","incorporate","thoroughfare","tower","fencing","gate"]}
