{"path":"548667.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features a large, elegant two-story house painted in white. The architectural style is ornate with Victorian influences. The house’s double-stacked porches are framed by decorative gingerbread trim and bracketed posts. Each porch has ornamental railings and intricate columns, which add to the charm and overall aesthetic.\n\nOn each story, there are evenly spaced double-hung sash windows, all equipped with dark shutters, contrasting with the white of the building. The ground floor porch is accessible through a central entry featuring a white door flanked by sidelights and a rectangular transom above, enhancing the entryway's prominence.\n\nThe structure itself is surrounded by a lush green lawn that is neatly trimmed, indicating well-maintained grounds. A few small flowering plants can be seen at the building’s front, adding a splash of color to the predominantly white and green scene.\n\nThe sky above is clear and brightly lit, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a sunny day. There are few visible structures or trees beyond the immediate vicinity of the house, which implies a spacious property or a relatively open neighborhood setting. The overall atmosphere reflects a serene and noble residential setting, typical of affluent historical neighborhoods.","title":"One of the historic wooden houses of Key West.
