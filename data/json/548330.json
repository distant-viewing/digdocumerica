{"path":"548330.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene from an elevated perspective, likely taken from the upper floor or roof of a nearby building. The image primarily shows several older brick buildings with various architectural details. Notably, the area is densely packed with residential and possibly commercial buildings that exhibit wear and signs typical of mid-century urban environments.\n\nThe center of the image features a roof with smoke drifting from a chimney, suggesting active utilities, surrounded by several ornate architectural structures possibly part of a religious building's complex, indicated by detailing reminiscent of bell towers or cupolas. \n\nThe street visible on the left side of the photo is lined with parked cars, reflecting the era's typical vehicle models, suggesting this photo could be from the 1970s or 80s. The street shows moderate traffic activity with cars and a few pedestrians visible, giving a sense of daily life. Below the smoke, a slightly obscured alley or small back street can be seen, containing dumpsters, suggesting it is a service or maintenance area for nearby buildings.\n\nOverall, the lighting and the haze suggest an overcast day, and the atmosphere appears slightly grimy, perhaps indicative of the air quality or weather conditions typical of many industrialized cities during this time period. This photograph captures a moment in urban life, highlighting both the architectural character and lived experience of the area it depicts.","title":"Incinerator of this South Bronx tenement is going full blast.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548343","548326","550138","556180","550053","553840","549267","550203","548382","546074","548318","548329","550108","545437","548374","548425"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","dumpster","80","building","alley","smoke","bell","roof","experience","car"]}
