{"path":"547303.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural agricultural scene, likely captured on a sunny day given the bright and clear sky. The foreground and midground largely show an expanse of plowed farmland with deep furrows. The soil appears moist and cloddy, strewn with remnants of previous crop harvests such as stalks and leaves, indicating recent agricultural activity.\n\nThe perspective is taken from one end of a field, looking straight down one of the furrows, which leads the viewer's eyes towards a central point in the background. The lines created by the furrows add a sense of depth and perspective to the scene.\n\nIn the background, thereâ€™s a classical barn structure with a distinctive arched roof, which is somewhat iconic in farm architecture. This building is the main constructed element in the landscape, standing alone amongst the flat terrain that reaches up to a clear horizon.\n\nThe sky is vividly blue and devoid of clouds, suggesting a dry, clear weather condition. Overall, the scene captures a typical agricultural setting with focus on the farmland and the singular farm structure, evoking a sense of solitude and the scale of agricultural operations.","title":"Farm typical of eastern Nebraskan plains","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547307","544481","547291","547304","557183","552462","552541","548296","547305","549181","549237","557946","546924","547321","547350","547288"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["furrow","farmland","farm","stalk","plow","perspective","harvest","barn","strew","remnant"]}
