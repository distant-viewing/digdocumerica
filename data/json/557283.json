{"path":"557283.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a striking contrast between urban development and waste accumulation. The foreground is dominated by a large heap of debris and discarded items, consisting of various types of machinery, metallic parts, household appliances, and other unidentifiable junk. The colors of the waste are predominantly muted with rusts, silvers, and weathered whites, contrasting sharply against the vivid blue sky.\n\nIn the background, the scene shifts dramatically to a view of modern urban buildings. Several high-rise structures, some with visible windows and others with flat, featureless facades, stand under a clear sky. These buildings represent a typical mid-20th-century urban skyline, suggesting a densely populated city center. The architectural styles vary, with some buildings showing elements of modernist design. Thereâ€™s no visible human activity in the junkyard or the buildings, adding a sense of quiet desolation to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes the themes of urban progress and the environmental impact of consumer society, highlighting the incongruity between human development and the accumulation of waste. The clear, sunny weather imparts a sharp clarity to the image, emphasizing the stark difference between the constructed environment and the debris-laden foreground.","title":"Junkyard across the Monongahela River contrasts with the modern office buildings and seems to bring the two locations closer than reality because of the use of a telephoto lens. The urban renewal renaissance program was begun in the city in the early 1950's.","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549638","549782","549958","549777","545851","547899","552043","549768","549823","545146","551521","549957","547921","545059","549762","552154"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["waste","accumulation","appliance","consumer","difference","junkyard","development","household","debris","progress"]}
