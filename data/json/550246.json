{"path":"550246.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of urban decay or a derelict site with scattered debris. The center of the image features a man in a white shirt and dark trousers, walking through a field cluttered with various objects. He is facing away from the camera, heading towards an indistinct cluttered area filled with pieces of wood, metal objects, and other unrecognizable debris.\n\nIn the background, there are several residential buildings that look relatively maintained compared to the foreground. The houses vary in design, featuring prominent roofs and multiple stories, indicating a typical suburban neighborhood. Trees and greenery suggest that this area might be on the outskirts of a town or within a region that has some level of community and residential activity.\n\nOn the right, you can also see utility poles and overhead power lines, which contribute to the semi-urban setting of the scene. The area is overgrown with weeds and bushes, and the ground appears uneven and neglected, hinting that this site might have been unused or abandoned for some time.\n\nOverall, the composition draws a stark contrast between the littered, neglected foreground and the more structured, inhabited background, suggesting themes of neglect, environmental concern, and urban decay.","title":"Empty lot in inner city, on Superior Avenue, becomes a dumping ground.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550253","552102","549784","549786","556640","549958","550264","553869","552750","552757","557345","556324","543165","547906","553476","551964"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["decay","site","weed","object","debris","outskirt","concern","neighborhood","trouser","neglect"]}
