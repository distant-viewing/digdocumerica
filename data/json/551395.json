{"path":"551395.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene where a young person, perhaps a teenager, is wading in a body of water, likely a river. The teenager, who has curly, shoulder-length hair, is dressed in a dark brown jacket with a light-colored fur collar over a white shirt. He holds a fishing net that appears to be filled with fish, suggesting heâ€™s either just caught them or is transporting them.\n\nHis expression is animated, with his mouth open as if he is speaking or reacting to something, and he holds a cigarette in his lips. He is standing in shallow water, and one can discern the ripples around his legs. Partially visible to the left of the frame is another person who appears to be managing the other end of the net. This second individual is largely obscured by the primary subject.\n\nThe background is slightly blurry but shows a simple, natural setting that suggests they are in a secluded area, possibly with rolling hills or slopes nearby, which are covered in a haze or mist. The overall mood is dynamic and slightly rugged, hinting at the labor involved in their task and the natural environment around them.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
