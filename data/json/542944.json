{"path":"542944.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial site by a body of water. It appears to be a lumber processing plant, due to the presence of large quantities of logs scattered throughout the picture and some logs floating in the water, neatly arranged in formations.\n\nThe plant is surrounded by a dense, forested landscape, and fields can be seen in the distance, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. On the plant grounds, there are multiple large, white industrial buildings, likely used for storing or processing the wood. Several roads and paths are visible, connecting different areas of the facility. \n\nIn and around the water, log booms (groups of logged trees) are organized in several distinct clusters, with a good portion directly adjacent to the processing plant, likely ready for processing. The water body itself is calm, reflecting the gray skies above.\n\nThere's smoke or steam emanating from one part of the plant, which may indicate active processing or manufacturing work. The environmental impact is noticeable, with cleared areas around the plant suggesting logging activity or other forms of land alteration. The overall scene highlights the industrial process in a natural landscape, hinting at the balance or tension between industry and environment.","title":"Lumbermill","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555165","552140","542940","542941","542921","551578","550327","542933","550349","550340","551579","550330","542943","552163","545256","542945"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["plant","processing","log","quantity","lumber","tension","alteration","boom","balance","water"]}
