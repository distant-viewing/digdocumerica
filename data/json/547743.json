{"path":"547743.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts the close-up view of an electronic circuit board immersed in a translucent golden-orange medium which gives it a dreamy and abstract aesthetic. The circuit elements are partially visible through this medium; you can see various electronic components like capacitors, transistors, and resistors mounted on the board. The labeling on some of these components is slightly visible, for example, a capacitor marked \"SPRAGUE\" and another component labeled \"100V.\"\n\nThe layout includes a printed circuit board pattern, which resembles a small maze of connecting lines and pads that are typical in electronic designs. Furthermore, the image appears to have light reflections or formations that create a ghostly silhouette of a hand, suggesting the presence of someone handling or perhaps designing the circuitry.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is somewhat eerie and mysterious due to the overlay of the golden color and the shadowy appearance of a hand, conveying a sense of technology blending with a personal touch. It emphasizes the intersection of human interaction with sophisticated technology.","title":"At EPA's National Environmental Research Center at Las Vegas, samples of food and water undergo constant testing for radiation.
