{"path":"549556.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of Niagara Falls, captured from a high vantage point that provides a panoramic view of both the American and Canadian sides. In the foreground, the American Falls can be seen cascading water powerfully over a curved cliff, producing a mist at the bottom. Below the falls, rocky outcrops are visible amid the turbulent waters.\n\nTo the right of the American Falls, the smaller Bridal Veil Falls can be distinguished, separated by Luna Island. The river upstream shows a swift current, with water being funnelled towards the falls among numerous small islands and rocky terrains.\n\nA prominent feature in the mid-ground is a large observation tower on the Canadian side, standing tall with a bulbous top, likely providing views of the entire falls area. Adjacent to the tower, a dense plume of mist rises from the Horseshoe Falls, which are mostly out of view but implied by the mist.\n\nThe surrounding area includes lush green parks with a series of pathways along the river, enhancing the scenic beauty of the location. A winding road is visible, bordered by well-maintained green spaces and trees.\n\nIn the distance, beyond the river and falls, the urban landscape of Niagara Falls, Ontario, is discernible with low-rise buildings scattered across the horizon. The sky above is somewhat cloudy, casting a soft light over the entire scene, which adds a dreamy, tranquil quality to this natural spectacle.","title":"Canadian, or \"Horseshoe Falls,\" seen from the air.
