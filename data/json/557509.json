{"path":"557509.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a peaceful beach scene at dusk or possibly dawn, characterized by low natural lighting with highlights and the sun gleaming off the water's surface. The scene captures two individuals, positioned at a middle distance from the viewer, walking along the shoreline. Their shadows stretch long on the wet sand, hinting at the sun's low position in the sky.\n\nThe beach is enclosed by steep cliff faces to one side, which appear rugged and partially covered in shadows, indicating they might be vegetated or have some grassy areas. The cliffs' top edges are smooth and rounded, silhouetted against a sky with a warm, subdued light suggesting sunset or sunrise conditions.\n\nThe water is calm, with gentle waves lapping the shore, reflecting sunlight in a shimmering pattern that indicates the presence of possibly a gentle breeze. The tide appears to be low, as evidenced by the significant expanse of wet sand exposed between the waves and the dry part of the beach.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a serene and possibly reflective or tranquil atmosphere, emphasizing the beauty of a natural coastal environment and the simple pleasure of a walk by the sea.","title":"Two people have a portion of gaviota state beach, all to themselves.
