{"path":"545190.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a man engaged in the process of sorting or examining a large collection of oysters. He is outdoors, standing and focusing intently on a rectangular, wooden sorting tray filled with oysters that he holds with both hands. The tray seems to be designed with multiple compartments, likely for the separation of oysters by size or type.\n\nThe man is dressed in casual work attire, which includes a plaid, button-up shirt over a white t-shirt, and he is wearing sunglasses. His hair is short and partly obscured under what appears to be a cap or headband. The setting around him seems industrial or rustic, possibly at an oyster farm, with visible wooden structures that could be part of the operational facilities.\n\nThe lighting in the image is natural, suggesting sunlight, and it casts deep shadows, enhancing the texture of the oysters in the tray. The photograph conveys a sense of active labor and attention to detail, possibly during oyster harvesting or sorting activities.","title":"Jack Wiegardt, owner of Northwest Oyster Farm, Inc., grows cherrystone clams and oysters from seed in trays.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545310","546270","552865","546365","546297","552879","546305","552288","546279","545181","552860","552287","546322","552881","552876","545189"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["oyster","tray","headband","separation","harvesting","compartment","button","plaid","collection","sunglass"]}
