{"path":"547456.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This image captures a vibrant scene of maritime activity, specifically focusing on a crew aboard a red sailboat at sea. The sailboat is tilted slightly due to the wind's force against its white sails, which are fully deployed. The hull of the boat is a deep red, and it cuts through the blue-grey waters, creating splashes and foam around it.\n\nThe crew, consisting of at least three individuals dressed in white shirts, are actively engaged in managing the boat. They appear to be working on various tasks necessary for sailing, such as adjusting the sails or possibly steering. Their attention is directed towards their activities, emphasizing a sense of teamwork and concentration.\n\nThe background is a vast expanse of the ocean under an overcast sky, suggesting an open and somewhat moody maritime setting, typical of a day at sea experiencing brisk weather conditions. The sea is choppy, and the sky merges with the horizon in a hazy line, giving a sense of isolation and vastness typical of the seafaring experience. The overall composition of the photograph highlights the dynamic interplay between human endeavor and the natural elements at sea.","title":"Tense moment for the crew of the sloop Wandelaar as she races southward","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547448","549394","549388","549392","549433","549402","548513","547463","549421","547458","549404","547461","544667","549426","549403","549434"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sea","crew","sail","sailboat","boat","teamwork","maritime","endeavor","sailing","foam"]}
