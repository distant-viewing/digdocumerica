{"path":"542581.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an iconic scene where a large American flag is prominently displayed, fluttering in the breeze atop a vertical flagpole. The flag's bright colors of red, white, and blue are vivid against a clear sky. To the left foreground of the image, the upper portion of a palm tree is visible with its textured trunk and a fan of sharp, green palm leaves protruding into the frame. The background reveals a hazy, distant landscape, characterized by rolling hills covered with dense foliage, beneath what appears to be a smoggy or misty sky. In the mid-ground, urban elements like buildings and some industrial structures can be seen, slightly blurred and obscured by the atmospheric conditions. The overall composition combines natural and man-made elements, symbolizing perhaps a typical suburban or semi-urban American setting. The flag itself, central and dominant, stands as a strong patriotic symbol set against this everyday backdrop.","title":"Smog","placename":"San Fernando Valley (Calif.)","location":"San Fernando Valley, California","nn1":["545047","552589","554361","548577","549279","548225","546817","557244","547886","544436","549626","545881","544423","549571","558157","546329"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["flag","palm","fan","flagpole","symbol","breeze","trunk","mid","portion","leave"]}
