{"path":"547512.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted wetland area strewn with trash and debris. The foreground shows a large accumulation of refuse including cardboard, papers, plastics, and miscellaneous waste on muddy ground interspersed with rocks and water puddles. In the background, tall, dense marsh vegetation extends towards the horizon under a clear sky. To the right, a sign stands partially visible amidst the debris, possibly indicating regulations or warnings related to the area. Further back, a separate water body can be seen, and beyond the marshland, the view opens up to a distant waterway under a vast sky. This setting conveys a strong contrast between natural beauty and environmental neglect.","title":"The Middletown dump spills over to the adjacent salt marsh. Ocean is in background. The land is owned by the U.S. Dept. of Interior. Dumping was scheduled to end June 30, 1973, but a 6-month extension was granted.","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547516","547520","547521","547844","544813","550812","547525","546805","544647","551440","552811","550800","547907","547524","550352","551441"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["marshland","regulation","marsh","refuse","warning","cardboard","puddle","debris","accumulation","plastic"]}
