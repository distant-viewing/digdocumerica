{"path":"555277.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a collection of blue plastic barrels arranged closely together, occupying the majority of the frame. The barrels have a cylindrical shape and feature round, flat lids. Some of the lids show signs of weathering, visible in the form of rust or discoloration.\n\nThe barrels are densely packed, creating a repetitive pattern that extends across the image. The subtle differences in the shades of blue of the barrels, along with the variations in the condition of each lid, add texture and depth to the scene. The lighting in the photograph casts a cool hue over the barrels, enhancing their bluish tones and contributing to a slightly moody atmosphere.\n\nThereâ€™s no visible background or other objects apart from the barrels, which emphasizes the focus on these storage containers and their arrangement. The overall composition is straightforward yet visually intriguing due to the patterns and the uniformity of the barrels.","title":"Containers of pesticides on a dock at the port of Newark, New Jersey.
