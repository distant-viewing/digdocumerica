{"path":"546394.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene viewed from behind a dense foreground of tall grass, which appears to be a type of reed or sugarcane. The plants are green with feathery, white-tipped plumes that seem softly lit, possibly by sunlight, suggesting a natural environment juxtaposed against industrial activity.\n\nIn the mid-ground, partially obscured by the tall grass, there appears to be a body of water, adding a serene element to the composition.\n\nThe background features a stark contrast, with prominent thick, dark smoke billowing out from a large smokestack. At least three separate columns of smoke can be seen, suggesting continuous and heavy industrial operation. The smoke drifts into a cloud-dotted sky, suggesting environmental pollution. In the distance, there are indistinct silhouettes of hills or mountains, which are somewhat obscured by the haze.\n\nThe setting is likely near an industrial plant located close to a natural or rural area, illustrating the tension between industry and nature. The overall composition of the photograph draws attention to the environmental impact of industrial activity, indicated by the pollution emitted into the otherwise clear sky.","title":"Sugar cane field and refinery","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545990","550995","545989","551555","547539","546141","551567","543813","546398","545975","545013","557225","550694","543159","557232","544676"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","pollution","drift","tension","obscure","tip","reed","plant","grass","billow"]}
