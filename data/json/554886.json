{"path":"554886.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a muddy livestock pen filled with sheep. The ground is thick with mud, and groups of sheep are clustered together, some lying down and others milling about. The sheep appear to be covered in mud to varying degrees.\n\nIn the background, a group of people is gathered inside the pen, observing or managing the sheep. There are eight individuals visible. They are wearing varied attire, suggesting a mix of practical workwear and more formal clothing. The clothing includes hats (some wearing cowboy hats), jackets, and boots, appropriate for a farm or livestock setting. One person in the foreground, on the far left, wears a vibrant red jacket and blue jeans, making them stand out amidst the otherwise muted colors worn by the others.\n\nThe setting includes rustic elements typical of livestock handling areas, like wooden fencing and gates, which appear functional and worn, adding to the rural, working atmosphere of the scene. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the group of people and the flock in the foreground, paints a vivid picture of rural life and livestock management.","title":"Loading sheep for return to pasture or slaughter from a ranch near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554880","554881","554894","554883","544391","554882","552573","554892","547396","554891","554884","554928","554890","552568","554888","547326"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["sheep","livestock","pen","mud","group","workwear","flock","clothing","fencing","degree"]}
