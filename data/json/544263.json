{"path":"544263.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene beach scene viewed through a section of wire fencing. The focal point is a sign attached to the fence reading \"PRIVATE PROPERTY,\" serving as a bold declaration against the tranquil backdrop. The frame of the photograph is divided sharply by the vertical post of the fence on the left and the horizontally stretched fencing which cuts across the picture, with rust and weathering evident on the wires and post, indicating exposure to the elements over time.\n\nIn the background, the gently curving shoreline extends from left to right, lined with trees that provide a lush green contrast to the muted sandy beach. The ocean appears calm with a soft ripple touching the shore. A mix of overcast and brighter sky suggests a possibly humid, subdued day. Hanging moss from the trees adds a distinctly southern or tropical ambiance to the scenery, enhancing the secluded and private feeling of the place.\n\nThe mesh of the fence, along with the rusted barbed wires at its top, introduces a tension between the viewer and the inviting landscape, reinforcing the notion of restricted access and private enjoyment of this natural setting. The composition of the image, with its barriers and the inviting landscape beyond, plays on themes of exclusion and privilege.","title":"Louisiana--Lake Pontchartrain","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["547046","554168","548220","542984","557441","545159","542895","543420","545248","547607","547973","557212","547836","552076","547910","543116"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["wire","fencing","fence","post","invite","notion","beach","tension","mesh","introduce"]}
