{"path":"545074.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a man working outdoors on a paved surface covered in water. The man, dressed in a dark blue work outfit with an undershirt, is actively using a long-handled tool, possibly a squeegee or mop, to push or manipulate a viscous, black substance on the ground. In front of him is a red cart containing buckets; one bucket appears to contain this black substance while the other seems to hold a lighter material, likely for the task at hand.\n\nThe environment seems industrial or under construction, given the wet and reflective condition of the pavement surrounding the man. The area is enveloped in haze or mist, contributing to an overcast atmosphere. In the background, somewhat obscured by the fog, there seems to be another vehicle or machinery, contributing to the industrial feel. \n\nThere are visible traces on the ground indicating movement of the black substance, and patches of it are scattered in the area surrounding the man, suggesting an ongoing or just-concluded activity involving this substance. The overall scene is moody with grey tones dominating due to the mist and wet pavement, which reflect light curiously, creating an almost ethereal effect on the environment.","title":"Robert Law, employee of the Quinault Indian Reservation, checks Quinault Beach razor clams monthly for size and quantity.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544832","555561","551869","555868","555562","558307","543804","550251","551925","558306","556177","555867","546885","555877","547094","552748"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["substance","pavement","bucket","mist","man","trace","cart","fog","haze","tool"]}
