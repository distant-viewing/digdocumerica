{"path":"556147.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up side profile of an African American man. He appears to be middle-aged and is sporting a full, well-groomed beard along with a thick mustache. The man is wearing a plaid flat cap, tilted slightly back on his head. His attire includes a vertical-striped, long-sleeve shirt adorned with suspenders. Notably, the shirt has several paint splatters, suggesting he may be involved in some type of manual or artistic work. \n\nThe expression on his face is contemplative, and he is looking off to his right, which suggests he may be engaged in observing something or deep in thought. The sunlight cast on his face highlights his facial features and gives a warm tone to his skin. \n\nIn the blurred background, there is a glimpse of a yellow structure, possibly a building, contributing to a casual, outdoor setting. The image has a personal and candid quality, capturing a moment in the man's day.","title":"Artist who was helping with a wall painting on 33rd and Giles Street in South Side Chicago. He is one of many Black artists painting outdoor murals in Chicago. They feel it is a means of sharing art with ghetto people who don't go to the established museums.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556133","557173","556149","556478","556443","553605","556563","547338","552872","552103","547282","554915","557035","547028","557034","556483"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["groom","suspender","mustache","beard","skin","tilt","thought","face","profile","man"]}
