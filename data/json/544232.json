{"path":"544232.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The image shows an older man seated on the edge of a bed in a modest room. The man is bare-chested and wearing checked trousers. He looks directly at the camera with a gentle, perhaps contemplative expression, holding what appears to be a cigarette between the fingers of his right hand. His posture and expression convey a sense of relaxed attentiveness.\n\nThe room where he is sitting is painted in a pale blue color and is sparsely decorated. On the wall behind him, there are three framed pictures. The central frame is positioned directly above his head and contains a portrait, while the flanking frames seem to hold landscape or building images. On the right side of the photo, a wooden table is visible, supporting a folded item of clothing and what appears to be a radio or a small television.\n\nThe overall lighting of the scene is soft, shading more towards natural lighting that highlights the texture of the man's skin and the sparse furnishings in the room. The simplicity of the setting and the personal effects visible in the composition give the photograph a very intimate and lived-in feeling, portraying a quiet moment in the man's life.","title":"Fisherman relaxes in his home at Bayou Gauche.","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552104","548458","545974","553517","555532","545986","544202","556457","547427","556459","543713","548454","557648","556563","556452","552871"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["room","television","radio","furnishing","attentiveness","man","finger","cigarette","portrait","expression"]}
