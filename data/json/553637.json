{"path":"553637.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a forested area where erosion control efforts appear to be underway. The landscape is dominated by sandy soil and several pine trees, some of which have been recently cut as evidenced by the visible stumps. In the foreground, large logs lie horizontally across the slope, possibly placed there to help stabilize the soil and prevent further erosion. \n\nTwo men, both wearing helmets, are working within this setting. The man on the right side of the frame is standing higher up the slope. He is holding onto a shovel and actively engaging in digging or stabilizing the soil. The second man is positioned slightly lower on the slope and further into the frame. He is closer to the trees and also appears to be working with the soil, though his specific activity is less distinct.\n\nThe background beyond the immediate work area is densely wooded, suggesting that this scene is deep within a forest. The lighting in the photo is natural, indicating it was taken during the day. The overall atmosphere conveys a mix of human intervention in a natural environment to possibly mitigate environmental degradation.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora, California. Salvage operation on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly. Pickering foresters mark trees they think should be left standing.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["542716","550224","542547","554856","542601","553601","542770","542772","542773","553639","542769","553611","542612","545535","553608","553606"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["soil","slope","erosion","shovel","stump","intervention","pine","degradation","man","helmet"]}
