{"path":"544433.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of two abandoned cars partially submerged in a muddy riverbed. The foreground prominently features the rusty, weather-beaten rear of one car, its paint heavily faded and peeling, revealing the raw, corroded metal underneath. The vehicle's rear window is missing and parts of its bodywork are crumbling away.\n\nStretching into the middle ground, another car, similarly dilapidated, follows the first, oriented in the same direction and similarly damaged. This second car is more deeply embedded in the muddy terrain, suggesting it has been there for a considerable length of time.\n\nThe setting is a dried-up river bed, with patches of shallow water still present, reflecting the vivid blue sky. The terrain is rough and uneven, with mounds of dirt and small patches of vegetation sporadically growing around the cars. The background shows a hilly landscape under a wide sky scattered with fluffy white clouds, suggesting a remote, arid location. The color palette of the scene is natural and earthy, dominated by the browns of the mud and the rust on the cars, contrasting against the blue of the sky.","title":"Old cars serve as water-break on Navajo reservation","placename":"Navajo (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo, Arizona","nn1":["547132","546173","552073","544060","555850","555849","543680","547601","547481","546318","549107","555869","553007","542590","555851","547484"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","riverb","missing","embed","rusty","rear","mud","muddy","dilapidate","mound"]}
