{"path":"556754.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures an indoor office scene featuring two people working amid various office equipment and documents. It appears to be a busy and somewhat cluttered workspace.\n\nA man stands on the left side of the image. He is wearing a light-colored shirt, has glasses, and is balding with grey hair. He is engaged in a task, leaning over a desk and using a telephone, seemingly conducting a conversation as he listens intently. His posture suggests that he is examining or indicating something on the desk.\n\nOn the right, a seated woman is visible, shown from the back and partially from the side. She wears a bright yellow short-sleeved top and her hair is dark and long. She is focused on paperwork spread across the desk in front of her.\n\nThe desk is cluttered with various items: papers, folders, and boxes are spread across the surface. Specific items like an old-fashioned radio, a microphone, and another telephone suggest a communication-heavy environment, possibly a newsroom or command center given the wall's array of schedules or timetables and a map.\n\nThe background emphasizes the nature of the environment, displaying a detailed, handwritten organizational chart and other signs that appear to schedule or track numerous activities or personnel. The room's atmosphere is utilitarian, filled with the tools of administrative work and coordination.","title":"Dispatching center for dial a ride radio dispatched door-to-door bus system in Haddonfield, New Jersey","placename":"Haddonfield (N.J.)","location":"Haddonfield, New Jersey","nn1":["556758","553088","552387","552391","552392","555233","555234","551904","551897","548237","552356","556668","551900","552377","551902","549378"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["desk","schedule","telephone","office","clutter","folder","spread","paperwork","chart","coordination"]}
