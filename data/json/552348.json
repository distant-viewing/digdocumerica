{"path":"552348.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph depicts a sailing yacht on calm waters with a scenic mountain background that is heavily snowcapped, suggesting it might be a volcanic peak. The sailboat is predominantly white with a blue stripe along its side and two large, mostly white sails fully hoisted and filled with wind. The sail closest to the viewer bears a set of numbers \"2946.\" \n\nThe yacht appears to be crewed by at least two people visible in the cockpit; one person is dressed in a red jacket and the other in dark clothing. They seem to be engaged in handling or maneuvering the boat.\n\nThe setting is serene, with the water reflecting a soft light, indicating either early morning or late afternoon sunlight. The distant mountain looms impressively in the background, and its presence adds a majestic atmosphere to the scene. The surrounding environment is relatively clear, and no other boats are immediately visible in the frame, giving a sense of quiet and isolation on the water. The overall composition of the image beautifully captures a moment of leisurely sailing against a stunning natural backdrop.","title":"Maneuvering for position before start of race held by six members of the tacoma yacht club on puget sound.
