{"path":"551987.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph shows an industrial landscape dominated by numerous large circular storage tanks, likely for oil or chemicals. Each tank is uniform in design, with some featuring external stairs and railings. These tanks are primarily grayish-white, and one has a logo with the word \"Royal.\"\n\nIn the foreground, there is a water body with a rocky edge, and a small jetty projects into the water. This jetty hosts a few parked vehicles and small buildings, possibly for security or operational management. Rails are visible beside some of the tanks, indicating the presence of transport or delivery systems.\n\nIn the background, beyond the storage tanks, is an urban industrial region with numerous factory structures and chimneys, some emitting smoke, creating a busy industrial skyline. The sky is somewhat overcast, suggesting an urban, possibly less environmentally friendly setting.\n\nThe overall composition portrays a densely packed industrial zone directly adjacent to or integrated with a waterfront, emphasizing functionality and industrial activity. The image appears dated, possibly from the late 20th century, given the style of the vehicles and visible infrastructure traits.","title":"Royal petroleum (shell oil co.)
