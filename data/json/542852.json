{"path":"542852.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a logging site. The scene is dominated by muddy terrain with visible tire tracks and paths formed by the movement of heavy vehicles. A central curved path cleaves through the area.\n\nA variety of heavy machinery is scattered across the scene, including trucks and what appear to be bulldozers and other logging equipment. Large piles of cut timber logs are placed around the site, some organized in neat stacks, and others haphazardly strewn.\n\nThere are several vehicles at the center and edges of the path, including transport trucks loaded with lumber, suggesting ongoing activity. The overall environment looks disturbed by extensive logging activities, with mud and exposed soil suggesting recent and intensive use of the area.\n\nThe presence of a single, small green tree in the midst of the chaos stands out, offering a sharp contrast to the otherwise barren landscape dominated by browns and mechanical greys. This tree appears to be one of the few remnants of natural vegetation in an expanse heavily modified by human activity. The image gives a perspective on the scale and impact of logging operations on a forested environment.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542827","542824","542949","550354","542948","542851","542823","552198","542839","542828","555085","553468","542947","545143","556922","554416"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["log","logging","path","truck","modify","site","disturb","lumber","chaos","timber"]}
