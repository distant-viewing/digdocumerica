{"path":"551214.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a serene twilight scene on water. The focal point is a small, white cabin boat cruising on a large body of water, possibly a lake or river. This boat creates substantial waves and ripples in its wake as it moves forward, indicating it is progressing at a moderate speed.\n\nThe boat is moving away from the viewer, positioned towards the bottom part of the image, leaving trails of foamy water behind. The water reflects a gradient of deep purples to soft pinks, mirroring the colors of the sky above.\n\nThe surroundings are tranquil, with dense, unbroken forests lining both sides of the waterway. These trees are dark and silhouetted against the sky, showing no distinct features other than their outlines.\n\nThe sky transitions from a peachy pink near the horizon, blending into deeper tones of violet as the eye moves upward. This coloration suggests that the photograph was taken during the late evening, around sunset.\n\nThe upper part of the image has a slightly darker vignette, possibly due to the camera's setting or natural atmospheric conditions, focusing attention towards the center of the scene where the boat and the reflected colors on the water are most vivid.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a peaceful, almost solitary moment in nature, emphasized by the fading light and the quiet movement of the boat through the tranquil waters.","title":"Houseboat moves west in late afternoon on the main osage arm of lake of the ozarks","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["551313","547230","543143","543119","552310","551280","551215","543613","552039","551307","552124","548118","543880","551222","551311","543411"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","pink","move","violet","water","vignette","cruise","coloration","progress","wake"]}
