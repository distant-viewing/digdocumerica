{"path":"550029.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene at a lakeside dock. It depicts a group of people aboard a small, narrow, red paddle boat adorned with an American flag on the stern. The boat is docked, and passengers are seated closely side-by-side facing the bow. They are of various ages, suggesting a mix of adults and children, some of whom are wearing colorful party hats suggestive of a celebration or festive event. \n\nA man wearing jeans and a dark jacket is stepping onto the boat, presumably assisting or greeting the passengers. He reaches towards someone on the boat, possibly handing off or receiving an item. On the wooden dock alongside the boat, several spectators or waiting passengers can be seen observing or waiting their turn. One individual close to the foreground appears to be a young man, also in casual attire, with his hands in his pockets, watching the activities around the boat.\n\nThe backdrop shows a calm body of water extending beyond the dock, reflecting the clear sky above. The colors are vibrant and contribute to the joyous and busy atmosphere of the scene. The dock itself includes a railing and an entrance with a sign that possibly reads \"EXTRA RIDES\", suggesting that multiple outings or rides may be occurring from this location.","title":"Setting out for a water tour of Boston's beautifully landscaped public garden","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["543944","544122","545728","549910","554176","554177","551255","549415","549410","543952","546856","551310","547838","551228","553835","549418"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["dock","boat","passenger","wait","receive","pocket","paddle","celebration","lakeside","bow"]}
