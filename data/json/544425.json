{"path":"544425.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural roadside scene that balances elements of nature with signs of human activity. On the left side of the image, there's a dirt shoulder beside a paved road. Here, two horses, one dark-colored adult and a brown foal, stand close together near a weathered green pole holding a faded, diamond-shaped sign. Both horses appear slightly dusty and are equipped with riding gear, suggesting they might be used for work or transport.\n\nThe background features a semi-arid landscape with sparse vegetation, primarily low shrubs and some scattered grasses, extending into the distance under a bright blue sky. The terrain is gently rolling and stretches toward a hilly horizon.\n\nThree vehicles are captured on the road, moving away from the foreground towards the background, emphasizing a bit of movement in an otherwise tranquil scene. They seem typical for rural transportation, possibly including a small truck in the lead.\n\nThis setting is likely in a remote part of a desert or semi-desert region, possibly in the southwestern United States, given the arid environment and the style of the roadside features. The overall ambiance is one of quiet coexistence between the natural world and human passage.","title":"Northeastern Arizona","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544395","553113","555453","553114","552501","544955","543044","553662","554885","552698","556958","548987","550005","542622","544362","545890"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["roadside","horse","diamond","coexistence","world","passage","road","shoulder","bit","transport"]}
