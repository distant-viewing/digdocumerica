{"path":"542642.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid rural landscape, characterized by sprawling fields of flowers in vibrant colors. The foreground features a field blooming with numerous flowers, their hues transitioning in broad horizontal stripes: bright yellow at the nearest, followed by deeper orange, then rich red, and finally a darker red shade that intensifies into what appears to be maroon or burgundy.\n\nIn the middle ground of the image, vehicles travel along a road that cuts horizontally across the scene. Adjacent to the road, the rural setting continues, with a few isolated trees and patches of different vegetation visible. A few scattered vehicles, including a couple of trailers or trucks, are either parked or in motion along the road.\n\nThe background provides a contrasting calm with flat fields and distant hills under a light blue sky, slightly hazed, possibly indicating distance or atmospheric conditions. No structures are prominent, emphasizing the expansiveness and open nature of the landscape. The overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the contrast between the vibrant, cultivated flower fields and the more subdued, natural landscapes in the distance, creating a panoramic view that captures both human agricultural endeavor and natural beauty.","title":"Commercial fields of ranunculus","placename":"Escondido (Calif.)","location":"Escondido, California","nn1":["542641","542645","542709","545880","544574","554027","549157","557549","545723","542517","554030","554055","544552","549229","545040","549158"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["field","flower","road","burgundy","expansiveness","endeavor","trailer","calm","vehicle","stripe"]}
