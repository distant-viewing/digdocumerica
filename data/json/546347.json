{"path":"546347.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"In this photograph, a woman stands in shallow, murky waters. She appears to be in a wooded wetland or swampy area. She has long, blonde hair tied in a braid that falls down her back. She's dressed in a grey T-shirt and dark shorts, wading through the water. Her attire and the tools she holds suggest she is conducting some type of aquatic research or exploration.\n\nThe woman is holding a large white net, possibly for catching aquatic creatures for study. Beside her is a fallen, partially submerged tree trunk, around which some branches and debris are entangled. A white bucket is also visible on the tree trunk, likely used as a container to hold specimens or tools.\n\nThe background is lush with dense, green trees under a slightly overcast sky, providing a serene, natural backdrop, reflecting a tranquil yet wild environment. The image conveys a sense of solitude and the calm focus of field work in natural science or ecology.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Field trip to Tom King Bayou Dana Beth Tyler, fishery biologist, is dip netting for non-contaminated female shrimp.
