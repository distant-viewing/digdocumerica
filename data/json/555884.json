{"path":"555884.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a small green plant thriving amidst a harsh, rocky terrain. The focus is centrally on the plant which features slender, elongated leaves that stand upright and slightly spread out. The leaves have a textured surface that appears furry or fuzzy, enhancing their vivid green color against the contrasting background.\n\nThe ground around the plant is rocky and uneven, composed of a dense collection of small, jagged stones that create a rough texture. The stones are in shades of dark grey or black, and the overall terrain appears inhospitable and arid, suggesting that the location might be in a desert or a similarly dry environment.\n\nThe lighting in the image casts strong shadows, indicating either early morning or late afternoon sunlight, which helps in accentuating the rugged texture of the stones and the delicate details of the plant. The background beyond the immediate vicinity of the plant fades into a soft blur, highlighting the isolation and resilience of the plant in such a stark landscape.","title":"Closeup of vegetation which survived cleanup operations at the five acre pond.
