{"path":"557023.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape at what appears to be either dawn or dusk, based on the soft lighting and muted colors. The primary foreground feature is a large field with neatly arranged rows of crops, presenting a textured pattern that recedes into the misty distance. The soil between these rows appears moist, suggesting recent rainfall or early morning dew.\n\nIn the background, centered along the horizon line, stands a quaint white house with a prominent architectural feature resembling a small dome or cupola, perhaps indicating it as a farm house or a chapel. Flanking the structure on its left is a cluster of trees partially shrouded by fog, enhancing the sense of depth and mystery in the scene.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph is calm and somewhat ethereal, emphasized by the mist that softens the landscape, blurring the lines between sky and land. The color palette is a blend of purples and blues in the sky, gradually shifting to darker earth tones towards the ground, which creates a gentle contrast and a quiet, contemplative mood.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a peaceful rural setting, inviting the viewer into a moment of solitude and natural beauty.","title":"Strawberry field at Serwold and Noll roads in northern Kitsap County. Increased land use pressure is expected on areas like this when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby.
