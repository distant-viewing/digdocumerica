{"path":"556911.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a motorboat speeding through an expansive body of calm, dark blue water. The boat is positioned on the right side of the image and is creating a prominent, frothy white wake as it moves. This wake forms a V-shaped pattern, with the arms of the V trailing back toward the center left of the frame, emphasizing the speed and direction of the motorboat. There are no visible landmarks or other boats in the immediate surrounding water, suggesting this activity is happening in a relatively isolated or open part of the water body. The viewpoint from above highlights the isolation of the boat in the vast water and the dynamic movement contrasted against the stillness of the surroundings.","title":"Aerial view of a Polaris submarine transiting Puget Sound. Polaris and Poseidon submarines are berthed at a U.S. Navy installation nearby. They are to be replaced by the larger Trident submarines; facilities for them are now being built. The addition of the Trident facilities are expected to increase the area's population and affect the way humans and animals live in the area.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547674","547685","547708","542697","550840","546049","555708","555715","546945","548520","546317","545043","547276","548926","545156","544142"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["v","motorboat","boat","wake","landmark","speed","highlight","water","viewpoint","stillness"]}
