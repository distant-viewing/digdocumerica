{"path":"557041.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a man mounted on a white horse. The man, who appears to be middle-aged, wears a traditional outfit featuring a broad-brimmed white hat, white shirt, dark vest, and a dark, intricately patterned neckerchief. His expression is thoughtful or contemplative.\n\nThe horse has a predominantly white coat with some darker spots visible on its face, particularly around the nose and eyes, and a slightly tangled mane. The horseâ€™s tack includes a simple bridle and reins.\n\nThe background of the image is dim and blurred but suggests an outdoor setting with diffused natural light, possibly under the cover of trees, which cast speckled shadows on the subjects. The focus and lighting emphasize the rider and the horse as central figures, with a soft portrayal enhancing the serene or reflective mood of the scene.","title":"Mounted horseman who will take part in a parade through the town of Cottonwood Falls, Kansas, near Emporia, during its annual Flint Hills Rodeo, a major cultural event of the area. Horses and large cattle trucks are the featured models of transportation. It is a 19th century \"cowboy\" town in the heart of the Kansas Flint Hills region, and near an area designed as a possible site for a tall grass prairie national park.","placename":"Emporia (Kan.)","location":"Emporia, Kansas","nn1":["554010","543787","553118","544420","553717","553716","554011","557043","557051","549198","543776","544308","544362","543783","544414","553064"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["horse","rein","bridle","mane","nose","rider","portrayal","vest","outdoor","cover"]}
