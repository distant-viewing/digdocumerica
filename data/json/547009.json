{"path":"547009.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach setting featuring several individuals, likely a family, engaged in various activities near the waterâ€™s edge. The overall tone and color palette suggest it could be late afternoon, with muted lighting and a partly cloudy sky contributing to a tranquil mood.\n\nIn the foreground, there are two primary groups of people. On the left, three young people are huddled together, possibly examining something one of them is holding. This group consists of two girls and one boy, who are intently focused on the object. The girls wear swimsuits, while the boy is in a striped shirt and shorts. \n\nOn the right, another group consisting of two girls are closer to the water. These girls are squatting down, seemingly engaged with the sand or water. Both are dressed in swimsuits, and their reflections can be seen clearly on the wet sand, adding a symmetrical aspect to the composition.\n\nIn the background, the shoreline extends into the distance where a pier can be observed. The pier, supporting a roofed structure, fades into the background under the overcast sky, adding a sense of depth and perspective to the scene.\n\nAdditionally, the calm sea, wet sand reflecting the sky, and the distant horizon line help set a peaceful, contemplative tone, typical of a beach environment. This image captures a moment of exploration and interaction with nature, typical of leisurely beach outings.","title":"Beach at St. Simon's Island","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["543225","555402","557507","552341","543493","554159","543072","546982","543534","548697","545162","548700","555892","546874","547877","555923"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["girl","swimsuit","sand","beach","pier","boy","group","squat","consist","outing"]}
