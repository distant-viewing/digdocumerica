{"path":"545245.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph displays an industrial setting focusing on a large metallic sign for \"Kaiser Aluminum Tacoma\", which is part of the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation. The sign is captured in a skewed, close-up manner, with the text angling upward from left to right, partially shadowed and backlit by the sun, causing some letters to be brightly illuminated.\n\nIn the background, a large industrial chimney stands prominently, emitting white smoke against a clear blue sky. The lower part of the chimney is obscured by the structure of the sign. The environment around the chimney appears industrial with visible structures that likely support the plant's operations and a few scattered utility poles.\n\nThe light is bright, suggesting it could either be morning or afternoon, underlining the contrast between the metallic elements of the plant and the natural light. Dust and lens flares are visible due to the angle of the sunlight, adding a gritty texture to the image. The overall composition juxtaposes the themes of industry and environment, highlighted through the interplay of the industrial structures with natural light and elements.","title":"Washington--Tacoma","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548193","552037","544691","557374","552190","557304","542705","545240","551034","546236","542521","543011","547198","542544","544777","545241"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","backlit","angle","sign","flare","lens","plant","underline","manner","cause"]}
