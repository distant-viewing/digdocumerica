{"path":"551304.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene rural landscape under a clear sky. Dominant in the foreground is a lush grassy field dotted with various shrubs and small trees. A small, calm pond reflects the sky and is flanked by dark green foliage. In the middle of the view, the field extends into the distance, with some areas featuring denser patches of shrubs.\n\nIn the background, the plain is broken by a horizon lined with trees and a few raised areas hinting at gentle hills. Toward the right side of the image, a small cluster of white and pastel-colored buildings, presumably farmhouses or barns, add a human element to the otherwise natural scene. The presence of the buildings introduces a sense of scale and distant human activity to the otherwise tranquil and sparsely populated scene. There are no visible people or animals, emphasizing the quiet and peaceful rural setting.","title":"Old pasture near eldon, a few miles north of bagnell dam","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["549256","555596","555567","557946","549222","557087","555603","545040","549142","555537","544481","557748","554722","549141","554767","549236"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["shrub","raised","pastel","farmhouse","introduce","plain","field","pond","barn","grassy"]}
