{"path":"551646.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant urban scene, presumably taken in a bustling city square or plaza. The scene is framed by verdant green tree branches in the foreground, which partially obscure the upper view but add a touch of natural beauty contrasting with the urban environment. The background is dominated by a large, multi-story building with modernistic architecture, featuring numerous rectangular windows and a reflective glass facade.\n\nIn the middle ground, there's an engaging view of a paved plaza filled with numerous bicycles parked in orderly rows, suggesting a bike-friendly location or a special event involving cycling. Overlooking the plaza, a large abstract sculpture, possibly made of steel, commands attention with its bold, swirling form, which adds an artistic element to the setting.\n\nThree young men are seated on a wide stone bench in the foreground, engaging in a casual conversation. They all appear focused on an object one of them is holding, suggesting a shared interest or discussion about the item. Their attire is casual, typical of the era which could be identified by styles reminiscent of the 1970s or early 1980s based on their fashion, such as jeans and simple shirts. Another individual, dressed in a black suit, walks nearby, adding a sense of movement to the scene. His presence contrasts with the more relaxed posture and attire of the seated men, indicating the diverse usage of this public space by different people. \n\nOverall, this photograph provides a glimpse into daily life in an urban setting, highlighting interactions among people, engagement with public art, and the coexistence of natural elements within a metropolitan landscape.","title":"Rockefeller Center--6th Avenue side","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551651","553158","551643","550076","551815","553319","551823","551829","550075","557257","551433","550751","553254","550083","550082","551493"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["plaza","bike","sculpture","1980","square","usage","art","bicycle","discussion","coexistence"]}
