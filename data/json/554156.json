{"path":"554156.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of a coastal landscape featuring a blend of natural and man-made elements. The bottom left corner of the image showcases a sandy beach adjacent to a body of water, the surface of which is shimmering due to sunlight. This beach stretches slightly into the center of the image, bordered by dense patches of dark green vegetation and some light patches possibly indicating dry areas or bare soil.\n\nOn the right-hand side, the landscape transitions into a more rugged and hilly area with an intricate network of roads or trails crisscrossing through it. The vegetation here looks sparser, with more visible brown earth, possibly indicating either less dense vegetation or different terrain. There are a few smaller clusters of trees scattered across the hills.\n\nToward the top of the image, the terrain flattens out into what seems to be a vast, rather uniform, open field or plain, extending towards the horizon. The color here shifts to lighter tones of brown, suggesting a drier, grassy landscape with less vegetation. There is a visible road cutting horizontally across this area that appears quite distinct against its surroundings due to its darker shade.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a diverse coastal environment with variations in vegetation, terrain, and human infrastructure, offering a detailed snapshot of a region where natural beauty meets human activity.","title":"Beach near puako on the western shore, one of the few beaches on the island aVailable to the public","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["547508","543427","557453","554157","553983","553982","557466","543425","554057","547629","547637","557504","548604","543088","554170","543328"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["vegetation","beach","terrain","flatten","shimmer","shift","crisscross","variation","road","patch"]}
