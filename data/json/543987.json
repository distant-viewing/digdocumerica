{"path":"543987.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a beachside cookout. The image is bustling with a variety of activities and individuals, set against the backdrop of a sandy beach and trees with a glimpse of water and boats in the background.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a large makeshift grill covered with aluminum foil where multiple pieces of food are being cooked, mainly what looks like sausages or kebabs. A man in a bucket hat, shirtless wearing plaid shorts, and holding a beverage cup, is actively engaging with the grill, turning or handling the food. He appears focused on his task amid the bustling scene.\n\nBehind him, there's a diverse group of people engaging in various social activities. Some individuals are seated on the ground or on logs, while others are standing and chatting. The crowd consists of men and women, some shirtless, others casually dressed in summer clothes like t-shirts and shorts.\n\nFurther in the background, others enjoy the beach environment differently, with some interacting near the boats and others roaming or relaxing by the shore.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and seems to imply a communal gathering with a focus on relaxation, socializing, and enjoying a summer day outdoors. The setting sun suggests that it might be late afternoon or early evening, adding a warm tone to the scene.","title":"Picnic on the banks of the Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["550026","557934","544986","557793","551276","557801","546127","548188","550228","546874","556297","550081","543534","550243","550932","557772"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["grill","other","food","summer","beachside","beach","socialize","aluminum","cook","enjoy"]}
