{"path":"550490.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a serene landscape dominated by rolling sand dunes and sparse vegetation. The dunes appear in multiple shades of gray and dark sand, creating a textured and rugged appearance. These dunes are intermittently covered with clusters of low-lying shrubs and bushes, exhibiting hues of green and yellow, adding a touch of life to this otherwise barren scene.\n\nAt the forefront and bottom of the image is a band of lush, golden-brown reeds or tall grass, contrasting sharply with the dark colors of the sand and the green of the vegetation. This suggests the presence of a water body or wetland area ahead of the dunes, which is confirmed by a glimpse of a shiny, water-like surface mirroring the light, visible between the reeds and the base of the dunes.\n\nThe interplay of light and shadow across the dunes and the foliage hints at a low sun, possibly early morning or late afternoon light, casting elongated shadows and enriching the colors of the landscape. The sky is not visible in the image, focusing all attention on the earthy tones and the textured surfaces of the natural elements.\n\nOverall, there is an air of quiet and untouched wilderness about the scene, captured through a careful composition that balances land, vegetation, and water in a harmonious color palette.","title":"Sand dunes on the banks of the Atigun River near the pipeline crossing point, view north.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545199","545200","543097","545203","547717","545207","544873","548230","547015","553058","543192","544415","548906","551553","545895","549037"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["dune","sand","reed","green","vegetation","band","wetland","forefront","light","base"]}
