{"path":"546096.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a single, multi-colored leaf, partially submerged in shallow water. The leaf, predominantly brown with spots of vivid yellow and hints of green, is decayed, showing signs of wear such as small holes and a slightly curled edge where it is not touching the water.\n\nThe water in which the leaf partially rests sparkles lightly, reflecting light caught on its rippled surface. Around the leaf, small pebbles and bits of sediment can be seen, likely contributing to the muddy, textured substrate in this wet environment.\n\nThe composition of the photograph draws attention to the textures and colors of autumn, and the transient, delicate interactions between natural objects and the elements around them. The overarching mood is one of quiet stillness and a poignant reminder of the changing seasons.","title":"The Calcasieu River is contaminated by industrial pollution.","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["546197","555030","544731","555178","551372","555044","551353","554737","551371","552693","552054","554603","542582","551352","551357","550341"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leaf","reminder","curl","hole","pebble","sparkle","sediment","stillness","yellow","autumn"]}
