{"path":"550430.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph depicts a red fox standing on a gravelly ground. The fox appears alert and is facing the camera with its mouth slightly open, as if it is vocalizing or panting. Its fur is primarily a vivid orange-red color, with white fur on its chest, throat and patches around the nose and mouth. Its legs are black up to the lower part of the limbs, transitioning sharply from the red of its body. The fox's tail, also red with a white tip, merges into the background.\n\nThe setting appears to be a natural, possibly wild area, with a non-distinct, out-of-focus background that suggests a natural landscape. The lighting is subdued, providing a soft overall effect to the image, accentuating the rich color of the foxâ€™s fur. Overall, the image captures a moment of natural behavior in wildlife against a blurred natural backdrop, focusing attention on the fox's expression and stance.","title":"A young female fox near galbraith lake camp","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550431","550432","542630","542629","550436","550468","545564","545556","555668","554621","551376","550802","544916","550804","543265","550803"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["fur","mouth","behavior","limb","nose","chest","tail","stance","tip","merge"]}
