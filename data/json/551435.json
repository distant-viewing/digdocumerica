{"path":"551435.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a man and a woman standing near a fountain in an outdoor setting. The man, centrally positioned in the foreground, is holding what appears to be a movie reel canister or a similar object, gazing down at it with a thoughtful expression. He has messy, mid-length blond hair and is dressed in a wrinkled, pink-striped button-up shirt tucked into dark trousers. Next to him, a woman with long straight brown hair, wearing glasses, a patterned light blouse, and a dark skirt, stands with her head turned towards him, listening or talking.\n\nA significant visual element in this photograph is a large, dark-colored fountain; the dome-shaped top of the fountain is in the center background, with water smoothly cascading down its sides. The background also features various individuals in soft focus, suggesting a bustling public space, likely a park or a similar recreational area.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph indicates it might be taken during the day, with natural light casting soft shadows and contributing to the vividness of the scene. The entire composition has a candid, natural feel, capturing a seemingly quiet, personal moment amidst a public setting.","title":"Sculptured water fountain and reflecting pool on nicollet mall provide a pleasant backdrop for a noonday chat","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551450","551640","553185","551468","551451","551858","551453","547834","550763","553224","553149","550080","551467","553219","549985","551462"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","canister","reel","shaped","cascad","wrinkle","caste","tuck","dome","hair"]}
