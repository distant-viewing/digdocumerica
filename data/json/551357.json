{"path":"551357.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph focuses on a few green maple leaves, captured against a softly blurred background. The leaves are arranged in such a way that centers one, which is completely visible and fully in frame. The visible leaf and others partially shown display a bright green color, glowing translucently with the backlighting, likely from the sun. The leaves have characteristic lobed structures with pointed tips, typical of maple leaves.\n\nSeveral water droplets are visible on the surfaces of the leaves, which add texture and suggest recent rain or morning dew. The water droplets catch light, reflecting it and enhancing the overall visual interest of the image.\n\nThe branches supporting the leaves appear thin and delicate, extending across the composition. The background is a diffuse mottling of darker greens and blacks, providing a contrast that makes the bright green of the leaves stand out more vividly.\n\nOverall, the composition and lighting highlight the natural beauty and intricate details of the leaves, creating a serene and refreshing visual experience.","title":"Rain drips from maple leaves overhanging the lake waters in Ha Ha Tonka, a region of exceptional natural beauty.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551353","557593","543620","558077","554727","551356","555044","544731","551371","543565","555040","543560","557539","546197","555032","543564"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["leave","droplet","dew","backlighting","green","tip","black","leaf","experience","rain"]}
