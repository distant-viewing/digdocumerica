{"path":"556489.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures an older man sitting alone on a porch in front of a house. The house appears aged, showing signs of wear with discoloration and peeling on the sidings. It has a steep, faded red roof, and a white window reflects some sunlight next to where the man is seated. The porch is simple, slightly elevated, surrounded by greenery, including thick bushes or small trees close to the building.\n\nThe man is seated on a chair, looking relaxed in a casual posture. He is wearing a plaid shirt and trousers, indicative of a humble, everyday outfit. His expression is thoughtful or contemplative, gazing out towards the viewer but not directly engaging with the camera. The overall mood of the scene is quiet and serene, suggesting a moment of peaceful solitude. The natural light suggests it might be morning or afternoon. The setting is rustic and suggestive of rural life, projecting a sense of tranquility and detachment from the bustling urban scenes.","title":"Otis Saunders, in his late 80's, suns in front of his home in Fireco, near Beckley, West Virginia. Like most of the older men in the area, he is a retired miner. Fireco was once a great mining town, but the region has been mined out.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552523","545524","545232","547792","556488","555580","558330","544219","545510","556484","558331","555532","548609","553090","551269","547812"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["porch","discoloration","house","man","siding","chair","trouser","outfit","wear","bush"]}
