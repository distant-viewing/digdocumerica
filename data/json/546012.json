{"path":"546012.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a nautical scene featuring a large ship and a person engaging in maintenance or inspection activities. Here are the detailed elements in the image:\n\n1. **Ship**: A large ship prominently appears in the image with the number \"1092\" painted in bold white figures on its bow. The ship is colored light grey with a feature that seems to be a lifeboat bracket positioned along the side. There are visible details such as railings, antennas, and possibly other sensor equipment on the upper parts of the vessel.\n\n2. **Person**: A man is present in the foreground, dressed in a long-sleeve green jacket and grey trousers, wearing a white hard hat. He appears to be inspecting or working on a structure possibly related to the ship. His attention is directed towards his task, and he seems to hold tools or equipment.\n\n3. **Sign**: Directly in front of the man, there is a weathered white sign with red and black lettering stating \"ASIAN POLLUTION EFFORT CONTAMINATED LIQUIDS MR. BOWEN\". This possibly indicates a pollution control or environmental monitoring operation related to the ship.\n\n4. **Background**: The background shows a clear blue sky with minimal clouds, suggesting a bright, sunny day. Other ships or ship-like structures are visible at a distance, reflecting an active maritime or dockyard environment.\n\n5. **Chains and Metal Structures**: Below and around the scene, there are heavy metal chains and structural elements, likely parts of a dry dock or ship repair yard. These elements enhance the industrial feel of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition reflects a maritime setting involved in ship maintenance or environmental operations, underscored by technical and industrial elements.","title":"This container skims and from activities at the Avondale Shipyard on the Mississippi River.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546008","544657","549590","546861","546040","549618","546802","549601","545147","552149","547474","551046","552303","546016","546934","547572"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","maritime","maintenance","bracket","antenna","operation","monitoring","inspection","equipment","repair"]}
