{"path":"550785.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene freshwater wetland ecosystem with a variety of natural elements. In the foreground, vibrant green grasses and aquatic plants, including patches of water lilies, are visible. These green plants accentuate the water's reflective surface, which mirrors the cloudy sky above. Prominent in the midground are stumps of dead trees protruding from the water, hinting at a once-thicker woodland area, now submerged or cut down.\n\nThe water body is extensive, covering the majority of the scene; it is dotted with more water lilies and some floating leaves, which add texture and visual interest to the composition. In the distance, a line of dense forest outlines the horizon, suggesting the water body is likely surrounded by a larger woodland area, which serves as a habitat for various species, both aquatic and terrestrial.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is calm and natural, with a cloudy sky suggesting overcast weather conditions, which adds a moody, tranquil tone to the scene. This habitat is likely a crucial ecosystem providing resources and refuge for a variety of wildlife, and playing a role in water purification and flood control within the landscape.","title":"Reckless logging in the 19th century desTroyed much of the great white pine forests of the north.
