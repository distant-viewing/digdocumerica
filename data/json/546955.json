{"path":"546955.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This image captures a lively and bustling beach scene, filled with various activities and elements typical of a busy shore during warmer months. The photograph shows a mix of beachgoers and boaters enjoying a sunny day by the waterfront.\n\nIn the foreground, we see multiple motorboats lined up along the water's edge. Some boats have people on board, while others are engaged in activities around them. Notably, one person is seated on the edge of a boat near the center, while another appears to be preparing or adjusting something towards the back.\n\nIn the background, there are more people scattered along the shore. Several individuals, including both adults and children, are standing or walking on the beach, wearing swimwear, suggesting a relaxed and leisurely atmosphere. The apparel choices vary, with some wearing typical beach outfits such as bikinis, swimsuits, and trunks, emphasizing the recreational nature of the setting.\n\nA jet skier is visible in the water, further out from the beach, adding a sense of action and recreation to the scene. The jet ski creates a dynamic contrast to the more stationary boats and leisurely strolling and lounging people on the shore.\n\nThe background also features a rustic two-storey building, suggesting a possible beach house or a nearby residential structure, lending a degree of permanence and habitation to the otherwise recreational setting. There are utility poles and a scattered arrangement of trees visible, contributing to a developed yet scenic coastal landscape.\n\nThe overall composition is vibrant, full of movement and color, portraying a typical day at the beach with various forms of water-based and beach activities. The image captures the essence of summer recreational cultureâ€”leisure, enjoyment, and community.","title":"The isle of palms is undergoing intensive development","placename":"South Carolina","location":"South Carolina","nn1":["546397","558233","549939","557772","546942","549934","548929","550243","550228","546874","553684","547482","553686","550931","555923","547628"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","jet","shore","boat","apparel","month","swimwear","beachgoer","skier","stroll"]}
