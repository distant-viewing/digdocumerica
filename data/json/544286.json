{"path":"544286.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph shows a monument set against the backdrop of an industrial landscape filled with large structures typical of a chemical or oil refinery. The monument itself has a classical structure, consisting of four short columns supporting a rectangular signboard that reads \"MONUMENT\" on top, and provides historical information below about a site called \"Viller√© Plantation.\"\n\nThe text on the monument recalls a historical event from December 23, 1814, when the British Army invaded St. Bernard Parish, and it lists the casualties suffered during a hand-to-hand night battle led by Andrew Jackson with American and British casualty figures.\n\nIn the background, complex industrial equipment can be seen: tall steel towers with various distillation or processing units, connected by multiple pipelines. There are also metal stairs and platforms visible for operational access. The sky is blue, adding a vibrant contrast to the metallic gray of the industrial facilities.\n\nThe green grass around the base of the monument injects a touch of nature into the otherwise industrial scenery. Some wild, overgrown vegetation suggests that this area might not be meticulously maintained.","title":"Historical marker noting plantation site stands at entrance to refinery.","placename":"Chalmette (La.)","location":"Chalmette, Louisiana","nn1":["544179","558041","550911","545363","545997","546064","546168","551082","542705","549713","545978","551998","546379","546207","550996","550917"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["monument","distillation","signboard","refinery","pipeline","stair","information","hand","oil","night"]}
