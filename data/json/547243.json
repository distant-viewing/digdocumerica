{"path":"547243.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of industrial activity in a large, open excavation site. The landscape is marked by dark soil and earth, indicative of ongoing construction or mining operations. The focal point of the image is the interaction between heavy machinery and haul trucks. \n\nIn the center, a bright orange excavator with a long boom and bucket is engaged in digging or moving the earth, positioned towards a pile of loose soil. To the left of the excavator, there are two large dump trucks with multi-axles; one is actively receiving a load from the excavator while the other appears to be waiting its turn or just having completed its load. Both trucks are painted white with visible dirt marks, suggesting frequent use in this dusty environment. \n\nThe pattern of tire tracks creates curved and circular lines on the ground, indicating the movement paths of the trucks and possibly other equipment. The overall environment is devoid of vegetation, emphasizing the industrial nature of this location. The photograph likely serves to document the scale and type of machinery used in such operations, as well as the extent of earth being moved or processed.","title":"Blue Plains sewage treatment plant: digging out a new site for the expansion of treatment facilities","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["544099","549245","555644","544138","552416","545831","555638","555606","547922","544107","554765","544135","549956","544134","547232","552418"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["excavator","truck","load","earth","soil","machinery","extent","dump","turn","boom"]}
