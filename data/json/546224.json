{"path":"546224.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph shows a scene at a seaside park during what appears to be the late afternoon or early evening, given the lighting and the slight haze in the atmosphere that suggests humidity or the remnants of a hot day.\n\nIn the foreground, an open-sided shelter with a flat roof supported by four bright yellow posts covers two picnic tables. At one of the tables are four people engaged in what seems to be either dining or enjoying a leisurely time together. There is a woman standing, appearing to engage with a young child who is sitting at the table. Both appear active in a conversation or an interaction involving perhaps the sharing or preparation of food. Another child and an adult, both seated, look towards the woman and the younger child, creating a scene of familial interaction. All individuals are dressed in light, casual clothing suitable for warm weather, hinting that it might be summer.\n\nThe picnic area is located on a grassy patch bordered by a sandy area, suggesting proximity to water. Indeed, behind the park setting, there is a broad expanse of calm water that reflects a serene, yet industrious background. Across the water, several industrial buildings, possibly warehouses or processing facilities, line the waterfront, distinguishing the areaâ€™s mixed usage of leisure and industry. Large cranes and other industrial machinery can be seen, indicating ongoing commerce or maintenance related to the facilities.\n\nAbove the picnic shelter, the edge of a red and blue flag is visible, blowing in the breeze, adding a small splash of color to the otherwise muted tones of the setting, and complementing the industrial yet peaceful seaside tableau.\n\nThe overall atmosphere captures a typical moment of mundane yet intimate family life juxtaposed against the backdrop of industrial activity, depicting a blend of natural leisure space and human economic activity.","title":"Lunching on the beach opposite the olin mathieson chemical plant","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["546134","552036","556298","557933","547756","552032","558188","545228","557488","555947","543631","543609","557955","553065","543372","546219"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["table","seaside","shelter","child","blow","distinguish","humidity","leisure","bordere","tableau"]}
