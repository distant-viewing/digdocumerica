{"path":"556803.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph appears to be taken from inside a vehicle, possibly a bus, as indicated by the prominence of the steering mechanism in the foreground. The driver is silhouetted, with emphasis on his arms, which maneuver the large steering wheel. The natural light from outside casts the interior in relative darkness, accentuating the silhouette effect.\n\nIn the background, seen through the bus windshield and side windows, is an urban landscape. Multi-storey buildings, which look to be part of a city's downtown area, line the street visible through the window. The view includes a traffic light displaying a red signal, and the reflection on the windshield adds a layer of texture to the scene.\n\nThe composition is balanced, with the driver positioned slightly to the left of the frame, leading the viewer's eye across the steering wheel to the cityscape beyond. The atmosphere conveyed is that of a typical busy city day from the viewpoint of a public transport vehicle.","title":"Passenger deposits her fare on a Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) bus in downtown Atlanta, Georgia.
