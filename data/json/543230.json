{"path":"543230.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor camping scene focused around a Boy Scout participating in a cooking activity. The young scout, wearing a traditional khaki uniform adorned with various badges, is seated on the ground near a small campfire. He appears contemplative or possibly tired, resting his chin in one hand while gazing at the fire.\n\nThe campfire itself is modest, constructed within a metal pan and surrounded by bricks to contain it. Above the fire, a handmade wooden structure supports a grill grate, under which some food items can be seen cooking. The smoke rises gently, contributing to the tranquil outdoor atmosphere.\n\nAround the fire, various camping equipment and supplies are scattered. These include several wooden logs, presumably for firewood, and a box labeled “Eldorado Banquet,” which suggests prepared food or camping meals. In the background, there’s a makeshift tent supported by poles and rope, with a green tarp as the canopy. Close to the tent, there is also a makeshift stand holding a camping lantern and another green tarp draped over a rope.\n\nThe scene is set in a grassy area, indicating a well-maintained campsite. The surroundings are somewhat blurred, focusing the viewer’s attention on the boy and his immediate activity. This setting evokes a sense of learning and adventure typically associated with scouting activities.","title":"Scout-o-rama","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["554511","554863","542727","551314","554682","544855","554687","557700","545497","551399","542726","545523","549451","554862","543162","543486"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["camping","campfire","fire","tarp","tent","food","rope","pan","lantern","cooking"]}
