{"path":"543598.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil scene in a freshwater pond or a calm lake, primarily dominated by an abundant growth of water lilies. The picture shows a close-up view of numerous lily pads and blossoms floating on the surface of the water.\n\nEach water lily features large, rounded, waxy, and vibrant green leaves, some of which are partially submerged in water, reflecting their adaptability to aquatic life. Among the greenery, several lily flowers are visible in various stages of bloom; some are tightly closed, while others display soft yellow flowers that pop against the backdrop of dark green pads.\n\nThe water surface is smooth, with minimal ripples, emphasizing the stillness of the setting. Reflections of the lily pads and the stems are faintly visible on the water's surface, creating a sense of depth and mirror-like imaging, contributing to the tranquility of the scene. The background is subtly blurred but indicates more vegetation and perhaps a faint line of trees or shrubs at the far edge of the water body, suggesting this scene is likely set in a secluded natural area.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is soft yet bright, indicative of daylight possibly during morning or late afternoon, which enhances the richness of the green leaves and the vividness of the yellow flowers. The overall composition emphasizes a peaceful coexistence with nature, focused on flora and quiet life forms native to freshwater environments.","title":"\"Water lilies\"","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["544592","550809","550808","555080","544474","554584","544588","558095","545387","554583","547639","543561","544525","550775","554591","551352"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["lily","pad","flower","water","richness","leave","blossom","surface","stem","bloom"]}
