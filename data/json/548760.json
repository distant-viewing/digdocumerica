{"path":"548760.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts a sparse, rocky landscape that appears to be part of a construction or development area. Several small plants are scattered across the foreground, planted in individual black pots and surrounded by clusters of white and light gray rocks, possibly coral or limestone. The texture of the ground is rough and uneven, with similar rocks and stones spread throughout.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple pastel-colored buildings, which seem to be a combination of residential and possibly commercial structures. The architecture is simple, showcasing flat roofs and a somewhat uniform design. The buildings are low-rise and painted in hues of yellow, turquoise, and white, which suggest a tropical or subtropical location.\n\nThe area is very open, under a clear sky with a few clouds, hinting at a sunny day which illuminates the entire scene brightly. There are no visible people in the scene, giving it a tranquil but abandoned feel. The surrounding vegetation is sparse, with only a few visible trees and shrubs around the buildings, contributing to the somewhat desolate appearance of the environment.","title":"Trailer park under construction at Marathon in the central Florida Keys.
