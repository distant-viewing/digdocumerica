{"path":"548873.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene by a lake with three individuals engaged in a focused activity. In the foreground stands a man, partially visible from the back, holding a light meter in his hands, which he is pointing towards something outside of the frame. His attire includes a casual dark shirt and he is wearing a wristwatch on his left wrist.\n\nSitting in the background by the rocky lakeside is a woman with blonde hair, dressed in a light-colored blouse. She is leaning forward, intently looking at a wooden box filled with various small objects and tools, likely related to the activity they are undertaking.\n\nNext to the woman, only the hands and the lower torso of another person are visible. This person appears to be engaged with the contents of the box as well.\n\nThe environment suggests a bright sunny day by a moderately wavy lake surrounded by sparse vegetation and some trees. The mood of the image suggests a focused yet peaceful activity, possibly related to environmental, geological, or biological research given the context of equipment and natural setting.","title":"California fish and game biologists take water samples at \"Goose Flats\" on the Colorado River.
