{"path":"546809.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant water-based scene, likely from a lake or harbor. In the foreground, a person is sailing a small, yellow sailboat equipped with a bright yellow and white sail that features a large black flower design. This individual appears to be maneuvering the sailboat close to a dock.\n\nIn the middle ground, directly behind the sailor, is a powerboat moored to a wooden dock. The boat carries several people, including adults and children, wearing casual summertime attire. One child seems to be pointing towards the sailor, while the others appear focused on someone outside the frame.\n\nThe backdrop shows a somewhat dated building possibly serving as a marina or boathouse, and another boat named \"Marg Leslie\" of Annapolis, MD is visible next to it. The building has large round windows on its top level, and its architecture suggests a mid-20th century style. The American flag flying from the stern of the nearby boat adds a patriotic touch to the scene.\n\nOverall, the setting exudes a relaxed, recreational atmosphere, emblematic of leisurely summer days spent on or by the water.","title":"Sailing in Annapolis inner harbor","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548058","548495","549415","548508","549411","543941","549423","543945","548511","549408","544667","544021","548513","549413","544029","549386"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailor","sail","sailboat","boat","boathouse","dock","summertime","moor","child","spend"]}
