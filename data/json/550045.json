{"path":"550045.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban outdoor market scene, vividly exemplifying a lively street environment likely from the mid-20th century. The view is from an elevated vantage point looking down on a street lined with tightly packed vendor stalls. These stalls, covered with large umbrellas or canopies, are filled with an array of fresh produce and other goods, attracting a considerable number of shoppers who browse and interact with vendors.\n\nThe market is framed on the left by a busy road where several vintage cars, indicative of the era with their distinctive body styles and colors, are either parked or slowly moving through. The right side of the scene features a three-story brick building with visible signage for \"Pete's Pub\".\n\nAbove the street and market, large billboards and signage are visible, contributing to the urban aesthetic. They advertise various products and services including frankfurts and one sign with a large animated figure. This outdoor advertising adds a commercial buzz to the atmosphere.\n\nThe background includes a view of more city buildings, some taller modern structures, which suggest a dense urban center. The sky is clear and bright, casting sharp shadows and contributing to the vividness of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph is a vibrant snapshot of city life, showcasing commerce, transportation, and urban architecture from a past era.","title":"Outdoor food market at Haymarket Square.
