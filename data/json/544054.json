{"path":"544054.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, open-pit mine characterized by expansive terraced excavation areas, each level descending deeper into the earth, showcasing a variety of earth tones from light sandy colors to deeper browns and reds. The absence of vegetation suggests a barren, arid environment. The terrain surrounding the pit features undulating hills and sparse vegetation, implying a rugged, rocky landscape typical of mining areas.\n\nIntricate roads weave around and into the pit, indicating the infrastructure needed for vehicles—likely trucks and heavy machinery—used in the mining operations. The lighting in the image casts a soft glow, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon, and accentuates the contours and textures of the dug-out layers.\n\nNo people are visible in the shot, emphasizing the scale and operation of the mine in comparison to individual human activity. The overall composition captures the vastness and depth of the pit and the significant alteration of the landscape due to mining activities.","title":"Open pit mines and smelter","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["544111","544112","549242","549167","553049","549172","544100","549241","554631","549177","555621","544096","544110","544785","554768","552177"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["pit","mining","mine","earth","comparison","alteration","operation","excavation","absence","contour"]}
