{"path":"552194.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph portrays a somewhat stark industrial landscape. In the background, there is a large factory complex with multiple chimneys, from which white smoke is billowing into the clear sky. The architecture of the plant suggests a mid-20th-century industrial design, typical for factories and processing plants.\n\nThe foreground shows a calm body of water, reflecting the factory and the sky. Some wild grasses are visible at the waterâ€™s edge, adding a natural element to the otherwise industrial scene. On the right side of the image, there is a pile of debris and discarded materials, including bits of wood and metal, suggesting pollution or neglect. This mix of nature and industrial activity creates a contrast between environmental and industrial themes.\n\nThe quality of the light, with shadows suggesting either early morning or late afternoon, adds a vivid blue hue to the sky and a serene ambiance to the water, contrasting the industrial activity. This composition invites reflection on the impact of industrial processes on natural landscapes.","title":"View of Crown Zellerbach Kraft pulp mill.
