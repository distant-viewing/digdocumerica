{"path":"553274.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a bustling outdoor scene with a focus on a \"Seeing Cincinnati\" sightseeing bus marked with the number 543. The bus is parked, and several people, likely tourists, are gathered around it. Some are boarding the bus, while others stand nearby conversing or looking at the bus. The bus driver and a few other individuals in uniforms can also be seen around the entrance of the bus.\n\nThe background reveals a sunny day in a lively urban square. There are numerous people, both adults and children, dispersed around the area. A prominent feature in the background is a large, striking fountain spewing water, providing a refreshing backdrop and gathering point for several people sitting or standing around it. The ground is paved with cobblestones, contributing to the quaint charm of the setting.\n\nThe attire of the people suggests a period look, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s, judging by the styles of the dresses, suits, and hats. The atmosphere appears casual and relaxed, with people engaged in leisure activities, indicating a warm, possibly summer day. Overall, this image captures a vibrant public space where people are enjoying their day, taking in the sights, and engaging in social activities.","title":"Cincinnati bought the privately-owned transit system renamed it \"metro\" and put new paint on the buses.
