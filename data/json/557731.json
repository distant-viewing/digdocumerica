{"path":"557731.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph shows a construction scene under a clear blue sky. The main focus is on a person who appears to be a construction worker, standing on the top of a tall, partially constructed wooden structure. The worker is wearing a white tank top and dark shorts, and is positioned amidst the framework of the structure, holding onto a piece of wood or tool, possibly engaged in the assembly or inspection of the edifice.\n\nThe structure itself is made of wooden planks and beams, supported by metal scaffolding. It has a multi-level design, with the worker located on the uppermost level which is open and exposed. The wooden planks used in the construction are light in color, likely indicating new or untreated wood.\n\nIn the background, there's a clear blue sky which suggests the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day. The composition focuses on vertical and horizontal lines created by the beams and supports of the structure, giving it a grid-like appearance that leads the viewer's eye towards the central figure of the worker. The perspective is slightly upward, emphasizing the height of the structure and the elevated position of the worker.","title":"Carpenter at work on the first unit of the new alpine village at the outskirts of helen.
