{"path":"542844.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural scene within a dense forest. A river flows gently through the scene, winding from the background into the foreground. The river banks are narrow and lined with small rocks and pebbles, and in some places, soil is exposed, suggesting gentle erosion from the water's passage.\n\nThe river is surrounded by a lush canopy of trees, prominently featuring tall, straight trunks and a rich assortment of green foliage. Various trees appear to be draped with moss, adding to the feel of a damp, richly vegetated environment. The foliage varies in color from vibrant greens to slightly yellower tints, hinting at diversity in the types of trees and possibly the time of year.\n\nThe overhead canopy casts gentle shadows on the surface of the river, creating a pattern of light and dark areas that lend a sense of tranquility and depth to the scene. There is no visible sky due to the density of the tree coverage.\n\nOverall, the composition underscores the quiet beauty of a secluded forest scene, untouched and dominated by natural elements. No human presence or artificial structures are visible, highlighting the solitude and pristine condition of the environment. The mood conveyed is peaceful and somewhat mysterious, typical of a deep forest setting.","title":"California--near Klamath","placename":"Klamath (Calif.)","location":"Klamath, California","nn1":["555076","555075","557250","550845","544861","554629","550844","550656","550717","555218","546171","551348","558085","554406","550700","555222"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","forest","canopy","coverage","pebble","foliage","tree","assortment","year","drape"]}
