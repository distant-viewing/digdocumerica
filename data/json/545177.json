{"path":"545177.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a family of four walking along a wooden dock in a marina. The family consists of a man, a woman, and two young children, a boy and a girl. The man is at the center, wearing a white shirt, brown pants, and sunglasses, carrying what appears to be a folded beach chair or blanket. To his left, the woman, dressed in sunglasses, a dark shirt, and jeans, holds hands with the boy, who is wearing a light-colored shirt with printed graphics and jeans. To the man's right, the girl, also in jeans paired with a light blue shirt, looks ahead.\n\nBehind the family, a large boat painted in yellow and white colors is moored at the docks. The boat features several levels including what seems to be a control bridge. The American flag is visible on the back of the boat, adding a touch of nationalism to the scene.\n\nThe setting suggests a sunny, outdoor recreational day by the water, possibly the beginning or end of a boating trip. The relaxed, casual attire of the family and their content expressions convey a leisurely day of enjoyment and family bonding. The dock itself is rustic, composed of worn wooden planks, and there are other maritime elements, like mooring lines and cleats, visible on the dock. The foreground shows the backs of two other individuals, giving the photo a candid, in-the-moment quality that suggests an unplanned snapshot capturing everyday life.","title":"Sport fisherman, his family, his catch in the \"salmon capital of the world.\"","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554506","552821","554517","548523","552975","550029","551228","554177","548511","547879","543499","543515","544310","543944","544980","543530"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["family","dock","jean","girl","sunglass","boat","boy","shirt","bonding","back"]}
