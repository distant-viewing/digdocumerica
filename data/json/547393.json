{"path":"547393.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image portrays a serene rural scene captured at dusk or during the night. Visible in the picture is a vast expanse of a field, stretching into the distance under a dark, possibly twilight sky. The forefront of the image is reddish, likely due to the dim lighting conditions, showing what appears to be a harvested field with stubbles left from the crop, which create a slightly rugged and textured appearance.\n\nTwo significant features break the monotony of the field: a solitary, brightly lit white house and a smaller structure beside it, both positioned towards the right in the scene. The structures are illuminated from within, their lights casting a glowing beacon in the otherwise dim environment. They provide a stark contrast to the dark surroundings and add a focal point of interest and human presence in the vast natural landscape.\n\nThere are no apparent human figures or animals in the scene. The background remains simple and uncluttered, emphasizing the isolation and quietness of the rural setting under a dark sky, which could either be deep blue or black, adding a sense of tranquility and solitude to the photograph.","title":"Farm house at dusk south of Grafton.
