{"path":"547831.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a coastal scene with a focus on the environmental impact of human activity near water bodies. The foreground shows a sandy beach with visible pollution, including scattered debris like wood pieces, plastic, and other discarded items. A noticeable stream or runoff flows across the sand, possibly carrying pollutants from the land into the water.\n\nThe middle ground features a large body of water, reflecting sunlight, which suggests a bright sunny day. In the background, there is a clear view of engineering structuresâ€”a bridge and what appears to be a train crossing it, enhancing the industrial vibe of the area. This hints at the proximity of industrial or urban activity which might be contributing to the environmental degradation seen in the foreground.\n\nThe overall composition of the image combines natural elements like sand and water with human-made structures and debris, creating a stark reminder of the interaction between human activities and natural environments.","title":"Refuse-laden stream seeps into Jamaica bay on land owned by the jfk airport","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548741","547897","552127","544621","550280","550215","546393","546116","550197","546965","545034","552080","546374","544784","550352","545854"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["sand","runoff","reminder","pollutant","debris","engineering","degradation","water","plastic","proximity"]}
