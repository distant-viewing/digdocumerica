{"path":"542546.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, there are two men engaged in a conversation in what appears to be an industrial setting. The environment features an open area with a predominantly dirt ground. The man on the right, who is more prominently visible and facing the camera, is dressed in a white shirt, light-colored trousers, and is wearing sunglasses. He seems to be holding a clipboard or a binder under his left arm. A watch is visible on his left wrist. The man on the left, whose face is partially visible, is wearing a light-colored, possibly green, shirt. \n\nIn the background, there is a large industrial structure that has multiple levels and seems to be made of metal. It resembles some sort of processing plant. Plumes of smoke or steam are rising from the structure into the clear sky. Additionally, there is a large truck visible further back, indicating that this might be either a construction site, a mining operation, or some other form of heavy industry area.\n\nThe setting and attire suggest that these men might be supervisors, engineers, or managers discussing work-related matters at the site. The clipboard and relaxed posture of the man in the foreground suggest planning or review of the works being undertaken at this facility.","title":"Lou dooley, registered sanitarian with air pollution control board, talks with the owner of an asphalt batch plant","placename":"San Joaquin (Fresno County, Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin, California","nn1":["544969","546628","543995","544022","549947","547382","555563","546824","557727","552368","546036","545537","548277","543651","544105","545672"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["clipboard","man","review","wrist","site","matter","discuss","planning","face","sunglasse"]}
