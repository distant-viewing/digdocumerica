{"path":"554674.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene during sunset or sunrise. A person, silhouetted against the dim light, seems to be setting up or holding onto a large red cloth or tarp, which contrasts vividly with the predominantly dark and natural tones of the background.\n\nThe setting is in a mountainous area, as evidenced by the softly curved silhouettes of mountain peaks visible against the sky. The light source, possibly the sun, is positioned low in the sky, towards the right-hand side of the frame, creating a lens flare that adds a dreamlike quality to the image. \n\nThe foreground consists of dense vegetation, also silhouetted, and does not compete for attention with the central activity but sets a rich, dark foundation for the scene. The person and the red cloth are near the bottom of the frame, but they are the most visually striking elements due to the contrasting color and the human activity in an otherwise tranquil and natural environment.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is one of peacefulness and solemnity, possibly suggesting themes of solitude, contemplation, or harmony with nature. The composition utilizes the rule of thirds effectively, balancing the natural elements with human presence, and the low light conditions enhance the mystique and mood of the setting.","title":"Camping at 4,000 feet on top of Mount Phelps as the sun sets over Algonquin Mountain and Wrights Peak, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["554515","555140","550646","542678","554731","554514","557519","557000","552896","543410","550429","548182","555131","542680","549446","552899"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cloth","silhouette","mystique","rule","solemnity","tarp","foundation","flare","harmony","lens"]}
