{"path":"543157.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a group of people engaged in agricultural labor in a field. The workers, uniformly dressed in long pants and long-sleeved shirts, are bent over, likely harvesting or tending to crops that appear to be short, leafy, and dense. Most wear hats, providing protection from the sun.\n\nIn the background, contrasting sharply with the pastoral foreground, is an industrial setting marked by two very tall smokestacks that dominate the skyline, along with several smaller structures and some smoke or steam emanating from the complex. The juxtaposition suggests a contrast between rural agriculture and industrial development.\n\nThe composition of the photo underlines this contrast, with the natural, low-rise agricultural setting in the foreground and the imposing, man-made industrial backdrop. This image captures a powerful narrative about land use and the coexistence of different economic activities within the same general vicinity.","title":"Radish pickers","placename":"Moss Landing (Calif.)","location":"Moss Landing, California","nn1":["557478","543845","548900","546964","553933","543159","553879","554108","543481","543858","554936","553659","549050","546398","554047","543012"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["harvesting","protection","agriculture","coexistence","vicinity","crop","steam","narrative","smokestack","labor"]}
