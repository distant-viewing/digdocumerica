{"path":"554923.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features a close-up side view of a woman wearing a large, black cowboy hat. Her expression is contemplative, with her eyes gazing downwards and characterized by an introspective demeanor. The woman appears to be of a younger adult age and has dark brown hair secured with what looks like a thin yellow rubber band, creating a small ponytail that falls just behind her ears.\n\nShe is dressed in a light-colored shirt with vertical stripes, which suggests a casual but outdoorsy style. The fabric of the shirt appears soft and comfortable.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, showing hints of a natural environment with diffuse sunlight filtering through trees. The color tone is warm, dominated by hues of brown and touches of blue sky peering through the branches, which adds a serene, almost peaceful quality to the setting. This gives the photograph a rustic and tranquil feel, focusing entirely on the woman in a natural landscape. The lighting, with the sun illuminating the profile of her face, highlights her features gently and adds depth to the composition.","title":"Young woman from San Antonio, Texas, who spends her vacations in Leakey, Texas, because she likes the people and has many friends in the town.
