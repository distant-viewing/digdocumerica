{"path":"546855.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a group of elderly women seated on benches in an outdoor public space. The women appear to be engaged in casual conversation, each dressed in distinct, patterned outfits that reflect styles likely from the mid-20th century. One woman, located in the forefront, wears a polka dot dress combined with a cardigan and white shoes, her hands gently folded in her lap. Others in the group sport a variety of floral and geometric pattern dresses. \n\nTheir hairstyles are notably styled in a manner typical of senior women from the time period the photo suggests—short and well-kept. Each woman carries a handbag or a small bag, resting either on their laps or next to them on the bench.\n\nIn their vicinity, there are other groups of people visible but blurred, indicating that the main focus of the image is the group of elderly women. The backdrop is a quiet urban setting with sparse trees, a paved walking area, and a glimpse of parked cars and a distant building, giving a relaxed community park vibe. The overall composition and emotional tone of the image suggest a serene day out, a snapshot of everyday life among friends enjoying each other’s company and public space.","title":"A rest and a chat on a park bench","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548646","557175","548625","547772","548647","551466","553484","551817","550679","556176","551444","557177","548626","551815","552722","553205"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["woman","lap","group","urban","cardigan","handbag","polka","fold","friend","hairstyle"]}
