{"path":"556493.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly couple standing on a narrow road. The man is on the left, wearing a dark jacket over blue denim overalls and a dark cap. He has a stern expression and wears glasses. He is using a walking stick that he holds in his right hand, wearing brown shoes, and seems to be gazing slightly down the road. The woman on the right is dressed in a long skirt, an apron, and a light-colored headscarf. She appears pensive or somber, her arms tucked close to her body.\n\nThe road they stand on appears to be a rural country lane, somewhat weathered and surrounded by green grass. The area is sunny and the shadows fall clearly on the road, indicating either morning or late afternoon. There are no visible buildings or other people in the image, giving it a quiet, secluded atmosphere. The focus and crispness of the image suggest it was taken at fairly close range, highlighting the solemn mood shared by the subjects.","title":"J.L.
