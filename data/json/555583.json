{"path":"555583.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural construction or development site viewed from an elevated perspective. The foreground features rocky terrain with sparse vegetation and a few bushes, indicating a hilltop or similar raised location. The center of the image showcases an active construction area where a new road or highway appears to be under development, curving gently towards the left. Several construction vehicles, possibly including trucks and earthmovers, are visible on and around the newly laid road, suggesting ongoing work.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes rolling hills and lush greenery typical of a verdant countryside setting. There are pockets of forest on the hills, adding to the rural ambiance. The sky appears slightly overcast, lending a soft, diffused light to the scene, which suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of transformation within a natural landscape, highlighting the intersection of human development and the rural environment.","title":"These hauling roads are being built by the hanna coal company in the area surrounding Barnesville","placename":"Ohio","location":"Ohio","nn1":["555630","555608","544812","549255","554809","557726","553378","549169","549203","543112","543105","549204","552814","547591","557728","556456"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["development","construction","hilltop","transformation","countryside","pocket","hill","intersection","road","lay"]}
