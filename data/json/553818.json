{"path":"553818.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features a simple, single-story rural schoolhouse, identified as \"La Prairie Grade School, Unit Dist. No. 3\" painted on its side. The building, set in a spacious and open landscape, is modest in architecture, with white wooden siding and a gabled roof. Two doors are visible, each adorned with small windows and located on perpendicular faces of the building. A prominent chimney rises from the roof, hinting at a heating system necessary for colder months.\n\nSurrounding the building is a large, grassy area with a collection of small wildflowers, predominantly giving a sense of a lush, green setting. A dirt road curves gently around the front of the schoolhouse, seemingly leading to or from local farmland, visible in the background as a flat, open expanse under a dramatic sky filled with fluffy, voluminous clouds.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed is one of tranquility and isolation, characteristic of many rural educational facilities of the past. The image captures a historical snapshot, suggesting a bygone era of simpler, community-centric education in rural America.","title":"Abandoned schoolhouse in La Prairie. (From the Sites exhibition.
