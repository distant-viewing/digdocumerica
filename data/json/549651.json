{"path":"549651.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph shows the interior of a bus that has been converted and repurposed for experimentation or testing, indicated by the large sign \"TESTFAHRZEUG\" (meaning \"test vehicle\" in German) placed across the back section of the floor. The usual seating has been removed, and instead there are wooden structures and boxes, possibly weights, laid out through the central walkway to simulate load or stress conditions.\n\nIn the middle of the bus, a person wearing a red shirt and darker pants, is kneeling on one of the wooden box structures. This individual seems to be actively working or adjusting the setup.\n\nThe interior lights of the bus are illuminated, suggesting either that the photo was taken during a time of low outside light or simply for better visibility inside the bus. There's another person partially visible through the door's glass at the front of the bus, suggesting other individuals might be involved in this test.\n\nThe bus is labeled \"CITY-BUS\", which suggests it was initially purposed for urban public transport. The open doors and view through the busâ€™s windows indicate the bus is parked in a lot, or a similar outdoor space likely used for the testing process.","title":"Prototype of mini-bus which will have a maximum speed of seven mph and will run on propane gas--later to be converted to electricity.
