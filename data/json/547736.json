{"path":"547736.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a controlled or natural field burning in an agricultural setting. The image is divided into areas showing different stages of burning and aftermath.\n\nIn the foreground and running through the middle of the image, there's a patch of dry, golden-colored stubble that remains unburned. This stubble appears short, indicating the crop was harvested before the burn. Directly adjacent to this area is a zone where fire is actively burning, marked by visible flames licking at the remaining stubble and producing a light smoke. The color of the flames suggest a moderate intensity, and the fire seems contained within its boundaries.\n\nBeyond the active fire, there's a large expanse of charred black land, indicating the area where the fire has already passed through. This charred land stretches towards the horizon, suggesting a wide and extensive burn area. The contrast between the blackened earth and the unburned golden stubble is striking.\n\nIn the background, the sky is a faded blue with puffs of white smoke drifting from the burning areas. It suggests a calm day without strong winds, which is typically preferred for controlled agricultural burns to prevent the spread of fires. The horizon line is distant and mostly flat, with only minimal structures or trees, emphasizing the expansive nature of this agricultural landscape.\n\nThis field burning technique is often used to clear fields of leftover crop debris, control pests and weeds, and replenish nutrients in the soil, preparing it for the next planting cycle. The photograph captures a typical scene of agricultural management, emphasizing both the destructive and regenerative aspects of fire used in farming practices.","title":"This entire field of straw west of El Centro in the Imperial Valley, burned off in less than half an hour.
