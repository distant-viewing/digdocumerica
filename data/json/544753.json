{"path":"544753.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph shows a busy industrial scene at a waterfront, likely a lake or large river, set against a scenic backdrop of a clear sky and rugged mountain terrain. There is a crane at the right side of the image, with its boom extended over the water. A large truck and desktop container sit at the base of the crane, appearing as if they are being used for a construction or maintenance project.\n\nIn the center and foreground of the image, individuals are engaged in several activities. There is a small boat containing a couple of people, which is floating near the shore. Nearby on land, several other individuals, who seem to be workers, are attending to different tasks. One of them is moving what appears to be a long piece of equipment or tubing.\n\nThe environment is rugged with rocky and uneven terrain at the shore, indicating a possibly remote location. Various other equipment and an umbrella-like structure add to the industrial feel of the scene. The overall composition highlights a bustling work environment juxtaposed against a serene, natural background, which suggests work related to water management, construction, or environmental monitoring.","title":"Small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["545648","547033","545635","546833","549308","545655","555796","553375","545657","545660","545641","547171","548774","545858","545631","544763"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["crane","tubing","shore","construction","boom","umbrella","attend","equipment","monitoring","rocky"]}
