{"path":"553616.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary figure in a reddish-pink hazy environment that blurs the background, creating a sense of isolation and mystery. The person, likely a worker due to the safety gear, is standing with their body slightly turned from the camera's view. They are wearing a white hard hat, a high-visibility vest over a long-sleeved shirt, and what appears to be heavy-duty work pants. Additionally, the individual is equipped with a shoulder bag, which could contain tools or communication devices.\n\nThe surroundings are nearly obscured by the dense, monochromatic haze, making it difficult to discern specific details about the location or the nature of the background. The overall color palette of the photo is dominated by shades of pink and red, potentially due to the lighting conditions, fog, smoke, or a filter used during the photography process.\n\nThe mood conveyed is somber and contemplative, accentuated by the diffuse quality of the light and the isolation of the figure within this undefined, almost dream-like space.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora. In post-fire salvage operations, \"cat skinners\" work in dust of caterpillar tractors. The \"cats\" haul logs of fire damaged trees to \"landing\" where they are loaded onto trucks for transporting out of the area. Soot and ashes from fire are so thick that drivers must wear face masks.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["544832","553615","554042","553610","547094","553599","556391","544171","553600","553623","546032","544094","553618","555263","545396","553639"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["isolation","figure","communication","pink","mystery","vest","discern","photography","fog","duty"]}
