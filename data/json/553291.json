{"path":"553291.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a focused and intense moment during a board game, seemingly a variant of chess played with pieces designed to look like miniature, colorful figures reminiscent of storybook characters or historical figures. The game is taking place on a table with a checkered board, and the pieces are vibrant in color, ranging from purple, green, yellow, and red, to blue among others. The pieces vary in shape and size, adding to the visual interest and complexity of the game.\n\nThe central figure in the photo is a man with a long, dark beard and a deep, thoughtful expression. He is dressed in a blue shirt and is seated at the table, looking closely at the board as he contemplates his next move. His hands are clasped together, and he holds a pen, suggesting he might be keeping score or making notes related to the game.\n\nTo his right is a partially visible milkshake or a similar beverage in a plastic cup with a straw, hinting at a casual, possibly leisurely environment. Additionally, another person's shoulder is partially visible on the left edge of the frame, indicating that the man is not playing alone.\n\nThe background is mostly dark and blurred, focusing the viewer's attention on the vivid, detailed game pieces and the player's contemplative pose. This set-up seamlessly blends intensity and playfulness, captured effectively through the use of lighting and depth of field that isolates the subject and the game from the surrounding environment.","title":"An absorbing chess game at Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553290","556219","553215","558191","548564","553197","546155","544213","553798","558320","546025","551958","548581","556551","544326","546140"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["game","board","piece","figure","table","playfulness","move","player","pen","note"]}
