{"path":"549264.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photo presents a vibrant maritime scene, set against a historical backdrop that suggests a coastal town, possibly in the Mediterranean. In the foreground, a large vessel labeled \"VILA VELEBITA PULA\" is moored at a quayside. The ship, painted in black and white, features a sturdy hull and a deck cluttered with equipment, including ropes and cranes, indicative of a working boat, potentially involved in cargo or industrial activities.\n\nSeveral individuals are visible on the ship, engaged in various tasks; two men appear to be handling equipment while another observes, collaboratively suggesting an ongoing maritime operation.\n\nThe background contrasts the industrial foreground with a serene historic town view. Prominent in the backdrop is a tall, slender bell tower, characteristic of Mediterranean architecture, likely dating from a significant historical period given its design and patination. The tower stands out against a clear sky, overlooking terracotta-roofed buildings that cascade down towards the water, hinting at a densely built, old European town.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the industrial aspects of maritime life with the enduring charm of historical architecture, captured under bright, clear weather conditions, contributing to a lively yet picturesque scene.","title":"The Vila Velebite II, the hydrobiological research ship of the Ruđer Bošković Institute, conducts several scientific projects for EPA.","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["549263","549362","546839","548403","549377","544657","555721","552000","544672","550043","549371","542905","546894","545147","546925","549892"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["town","ship","tower","bell","architecture","endure","equipment","cascade","overlook","date"]}
