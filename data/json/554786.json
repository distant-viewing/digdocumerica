{"path":"554786.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an old, weathered log cabin in a rural setting. The cabin is two stories high with a steeply-pitched roof and an external stone chimney on its right side. The logs have a grayish-brown appearance, signifying aging and exposure to elements. The roof of the cabin appears to be made of corrugated metal sheets.\n\nThe cabin features several windows: one visible on the first floor is boarded up, while another window on the upper floor is partially open, with broken panes. The door of the cabin is open, leading to a dark interior. There is no visible door on the hinges, suggesting abandonment or disuse.\n\nSurrounding the cabin is a quite bare landscape, with few trees and some sparse, brown vegetation, indicating a fall or winter season. There isnâ€™t much undergrowth around the cabin, which is located on a patch of cleared dirt land.\n\nNear the front left of the cabin, there is a kind of makeshift step made of logs. To the right of the cabin, a pile of branches and possibly other debris is stacked against the wall. The overall mood of the scene is somber and abandoned, evoking a sense of isolation and neglect.","title":"This old log cabin stands adjacent to land being stripped by the Ohio Power Company off Route 146.","placename":"Freeland (Ohio)","location":"Freeland, Ohio","nn1":["543350","549193","555231","546149","543339","545233","554788","554822","545518","552494","544865","554707","554084","552491","552455","557633"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cabin","log","floor","door","disuse","pane","undergrowth","sheet","roof","aging"]}
