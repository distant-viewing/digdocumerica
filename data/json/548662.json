{"path":"548662.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a two-story house with a distinct classical and Victorian architectural style. It is painted a soft color, possibly a light shade of blue or grey, complemented by white trim work. The house boasts ornate decorative elements, including intricate latticework and gingerbread trim around its curved balconies. These balconies are adorned with balustrades that echo the house's vintage charm.\n\nThe house features double-hung windows with shutters on the upper floors, providing a traditional look. The roofline suggests a complex structure, incorporating different levels and angles, further indicating the home's age and stylistic roots in historical architecture.\n\nThe house is surrounded by lush greenery, with various bushes and flowering plants, including bright punches of reds and other colors near the bottom of the composition. Tall, tropical green plants and trees peek behind and alongside the house, adding to a sense of secluded privacy and rich natural environment.\n\nThe image is captured during a time of day where the lighting casts deep shadows and enhances the structure's three-dimensionality, suggesting that it might be either morning or late afternoon. The bright sunlight and clear blue sky above hint at good weather and emphasize the vibrant color of the flora.","title":"A typical Bahamian-style residence of Key West.
