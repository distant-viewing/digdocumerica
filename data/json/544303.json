{"path":"544303.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a young boy fishing by the water's edge. The setting seems serene, likely a river or lake, given the calm appearance of the water surface shimmering with sunlight reflections. The boy is leaning forward over the side of a concrete dock or platform, intently focused on his fishing activity. He holds a simple fishing rod, which extends into the water.\n\nThe boy appears relaxed and absorbed in the activity, with his elbow resting on the concrete and his cheek propped up by his hand. His hair is tousled and light-colored, hinting at a sunny, possibly breezy day. He is wearing a casual two-tone t-shirt, mainly light blue with a darker blue collar.\n\nThe background is predominantly water, with no distinct features apart from the gentle ripples and the light reflecting off the water's surface. The overall mood conveyed by the image is peaceful and contemplative, typical of a quiet, leisurely day spent near the water. The primary focus is on the boy and his engagement with the act of fishing, highlighted against the simple, natural backdrop.","title":"Fishing off the pier","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["551025","551022","551024","550666","552257","550313","548138","554518","550231","550217","550776","555576","549935","554519","543516","543472"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boy","fishing","water","cheek","elbow","prop","spend","absorb","shimmer","collar"]}
