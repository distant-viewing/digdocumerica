{"path":"551664.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph depicts an urban setting with a large, decorative fountain that resembles a dandelion, from which water sprays outward in all directions. The fountain is centrally featured and appears quite large, with numerous thin, metal rods extending from a central sphere, each ending in a nozzle that disperses water.\n\nIn the foreground, a person wearing a bright yellow raincoat is actively engaging with the fountain. This person seems to be either adjusting something on a camera or possibly playing with the water, as they direct their attention towards the fountain.\n\nThe background shows modern office buildings with rows of uniformly spaced windows. The architecture is typical of mid-to-late 20th-century commercial skyscrapers, with a dark facade. Copy on one of the buildings is partially visible and reads \"First Canadian,\" suggesting the location might be in Canada, possibly within a financial or commercial district.\n\nThe setting also includes other pedestrians, apparently undisturbed by the fountain's spray, and some are seated nearby, suggesting the presence of benches or other urban furniture. The ground appears wet, reflecting the overcast or rainy weather indicated by the attire of the person in the foreground. The overall atmosphere is one of a lively, yet serene urban plaza where people can gather and enjoy the outdoor space amidst the hustle of city life.","title":"Pinwheel water fountain.
