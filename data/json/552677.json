{"path":"552677.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid scene of rural life, focusing on a cattle farmer at work. It features a man in traditional farm attire: a denim jacket, a red scarf, and a weathered cowboy hat, sitting astride a white sack, possibly filled with feed or supplies, among a herd of cattle. The cattle are densely packed and have a mix of dark brown and white fur, indicating they might be a specific breed.\n\nThe man's posture and attire suggest he is engaged in a common farming activity, possibly feeding or inspecting the cattle. His face, partly obscured by the brim of his hat, appears focused and reflective. The surroundings are slightly blurred, emphasizing the central figure and the cattle around him. The sky is overcast, and the overall tones are cool, suggesting this could be a cold day.\n\nThe composition of the photograph centers around the interaction between the farmer and the cattle, encapsulating a moment of everyday farm work. The natural, candid capture of this scene conveys a sense of authenticity and the hard-working nature of rural life.","title":"Frank starbuck, last of the old time ranchers near Fairview manages a spread of 1300 acres and 400 head of cattle.
