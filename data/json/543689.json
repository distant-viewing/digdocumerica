{"path":"543689.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This is a photograph of a young boy playing in a shallow body of water, likely a stream or small river. The boy appears to be mid-step, navigating carefully through the water. He is wearing a dark red T-shirt and dark shorts, with his bare legs partially submerged in the glistening water, which reflects light vividly, suggesting it might be a bright, sunny day.\n\nThe boyâ€™s expression is one of concentration and delight, and his arms are outstretched as though he's trying to maintain balance. His mouth is open, possibly talking or exclaiming something as he moves.\n\nIn the background, the area is shadowy and filled with green foliage, hinting at a densely wooded area surrounding the water. The shadows suggest a canopy of trees that are filtering the sunlight. This creates a contrast between the darker, serene background, and the bright, sparkling water. The overall setting feels natural and secluded, a peaceful spot for a child to explore and play.","title":"The Denver P.T.A. sponsored a week-long summer workshop to introduce school children to the natural environment.","placename":"Boulder (Colo.)","location":"Boulder, Colorado","nn1":["545539","544196","543685","547692","553430","544218","553245","553429","543677","544380","544352","551022","551160","552940","548837","553435"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["boy","delight","water","dark","balance","mouth","step","concentration","leg","stream"]}
