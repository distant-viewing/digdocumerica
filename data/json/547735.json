{"path":"547735.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of the rear part of a dark colored Mazda RX-3, focusing prominently on the brand name \"MAZDA\" and the model name \"RX-3\" emblazoned in metallic lettering on the car’s surface. The photograph is partially shadowed, with sunlight gleaming off the polished, reflective surface of the car, highlighting the texture and shine of the paint and the chrome trim around the letters and the tail light.\n\nTo the right side of the image, another car, which appears to be a vintage model, is partially visible. This car is facing the camera, giving a clear view of its front grille and one headlight, with a reflection visible on its bonnet, possibly indicating a bright, sunny day. The background is largely overexposed and blur, focusing the viewer’s attention on the more detailed foreground cars.\n\nThe composition utilizes a shallow depth of field, with the focus sharply on the \"MAZDA\" and \"RX-3\" lettering, while gradually blurring out towards the edges. This technique enhances the visual impact of the brand and model designation, signaling a strong identity connection to the automotive brand and model. The overall aesthetic is one of nostalgia and appreciation for classic automotive design.","title":"New cars awaiting shipment at Terminal Island, part of the Los Angeles waterfront","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["547746","554384","556205","547722","547494","557847","552787","542640","557052","557878","552800","542637","557917","545469","555476","557891"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["brand","model","car","lettering","bonnet","name","identity","blur","gleam","grille"]}
