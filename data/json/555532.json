{"path":"555532.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man sitting at a wooden table inside what appears to be a rustic, cluttered room. The man is wearing a red and black plaid shirt with suspenders and a black cap. His expression looks thoughtful as he gazes slightly off-camera, with natural light illuminating his face from a large window beside him.\n\nOn the table, there is a mug on a saucer next to a partially visible pack of cigarettes and a yellow box. The table and surrounding area are cluttered with various objects that suggest a lived-in space or possibly a workspace; there are books, boxes, papers, and what might be tools or kitchen items. The interior wall is plain and utilitarian, featuring a mounted fixture or appliance.\n\nIn the background, through the window, a gentle, diffused light suggests an overcast or foggy day outside, contributing to the serene and introspective mood of the photo. The overall composition has an intimate, documentary feel, capturing a moment of solitude and reflection.","title":"Uncharacteristically somber, this 76-year-old native of east Randolph, Vermont, finishes his morning's third cup of coffee.
