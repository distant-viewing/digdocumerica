{"path":"552544.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial setting situated in a rugged landscape. The foreground of the image features some shrubbery and earth tones, overlooking an expansive plant facility. This plant consists of various structures including several large metal silos, a tall chimney, connecting walkways and some factory-like buildings with large metal roofs. Different parts of the plant are connected through a series of metal conduits and staircases, accentuating its industrial nature.\n\nThe background reveals a broader landscape with gently rolling hills that are relatively barren, indicating a semi-arid or arid climate. The hills stretch out into the distance under a clear blue sky. The lighting suggests the photograph was taken during the day, and the shadows indicate a time either in early morning or late afternoon, giving the colors a warm, vibrant quality.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a mix of industrial activity set against a natural, perhaps even somewhat remote, backdrop that contrasts the man-made elements with the natural terrain.","title":"Anvil Points Research Center, a government facility, has been leased to Development Engineering Inc. which will test a new kind of retorting (distilling by heat) process to extract the oil from oil shale.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["544068","546122","545992","543642","543733","551112","546055","542553","544676","555542","543764","545998","554763","551082","551026","542705"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plant","metal","connect","conduit","staircase","shrubbery","hill","silo","overlook","walkway"]}
