{"path":"543808.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"In this photograph, a man stands outside of a building marked \"SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT\" with large, uppercase letters on a brick wall. The man appears to be conducting an experiment or demonstration, as he is focused on examining two clear plastic containers filled with a liquid that looks to be samples of water, possibly taken from the sewage treatment process.\n\nThe man, who is of medium build and wears glasses, is dressed casually in a gray t-shirt with contrasting dark and light banding on the sleeves. His t-shirt is slightly stained, suggesting he might have been physically involved in work or testing processes before this moment. He holds one container up towards the light, presumably to observe the clarity or contents of the liquid more closely, while the other container rests in his other hand at a lower position. \n\nThe setting is sunny and clear, indicating good daylight conditions for visual inspection of the samples. The overall appearance of the image suggests an educational or professional scenario centered on wastewater management or environmental science.","title":"Technician holds samples of \"dirty\" and \"clean\" water after treatment.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["543812","549628","543803","546904","543804","543797","543810","553657","546287","542662","547568","543799","546343","544998","549333","547718"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["container","sample","liquid","treatment","wastewater","science","process","demonstration","build","testing"]}
