{"path":"548373.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene likely set in a large city. The focus is a person standing on a street filled with elements that suggest it is a busy environment. The scene is filled with a mix of natural and urban components.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a man standing on the left side; however, his back is turned to the camera, making it impossible to see his face. He is dressed in a light-colored jacket over a darker shirt, paired with dark pants. He seems to be observing the street, specifically directing his gaze towards an area with steaming vapors coming from a large pipe.\n\nDirectly in front of the man, capturing a significant portion of the foreground, is an oversized, rusted pipe emerging from a hole in the street, surrounded by a wooden barricade marked with yellow and black stripes. This barricade also supports the pipe, and white smoke or steam is visibly emanating from the pipe.\n\nBeyond this immediate scene, yellow taxicabs are parked or stalled in traffic, suggesting a busy street and typical for a bustling urban setting. Behind the cabs, the lower parts of large buildings and a church-like structure with arched design elements and detailed stonework can be seen, contributing to a dense cityscape.\n\nThe lighting in the image is subdued, with an overcast sky, which casts a natural filter over the scene, dampening the color intensity and possibly hinting at the early hours of the day or a cloudy weather scenario.","title":"Outside gRand central terminal in midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549849","548326","549863","549859","545351","547695","553845","554308","549874","557278","550175","554310","550203","545396","548330","548410"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["pipe","street","stonework","hole","cab","emanat","stall","intensity","emerge","scenario"]}
