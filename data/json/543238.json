{"path":"543238.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene featuring multiple individuals engaged in various activities, seemingly in a garden or a natural bushy area. On the left side of the image, two adults are standing close together, with the younger one holding a pair of binoculars up to their eyes, likely observing something in the distance. Both are dressed in casual outdoor attire, including hats and light jackets, suggesting a cool setting or possibly a morning outing.\n\nOn the right side of the image, an older man wearing a dark hat and jacket is interacting with three children. He is holding a piece of paper, which he seems to be showing to the children. The kids, who appear intrigued, are attentively listening or looking at what the man is presenting.\n\nThe background is densely filled with greenery, including various shrubs and small trees, which creates a sense of being in a lush, natural environment. The focus and depth of field in the photograph suggest that it was taken during a moment of active engagement and leisure, capturing both the curiosity of the viewers with binoculars and the educational or sharing moment happening between the man and the children.","title":"Sierra club nature hike","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["545311","543234","544739","552033","551736","553371","553357","557985","553376","549314","555546","557005","543236","555947","544829","553065"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["binocular","child","kid","happen","jacket","hat","out","intrigue","listen","curiosity"]}
