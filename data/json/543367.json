{"path":"543367.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a view of an old, abandoned town, likely a former mining or pioneer village. The setting is a dry, arid landscape with sparse vegetation, primarily low shrubs, under a clear, bright blue sky. In the foreground, a dirt path, bordered by shrubbery, leads through the scene toward the town.\n\nThe town itself consists of many wooden buildings in various states of disrepair. The structures include small houses and larger buildings, some with details like wooden siding, pitched roofs, and verandas, all indicative of typical 19th or early 20th-century American frontier architecture. One prominent building near the center has a steeple, suggesting it might have been a church or community hall.\n\nThe paint on the buildings is faded, and many of the structures appear to be tilting or collapsing, indicating long-term abandonment and exposure to the elements. There are no visible signs of current human activity, reinforcing the ghost town ambiance.\n\nThe scene is framed against a backdrop of rolling hills, with the natural landscape further emphasizing the isolated and forsaken feeling of the place. The setting sun casts a soft light over the buildings, creating a quiet, somber mood typical of deserted places overtaken by history and nature.","title":"\"Ghost town\"","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543351","543341","543342","543349","543356","543353","545233","544137","545817","556330","543914","543354","554822","554707","543344","545813"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["town","building","place","steeple","village","hall","shrubbery","history","church","term"]}
