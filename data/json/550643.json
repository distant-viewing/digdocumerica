{"path":"550643.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a vast and diverse natural landscape, likely taken during the early hours of the evening, given the shadows and the soft glow of light that hints at either sunrise or sunset. The image predominantly shows thick, dense forests that are interrupted by patches of open land.\n\nThe forest is composed mainly of coniferous trees, dark and tightly packed, covering most of the terrain. Interspersed within the sea of green trees are small patches of deciduous trees showing hints of yellow and orange foliage, suggesting that the photo might have been taken during the late summer or early autumn, when the leaves start changing colors.\n\nIn several areas, the forests give way to open fields and meadows - these are seen as wide expanses of brown and beige colors, probably indicating grasslands or cleared ground. Within these open sections, dark green shrubs or young trees sporadically grow, adding diversity to the vegetation seen in the image.\n\nScattered throughout the landscape are small bodies of water. Some appear as narrow winding streams or creeks, reflecting light and creating vivid contrasts with the dark surrounding terrain. Others manifest as small lakes or ponds nestled within the trees, adding a reflective blue or dark surface to the otherwise predominantly green and brown palette.\n\nThe overall scene is devoid of any visible man-made structures or human presence, providing a sense of untouched natural beauty. The photograph encapsulates the wild, rugged terrain viewed from above, with variations in color and texture that indicate a rich, natural biodiversity.","title":"Typical country north of the chugach range, taiga forests and numerous small lakes","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["553567","550644","553570","550541","556906","553564","550578","550569","557003","550626","550566","550544","550629","555217","555677","553568"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["forests","terrain","creek","lakes","tree","biodiversity","interrupt","cleared","wild","ponds"]}
