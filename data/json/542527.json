{"path":"542527.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene landscape dominated by reflective water bodies. It appears to be taken during the day under bright sunlight, as indicated by the shimmering effect on the water's surface where the sunlight is reflecting. There are multiple patches of dry grass and shrubbery interspersed with still water. The foreground shows a grassy bank with dried, somewhat yellowed grass, which slopes down to the water.\n\nIn the middle section of the image, there is a truck parked on a narrow strip of land jutting into a large body of water. The truck has several people around it, possibly engaged in some type of outdoor or maintenance activity, given the rural setting and the presence of large industrial-looking equipment. Above and beyond the truck, more water bodies can be seen, surrounded by what looks like flat grasslands.\n\nOn the far right, a small portion of a structure or another vehicle can be seen parked at a distance, again suggesting some human activity or settlement in this otherwise natural and tranquil landscape. The overall sense is that of a peaceful, natural area possibly used for specific human activities relating to land or water management, likely within a rural or semi-wilderness area.","title":"Oil sump","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["554485","555386","553086","548030","556905","548129","545008","550357","557503","555570","544607","550638","543809","552040","553083","548868"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["truck","water","bodie","relate","jutt","grassland","land","yellow","shrubbery","outdoor"]}
