{"path":"551652.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban scene, likely from a downtown area in a major city. The focus is on a busy street lined with tall office buildings that have a modern architectural style. These structures have a mix of glass and steel facades, reflecting the hustle of city life.\n\nAt the street level, there is a variety of activity. Numerous people can be seen walking along the sidewalks and crossing the street, engaged in their daily routines. The crowd includes both men and women dressed in typical streetwear, suggesting a casual atmosphere. Vehicles—including yellow cabs, which hint at this possibly being New York City—are visible in the street, contributing to the urban vibe.\n\nIn the foreground, the view is framed by bursts of nature, with large, lush hydrangea flowers in shades of pink and white resting in planter boxes. These floral arrangements add a touch of natural beauty and contrast to the steel and concrete surroundings. There are also patches of smaller green shrubs near the flowers, enhancing this natural framing.\n\nAbove, the sky is slightly overcast, casting diffused light that softly illuminates the scene. The presence of green foliage hanging from the top edge of the photograph suggests that the viewer might be positioned near or under a tree, adding a layer of depth and a sense of being personally present in this busy city environment.","title":"Rockefeller center","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551685","551644","551653","551665","557256","557257","551493","551743","553845","549849","556193","557281","551781","553840","546745","557266"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["street","steel","city","flower","resting","planter","burst","cab","hustle","downtown"]}
