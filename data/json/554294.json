{"path":"554294.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph provides a city street scene viewed from a perspective flanked by larger vehicles, with a focus on urban hustle and period-specific transportation. On the left, part of a white structural column or pole is seen, and on the right, the bold red cabin of a 1955 Red Top cab, as indicated by the text and number \"1955\" prominently displayed. The cab's window reflects another dark-colored vehicle.\n\nThe middle and background show a busy city street bustling with people and activities. There are multiple taxis in the scene, indicating a busy urban environment, possibly a business or commercial district given the presence of signs like \"HOTELS.\" Pedestrians, including men and women in 1950s attire, are walking along the sidewalk and crossing the street. One of the pedestrians, a woman in a light dress, is directly visible through the window of the red cab, looking towards the scene, thus also showing an interaction of life inside and outside the vehicles.\n\nThe lighting and color saturation suggest this might be a late afternoon or a slightly overcast day, creating a lively but somewhat subdued atmosphere typical of mid-century urban life. The environment includes tall buildings lining the street on one side, featuring a mix of business signage and architectural details typical of the era.","title":"Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549876","549869","549873","549848","554331","554310","554315","548331","549859","554330","545325","554314","554329","554316","548410","549881"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["cab","street","pedestrian","business","vehicle","taxi","hotel","hustle","city","saturation"]}
