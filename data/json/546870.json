{"path":"546870.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph features a large suspension bridge spanning a body of water. The bridge has two towering sets of pillars supporting a long, gracefully curving suspension system. The bridge’s structure is primarily metallic with the main cables and road deck prominently visible, providing a sense of scale and engineering marvel. \n\nThe pillars are painted in an alternating pattern of white and what appears to be a reddish-brown color, adding visual interest and aiding in maritime visibility. The bridge’s deck is busy with traffic, visible as tiny moving specks that suggest the bridge's role as a significant transportation route.\n\nThe water beneath the bridge is calm, reflecting a bit of the structure’s underbelly and creating a tranquil maritime scene. The sky is partly cloudy but predominantly clear, casting natural light that enhances the metallic sheen of the bridge’s cables and deck. \n\nIn the background, the landscape is relatively flat and open with minimal built-up areas, indicating that the bridge might be in a less urbanized region or leading to a quieter area of a larger metropolis.","title":"Chesapeake Bay bridges","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["546810","547669","552846","547703","547828","543313","549547","548207","548401","548415","546724","544542","549068","550954","549469","552598"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["bridge","suspension","deck","pillar","cable","metropolis","speck","sheen","maritime","engineering"]}
