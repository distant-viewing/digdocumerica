{"path":"556461.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a large sign greeting visitors to Williamson, labeled as “HEART OF THE BILLION DOLLAR COAL FIELD.” The sign consists of metal frames holding three main components: The uppermost part features a navy blue rectangle with the text “WELCOME TO WILLIAMSON” in bold, yellow font. Below this, a larger white rectangle states \"HEART OF THE BILLION DOLLAR COAL FIELD\" in black lettering. \n\nOn either side of the lower white rectangle, there are round logos representing different community organizations: the Rotary International, the Kiwanis International, and the Lions Clubs International. These logos are colorful and distinct against the white backdrop of the main sign. \n\nBehind the sign, a leafy, dense bush can be seen, suggesting the sign is placed in a lush, green area. The background indicates a natural, possibly hilly setting that frames the sign well, emphasizing its prominence and making it clearly visible to onlookers or passersby. The photograph appears to be taken during daylight with good lighting that enhances the readability and colors of the sign.","title":"Sign at the entrance to Williamson, West Virginia, proclaims the town is in the heart of coal fields.
