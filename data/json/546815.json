{"path":"546815.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures a scene within an industrial or construction environment. In the foreground, a male worker, dressed in work attire comprising of a grey shirt, darker trousers, and wearing a protective helmet marked with \"VT,\" is actively using a sledgehammer. He's in the motion of swinging the hammer down towards a large wooden structure, possibly for dismantling or adjusting the setup. The hammer is caught mid-swing, emphasizing the action and effort involved.\n\nThe worker is wearing glasses and appears focused and exertive, demonstrating physical strength in his task. The background is dimly lit, revealing more workers who appear to be engaged in similar labor-intensive tasks. The environment suggests an expansive industrial space, possibly a workshop or a construction site tunnel, hinted by the curved ceiling structure elongated into the backdrop.\n\nThe overall ambiance is gritty and busy, typical of a laborious setting. The lighting is minimal, primarily highlighting the main subject and his immediate surroundings, thereby drawing attention to the worker and his task. The overall tone and mood conveyed by the photograph are those of hard work and industrious activity within a challenging work environment.","title":"Bethlehem steel worker knocking out a support from under the \"chevron Hawaii\" prior to launching from the sparrows point shipyard","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["556391","544171","556880","547693","553618","544331","542497","556315","556866","544316","553603","554918","553802","543741","555239","544018"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["worker","task","elongate","dismantle","work","swinge","strength","swing","tunnel","construction"]}
