{"path":"544022.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside an industrial setting, likely a factory focused on heavy or metal manufacturing based on the visible environment and materials. The primary focus of the image is two male workers engaged in a discussion. Both are dressed in work attire appropriate for a potentially hazardous environment: hard hats, protective eyewear, gloves, and long sleeves. One of the workers is holding documents or a notebook, suggesting a planning, inspection, or supervisory activity, while the other holds a large wrench, indicating engagement in physical labor.\n\nAround these workers, numerous cylindrical objects, which appear to be metal parts or tools, are neatly aligned and organized in rows throughout the workspace. These objects might constitute parts of a larger machine or assembly line components. The background is dimly lit, with high ceilings and an extensive steel infrastructure, emphasizing the industrial nature of the setting. Lights hanging from the ceiling cast a warm glow, contrasting with the predominantly darker tones of the scene. The ambiance suggests a typical, busy workday in a manufacturing plant, with emphasis on activity and productivity.","title":"Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co.'s electrowinning refining plant.
