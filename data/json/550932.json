{"path":"550932.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph shows a vibrant scene on a crowded beach. The beach is covered with sand and dotted with numerous people engaged in different activities. In the foreground, there's a man reclining near a cooler, seemingly enjoying the sun. Close to him, and spread throughout the image, various individuals are seen sunbathing, with some lying on beach towels and others on inflatable mattresses.\n\nToward the middle of the frame, a group of individuals are standing and chatting. Some wear swimsuits while others are shirtless, wearing shorts. Notably, one person in the background throws a beach towel or cloth over their head, spread wide as if in a playful or dramatic gesture.\n\nIn the background, you can see more beachgoers and some beach infrastructure like lifeguard towers and umbrellas. Buildings line the background along with what appears to be a boardwalk area, suggesting that this beach is adjacent to a developed urban area. The atmosphere is casual and leisurely, with people enjoying a sunny day out by the sea. The sky is clear, and there isn't much vegetation visible, which is typical for sandy beach environments. The overall mood is lively and carefree, typical of a beach setting during warm weather.","title":"Stewart Beach, on the eastern end of Galveston Island, one of the area's most popular summer playgrounds.","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["547491","547628","550931","553685","548541","546942","547680","553686","546794","550243","553683","550919","547482","547503","546874","553684"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["beach","towel","boardwalk","beachgoer","swimsuit","cloth","other","umbrella","gesture","sand"]}
