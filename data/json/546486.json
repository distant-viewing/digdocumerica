{"path":"546486.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph depicts an indoor office scene. A person, appearing as a silhouette, is seated at a desk in a room with subdued lighting. The individual seems to be engaged in some work, possibly reading or writing, as suggested by the posture and placement of what looks like papers on the desk.\n\nBehind this person, covering almost the entire width of the room, is a large window with vertical blinds that are nearly closed, allowing minimal light to filter through, casting dim, vertical stripes across the room. These blinds give the scene a somewhat private and isolated atmosphere.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a large, modern art painting hanging on the wall. The painting is dominated by two blocks of color: a vibrant, reddish-pink on the top and a deep black on the bottom, creating a stark, geometric contrast.\n\nThe room itself is otherwise minimally furnished and decorated, with a plain, neutral-colored wall and what appears to be a carpeted floor. The overall ambiance is quiet and somewhat stark, with a focus on the person at work and the contrasting bold art on the wall.","title":"Interior of cummins corporate office, built in 1972","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["548864","546471","546580","546479","546572","553088","557695","551897","557682","556250","552647","556014","548237","548072","552619","544326"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["room","painting","desk","art","wall","person","blind","black","caste","subdued"]}
