{"path":"556130.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features an outdoor scene at the Portland Terminal Railroad Company station. The focus is on a large, aged wall display positioned on the facade of the train station, just under the roof which is supported by green metallic beams. The display is captioned with the text \"Portland Terminal Railroad Company\" and beneath this, a welcoming message from the \"City of Roses\" which seems to extol the virtues of Portland's scenic and urban attractions, inviting visitors to enjoy and return, emphasized by the phrases \"Have fun in all your journeys, but do come back again.\" This message is surrounded by large painted roses, emblematic decals, and some deteriorating elements suggesting weathering over time.\n\nBelow the sign, the base of the building is painted in a muted teal shade and carries a banner that reads \"Thanks for using the train. Do come back again.\" emphasizing hospitality and customer appreciation.\n\nIn front of the building, a man is walking by. He appears to be middle-aged, wearing a light shirt, dark pants, and possibly glasses. His body language suggests he is in mid-stride and moving purposefully past a large, rough-hewn circular stone sculpture or monument, which stands on the paved ground near a doorway. The area appears quiet, devoid of any busy activity typical of a train station, suggesting it could be an off-peak time.\n\nThe surroundings reflect a typical train station setup but with distinctive, personalized elements which give it a local flavor, emphasizing regional pride and the historical significance of the terminal in the area. The overall composition of the scene conveys a sense of transit, history, and local identity.","title":"Union station sign at the Portland, Oregon, terminal welcomes travelers to the city of roses.
