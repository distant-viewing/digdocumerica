{"path":"543404.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and scenic coastal landscape. In the foreground, there are rounded cliffs covered in dense, colorful vegetation. The cliffs are blanketed with lush greenery and clusters of flowers, predominantly in shades of pink and white, creating a striking contrast against the natural earth tones of the rocks.\n\nOne particularly prominent feature is the cascading pink flowers that drape over the rocks, softening the ruggedness of the landscape. These floral clusters add a burst of color and texture to the scene.\n\nIn the middle of the composition, there is a person seated on a rock formation near the edge of the water. The person is wearing casual clothing and seems to be enjoying a moment of solitude, gazing out at the sea.\n\nThe background of the image features the calm, blue waters of the ocean, scattered with small rock formations protruding above the surface. These rocks create a natural breakwater, adding interest and complexity to the waterscape.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is serene and picturesque, inviting viewers to appreciate the natural beauty and tranquility of this coastal setting. There is a harmonious blend of rugged natural elements and vibrant flora, making the scene both dynamic and soothing.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove, Monterey Bay","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543199","542968","542917","543401","543184","543196","543202","553805","545122","543297","543299","545173","547592","543399","554082","543389"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","cliff","waterscape","breakwater","formation","flower","cluster","burst","appreciate","ruggedness"]}
