{"path":"545763.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene where two people are walking across a sandy ridge. The image is taken in a silhouette style against a muted and mostly featureless sky, which could be either during sunrise or sunset due to the lighting conditions.\n\nOn the left, a person appears to be walking upward towards the crest of the ridge, emphasizing an active posture. This individual's attire is unclear due to the silhouette, but they exhibit what could be a relaxed, comfortable walking style suited for a hike or leisurely walk in nature.\n\nOn the right, another individual strides forward, having just reached the top of the ridge. Their movement conveys a sense of purpose and ease. Both are distanced sufficiently to suggest they are walking independently yet sharing the same path and goal.\n\nThe composition highlights the vastness and isolation of the landscape around them, further emphasized by the expansive, almost blank sky above. The interaction of their silhouetted figures against the simple horizon line creates a graphic, contemplative scene, focusing on the themes of journey and companionship in a serene, natural setting.","title":"Family on whale rock, near upheaval dome, said to be the best exposed example of a salt dome in the world","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["543248","545859","544330","549037","544089","545768","545751","558097","545194","543417","545195","550234","547716","545772","548222","544315"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["ridge","walk","walking","ease","hike","crest","silhouette","companionship","stride","journey"]}
