{"path":"551144.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant street scene likely from the late 20th century, characterized by its vintage aesthetics and color palette. Two women are prominently featured at the forefront of the image, walking down the street. One woman wears a white dress and heels, and the other is dressed in a light pink short set with matching heels. They appear engaged in their surroundings, and one is turning slightly as if to speak to the other or observe something.\n\nIn the background, the main focal point is a classic movie theater marquee displaying the film titles \"Love Secrets of the Kama Sutra\" and \"Passion Seekers.\" The theater marquee, adorned with numerous light bulbs and a large, bold typeface, captures a distinct mid-century American movie theater design. A \"No Right Turn\" traffic sign stands on the left side of the foreground, enhancing the urban setting of the photograph.\n\nThe street itself is bustling with various people in motion and features typical urban elements like sidewalks, buildings with store fronts, and utility poles. The ambiance suggests a busy, lively downtown area. The color and lighting give the image a warm, nostalgic feel, typical of color film photography from that era.","title":"Entertainment on Summers Street, in downtown Charleston","placename":"Charleston (W.
