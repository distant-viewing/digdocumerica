{"path":"552871.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up portrait of an elderly man gazing upwards, slightly off-camera, giving the impression of deep thought or consideration. He is an older Caucasian male with visible signs of aging such as wrinkles and sunken cheeks, which add character to his face. His hair is combed back and is predominantly gray with hints of his original darker color. He wears large, square-framed glasses that accentuate his thoughtful expression.\n\nThe man is dressed in a light blue, short-sleeved shirt which is unbuttoned at the top showing a part of a white undershirt and what appears to be a glimpse of his chest. In his shirt pocket, there appears to be a small object, possibly a pen, with a pink top visible.\n\nThe background behind him is blurred but suggests a natural outdoor setting, likely near a body of water given the hints of blue and glare that suggest sunlight reflecting off a surface.\n\nOverall, the image has a candid quality, capturing a moment of reflection for this elderly man, set against a serene, possibly riverside backdrop.","title":"Lake Borgne oystermen claim release of Mississippi River flood waters has polluted their oyster beds.
