{"path":"553111.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of an elderly Asian man wearing a dark wide-brimmed hat and round glasses. The man appears cheerful, smiling broadly, and is making a \"V\" sign with his fingers, which traditionally signifies \"peace\" or \"victory\". He is dressed in a lightly colored shirt adorned with a small, detailed floral pattern. The image is taken from a side angle, focusing on the man's face and hand, with the background out of focus and featuring a subdued, dark blue hue. The lighting highlights the contours of the man's face and the glasses he is wearing, intensifying the reflective glare on his lenses. This, combined with his expression and gesture, creates a warm and engaging portrait.","title":"Spring roundup of paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake indian reservation, coralling and bRanding is done in five stages around Pyramid Lake, posing for the photographer","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["557056","548224","554857","556133","547179","548226","556084","552871","548251","556449","552873","556452","549122","547360","554858","547338"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["v","glare","intensify","man","finger","glass","peace","portrait","signify","brim"]}
