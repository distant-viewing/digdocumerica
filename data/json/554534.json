{"path":"554534.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, slightly overcast day at what appears to be a rural lakeside location. The foreground features a weathered, white boat turned upside down, next to which is a large barrel topped with a cone and a sign that reads \"PLEASE DO NOT THROW ANYTHING IN THIS AREA.\" Surrounding the barrel is an assortment of litter, including bottles and other refuse, contrastingly impacting the natural setting.\n\nTo the right, dense foliage predominantly fills the middle ground, partially obscuring a view of the lake behind, which reflects a gloomy sky. The backdrop is composed of a hilly, wooded area across the lake, suggesting a remote or less developed location.\n\nOn a wooden dock extending into the lake, two individuals are visible. On the left end of the dock, a child in bright orange trousers and a dark jacket is in motion, possibly running or jumping. Near the center, an adult stands watching the child; this person is dressed in dark clothing and appears to be holding something that might be a fishing rod.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its combination of human activity and environmental neglect, juxtaposes the joy of a lakeside retreat against the backdrop of nature marred by pollution.","title":"Accumulated litter piled in the foreground by trash cans at Twitchell Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550352","557734","543552","554552","552029","544266","546799","552158","550687","547525","546941","544567","546944","555547","551226","550812"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["barrel","lake","dock","child","cone","retreat","refuse","lakeside","litter","location"]}
