{"path":"553925.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a serene waterfront setting with several architectural and natural elements. In the foreground, there’s an expanse of tranquil water that reflects a soft sky. On the water, a small boat crowded with passengers is visible, creating a focal point of human activity. The boat is moving, suggested by the wake trailing behind it, indicating leisure or transport activity.\n\nThe middle ground prominently features a row of large, multi-storied houses or apartments built directly on the waterfront, elevated on stilts or a raised foundation to perhaps guard against high water levels. These houses have spacious balconies and large windows, designed to offer extensive views of the surrounding waterscape. The architectural style is modern, with flat roofs and a mix of wooden and possibly metallic materials, painted in earth tones that blend harmoniously with the natural environment.\n\nIn the background, beyond the houses, there’s a slight hint of lush, tropical vegetation peeking out, and a clear, partly cloudy blue sky overhead. The overall atmosphere of the scene is calm and picturesque, indicative of a relaxed, coastal lifestyle.","title":"Hawaii-kai, built on a swamp and a hillside, is a fast-growing area east of downtown Honolulu.
