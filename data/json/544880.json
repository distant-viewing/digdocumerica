{"path":"544880.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a close-up perspective of a dandelion seed head, backlit to emphasize its delicate structure. The lighting highlights the fine, hair-like filaments of the seeds, which radiate outward, forming a sphere of fine threads that capture the light, creating a bright, circular glow around the dark silhouette of the seed head's center.\n\nThe dandelion is positioned in the center of the frame, with its stem leading downward from the bottom of the seed head. The stem is vertically aligned and appears as a dark, slender line against the contrasting background. It casts a shadow and shows a few stray light reflections that add a sense of depth and texture to the composition.\n\nThe background of the image is a deep, dark blue, almost black, providing a stark contrast that makes the illuminated seed head stand out vividly. This simple yet dramatic background emphasizes the intricate details and natural beauty of the dandelion, turning an everyday sight into a striking visual object.\n\nThe overall composition plays with light and shadow to transform a common natural element into a piece of art, focusing on texture, contrast, and the ethereal quality of the dandelion seeds.","title":"Colorado--Uncompahgre National Forest","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["543602","557487","555189","543623","557617","545291","545699","557169","552554","555052","544586","557586","554586","554745","543596","545715"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["seed","dandelion","head","stem","thread","sphere","sight","art","center","texture"]}
