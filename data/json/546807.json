{"path":"546807.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a marina. A woman is standing on a wooden dock beside a white sailboat named \"Dawn Treader,\" which is registered in Baltimore, MD. The boat features prominently in the frame, with its name and registration painted near the stern. The sails of the boat are down, with the mainsail partially wrapped and tied around the boom, which extends out at the stern of the boat.\n\nThe woman, wearing a sleeveless top and shorts, is engaged in an activity, possibly coiling a rope or handling other boating equipment. She appears focused on her task, standing near a wooden piling that supports the dock.\n\nThe background features other boats moored in the water, indicating a busy marina setting. Several masts of different boats add vertical lines to the composition, while water can be seen rippling gently around the boats. Additionally, various green trees line the background, and overcast skies suggest a calm but cloudy day. The overall setting communicates a tranquil, leisurely day by the water, common in maritime environments.","title":"Preparing to sail from mooring in Annapolis harbor","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["542875","548528","543247","551228","548276","544130","548523","542902","544248","544244","542873","556192","542912","546877","543545","543035"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","marina","stern","name","dock","rippling","coil","piling","register","registration"]}
