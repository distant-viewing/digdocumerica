{"path":"542922.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and shaded forest scene dominated by large redwood trees. The focus is on the rich textures and dark colors of the tree trunks, which are massive and stand closely together. Sunlight filters through the dense canopy, illuminating small patches of leaves which add a bright contrast to the dark woods.\n\nThe bark of the trees is deeply grooved and reddish-brown, typical of redwoods, suggesting the majesty and age of these towering giants. The foreground features a particularly thick trunk with moss and other small vegetation clinging to its surface, highlighting the ecosystem's moisture and richness.\n\nNo people or animals are visible in this image, emphasizing the solitude and undisturbed natural beauty of the forest setting. The background is softly out of focus, allowing the viewer to sense the depth and density of the forest, while small specks of light suggest the density and height of the foliage overhead. Overall, the composition conveys a peaceful, almost mystical quality of a pristine woodland environment.","title":"A stand of redwood trees in Richardson Grove Park along Route 101","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554968","543447","554969","542845","554966","554990","542750","542745","555051","542748","554967","554976","543449","555057","542569","543442"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["redwood","density","forest","trunk","groove","richness","majesty","cling","speck","moisture"]}
