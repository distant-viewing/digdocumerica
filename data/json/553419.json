{"path":"553419.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph presents a river scene with a moderately turbid, muddy water flow. The river is bordered by lush greenery on both sides, consisting of dense shrubs and trees, creating a natural barrier and adding a touch of calm wilderness to the scene. Within the river, a variety of large rocks and fragments are scattered, some submerged and others partially exposed above the water's surface, indicating a possibly rocky riverbed.\n\nIn the foreground, objects that appear to be man-made debris or discarded items can be seen in the water, possibly indicating pollution or recent flooding that has swept materials into the river. To the left, the bank of the river shows a buildup of smaller stones and pebbles, suggesting sediment deposition or a lowering of the water level.\n\nIn the background, the view is partially obstructed by the dense foliage, but the silhouette of a building or an industrial structure is visible, suggesting an urban proximity or human development near the river. This could also hint at a source or contribution to the state of the river seen in the picture, whether it be pollution or structural modifications along the riverâ€™s course. \n\nOverall, the photograph captures the intersection of natural river dynamics with human impact, highlighting both the natural beauty of the river environment and the challenges of environmental conservation near urban or industrial areas.","title":"Clear stream flows above the Weyerhaeuser and Fitchburg paper mills","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["545866","546351","553420","551531","553003","542557","550947","546111","552953","550698","542881","550250","550950","550367","550369","547990"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["river","deposition","pollution","obstruct","modification","sweep","riverbed","flooding","pebble","course"]}
