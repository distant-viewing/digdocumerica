{"path":"542523.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image features a beautiful natural river scene, likely captured from an elevated viewpoint. The river, exhibiting a gentle flow, meanders amidst a rugged terrain and is bordered on either side by lush slopes densely covered with trees and shrubs, mainly evergreens. Notably, the river has distinct shores: one side has a mix of boulders and a narrow sandy tract shaded by several trees, predominantly medium to large in size, while the opposite bank is steeper and appears more forested.\n\nThe composition of the photograph captures the sinuous path of the river flowing from one corner of the frame towards the center, leading the viewer's eye along its course. Various sizes of rocks are scattered within the river and along the sandy parts of its bank. The color contrast in the photograph comes from the dark green hues of the vegetation, the lighter green of the river water, the sandy shoreline, and the earthen colors of the riverbank. These elements together create a sense of serenity and untouched wilderness in the scene. The overall mood of the image is peaceful, depicting a serene natural environment away from urban areas.","title":"Central California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544861","555075","551348","550656","546171","542844","550658","545861","552925","550616","555674","550700","555076","553452","542558","550527"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","bank","evergreen","size","course","serenity","boulder","viewpoint","riverbank","flow"]}
