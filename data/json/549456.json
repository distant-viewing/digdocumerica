{"path":"549456.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic aerial view of a winding river flowing through a valley. The river curves gracefully through the landscape, its waters delineated by banks of various shades of blue and gray, suggesting variation in depth and current. Surrounding the river, the terrain is composed of expansive, brownish grasslands that transition into steep, barren hills which rise sharply on either side of the valley. The hills display a rugged texture, highlighted with various shades of brown and hints of green, indicating sparse vegetation.\n\nAt the left foregound, there's a close view of the river's edge showing a small patch of brighter grass and rocks, contrasting sharply with the dark waters. The overall scene is devoid of any visible human presence such as buildings, roads, or bridges, which emphasizes the natural and untouched aspect of this landscape.\n\nThe topography and the winding course of the river suggest this might be a mountainous or hilly region. The overall perspective offered by the image provides a sense of tranquility and isolation, highlighting the serenity and rugged beauty of the natural world.","title":"Winding course of the Snake River viewed from trail near \"Suicide Point\" in Hells Canyon, wildest and deepest gorge in North America","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["549455","550542","550562","550526","544744","550616","550593","552925","550581","553452","550524","555575","550561","550487","542701","550627"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["river","valley","grassland","course","serenity","topography","hill","world","shade","variation"]}
