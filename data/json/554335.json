{"path":"554335.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph depicts a large pile of discarded and disassembled vehicle parts, primarily consisting of engines and metal components. These are stacked haphazardly, creating a chaotic and dense hill of rusty and muddy machine pieces. The parts vary in size and state of decay, with some components showing heavy rust and deterioration. Notably, there is a prominent engine in the foreground which appears to be partially intact, with other motors and mechanical parts clustered around it.\n\nThe overall scene suggests a scrapyard or a recycling facility dealing with automotive waste. There is no visible vegetation or other objects; the entirety of the visible scene is saturated with these metallic wastes. The color palette is dominated by dark and muddy hues, predominantly grays and browns, likely due to the state and rust of the metals. The lighting is dull, casting no significant shadows, which may imply an overcast sky, adding to the grim ambiance of the setting.\n\nThere are no people or animals visible in the photo, making the mechanical graveyard the sole focus. The pile extends into the background, showing the large scale of waste. The accumulations suggest significant consumption and discard of mechanical components, probably reflecting on larger environmental and economic issues related to automotive industry practices and waste management.","title":"AutoMobile scrap reclamation yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554334","554318","554300","542585","547625","553006","542656","552740","548147","554320","554301","547611","546268","554352","549023","553005"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","component","engine","rust","state","pile","consumption","entirety","scrapyard","deterioration"]}
