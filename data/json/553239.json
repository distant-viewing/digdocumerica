{"path":"553239.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene during a procession or public celebration. It features a group of people engaged in various activities that suggest a festive, carnival-like atmosphere. The foreground shows a banner held aloft, reading “Marilyn Wood and The Celebrations Group,” adorned with a colorful abstract design, possibly a stylized face in yellow, black, and red.\n\nThe participants in the scene are dressed in loose, colorful clothing, dancing and moving energetically. Some individuals are holding flags or pieces of fabric, integrating them into their movements, adding to the dynamic and festive feel. The attire and activities represent a cheerful, expressive gathering, likely part of a cultural or artistic event.\n\nThe setting is an urban environment, with skyscrapers visible in the background, contributing to a contrasting backdrop of rigid architectural lines against the fluidity of the movement in the foreground. The paved area where the event is taking place appears to be a public square or an open pedestrian zone, characterized by distinct paving patterns.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its action in the foreground framed by a cityscape, captures the essence of a lively public celebration within an urban setting.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
