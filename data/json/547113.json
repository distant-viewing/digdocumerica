{"path":"547113.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a maritime industrial scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, lending the image a moody atmosphere. It predominantly features a large crane on a barge. The crane is sizable, with its boom extended diagonally upwards towards the right of the frame. The crane is positioned in the water, and a visible jet of water or steam is being ejected with force on the rear left side of the barge, possibly indicative of some active mechanical operation or process.\n\nIn front of the crane on the barge, there’s another smaller vessel. Like the crane barge, this vessel is equipped with machinery or cargo—its exact features are not distinctly clear due to the quality and distance of the shot. It emits a large amount of smoke or steam, contributing to the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe background is subdued with soft light conditions and features the open water and a distant shoreline, possibly with piles of materials or more industrial equipment. The sky is overcast with stratiform clouds, enhancing the serene yet somber color palette dominated by muted purples and blues.\n\nThere are no people visible in the image, focusing all attention on the machinery and the activities at hand. The overall composition and the use of natural light evoke a feeling of isolation and the harsh working environment often faced in industrial maritime settings.","title":"Dredge barge at work inside breakwater of consumer power plant at ludington","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["551563","555807","552015","546934","551954","549305","546830","544127","550910","547579","555808","547223","545655","547109","555285","549308"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["barge","crane","steam","vessel","machinery","jet","upwards","boom","force","purple"]}
