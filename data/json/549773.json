{"path":"549773.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph features a stark and somewhat unsettling juxtaposition of urban decay and city skyscrapers. In the foreground, a large pile of discarded automotive tires dominates the scene. These tires, which vary in size and state of wear, are strewn haphazardly across the ground, suggesting neglect and abandonment. Some are still fitted with rusty metal rims, hinting at the long time they have been exposed to elements. \n\nBeyond the tire pile, there is a broader view of a vast debris field containing assorted waste: pieces of wood, metal scraps, and other unspecified rubbish piled irregularly over a large area. This scene of dereliction contrasts sharply with the background.\n\nIn the distance, the silhouette of a city skyline outlines prominently against a clear blue sky. Distinctly noticeable are twin tall buildings standing side by side among other urban architectures. This skyline provides a dramatic backdrop, symbolizing urban development and contrast against the disarray and discarded items in the foreground. The presence of smoke or haze near the lower buildings adds a layer of atmospheric effect, perhaps suggesting pollution or ongoing industrial activities.","title":"Illegal dumping area off the New Jersey Turnpike, facing Manhattan across the Hudson River.
