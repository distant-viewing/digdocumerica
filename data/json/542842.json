{"path":"542842.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph presents a breathtaking aerial view of a rugged mountainous landscape, predominantly covered with snow. In the foreground, steep mountain slopes are visible, featuring patches of snow and exposed rock, creating a stark contrast. A small, frozen lake sits nestled within a valley of these slopes, surrounded by snow and shadowed by the high ridges.\n\nThe middle ground extends into a vast expanse of dense evergreen forest that blankets rolling hills and valleys, stretching towards the horizon. These forests appear dark green, indicating they are likely coniferous.\n\nIn the background, the terrain rises again into distant mountain ranges that fade into a hazy blue, suggesting great distance and atmospheric perspective. The sky above is clear and bright, indicating fair weather, which enhances the visibility across this expansive landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its layers of mountain, forest, and sky, offers a vivid depiction of a remote, wilderness area, likely untouched and preserved in its natural state. The use of aerial perspective gives the viewer a sense of the grand scale and untouched beauty of this mountainous region.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542830","552143","552144","555690","555712","550413","550642","550423","555656","552173","555662","542519","550515","550510","550419","555678"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snow","mountain","forest","valley","slope","perspective","preserve","depiction","blanket","ridge"]}
