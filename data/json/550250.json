{"path":"550250.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of environmental degradation, featuring a partially dried up river channel surrounded by dense foliage. In the foreground, there is a large expanse of litter and debris strewn across the ground, primarily consisting of chunks of broken concrete, discarded materials, and patches of dark soil or mud. This garbage and rubble dominate the immediate vicinity, suggesting a site of significant neglect or aftermath of a demolition.\n\nIn the middle distance, the river can be seen winding through the landscape, with its water levels appearing notably low, exposing the riverbed. The banks of the river are overgrown with lush green trees and bushes, forming a dense natural barrier along the sides of the waterway.\n\nIn the background, further beyond the river, industrial structures are faintly visible, together with high-voltage power lines standing tall across the horizon, indicating the proximity of human infrastructure and activity. High stakes are involved regarding the environmental health and management of this area, emphasizing a juxtaposition between natural beauty and human impact.","title":"Landfill operation on Warner Road, along Mill Creek which flows into the Cuyahoga River (background)","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551531","556419","550950","550259","544810","552046","552098","545945","547485","552082","552936","547907","550947","553419","552089","552127"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["river","stake","voltage","demolition","chunk","riverbed","health","rubble","litter","mud"]}
