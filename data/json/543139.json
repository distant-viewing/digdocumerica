{"path":"543139.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a coastal scene with dynamic interactions of land and sea. Two individuals are prominently positioned on a rough, jagged rock formation, suggesting an outcrop of a rocky coastal area. The ocean in the background is tumultuous, with white waves crashing against the rocks, emphasizing the raw power of nature. The sea is a mix of dark and light blues, contrasting starkly with the white foam of the waves.\n\nThe rock formation itself is characterized by sharp angles and a rough texture, indicative of erosion from the sea. Its dark hue may suggest a type of basalt or other volcanic rock, which is often found in coastal regions exposed to severe weathering by the sea. \n\nThe two individuals, one seated and one standing, appear to be engaged in casual observation or conversation, enjoying the natural beauty around them. Their presence adds a human element to the scene, providing a sense of scale and the notion of human interaction with nature.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph casts a vibrant, somewhat dramatic feel, with the brightness of the sea and the deep shadows between the rocks creating a stark contrast. This possibly indicates that the photo was taken during a time of day when the sun was high, intensifying the vibrant blues of the ocean and the dark, almost silhouette-like appearance of the rocks and human figures.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of tranquility and reflection amidst the rugged beauty of a coastal landscape, highlighting both the enduring strength of the natural world and the fleeting presence of humans within it.","title":"Rocky coast","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543492","543309","553775","543295","545122","543204","545126","543250","543289","543092","545173","545130","553773","543307","543060","542917"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["sea","rock","notion","ocean","wave","formation","strength","intensify","blue","crash"]}
