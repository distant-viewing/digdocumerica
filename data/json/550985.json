{"path":"550985.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene overwhelmed by pollution. The foreground is dominated by two towering water tanks standing on lattice-like steel supports, a motif suggestive of typical American industrial architectures from the mid-20th century. These cylindrical tanks are silhouetted against a disturbingly dense and voluminous cloud of smoke that fills the background. The smoke is thick and colored in hues of grey and brown, obscuring much of the environment and casting a muted, almost sepia-toned filter over the scene.\n\nBetween the two water tanks, the faint outline of a sun can be seen, dimmed by the heavy smoke to the point where it resembles more a pale moon. This addition adds a dystopian element to the scene, highlighting the environmental impact of industrial activity.\n\nIn the middle ground, behind the structures, a bridge with visible trusses carries what appear to be train cars. This suggests that the facility might be involved in heavy industry or manufacturing, likely reliant on rail transport for goods shipment.\n\nMountains form the farthest visible background, their contours barely discernable through the haze. Their presence hints at a valley location, which might explain the accumulation of smoke.\n\nThis image powerfully conveys themes of environmental degradation and industrial excess, illustrating the impact of human activities on nature and air quality. The overall atmosphere is haunting, marked by a stark contrast between industrial might and environmental vulnerability.","title":"Emission from the Union Carbide ferro Alloy plant darkens the sky at Alloy WV.","placename":"Charleston (W.
