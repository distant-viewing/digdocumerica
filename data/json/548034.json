{"path":"548034.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a serene lakeside scene. In the foreground, clear and shallow water delicately laps over a stony bottom, creating gentle ripples. The transparency of the water allows for the visibility of pebbles and plants beneath the surface. Prominent in this area are clumps of green, grass-like vegetation sprouting directly from the watery edges, adding a vibrant natural element to the scene.\n\nIn the middle ground, the lake extends towards the horizon, bordered by dense rushes that are lush and abundant, implying a healthy aquatic environment. These rushes partially obscure the lake's far shore, suggesting its vastness.\n\nDominating the background is a peaceful yet intriguing view of the lake stretching out under a vast sky. This expanse is punctured by a solitary, weathered structure floating serenely in the distance, possibly a boathouse or a fishing shack, which adds an element of human activity to the otherwise natural landscape. This structure is supported by stilts and features a gabled, two-colored roof which stands out against the subdued blues of the water and sky. Beyond this, faint hints of additional vertical structures suggest more human activity or installations, possibly related to fishing or boating.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is quite balanced, with the natural elements in the foreground leading the viewer's eye towards human-made structures, bridging the conjunction of natural and human environments under a vast, clouded sky. The photograph exudes a sense of calm and isolation, inviting contemplation about the interaction between human life and natural landscapes.","title":"The mouth of the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550324","550778","548030","550493","543546","557562","546293","546530","545008","545229","543547","550750","551207","543531","543579","547127"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["lake","fishing","boathouse","shack","stilt","rush","clump","pebble","boating","lap"]}
