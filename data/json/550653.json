{"path":"550653.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This is an image of a lone kayaker paddling through a river. The river is wide and appears tumultuous, with visible ripples and somewhat choppy waters indicative of a rapid or swift-flowing section. The kayaker, centered in the photograph and slightly to the left, is facing away from the viewer, paddling downstream with a double-bladed paddle. The kayak is yellow, giving a stark contrast to the predominantly dark blue and gray tones of the river.\n\nAround the river are dense, lush green forests that run along the banks, stretching into the background. The trees are densely packed, mostly coniferous, with some variety in height and density. The sky is overcast, lending a slightly gloomy atmosphere to the scene with a dominant gray-blue hue that overlays the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of solitude and the scale of nature, with the human figure small in comparison to the expansive wilderness around them. It suggests themes of adventure, exploration, and the pursuit of outdoor and water-based activities in natural settings.","title":"Kayak near headwaters of the Androscoggin River, looking upstream from the Errol Bridge.","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["553333","558070","553334","554465","553335","550661","550657","550659","553336","558071","550663","555078","558068","543537","558069","557492"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","kayak","comparison","pursuit","paddle","density","adventure","exploration","ripple","height"]}
