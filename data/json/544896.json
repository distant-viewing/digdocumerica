{"path":"544896.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a cicada perched on a tree branch. The cicada prominently shows its detailed physical characteristics including its large, transparent wings patterned with prominent dark veins, and a robust body with a combination of brown, black, and white coloration. The insect's eyes are not distinctly visible suggesting the angle of the shot or perhaps the shading under its body.\n\nThe branches of the tree are slender and twist in various directions, some bearing clusters of needle-like leaves. These leaves are bright green and have a soft, thin texture, contrasting with the bark's rough, patched white and gray appearance. It appears as a typical scene possibly from a coniferous woodland, suggested both by the structure of the tree and the foliage visible.\n\nThe backdrop provides a very out-of-focus view of a clear blue sky, with no visible clouds, indicating that the photo was taken on a bright, clear day. This background serves as a simple, unobtrusive canvas that highlights the subject of the photo—the cicada—and the detailed texture of the tree bark and leaves. This setting embodies a tranquil natural environment, focusing on the subtle interplay of light and texture.","title":"Cicada in a pinon pine tree, Natural Bridges National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557585","555064","553872","544520","555196","549144","555062","544930","557102","557544","544514","544619","544479","544547","551355","543595"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["bark","leave","insect","branch","texture","canvas","vein","characteristic","needle","wing"]}
