{"path":"548633.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a calm sea or large body of water under a cloudy sky. In the center of the image, stretching horizontally across the water, is a long barrier or floating structure made up of multiple white triangular segments, each connected at their bases by a line, possibly a safety or demarcation barrier. The water is clear, allowing for visibility of submerged features or vegetation under the surface, especially noticeable on the left side under the barrier. The patterns in the water suggest gentle movement or currents. The overall atmosphere is serene with a hint of somberness due to the overcast sky.","title":"Seven mile bridge, longest of a series of concrete bridges linking the Florida keys from the mainland to Key West.
