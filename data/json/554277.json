{"path":"554277.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene, likely at a ski resort, where a group of people is gathered outside for socializing and refreshment. There are several individuals seated in yellow deck chairs arranged in a semi-circle. The setting appears to be the outdoor area of a wooden lodge, as evidenced by the wooden walls and a snow-covered roof visible in the background.\n\nThe people in the image are dressed in typical ski resort attire, such as insulated jackets and pants in various colors like red, blue, and white. Many wear colorful knit hats and sunglasses, appropriate for sunny, snowy conditions. A few individuals are standing, perhaps in conversation or moving around the seating area. The presence of beer cans on a small outdoor table suggests a relaxed, leisure atmosphere typical of apr√®s-ski.\n\nThere is an overall sense of casual interaction, comfort, and enjoyment among the group members as they engage in conversation, laughter, and the enjoyment of beverages, capturing a moment of shared leisure after, presumably, a day on the slopes.","title":"After the skiing--a rest and a drink in the late afternoon sun","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554237","554269","554218","554221","554273","554228","554276","554238","554235","554267","554245","550017","554275","554259","554243","554265"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ski","resort","enjoyment","refreshment","lodge","laughter","leisure","conversation","beer","circle"]}
