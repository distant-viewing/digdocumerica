{"path":"547568.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene centered around a wastewater treatment facility. In the foreground, there is a circular sedimentation or settling tank filled with water, exhibiting a reflective surface that mirrors structures and the sky above. A man is visible standing on a walkway at the edge of this tank, looking contemplatively at the water. He is dressed in dark clothing which suggests a work uniform. \n\nThe structure of the tank includes a partial fence-like border made up of regularly spaced vertical bars, and water is gently spilling over the side of the tank, creating a series of small waterfalls that cascade into a lower level, creating a slightly frothy surface on the water below.\n\nIn the background, substantial industrial buildings, possibly part of the same treatment facility, are visible. These buildings are equipped with tall smokestacks and the architecture is characterized by utilitarian, mid-20th century industrial design. There are also some structures that look like bridges made from metal, connecting different sections of the facility, and numerous utility poles and lines crisscrossing above.\n\nThe scene overall communicates a typical industrial working environment, focusing on water treatment processes. The reflection of the infrastructure in the water adds an element of symmetry and visual interest to the composition. The sky is overcast, imparting a moody, subdued light to the scene, which complements the industrial setting.","title":"Sewage treatment plant","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["548212","543572","542982","543573","548216","545840","549636","543810","546895","543568","544052","545836","543524","542987","548196","543574"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["treatment","tank","facility","wastewater","water","cascade","symmetry","bar","waterfall","border"]}
