{"path":"545203.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a striking landscape of a sandy area with undulating dunes under a vivid sunset sky. The foreground is dominated by soft, orange-tinted sand, marked with numerous small footprints and rippled textures typical of sandy environments. Visible are clusters of trees, mainly coniferous, which are interspersed amongst the dunes. Some trees in the middle and farther back appear dead or devoid of foliage, standing as stark, bare trunks.\n\nThe background extends to other dunes that recede into the distance, highlighting a play of light and shadow created by the low angle of the sun. The sky above is a gradient of deep blue merging into warmer orange and yellows near the horizon, suggesting the photo was taken either during sunrise or sunset. This lighting casts a golden hue over the scene, emphasizing the contours and ridges of the sand dunes and creating a serene yet somewhat desolate atmosphere.\n\nThe image does not contain any visible human activity or man-made structures, giving it a natural and untouched look. The overall mood is peaceful, with a touch of melancholy due to the stark, lifeless trees amidst the vibrant natural beauty.","title":"Part of the extensive sand dune area","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["545207","548230","545199","550490","545200","547717","553058","544415","548906","543097","552897","545748","543192","547015","545752","549037"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["dune","sunset","sand","footprint","sunrise","ridge","gradient","yellow","contour","play"]}
