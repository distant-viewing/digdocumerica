{"path":"545722.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph focuses on two vibrant red flowers with several layered petals, vivid in color, transitioning from deep red at the edges to a lighter red towards the center. Each flower has several yellow anthers on green filaments clustered at the center, surrounding a prominent green stigma. These flowers are likely part of a cactus, suggested by the visible spiny features and dry straw-colored grass surrounding them. The background is softly blurred, primarily consisting of neutral browns and tans, emphasizing the stark contrast and bright coloration of the flowers. The composition showcases the natural beauty and resilience of desert flora, thriving amidst an arid environment.","title":"Fishhook cactus blossoms","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544885","544891","544890","544877","545718","544582","545727","545712","554844","544875","545709","544894","554840","551380","549018","543451"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","red","cactus","tan","straw","petal","coloration","flora","resilience","center"]}
