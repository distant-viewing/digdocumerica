{"path":"555673.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph presents a panoramic view of a majestic mountain landscape, presumably taken from an elevated or aerial perspective. The scene features several elements indicative of a mountainous terrain, including diverse geological and natural features:\n\n1. **Mountains:** In the background, there are multiple mountain peaks, some of which show patches of snow, indicating higher altitudes and possibly colder temperatures in these areas. These peaks have rugged features, sharp inclines, and are dotted sporadically with snow patches enhancing their dramatic appearance.\n\n2. **Glacial Valley:** Dominating the middle portion of the image is a wide, U-shaped valley, typical of glacial erosion. The valley floor appears to contain a mixture of rocky debris and lighter colored sediment, which might be glacial till or moraine material left behind by a retreating glacier.\n\n3. **River:** A vivid river or glacial meltwater stream flows through the valley. It exhibits a braided river pattern, characterized by multiple small channels and islands of sediment. This suggests that the river carries significant amounts of silt and sediment, reshaping the valley floor over time.\n\n4. **Vegetation and forest:** The lower slopes of the mountains and the valley edges have greenery which could be a mix of dense forest and brush. This indicates that the area receives enough moisture to support such vegetation, contrasting with the barren higher altitudes.\n\n5. **Sky and lighting:** The sky above the scene is mostly clear with good visibility, contributing to the vivid colors and detailed textures observed in the landscape. The lighting suggests midday or early afternoon, providing a well-lit view of the valley and mountain features.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a breathtaking natural landscape that showcases the dynamic processes and stunning beauty typical of mountainous, glacially influenced environments.","title":"View south across the Richardson Highway, lower foreground, to the site of the Sheep Creek construction camp (shown in preliminary land clearing phase), the Lowe River Wortmanns Creek and Wortmanns Glacier (center distance).","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550630","550394","550497","550511","550592","550415","550512","550401","550516","550510","542830","550589","550441","555678","550413","550507"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["valley","sediment","mountain","altitude","peak","snow","river","floor","silt","glacier"]}
