{"path":"549756.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor setting where a young man and woman are walking together on a grassy path. The couple seems engaged in an intimate and relaxed conversation, suggesting a close relationship or friendship. The woman is on the left, dressed in a bold red, black, and white plaid jacket and dark pants, with her dark hair loose. The man to the right is wearing a light grey jacket and jeans, and his hair is longer and slightly tousled.\n\nThey are walking in what appears to be a spacious park-like area, with a lake and dried winter reeds visible in the background. The far landscape includes a bridge crossing the body of water and gentle rolling hills, partially obscured by a soft focus that emphasizes the couple in the foreground.\n\nThe overall mood of the scene is calm and casual, with an overcast sky suggesting a cool weather setting. The composition of the photograph, with its focus on the couple and the expansive natural environment around them, evokes a sense of quiet companionship and tranquility.","title":"Former landfill in Bergen County has been converted into a park","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["549755","550234","544337","553396","548833","554900","554901","551942","551426","558097","547834","551462","545489","554494","551945","550238"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["couple","friendship","jacket","companionship","relationship","hair","reed","woman","outdoor","plaid"]}
