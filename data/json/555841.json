{"path":"555841.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph displays a single primary object resembling an abstract or biological form, viewed under substantial magnification, likely in a microscopic context. The central object has an irregular, somewhat ragged silhouette, presenting a texture that suggests a composite of granular and slightly fibrous elements. The coloring ranges from vibrant orange at the edges to a deeper, burnt orange and some brown hues, evoking an impression of organic or possibly mineral origin.\n\nThe background is uniformly dark navy blue, accentuating the object's vivid colors and intricate textures. There are minimal specks and smaller particles scattered around the main form, appearing as tiny points of lighter blue, white, and orange, giving a sense of the ambient environment possibly constituted of similar material or particles in suspension.\n\nThe composition is straightforward with a close focus on the central organic or mineral-like form, providing a detailed examination of its structure and colors. The overall appearance suggests a scientific or exploratory nature, possibly related to studies in fields such as biology, geology, or materials science. There isn't any direct indication of human activity or manufactured objects, emphasizing the natural or scientific character of the image's subject.","title":"Detritus particle photographed at the atlantic marine fisheries laboratory at Sandy Hook, New Jersey.
