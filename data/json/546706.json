{"path":"546706.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph provides an aerial view of a river passing through a populated city. The river bends gracefully to the left in the midground. Along its banks, dense green foliage predominates, intersected by a divided highway running parallel to the river on the left bank. On each side of the river, there are clusters of buildings indicating urban and residential areas. Notable buildings visible include both low and high-rise structures, amidst a backdrop of dense patches of trees.\n\nIn the distant background, a distinctive arched bridge spans the river, and several smaller islands can be seen in the river. Beyond the bridge, the city continues, fading into the horizon. The skyline shows numerous buildings of various heights, contributing to a mixed urban landscape. The sky above is slightly overcast, with dominant blues mixing with streaks of white clouds.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the blend of natural and urban elements typical of a well-developed city area, emphasizing waterways, roadways, green spaces, and architectural diversity. The photograph also conveys a sense of calmness and scale, juxtaposing human development with natural beauty.","title":"Potomac river, looking south.
