{"path":"544613.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image showcases a network of electrical power lines and poles captured against a twilight or dawn sky. The silhouette of numerous electricity pylons of various configurations and sizes dominates the photograph, each supporting multiple wires and cables that crisscross in a complex, web-like pattern. The poles are structured in a linear arrangement, extending diagonally across the frame, which leads the eye from the bottom left to the upper right corner, giving a sense of depth and perspective.\n\nThe background of the image is quite muted, indicating it could either be early morning or late evening, with the sky appearing in a monochrome hueâ€”possibly dark blue or a shade of black. This adds a moody atmosphere to the scene and highlights the intricate details of the power lines even more starkly.\n\nThe overall composition effectively portrays the industrial theme centered around power transmission and energy infrastructure. There are no people or moving objects in the scene, focusing fully on the stark industrial beauty and complexity of the electrical distribution network. Such an image might evoke themes of technology, energy management, or environmental impact associated with industrial landscapes.","title":"Power lines beside North Kendall Drive","placename":"Kendall (Fla.)","location":"Kendall, Florida","nn1":["543728","547936","553830","549110","544355","553028","543903","549011","557977","546389","543926","548146","550183","543823","544277","542643"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Infrastructure Maintenance"],"terms":["power","energy","network","web","configuration","pole","pylon","transmission","electricity","distribution"]}
