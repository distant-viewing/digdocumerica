{"path":"546978.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a contrasting scene showcasing industrial activity beside a natural landscape. In the foreground, a marshy wetland area is visible, featuring clustered patches of long, slender grasses at the edges of a reflective water body, possibly a small pond. The water captures the reflection of the sky and some of the surrounding vegetation.\n\nBeyond the natural foreground, the background presents a starkly different industrial scene. Multiple large buildings with various vertical and horizontal structures dominate this area. At least one large chimney stack is visible, emitting a plume of smoke or steam into the sky, suggesting ongoing industrial operations. Accompanying these structures are piles of materials, possibly related to construction or manufacturing, and cranes, indicating active industrial work. The entire complex is busy with infrastructure that supports heavy industry.\n\nThe sky is relatively clear, slightly overcast, complementing the tranquil yet pensive mood set by the juxtaposition of industry and nature. The presence of the industrial setup so close to a natural wetland highlights themes of environmental impact and industrial encroachment on natural landscapes.","title":"Mercury waste from the Brunswick Pulp and Paper Company has desTroyed the marshland in front of the plant.","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["546974","544289","545996","550995","543813","546073","550694","545989","552194","554630","545993","557225","545112","552154","547539","545013"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["wetland","industry","encroachment","highlight","pond","manufacturing","stack","plume","steam","chimney"]}
