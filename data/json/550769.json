{"path":"550769.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and slightly darkened scene of two boats on a river flanked by lush, dense foliage. The light, possibly that of early morning or late afternoon, gently illuminates the water, creating a reflective surface that shimmers slightly under the influence of gentle ripples. The boats, positioned towards the center-right of the photograph, contain groups of people who appear to be engaged in a leisurely boating activity, paddling slowly through the water.\n\nThe foreground of the image is somewhat obscured by out-of-focus natural elements, such as leaves and branches, suggesting the photograph was taken from a hidden or sheltered spot amongst trees on the riverbank. This framing device adds a sense of depth and a voyeuristic quality to the scene, as if the viewer is secretly observing this peaceful moment.\n\nThe background is dominated by dark green tones of the tree-covered riverbanks, which reflect faintly in the water, enhancing the overall mood of tranquility and seclusion. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is calm and contemplative, inviting the viewer into a moment of quiet connection with nature.","title":"Paddling down the Wisconsin river from tower hill state park, two canoes and seven men retrace the 3000 mile trip made in 1673 by father marquette and louis Joliet, clothes and canoes duplicate those of the first explorers.
