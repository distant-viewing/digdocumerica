{"path":"555454.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph displays a neatly stacked pile of firewood in the foreground. The logs are cut uniformly and some are covered with a black tarp, possibly to protect them from moisture. The focus and close-up framing on the woodpile draw attention to the textures and patterns of the cut wood. \n\nIn the background, there is a residential setting featuring a large two-story house with white siding and a dark roof. The architecture suggests a typical American suburban style. A porch is visible with a dark railing. Adjacent to the main house, there appears to be another building, perhaps a garage or guest house, peeking from behind. This building has a similar architectural style and color scheme to the main house.\n\nThe setting is sunny with clear skies, and the lighting casts shadows of unseen objects (including the photographer) onto the ground and part of the woodpile, suggesting the photograph was taken during the day when the sun was fairly low in the sky, likely morning or late afternoon based on the long shadows. The environment looks well-maintained and tranquil, typical of a residential neighborhood. There are also lush green grass and a driveway visible, enhancing the suburban residential feel of the photograph.","title":"Until the fuel crisis it was very unusual to notice wood piled on front lawns such as this stack. Prices for precut wood skyrocketed overnight, but it still was purchased.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["554413","555507","543588","552547","542596","557326","553458","556426","550877","558110","556472","554412","554411","542595","557094","558102"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","guest","tarp","driveway","photographer","garage","scheme","moisture","framing","siding"]}
