{"path":"547352.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and serene natural landscape at sunset. Dominating the upper half of the frame is a large, dark cloud that spans across the sky, creating an intense and moody atmosphere. A brilliant display of sunlight penetrates through a break in the cloud, casting dramatic rays of light that spill across the scene. The rays illuminate parts of the cloud from behind, creating a stunning contrast between light and dark.\n\nBelow, a calm body of water reflects the glimmers of light filtering through the clouds, enhancing the overall luminosity of the scene. The shore of the water body is lined with sparse vegetation, which is silhouetted against the glowing horizon, adding texture to the otherwise smooth waterscape. In the distance, a faint silhouette of a landmass or vegetation horizon can be seen beneath the cloud, further anchoring the composition and providing depth.\n\nOverall, the composition is harmonious yet dynamic, characterized by its contrast between the dark, imposing clouds and the brilliant light of the sunset, creating a peaceful yet powerful natural spectacle.","title":"Sun rays through storm clouds over grafton, in the agricultural country west of Lincoln","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["553992","547047","545375","552335","547356","544944","554759","550391","543608","553857","545000","552338","557447","552277","552350","557591"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["cloud","ray","sunset","luminosity","glimmer","waterscape","penetrate","spectacle","spill","silhouette"]}
