{"path":"558017.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph showcases a serene outdoor scene featuring a canal-like water body reflecting the early evening sky. A series of utility poles are aligned along the canal's banks, extending into the distance and diminishing in size, creating a perspective effect. The poles are connected by multiple lines, likely power lines. On the left side of the image is a \"DANGER\" sign mounted on a post near the waterâ€™s edge, although the specifics of the warning are unclear due to the distance.\n\nThe landscape includes lush greenery with trees flanking the far side of the canal, their foliage dense and extending to the image's top frame. To the left, you can see a small part of a road or path parallel to the canal, and behind it there appears to be some type of white industrial or commercial building set among the green backdrop. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting a soft glow and long shadows across the scene, enhancing the tranquil and slightly mysterious ambiance of the location.","title":"Ohio-Erie Canal with the towpath at the right and Canal Road on the left, looking to the south from Stone Road, near Cleveland, Ohio. The canal flourished from 1833 to 1913 as a link between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi river systems. The waterway was put out of business by a flood and competition from the railroads. The canal is now a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located between the metropolitan areas of Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["544703","552521","544678","558002","544673","545949","544695","542631","552733","549032","553086","553428","545927","558011","550753","558016"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["canal","specific","pole","danger","warning","line","distance","post","glow","bank"]}
