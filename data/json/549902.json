{"path":"549902.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy multi-lane highway scene, captured from an elevated perspective. The lanes are filled with a variety of vehicles, indicating a bustling traffic flow typical of an urban setting. The vehicles include cars, trucks, and a prominently visible yellow semi-truck with \"SUNNY\" written on the trailer, all captured in motion blur, suggesting high speed and the bustling activity of the highway.\n\nThe composition features a strong diagonal element created by the direction of the highway, which moves from the top left corner of the frame to the bottom right, guiding the viewer's eye along the path of the vehicles. The overcast lighting conditions provide a soft diffusion of light, reducing shadows and highlighting the colors and details of the vehicles and the road surface.\n\nIn the foreground, there are multiple traffic lanes separated by white and broken white lines, further emphasizing the density of the traffic. Overhead, and somewhat blurred due to the focus on the moving vehicles, there's a street lamp extending into the frame, adding to the urban infrastructure elements visible in the scene.\n\nLines and textures are evident in the design and maintenance of the road, with patches and repairs visible on the surface, suggesting frequent use. A road sign, possibly indicating a junction or an exit, is also seen in the center, mounted on a pole at the divider, its details blurred but contributing to the context of roadway navigation aids.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the dynamic and bustling nature of an urban highway, conveying both the motion and the everyday use of this transportation infrastructure within a city environment. The focus on movement, the diversity of vehicles, and the infrastructure details together paint a vivid picture of modern urban transport.","title":"Traffic on the George Washington Bridge.
