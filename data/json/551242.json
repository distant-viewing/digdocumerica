{"path":"551242.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a large dumpsite where burning trash is visible in the foreground. On the left side, red flames and dark smoke rise from a concentrated mass of burning debris, including what appears to be tin cans, boxes, and general household waste. The center and right of the image show more of the wide, scattered trashfield, densely covered with discarded items such as cans, boxes, containers, and unidentifiable rubbish spread out over a vast area.\n\nThe surrounding environment contrasts sharply with the dumpsiteâ€”there are lush green trees in the background, indicating a forested area. Additionally, the natural landscape extends far into the background, featuring rolling hills under a partly cloudy sky. This juxtaposition highlights the impacting human waste on natural settings.\n\nPower lines running across the top of the image suggest the proximity of infrastructure, possibly indicating that this dumping site is not far from inhabited areas or accessible roads. This complex scene captures elements of environmental degradation caused by human actions.","title":"This burning dump at sunrise beach is scheduled to be covered over","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["550702","550801","550798","551243","551247","543824","554541","557307","551245","543832","552446","549957","550248","546381","549936","546246"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["can","box","waste","burning","dumpsite","inhabit","dumping","rubbish","flame","discarded"]}
