{"path":"553170.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a young boy leaning on a railing. The boy, who appears to be around elementary school age, is looking off to the side with a slight smile on his face. His expression conveys a sense of curiosity and contentment. He is dressed in a light blue button-up shirt and has short, closely cropped hair.\n\nThe photograph is taken from a slightly elevated angle, focusing on the boy from the chest upwards. His hands are casually placed on the railing, which appears to be made of a smooth, metallic material. The background is softly blurred, showcasing a darker area that suggests a shadowed indoor environment, possibly a building or under a structure, providing a neutral backdrop that highlights the subject of the photo.\n\nThe lighting on the boyâ€™s face suggests natural light, possibly coming from above, illuminating his features while casting subtle shadows. The overall composition of the photograph draws attention to the boy's serene expression and the simplicity of his posture and surroundings.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: youngster looks down from overhead walkway","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["543870","556606","558394","553168","553147","556138","553494","543476","549299","543744","546561","544222","553553","545307","546565","557034"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["boy","railing","contentment","school","chest","expression","button","curiosity","face","showcas"]}
