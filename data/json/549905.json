{"path":"549905.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a ferry terminal. The image is taken from an elevated viewpoint, looking diagonally across a crowd of passengers on a boarding platform. The platform is bustling with people who appear to be waiting to board or disembarking from a ferry.\n\nIn the back and slightly upper portion of the image, the ferry, labeled \"American Legion,\" is visible, suggesting that this could be a location in the United States or associated with American services. The ferry's cabin above the deck can be seen, indicating that this is a sizable vessel, possibly used for significant distances or large numbers of passengers.\n\nThe foreground of the image features the right side of a steel bridge-like structure on which people are walking. The railing of this bridge is made of metal with vertical bars, and thereâ€™s visible activity underneath it, possibly another walkway or additional parts of the boarding area.\n\nThe lighting and color saturation suggest this might be an older photograph or taken with film that renders deep and muted colors, specific to certain types of vintage or analog photography. The crowd consists of people dressed in varied attire, hinting at a chilly or moderately temperate climate given the visible jackets and heavier clothes.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a busy, transportational scenario with individuals in transit, characteristic of a bustling ferry terminal.","title":"Commuters at the Staten Island Ferry terminal in Lower Manhattan's Battery Park area","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549706","553797","549707","546840","549910","546773","546797","549900","543954","556855","555948","554176","545176","544599","553799","555967"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Crowds"],"terms":["ferry","boarding","terminal","crowd","passenger","platform","bridge","people","bar","saturation"]}
