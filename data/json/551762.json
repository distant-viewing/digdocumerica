{"path":"551762.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor lunch scene among three young men. The setting is an autumnal park, evidenced by a carpet of fallen leaves around the area and diffuse sunlight filtering through trees.\n\nOn the right, a man with a dark sweater and glasses is seated, inspecting a pocket-sized mirror or some small round object in his hands. He appears absorbed in his action, potentially adjusting his glasses or examining something on his face. Next to him in the center, another man dressed in a striped jacket over a lighter shirt is focused on eating directly from a large aluminum foil container he holds in his lap. He seems to enjoy his meal, paying no attention to his surroundings.\n\nTo the left, another individual, partly obscured from view, faces away from the camera, only revealing a side profile as he drinks from a colorful can. He wears a plaid jacket and is turned slightly inward toward the other two.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is casual and peaceful, with the young men enjoying a simple meal in the quiet of a natural setting. Their casual clothing suggests a cool climate, possibly in late fall. The trees around, showing sparse leaves, confirm the seasonal setting, providing a calm and relaxed environment for the group.","title":"High Rock Park, on Staten Island, has nature trails, wildlife preserves, and a garden for the blind.
