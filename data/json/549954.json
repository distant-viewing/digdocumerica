{"path":"549954.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a scene by the lake featuring a woman and two dogs aboard a small inflatable boat. The boat, predominantly white with bold red and blue stripes running its length, is floating near the shore. On its surface, it also features a simple graphic of a ski-jumper.\n\nThe woman, who is wearing a black and white striped swimsuit, is positioned at the bow of the boat, leaning slightly forward with her hands placed firmly on the side. Her long, dark hair falls over her shoulders and she looks attentively towards the shore, possibly preparing to either embark or secure the boat.\n\nTwo dogs are also present on the boat. The dog towards the front, which appears to be a black mix breed, is sitting up and facing the direction of the shore, perhaps alert to the surroundings. The other dog, a gray Schnauzer, is seated more towards the center and is also alert, facing slightly towards the right, engaging with its environment.\n\nThe water around the boat is relatively calm with small ripples, suggesting a peaceful setting. The background of the scene is vague, focusing more on the immediate setting of the boat and its occupants. The lighting suggests it might be a sunny day, although the atmosphere retains a slightly muted quality, perhaps indicative of an overcast sky or the quality of the photograph itself.","title":"Two schnauzers afloat on the Hudson River off Croton Point Park","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["544195","551310","549928","554486","545958","543942","548054","552316","549417","552982","549411","546976","546856","553403","546352","546356"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["boat","dog","shore","breed","graphic","ski","swimsuit","occupant","bow","quality"]}
