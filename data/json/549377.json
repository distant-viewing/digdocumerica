{"path":"549377.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a picturesque coastal scene likely taken from a boat or a viewpoint across the water. The central focus is a dense cluster of old, closely packed buildings that appear to be part of a historical town. Many of the buildings have faded facades which hint at their age and weathered histories. The architecture is varied, with several evident styles, and no uniformity in height or design which adds to the charm of the scene.\n\nDominating the skyline is a tall, slender tower which looks to be part of a church or cathedral. This tower is topped with what appears to be a conical spire and a cross. Adjacent to this, slightly elevated on a hill, is a large square building, possibly a religious institution, judging by its grandeur and positioning.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, on the water, is a medium-sized boat featuring a predominantly white hull and a dark trim. The boat looks like a working vessel, possibly used for fishing, given the presence of large visible booms or masts typically used for nets or lines.\n\nThe color palette of the photograph is quite muted, with blues, greys, and earth tones, suggesting it might have been taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. There's a slight graininess to the image which, combined with the color saturation, gives it a vintage feel.\n\nThe backdrop of the image shows a cloudy sky that casts a soft, diffused light over the entire scene, contributing to the serene and timeless quality of the photograph. The vegetation visible includes several trees, likely cypresses, interspersed among the buildings, providing a touch of greenery to the urban environment.","title":"The Vila Velebita II, research ship of the Ruder Boskovic Institute, heads out to sea.","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["549362","550318","542913","542878","549263","550322","550314","542907","542910","553327","549264","542918","542876","542877","545005","553326"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","graininess","institution","uniformity","tower","boom","spire","positioning","mast","building"]}
