{"path":"550848.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of leisure and outdoor activity, specifically fishing. The image features several people of different ages engaged in fishing along what appears to be a riverbank or lakeside.\n\nStarting from the foreground, there is a young boy standing and facing slightly towards the camera, holding a fishing rod. He has dark hair and is wearing a long-sleeved, pale sweater and red shorts. His expression is serious and focused.\n\nBehind the boy to the left, there is a seated older man also holding a fishing rod. He has gray hair and a beard, and is attentively looking at his rod. He is dressed in a red jacket and a two-tone shirt, with his legs crossed showing socks and casual shoes.\n\nIn the background, off to the right of the image, stands another older gentleman in a denim jacket over a red vest and blue shirt, actively fishing as well. He wears large framed glasses and a cap, and seems engrossed in his activity. Behind him, another figure in a darker jacket can be partially seen, holding a fishing rod as well.\n\nThe backdrop is lush with green foliage, enhancing the sense of a tranquil, natural setting suitable for fishing. The overall mood is one of peaceful concentration and shared enjoyment of a common interest.","title":"Fishing from the banks of the fox river near montello depending on the time of year, pan fish, bullheads and northern pike can be caught","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["548737","542564","549935","543164","542560","546811","548190","543516","550850","544223","557741","546800","553081","548132","551025","551410"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["rod","fishing","jacket","fish","boy","gentleman","hold","sock","hair","start"]}
