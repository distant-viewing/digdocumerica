{"path":"543594.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photo captures a construction scene where several workers are engaged in the building of a wooden framed structure under a clear blue sky. Four construction workers are visible, each performing different tasks which contribute to the ongoing construction work.\n\nOn the left part of the image, one worker stands on an upper level of the structure, holding a long, thin object, possibly a measuring stick or level. He is dressed in light-colored trousers, a striped shirt, and wears a safety helmet.\n\nIn the middle of the frame, two construction workers are more directly involved with assembling or securing wooden beams. One of these workers is bending over, focusing intently on either nailing or examining the junction of two beams. This worker wears a plaid shirt and jeans. The other worker next to him is in a crouching position, assisting or preparing to assist.\n\nOn the right, another worker stands confidently on a beam, with no visible harness, suggesting a lack of stringent safety measures. He is shirtless, showcasing a fit physique, and wears jeans and a tool belt. He is also holding what appears to be a power tool. His stance and demeanor project both ease and readiness, typical of experienced laborers comfortable in their work environment.\n\nThe construction entails a skeletal wooden infrastructure that suggests the building might be in the initial or mid-phases of construction. The wooden beams and framing indicate the structure could either be residential or a small commercial building.\n\nThe background is mainly clear sky, indicating fair weather, which is ideal for construction activities. No other buildings or landscapes are in view, emphasizing the focus on the construction activity and the workers. The workers' attire and the style of the wooden frames suggest that the photograph could have been taken in a suburban or rural setting.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with its dynamic range of activities and spreading of workers across the structure, highlights the collaborative and physical nature of construction work.","title":"Condominium construction","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["557730","553924","557731","547858","546837","546929","556642","547989","547218","555373","543544","556635","546414","553702","543593","544167"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["worker","construction","beam","measure","assist","safety","tool","jean","work","level"]}
