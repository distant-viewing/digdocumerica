{"path":"557527.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph displays a scenic view of a valley surrounded by mountains. In the foreground, nestled within the curves of the valley, is a large complex or community of uniform white buildings, possibly modular homes or similar structures. These buildings are arranged neatly in rows, reflecting a structured and organized layout. At the center of this community, there is a body of water â€“ likely a small lake or pond - that adds a natural element to the otherwise man-made environment.\n\nThe surrounding area features additional verdant patches and sporadic buildings, suggesting a mix of residential and possibly light agricultural use. The middle ground shows sparser vegetation and a few isolated buildings that appear residential in nature, which may indicate the presence of individual homes or small estates.\n\nThe background is dominated by mountain ranges that rise steeply behind the community. These mountains are covered in a mixture of greenery and bare rock, suggesting rugged and varying terrain. The image captures a clear day, but with a slightly hazy sky that might be indicative of distance or light atmospheric conditions. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photo emphasizes the juxtaposition of the orderly human settlement within the natural, rugged beauty of the mountainous landscape.","title":"Seminole springs Mobile home park, on mulholland drive near Malibu, California, on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county is one of the few developments in the santa monica mountains","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["557526","544816","557339","550525","556967","552603","556468","552595","557379","543746","552593","551101","557516","543750","556341","543738"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["community","mountain","valley","home","estate","building","settlement","pond","mixture","nestle"]}
