{"path":"552149.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene at a waterfront, possibly during a logging or ship repair operation. The central element of the image is a large ship, its hull towering over the scene, depicted with a dark shadow cast across part of its side. The ship appears to be dry-docked or moored next to a wooden platform or pier.\n\nOn the wooden platform, several people are engaged in various activities. The foreground shows individuals possibly dressed in work clothes; some wear helmets and others are shirtless, indicating a warm climate or strenuous physical activity. At least five men are visible. Two on the left seem to be conversing next to the ship, while in the center, another group is handling what appears to be ropes or cables, possibly used to secure the ship or manipulate logs.\n\nTo the right, two men are focused on guiding a large log, which they appear to be maneuvering with long poles. The use of poles suggests they might be trying to position the log either for transport or processing. This activity traditionally corresponds to the logging industry, where logs are floated via waterways and then gathered and organized at a mill or storage site.\n\nThe setting includes a clear blue sky and a serene water body in the background, which hints that this location might be near a lake or calm sea. The atmosphere of the image is industrious, highlighting manual labor and the handling of natural resources. There is also a sense of tranquility provided by the natural surroundings, contrasting with the human activity.","title":"'Logs for Japan'","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552148","552303","547474","548125","555797","546016","546917","545147","547572","546802","552216","546914","550910","546040","552244","544753"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","log","logging","platform","pole","mill","repair","handling","resource","clothe"]}
