{"path":"552748.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a somber urban scene featuring a solitary man who appears to be engaged in the act of sweeping a street. The setting is marked by a dilapidated red brick building with significant signs of wear and neglect. The facade of the building has boarded-up windows on the top floor, while graffiti covers the walls and shutters on the ground level, contributing to the sense of urban decay.\n\nThe man in the image is dressed in what looks like a worker's outfit—possibly a uniform—consisting of a cap, dark jacket, and dungarees over a lighter-colored shirt. He is using a long broom to sweep debris or dirt off the asphalt street, which also shows signs of aging, including stains and patches.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph is somewhat melancholic, underscored by the gray skies and the muted colors of the urban environment. The absence of other people and the focus on menial labor in such a setting suggest themes of isolation and the struggle of daily life in neglected urban areas. The composition of the image, with the man offset slightly to the left and the broad building filling much of the background, draws attention to both the human aspect and the broader context of his environment.","title":"Abandoned house and street sweeper in North Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549845","556177","551869","552751","550253","552750","545520","557345","550257","553506","544832","549785","556156","551936","549784","558307"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["broom","struggle","stain","shutter","graffiti","act","asphalt","street","aging","man"]}
