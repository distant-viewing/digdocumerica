{"path":"546882.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a large steel mill. Viewed across a body of water, presumably a river or lake, the mill features multiple tall smokestacks from which white and gray smoke billows into the sky, blending with the clouds above. The facility includes several large structures with visible steel frameworks and conveyor systems, indicative of a heavy industrial environment involving the production or processing of steel.\n\nIn the foreground, the calm water acts as a contrast to the busy and smoky industrial backdrop, enhancing the focus on the mill. The sky is partly cloudy with blue patches, suggesting it might be a bright day despite the industrial emissions. The time period or specific location is not clear, but the style of the structures and the nature of the emissions suggest a mid-20th-century setting, typical of heavy industrial areas during that era. No people are visible in the image, emphasizing the focus on the industrial activity and machinery. The overall composition captures the environmental impact of industrial processes and provides a historical snapshot of industrial landscapes.","title":"Bethlehem steel plant at sparrows point","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546827","557215","557216","557227","557222","550344","546884","549966","547696","546808","546769","545236","549967","553891","557218","550868"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["mill","steel","emission","conveyor","production","act","billow","framework","smokestack","system"]}
