{"path":"553942.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph showcases a city welcome sign (labeled \"Makakilo City\") mounted on a stone wall that outlines the bold, green letters of the city's name. The sign appears weathered, indicating it has been there for a while. Adjacent to the sign, there are two other signs on a post: one is a Lions Club International emblem featuring a logo and the caption \"We Serve,\" indicating active local civic engagement, and another is a \"Welcome To Makakilo\" sign that looks quite faded and worn. On the left side of the frame, there is a sliver of the road with a vintage white car passing by, suggesting the photo might be from the mid-20th century. This car is in motion, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise static scene.\n\nThe surroundings include lush green plants and grasses at the base of the stone wall, injecting a vibrant natural element into the urban setting. The background shows a clear sky and a few wispy clouds, with hints of more tropical vegetation and utility poles stretching into the distance. This typical suburban scenery with well-maintained streets likely indicates a calm, residential neighborhood. Additionally, the presence of electrical lines and well-paved roads suggest infrastructure and development in the city.","title":"Makakilo is built on a dry, rock slope. Environmentalists hailed its designation for urban development, made ten years ago because it was clearly not suitable to agriculture.","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["553723","545498","550099","549163","545618","554034","555450","545419","553017","554123","549113","548889","547021","553473","553767","548670"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["welcome","sign","city","inject","stone","emblem","wall","pave","pass","road"]}
