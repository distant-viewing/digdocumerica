{"path":"544721.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts a vast, desolate landscape, which appears to be a salt flat or a very arid zone with minimal vegetation. The foreground showcases a cracked, dry earth texture, heavily suggesting a lack of moisture and harsh environmental conditions. This area transitions into a patch that seems to be covered with salt deposits, which sparkle slightly, reflecting the sunlight.\n\nMoving towards the midground, the scene opens up to a large body of water that is partially frozen or contains floating ice formations. The waterâ€™s surface has pockets of open water and areas covered with a white crust, likely salt or ice. In the water, there are several isolated rocks or hardened salt formations protruding from the surface. Additionally, some wooden sticks or posts are visible, sticking out of the water and ice, though their purpose is not immediately clear.\n\nThe background is dominated by a wide, open sky, contributing to the feeling of expansiveness and desolation. The horizon is subtle, merging slightly with the sky, but a faint mountain range or landform is barely visible, adding a sense of depth to the landscape. \n\nOverall, the photograph captures an evocative scene of a stark, seemingly inhospitable environment where the interaction and the boundaries between land and water are blurred by salt and ice formations. The lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, as the light is not harsh but rather soft, giving a somewhat serene but cold feel to the landscape.","title":"Sewage enters the bay","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["543644","548703","544733","544774","544687","550397","545623","552902","550588","555885","550404","545647","553867","551553","552420","544751"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["salt","ice","formation","stick","water","freeze","expansiveness","landform","sparkle","pocket"]}
