{"path":"554413.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and somewhat quaint scene in a rural environment. The image shows an outdoor setting with several old wooden buildings that have a weathered and functional appearance. \n\nOn the right side of the frame, there's a large stack of neatly chopped firewood, showing a mixture of freshly cut and aged logs. The woodpile is meticulously arranged, suggesting preparations for the winter or regular use for heating and cooking.\n\nIn the center of the image, there's a dirt path leading through the area. Along this path, an elderly man with gray hair, dressed in traditional work attire, including suspenders and a cap, is walking away from the camera, towards the buildings. His presence adds a human element, evoking a sense of daily life and activity in this setting.\n\nTo the left of the path, slightly out of focus, are more structures that appear to be part of a homestead or farm. They include a building with a tall chimney, possibly indicating a forge or a kitchen, and a partly visible shelter that might be used for storing tools or as a workshop.\n\nThe background is filled with lush green trees, indicating that this location is in a wooded or forested area. The brightness of the day is evident with the clear blue sky peeking through the foliage, casting shadows and highlighting the textures of the wood and buildings.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a serene yet industrious atmosphere, illustrating rural life and the self-sufficiency associated with living closely with nature.","title":"Cull logs stacked for sale at big moose","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["557026","543588","554411","557947","551076","554412","558102","555454","558101","547658","555609","545060","551100","546149","544865","551081"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["path","chop","heating","self","cooking","suspender","kitchen","peek","building","workshop"]}
