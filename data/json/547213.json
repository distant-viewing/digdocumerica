{"path":"547213.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures three individuals in a canoe on a body of water, which appears calm with light ripples. The canoe is dark in color, possibly black, and has noticeable length and a sleek design. The person in the front of the canoe is actively paddling with a single-bladed paddle, appearing slightly leaned forward in the effort. This individual is shirtless, which suggests warm weather or vigorous activity. The person in the middle sits facing forward, without a paddle, seemingly relaxed or in conversation with the third individual. The person at the rear of the canoe is also holding a paddle but is in a resting position, possibly steering the canoe.\n\nThe overall ambiance is serene, emphasized by the expansive, reflective water surface around the canoe. The background of the image is mostly water, with no distinct shoreline or other objects, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention entirely on the action and interactions happening within the canoe. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be a cloudy day or shot in a time of soft, diffused daylight.","title":"Canoeing on the Potomac","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["550774","550767","550309","551546","544980","549996","553345","553806","553343","547550","558072","553409","551518","554661","550659","550822"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["canoe","paddle","resting","person","individual","rear","position","length","effort","ripple"]}
