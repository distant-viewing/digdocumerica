{"path":"550677.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a large, three-story building that has a very distinctive architectural design. The structure is painted in a deep red with white trim, and each floor has wide wrap-around balconies with a set of white railings. The balconies curve outward subtly, adding an elegant feel to the building's aesthetic. The most striking feature of the architecture is the conical-roofed tower on one corner, which gives the building a unique and possibly historic look.\n\nIn front of the building, there's a well-manicured lawn divided by a concrete pathway leading to the front stairs, which ascend to a centrally located entry door. A sign indicating \"Leland Apartments\" is visible on the front lawn, suggesting this building serves as a residence.\n\nThe photograph captures a lone person walking past the building on the sidewalk at the bottom of the frame. This individual appears to be wearing casual attire, possibly shorts and a t-shirt, seeming in mid-stride and engaged in a typical walking activity.\n\nThe background is primarily clear but features some green foliage from trees, indicating a well-tended and green urban or suburban environment. The sky is bright, suggesting a clear day which enhances the vibrancy of the building's red facade. There are no other visible vehicles or people, adding a sense of tranquility and focus on the architectural subject of the image.","title":"Old hospital in Berlin, industrial city on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["546469","556182","549360","552968","546506","558162","556046","546481","550042","546423","546473","558030","551263","558128","546539","546477"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["balcony","building","lawn","wrap","walking","entry","residence","stride","stair","vibrancy"]}
