{"path":"547865.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"In the photograph, the main focal point is a rectangular, weathered sign mounted on a wooden post. The sign is painted in red with bold white lettering that reads: \"JAMAICA BAY WILDLIFE REFUGE KEEP OUT CITY OF NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF PARKS.\" The sign shows some signs of age and weathering, indicating it has been there for a considerable time.\n\nThe background presents a natural setting that includes a mix of elements. On the left side, there are dense, leafy, green trees or bushes, slightly obscuring parts of a sky that appears overcast. The right side of the image opens up to a view of a tranquil water body, surrounded by tall, slender reeds and grass, hinting at a peaceful, natural wetland environment typical of a wildlife refuge. The vegetation and water indicate a rich, biodiverse habitat, possibly hosting various wildlife species.\n\nThe atmosphere of the scene is quiet and serene, suggesting a location away from urban noise and disturbance. The composition of the image, with the sign off-center and the natural elements surrounding it, emphasizes the contrast between human-imposed restrictions and the natural beauty of the area. The overcast sky adds to the tranquil and somber mood of the scene, reinforcing the solitude and untouched aspect of the refuge.","title":"Jamaica bay-in the path of \"the atlantic flyway\", the route of migrating birds","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547850","553085","556943","550212","554103","545109","557489","544220","557205","552076","548248","546386","547046","545008","543104","552211"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","wildlife","noise","restriction","off","bold","host","reed","disturbance","leafy"]}
