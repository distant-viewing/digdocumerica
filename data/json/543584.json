{"path":"543584.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction site where new residential buildings are in the process of being erected within a forested area. The buildings are multi-story wood structures, seemingly in the early stages of framing, characterized by exposed beams and partial framework.\n\nThe scene is interspersed with tall, thin trees, some of which have blackened trunks, suggesting they may have survived a recent fire or are marked for preservation. There are no leaves visible on the trees, adding to the feeling of a barren or recently burned forest environment.\n\nConstruction materials like lumber planks and plywood sheets are scattered throughout the foreground. Miscellaneous debris, including discarded papers, plastic bottles, and other construction waste, can be seen strewn across the dirt ground around the building sites, suggesting active work and movement in the area.\n\nThe clear blue sky and bright daylight indicate good weather conditions, which is typical for outdoor construction activities. This setting, coupled with the nature of ongoing work, captures a moment of development and transformation in a natural landscape.","title":"Condominium construction","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["546988","543583","553922","555232","553702","550737","543593","553703","543591","547833","556940","556619","557730","547858","543544","557728"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","transformation","site","preservation","lumber","sheet","work","framing","bottle","fire"]}
