{"path":"544048.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling industrial scene, likely of a mining or metal processing facility. The image is filled with various elements of heavy machinery and infrastructure that paint a picture of a highly mechanized operation.\n\nForeground: The foreground shows debris or mined material spread out over a vast area, much of it appearing wet and glistening, indicating recent activity or processing. There are pools of water reflecting the surroundings, adding a grimy sheen to the scene.\n\nMiddle ground: Dominating the middle ground are structures that appear to be conveyor belts and metal frameworks. These structures are large and rugged, built for heavy-duty operations. One of the notable features is an elevated conveyor belt supported by a robust, diagonal beam, which transports materials from one part of the facility to another. Directly beneath this, there's a platform where large amounts of earth-like material are deposited.\n\nBackground: In the background, amidst the radial array of industrial fittings and pipework, there are small hills, lightly vegetated, which suggest that the facility is situated in a valley or a pit-like setting. There's also a glimpse of infrastructure such as electricity pylons, hinting at other aspects of this large-scale operational setup.\n\nPeople: There is a person visible on the upper left part of the photograph, walking on one of the elevated platforms. They are wearing industrial attire, likely safety gear, which indicates ongoing work and operations at the site.\n\nAtmosphere: The lighting in the image is bright, indicating either a sunny day or intense work lights, enhancing the harsh, metallic nature of the industrial environment. The air appears dusty and filled with particulate matter, common in such industrial zones, which adds a layer of grittiness to the scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures the intense, rugged environment of industrial operations, emphasizing robust machinery, active human participation, and the transformation of natural landscapes for industrial purposes.","title":"Iron leaching (separating) area of inspiration consolidated copper company's smelter","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["554764","544036","545442","543642","551036","549168","546055","551037","546757","545992","549965","544390","556401","550343","556893","542989"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["operation","belt","facility","platform","grimy","fitting","transformation","pylon","machinery","matter"]}
