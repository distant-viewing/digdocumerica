{"path":"549332.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and cluttered laboratory scene filled with various scientific equipment and activities. At the heart of the image, a person wearing glasses and a white lab coat is intently working amidst a plethora of lab apparatus. He is seated, slightly leaning forward, and handling some scientific instruments, focusing on his work with a serious expression.\n\nThe workspace is tremendously packed with lab essentials: there are multiple pieces of glassware including flasks, beakers, and intricate tubing systems that possibly indicate experimentation or chemical analysis processes. The foreground prominently features a wide assortment of glassware set up on what appears to be a black countertop, surrounded by wires, electronic devices, and large white containers, possibly holding chemicals or solutions.\n\nBehind the person, spanning the width of the image, are more lab instruments and setups indicative of a research and development environment. These setups involve structured racks filled with cylindrical objects, cables, and further electronic equipment. \n\nThe window on the right side of the frame provides natural light, and outside, greeneries and part of a building can be seen, situating this laboratory possibly within a university or scientific research facility setting. The overall atmosphere is busy and detailed, reflecting a scene of deep scientific investigation or experimentation.","title":"Dr.  Bozena cosovic studies the absorption of enzymes on mercury at the ruder boskovic institute.
