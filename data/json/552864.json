{"path":"552864.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a middle-aged man standing outdoors. He is wearing a blue denim shirt, which appears slightly worn, and a striped bucket hat. The man has a mustache and a serious expression on his face. He is extending his left arm to the right, resting it on what might be a metallic or concrete post or bar, partially visible in the foreground of the image.\n\nThe background is rather obscured with soft focus but appears to be a watery or marine environment due to visible poles that resemble dock pilings or maritime structures. The overall ambiance suggests an overcast day, indicated by the even and subdued natural lighting in the scene.\n\nThe setting could likely be a fishing area or near a waterfront, hinted by the attire of the man and visible elements, giving an impression of a working environment related to water activities or boating. The man's posture and attire contribute to a utilitarian and rugged feel of the photograph.","title":"Lake Borgne oystermen claim release of Mississippi River flood waters has polluted their oysterbeds.
