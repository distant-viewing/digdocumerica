{"path":"554421.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a silhouette of a person standing atop what appears to be a large vehicle or a stack of circular objects, possibly barrels or tanks. The figure is captured from a low angle, with their body positioned in a dynamic, possibly striding posture, against a twilight sky that is blue and darkly clouded, providing an atmospheric background.\n\nBelow the silhouette, there are four glowing red lights distributed near the bottom edge of the frame, likely rear lights of the vehicle or reflective markers on the equipment. The low light condition of the setting enhances the contrast between the dark, outlined shapes and the fading light of the sky. There are visible elements such as power lines crossing near the top portion of the frame, adding a sense of depth and environment typical of an outdoor, possibly industrial or working area.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a dramatic and somewhat mysterious mood, emphasizing shapes, silhouette, and minimal color usage.","title":"Litchfield Paper Company lumberjack using chains and \"come along\" to secure logs on truck.","placename":"Tupper Lake (N.Y.)","location":"Tupper Lake, New York","nn1":["543002","546389","553226","545418","553623","553228","556185","553621","546384","546021","543024","551030","550174","544123","555140","548886"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["silhouette","stride","shape","distribute","marker","usage","barrel","outdoor","vehicle","twilight"]}
