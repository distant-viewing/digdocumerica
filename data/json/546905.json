{"path":"546905.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a large collection of debris and trash floating in a body of water. The accumulation is contained within a curved, artificial barrier, which might be a boom used to prevent the spread of the material into a broader waterway. This barrier seems to curve gently and is anchored by visible ropes or cables stretching across the water.\n\nThe debris includes a variety of items such as wood planks, bottles, cans, and miscellaneous waste materials, suggesting a lack of proper waste management in the vicinity or consequences of urban runoff. The water itself is murky and opaque, indicating possible pollution.\n\nIn the background, there are dark, weathered-looking walls that could be part of an old dock or water control structure. The overall atmosphere is a bit gloomy and underscores environmental concerns related to water pollution and waste disposal issues. The viewpoint is from above, providing a clear vantage of the extent of pollution captured within the boom barriers.","title":"A screen placed across Jones Falls traps trash and keeps it out of Baltimore Harbor.
