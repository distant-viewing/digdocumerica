{"path":"551469.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures two elderly men engaged in conversation on a city sidewalk. The man on the left is wearing a light-colored baseball cap, a short-sleeved button-up shirt, and dark trousers. He is utilizing a walking stick and leans slightly on it while conversing. The man on the right is dressed in a light-colored shirt and dark trousers. He is also using a walking stick, but in addition to that, he carries a bundle of crutches tucked under his arm. Both individuals appear to be sharing a moment, with the man on the right focused intently on speaking to his companion.\n\nThe setting appears to be an urban environment with an architectural background that includes a darkened door and a window bearing a sign. The stone finish of the building and the modest planting beside the door all contribute to a sense that this scene is taking place in a well-trodden public space. The tone and mood conveyed by the muted colors and the accessory use of mobility aids suggest themes of aging and companionship.","title":"Resting on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553558","549293","549292","549291","557143","557079","557767","548625","553208","543037","553519","551817","554280","548482","547816","556485"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["stick","trouser","bundle","door","aid","companion","mobility","planting","man","companionship"]}
