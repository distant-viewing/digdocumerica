{"path":"556302.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic moment during a baseball game. The central focus of the image is a male pitcher in mid-pitching action, dressed in a green and gold baseball uniform with white pants. He is wearing a matching green cap and his left leg is lifted high in the air, while his right arm is fully extended backward, holding the baseball. His intense focus and athletic form emphasize the motion involved in pitching the ball.\n\nThe background shows a sunlit baseball stadium filled with spectators. The crowd, blurry due to the shallow depth of field, adds a sense of atmosphere and excitement, observing the game from the stands which appear mostly filled. The pitcher stands on a well-maintained dirt mound with a clean white pitching rubber at his feet, which contrasts sharply with his dark cleats.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is bright and direct, likely indicating a day game under clear skies. The composition skillfully captures the energy of the sport and the concentration of the pitcher, making it a vivid snapshot of a baseball game in progress.","title":"Photograph of an Oakland A's pitcher","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556303","546272","553042","551103","557780","555916","556507","549284","552024","549318","551099","551768","551095","551094","547446","550170"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["baseball","game","stadium","rubber","ball","excitement","gold","progress","stand","foot"]}
