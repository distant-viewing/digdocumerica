{"path":"548175.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of the back of a fuel dispenser, likely at a gas station. The main focal point is a sign that likely contains the pricing and payment options but is mostly obscured by two handwritten signs. One, made of paper and adhered to the surface with strips of beige tape, reads \"NO CHECKS OR CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED\". Another sign, crafted from a piece of cardboard and similarly attached with tape, prominently displays the word \"EMPTY\" written in black marker. This suggests that the fuel dispenser is out of service, either temporarily due to maintenance or permanently due to lack of fuel supplies.\n\nThe sign casing is white, with curved edges and contains visible elements such as slots probably for credit or debit cards that are now considered non-functional as indicated by the signs. The background is softly blurred but hints at a natural setting with trees, suggesting that the gas station may be located in a rural or semi-rural area. The overall image conveys a sense of service disruption or unavailability.","title":"Gas shortage","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548169","548171","555413","555416","548176","548047","555414","548173","555464","555494","555405","548174","550103","548053","548049","555411"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["fuel","dispenser","card","tape","sign","gas","service","contain","station","option"]}
