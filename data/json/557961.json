{"path":"557961.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a busy and colorful scene centered around a large gathering of people, mostly families and children, outdoors in a rural setting. A long, dark-colored train stretches across the background, sitting stationary on the tracks surrounded by nature. The crowd is diverse, featuring men, women, and children of various ages, many of whom are dressed in casual summer attire reflecting styles from perhaps the 1970s or 1980s, with lots of patterned shirts, shorts, and dresses.\n\nThe people are gathered around the train, standing on and near the tracks in a somewhat disorganized manner. Many are facing the train, possibly waiting to board or just observing it, creating an impression of anticipation and activity. The setting appears to be lush with greenery under a bright, partly cloudy sky, suggesting a pleasant day outside.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is communal and lively, with the vastness of the train and the relaxed, yet attentive demeanor of the crowd suggesting an event or a public outing, possibly linked to a special train ride or a community festival related to railway heritage.","title":"Cuyahoga valley line steam powered weekend excursion train passengers at the ira road and riverview road stop","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["556091","556100","556041","556857","556074","556114","551413","555967","558294","546821","557964","556855","556090","557956","545732","544817"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","crowd","track","anticipation","child","heritage","festival","dark","outing","manner"]}
