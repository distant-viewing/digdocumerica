{"path":"549670.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts an indoor setting, likely within an urban subway station or a similar public transportation hub. The scene is illuminated predominantly by a large, eye-catching circular light fixture installed in the ceiling, which casts a warm glow and creates an intriguing ambiance. This light fixture has a patterned cover, contributing to its distinctive appearance. \n\nThe floor features a black-and-white checkerboard pattern, adding to the visual appeal and guiding the flow of commuters. A man in a suit, carrying a briefcase, is seen walking across the floor, heading towards the background of the frame. His movement and attire suggest he could be a businessman commuting either to or from work.\n\nIn the background, three escalators are visible, enhancing the depth of the scene. Two of them are occupied with people ascending and descending, indicating the functionality of the space as a transit area. The escalators and their smooth metal finishes contrast with the pattern on the floor and the warmth overhead, providing a somewhat industrial feel to the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a slice of urban life, characterized by movement, routine, and the interplay of light and architectural elements, creating a moody yet dynamic atmosphere typical of many public, metropolitan environments.","title":"The underground pedestrian passageway at koertnerstrasse and the ring","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["556696","549904","551880","551879","556054","556820","551887","556823","551886","556674","556815","556821","557886","556825","556679","556686"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["fixture","floor","commut","briefcase","install","descende","commuter","movement","ascend","subway"]}
