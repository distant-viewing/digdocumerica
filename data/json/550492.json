{"path":"550492.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a natural scene characterized by geological and aquatic elements. In the foreground, a patch of dark, wet gravel or volcanic ash stretches along the bottom part of the image, leading up to a distinct waterfront. Notably, there is an animal's track, possibly paw prints, imprinted in the gravel pointing towards the water.\n\nA narrow concrete or stone structure, resembling a small dam or walkway, juts into a body of water on the left side of the image. This structure is partially covered in green moss or algae, suggesting damp conditions and minimal human disturbance.\n\nThe body of water appears calm and reflects the barren landscape surrounding it, contributing to a mirror effect. It extends into the middle ground of the image where it contrasts sharply with a yellowish sandy strip on its bank.\n\nThe background is dominated by a range of rounded mountains or hills devoid of significant vegetation. These mountains showcase varying shades of gray and brown, typical of eroded volcanic terrain or bare earth landscapes, which suggest a harsh, possibly cold climate.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the intersection of natural elementsâ€”water, earth, and the minimal human-influenced structures, underlined by a stark, almost desolate beauty.","title":"Wolf tracks along the shore of a lake near mile 141.
