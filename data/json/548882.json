{"path":"548882.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features an outdoor scene where two men are aboard a small motorized boat on a calm body of water, seemingly conducting some sort of measurement or monitoring activity. The boat is equipped with tools and equipment, suggesting they might be engaged in environmental or water quality research.\n\nOne man is seated at the stern of the boat, handling the boat's controls and steering, while wearing a light-colored hat and glasses, which suggests sunny or bright conditions. He appears focused on navigating or positioning the boat. The other man is standing closer to the center of the boat, and he is occupied with operating a large, vertical measurement tool that extends significantly above his head. This device might be used for gauging water depths, collecting samples, or another specific scientific task.\n\nThe boat itself is a flat-bottomed, metallic craft, marked with labels and numbers including \"USERSO5\" and a registration number, which identify it possibly as a vessel used by a research or government organization.\n\nIn the background, there is a lush green shoreline with dense vegetation, indicating that the location might be in a river, lake, or estuarine area with a natural, undeveloped shore. The water is calm, reflecting some of the greenery and the sky above. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, isolated area conducive to focused environmental studies.","title":"Measuring depth of water at Imperial Dam.
