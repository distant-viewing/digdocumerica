{"path":"542988.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a water treatment facility, focusing on a specific apparatus for processing water. The image is set outdoors during daylight. At the center, there's a large structure with two prominent circular elements that seems to be part of a machinery system possibly for aeration or filtration. Water vigorously flows over what resembles a weir or spillway, creating a shimmering cascade that highlights different shades of white and blue, likely indicative of strong water flow.\n\nThe whole scene is set in a field of gravel or coarse material, stretching far into the background, suggesting the location may be expansive. In the distant background, structures that look like industrial buildings can be seen under a clear sky, suggesting this could be a part of a larger industrial or water treatment area. The overall tone of the image gives a sense of industrial activity, focusing on water processing or management in a possibly remote area. The lighting conditions, with the sun possibly low on the horizon, casts a warm hue over the scene, emphasizing the textures and the flowing water.","title":"Sewage treatment.
