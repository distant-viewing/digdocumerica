{"path":"554430.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor industrial setting, specifically a lumber mill. A man is present in the scene, clad in work attire including a plaid shirt, jeans, and a green hard hat, which suggests safety regulations are being followed. He is engaged in an activity that involves interacting with pieces of freshly cut wood that are moving along a conveyor system. The man appears focused on his task, positioning or guiding the wooden boards.\n\nThe environment around him is machinery-heavy, indicating a well-equipped lumber processing plant. In the foreground, there are several pieces of lumber of different shapes and sizes, some possibly being sorted or prepared for further processing. The machinery includes conveyors, and possibly saws or planersâ€”tools typically used in milling operations to cut and shape the wood.\n\nThe building has a high ceiling and is well-lit, both by natural light coming through the side windows and by overhead industrial lighting, contributing to a clear visibility necessary for such precise labor. The background shows more machinery and extends into a darker region, indicating the depth of the facility. Overall, the setting effectively portrays a bustling, efficient industrial environment focused on wood processing.","title":"Inside the Litchfield Paper Company mill near Tupper Lake freshly cut boards are fed by hand onto belt-ramp leading to outside platform.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554431","554432","554428","554429","557945","544007","546036","554427","544822","544026","550668","558373","558371","553608","553614","553648"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["lumber","processing","conveyor","wood","machinery","saw","cut","piece","regulation","shape"]}
