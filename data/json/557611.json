{"path":"557611.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a nighttime scene with a striking appearance. Dominating the upper left corner of the image is a bright, oversaturated star-like object emitting pink and orange flares, which creates a vibrant contrast against the dark blue, almost black sky. Below and moving across the center of the image is a landscape shrouded in mist or low clouds, illuminated by a mysterious pinkish-purple light that gives it an ethereal quality. The soft, glowing light delicately silhouettes what appears to be a ridge or a distant line of trees or shrubs, enhancing the mood of tranquility and solitude. The rest of the image is dark, enhancing the focus on the illuminated parts and the celestial object. The overall composition gives a sense of isolation and the vastness of the night sky.","title":"Long shot view across olympic national timberland with mist in the valleys at sun rise.
