{"path":"543067.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures the dramatic aerial view of a craggy, rocky coastline. The central focus is a prominent, rugged headland jutting into a deep blue sea, with waves breaking against its base forming white frothy water. The headland itself is characterized by its rough, textured surface, evident in its varying shades of brown, gray, and slight tinges of red. Portions of the rock formation are speckled with patches of green vegetation, which provide a contrast to the otherwise barren landscape.\n\nThe surrounding sea is marked by dispersed patches of white waves, suggesting a relatively strong wave activity near the coast. The perspective is from above, looking down on the headland and along the sea coast, making the geographical features starkly prominent.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the natural rugged beauty of the coastal landscape, showcasing the powerful interface between land and sea. The rich, earthy tones of the rocks and the dynamic blues of the ocean contribute to a vivid and textural scene that displays the untamed and raw aspect of coastal regions.","title":"Birds speckle coastal Bluff.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543291","545122","543309","543297","543295","543243","543289","543092","553775","545130","545934","543300","543290","543061","545125","543328"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["sea","coast","wave","interface","tinge","jut","disperse","rock","patch","coastline"]}
