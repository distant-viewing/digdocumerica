{"path":"547418.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a man from behind, as he walks through a very muddy field. He is wearing a gray hoodie, blue jeans, and high rubber boots, appropriate for muddier or wet conditions. His clothes and boots are visibly splattered with mud, indicating he has been walking through or working in the area for some time. The man is also wearing a red baseball cap, which is covered in dust or mud. His posture suggests a steady, purposeful walk, and he appears to be relaxed, with his hands slightly away from his body. The field in the background is uneven and covered extensively in wet, chunky mud, with pooled water in some areas, reflecting a rural, agricultural setting. There is minimal vegetation visible, only some sparse, small plants emerging from the mud. The overall atmosphere is quite overcast, suggesting a cold or gloomy weather day which might have contributed to the muddy conditions.","title":"John Dolezal slogs through mud on his farm near Bee, Nebraska.
