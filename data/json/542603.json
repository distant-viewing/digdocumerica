{"path":"542603.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a forest scene alive with activity. On the left, a tree trunk prominently displays an attached device with blue straps, possibly a tool or equipment for surveying or ecological research. The middle and right portions of the image showcase two individuals standing amidst a cluster of tall pine trees. Both are dressed in fatigues, which suggests they might be involved in some type of military or outdoor expedition activity. They seem engaged in an interaction or observation of their surroundings. The background is rich with more pine trees, indicating a densely wooded area. The forest floor is scattered with pine needles and some patches of bare earth, typical of a coniferous forest environment. The lighting suggests it's a bright, sunny day, enhancing the visibility throughout the composition.","title":"Steve Beck and Joe Tanski of U.S. Forest Service","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["544003","542604","553638","553601","557005","542602","542716","542772","553357","542770","542773","543441","557007","542732","553635","554665"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["forest","showcase","expedition","strap","needle","observation","research","device","visibility","tool"]}
