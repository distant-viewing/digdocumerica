{"path":"547252.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a water treatment plant adjacent to a muddy river. The river curves from the upper left to the bottom center of the image, with varying sediments causing brown and lighter silt patterns in the water. Large deposits of mud and some vegetation are visible in and around the river. \n\nIn the immediate foreground, beside the river, is the treatment facility, which includes several circular and square structures presumably used for processing water. These include large circular tanks, some of which are covered, as well as open tanks with visible inner structures. Connected by a network of roads, the facility also houses rectangular buildings, likely for administration and processing. The area around the plant features patches of green grass area and few trees discreetly interspersed.\n\nBeyond the water treatment plant, a residential area with dense housing can be seen, lining the river's opposing banks and edges. The overall scenery is a mix of human infrastructure and natural river landscape, hinting at the interaction between urban development and natural water bodies.","title":"Aerial view of the occoquan water filtration plant and the occoquan river muddied from siltation and soil erosion","placename":"Arlington (Va.)","location":"Arlington, Virginia","nn1":["547260","547257","548216","553837","544555","547239","548212","553450","543574","547262","549636","547670","546895","544471","553900","543573"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["treatment","river","plant","administration","tank","water","deposit","facility","mud","housing"]}
