{"path":"549313.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph features a maritime scene with two primary boats actively moving across the field of view. One boat in the foreground is a police boat, prominently marked with \"POLICE\" and \"NEW YORK CITY\" on its side. It is painted in a dark hull with a white superstructure and flies the American flag on its rear. The boat is captured in motion with waves around its hull suggesting movement through the water.\n\nThe other vessel, slightly in the background, appears to be an older, possibly vintage, tugboat with a yellow and red color scheme. It is also in motion, producing a wake as it moves through the water, and is positioned mid-frame heading towards the left side of the photograph.\n\nBehind these boats, the cityscape presents an urban shoreline dotted with various industrial buildings and warehouses. Notable features include faded, large signage on buildings, one of which reads \"Sarnoff\", hinting at possibly historical or commercial undertakings associated with these structures.\n\nThe general atmosphere suggests an overcast or hazy day, as indicated by the somewhat muted lighting and the lack of distinct shadows. The color tones throughout the scene are a mix of blues, grays, and the industrial structure's neutral earthy colors, conveying a no-nonsense, functional aspect of the city's waterfront operations. Overall, an industrial vibe pervades with an undercurrent of city hustle and maritime activity.","title":"Police launch on patrol on the Hudson River off battery park on the lower tip of Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547961","547061","548327","555798","549783","549892","551991","546845","551990","550901","550043","550894","544657","544234","557815","552020"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["boat","motion","superstructure","police","hustle","tugboat","move","produce","city","reads"]}
