{"path":"543009.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial scene encompassed by a natural landscape. The foreground features several industrial buildings, the most prominent being a large building with a flat roof from which some smoke or steam is rising. Adjacent to it is a large, conical structure akin to an old-fashioned wood-fired kiln, also emitting smoke or steam from its top, suggesting it might be in operation. This structure appears weathered, with a surface texture that indicates aging or exposure to the elements. \n\nIn the background, there is a lush, dense forest on the slope of a hill or mountain, with a variety of trees that appear to be conifers, creating a dark green canopy. Above this natural backdrop, the sky is visible with a bluish tint, perhaps due to the time of day or weather conditions when the photo was taken.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes the industrial activity in the foreground against the serene and unspoiled forest in the background, highlighting a stark contrast between human industrial endeavors and the natural environment. This scene might suggest themes of environmental impact, industrialization, or the coexistence of human activity with natural landscapes.","title":"Wood chip burner","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["545113","551026","546236","557225","557374","550711","550997","544736","554630","543011","545053","543813","542997","557377","550995","546073"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["steam","encompass","smoke","industrialization","forest","tint","endeavor","conifer","a","coexistence"]}
