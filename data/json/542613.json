{"path":"542613.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up portrait of an elderly man outdoors. The man's face is partly sunlit and shows signs of weathering indicative of many years spent outdoors. He has a rugged appearance with a thick, graying beard and deep lines marking his face. He is wearing a wide-brimmed, floppy hat that adds to his outdoorsy look.\n\nThe man's glasses reflect some light, partially obscuring his eyes, yet adding an interesting element to his expression. He is dressed in a plaid, flannel-like jacket which suggests cool weather or a preference for sturdy, practical clothing.\n\nThe background is softly focused but visible enough to suggest a natural, woodland setting with hints of trees and greenery. This serene backdrop complements the man's rugged outdoors appearance, hinting at a probable connection with nature or outdoor activities.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the man positioned to the right, draws focus to his profile, especially to the details of his facial features and expression. The lighting emphasizes the textures of his skin and beard, conveying a sense of resilience and a lifetime of experiences. The photograph overall exudes a strong character study and evokes a sense of stoic calmness.","title":"John Luman, builder of logging roads since 1945","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557173","552103","554846","544409","547179","554857","548236","548616","556563","552871","554915","553091","543701","556443","554926","547679"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["beard","man","preference","flannel","overall","spend","appearance","portrait","woodland","calmness"]}
