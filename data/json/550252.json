{"path":"550252.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The image depicts an expansive landfill site heavily filled with waste materials. In the foreground, large puddles of water mixed with murky substances are visible, reflecting bits of the sky and some of the trash scattered around. The piles of garbage form uneven mounds that dominate the landscape, composed of various discarded items, fragments, and rubble.\n\nIn the middle to the background of the image, heavy machinery is in operation to manage the waste. Three large landfill compactors or bulldozers can be seen in action. They are dusty and partly obscured by the dust they're raising, indicating their active use in moving, crushing, or compacting the trash. Particularly noticeable is the large bulldozer in the center with its front shovel raised, dumping or spreading garbage. Another interesting element is a partially seen vehicle to the left with its dump bed tilted upwards, either depositing or getting ready to collect refuse.\n\nThere isn't much vegetation visible; the scene is stark with a focus on the man-made waste and operational machinery. The sky is vaguely visible but mostly overshadowed by the dust and fumes emanating from the activity in the landfill. Overall, the atmosphere conveys a gritty and polluted environment, typical of such waste disposal operations.","title":"Warner Road landfill operation on Mill Creek, which flows into the Cuyahoga River","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546246","546234","543828","546235","549938","546250","549937","546231","548322","543821","548210","546251","548350","546247","549936","549794"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["landfill","waste","bulldozer","garbage","dust","trash","compactor","fume","machinery","dump"]}
