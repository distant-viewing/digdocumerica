{"path":"557651.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This image provides an aerial view of a rural area, capturing a blend of natural and man-made features in a valley. In the foreground, a two-lane road stretches vertically through the image, framed by lush greenery predominantly on the left side and a mixture of trees, grass, and three peculiar white patches on the right which could be sand traps of a small golf course or similar landscape features. \n\nMoving to the middle ground, small residential and commercial buildings cluster along both sides of the road. Their roofs, in shades of red and other dark colors, contrast with the surrounding greenery. Along the road, visible vehicles suggest normal daily activity.\n\nThe background is dominated by a series of rolling hills and mountains extending into the horizon, adorned with dense forest that showcases various shades of green under a clear, blue sky. This scenic backdrop adds a calm and serene mood to the overall image, highlighting the rural charm of the location.","title":"Aerial view of helen, Georgia, near robertstown, showing Georgia highway 17/75 leading into town from the south","placename":"Georgia","location":"Georgia","nn1":["556968","556997","556971","548172","557726","558063","548199","557557","555624","556967","552593","557748","556462","556341","556915","549116"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["trap","golf","road","course","greenery","shade","charm","lane","mixture","roll"]}
