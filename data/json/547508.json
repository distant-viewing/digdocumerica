{"path":"547508.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal area that shows a diverse mix of natural and altered landscapes. The coast is on the right side of the image and it features a sandy beach with gentle waves lapping against it. Adjacent to the beach area is a band of dense green vegetation, which appears to be a marsh or wetland.\n\nIn the middle section of the image, there is a large open piece of land with minimal vegetation, primarily dirt or sandy soil. It seems used either for agriculture or as a construction site, as multiple vehicles, possibly tractors or trucks, are scattered across this zone. One large red-roofed building is prominently visible, suggesting some kind of storage or industrial facility.\n\nAn interesting aspect of the scene is a very narrow, winding water body, possibly a river or a stream, which meanders through the landscape starting from the left side and curling its way all through the midsection of the photograph towards the bottom right, almost reaching the coastline. Along the banks of this water body, dense greenery is observable, which sharply contrasts with the more barren land surrounding it.\n\nSeveral dirt roads crisscross the landscape, connecting different parts of the area, which are also visible with numerous vehicles traveling or parked along these routes.\n\nThis image captures a juxtaposition of natural beauty and human influence, detailing components of both undeveloped natural areas and areas significantly modified for human use, likely for either agricultural, industrial, or developmental purposes.","title":"Aerial view of Middletown dump.
