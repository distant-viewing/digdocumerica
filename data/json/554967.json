{"path":"554967.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene forest scene predominantly featuring large, mature trees. The trees are very tall with thick, rugged trunks that display a rich texture. The bark on these trunks varies in color from deep brown to gray, and one can notice patches where the bark has either worn away or has discolorations.\n\nThe foreground of the image mainly focuses on one tree that is significantly prominent compared to the others; its trunk occupies a considerable portion of the frame. This main tree stands on the left side of the image, and its presence is so dominant that it almost acts as a natural column bolstering the sky.\n\nTo the right, partially hidden yet still prominent, another tree with similar characteristics can be seen. In the middle and background, glimpses of more trees continue, suggesting a dense woodland area. The foliage of smaller trees and shrubs is sparsely visible near the ground, adding a touch of green to the otherwise subdued color palette dominated by the browns and grays of the tree trunks.\n\nLighting in the photograph seems to be natural, likely filtered through the tree canopy, casting parts of the trunks and the forest floor in shadow, which enhances the textured details of the wood and the overall mysterious, tranquil atmosphere of the forest environment. This composition skillfully frames nature's vertical grandeur, isolating these trees as subjects of natural strength and age.","title":"Over mature western red cedar with stagnated hemlock in the understory on river bottom land in the Simpson sustained yield unit of the Olympic national timberland, Washington.
