{"path":"549622.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures two men on a small powerboat moving at speed on blue waters, creating a trail of white frothy waves. The man in the foreground is seated towards the bow (front) of the boat and is wearing a red vest, sunglasses, and appears relaxed, slightly leaning back against the front of the cockpit. The other man stands behind him, steering the boat, and is dressed in a short-sleeved, striped shirt and sunglasses, looking ahead attentively.\n\nThe boat, named \"U.S. EPA GOVERNMENT,\" implies that it is a vessel used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, suggesting that the men could be engaged in activities related to environmental monitoring or research. The sides of the boat display some simple detailing, and thereâ€™s equipment visible within the cockpit that might be used for their work.\n\nThe background of the image is the open water, and the day appears bright and sunny, enhancing the vivid blue of the ocean and the crisp white of the boat's wake. The entire scene suggests motion and professional activity in an outdoor, aquatic setting.","title":"EPA personnel operating out of EPA Gulf Coast Water Supply Research Laboratory at Dauphin Island.
