{"path":"553066.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a peaceful rural scene centered around a white horse lying down in a shallow body of water. The horse appears relaxed, partially submerged, and oriented towards the left side of the frame. It is surrounded by a natural environment featuring vibrant green grass and a field of yellow flowers in the background. The yellow flowers cover the landscape behind the horse, creating a colorful backdrop. Ripples in the water around the horse suggest it might have been moving or settling down just prior to the shot. There is a soft blur of vegetation in the foreground, possibly indicating a shallow depth of field used by the photographer to focus more sharply on the horse. The overall atmosphere is calm and serene, marked by natural beauty and the gentle presence of the horse enjoying the water.","title":"Lake Lyndon Johnson. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
