{"path":"555396.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque waterscape, most likely taken during low tide based on the visible sand patterns in the foreground. The image is vertically divided almost into two equal parts. The bottom half shows a wet sandy shore with prominent rippled patterns, indicating the receding water. The ripples in the sand create an intricate texture and add depth to the composition.\n\nThe upper half of the image features a calm body of water reflecting the cloudy sky above, which takes on a dramatic dark hue. This reflection blends seamlessly into the real sky at the water's edge, creating an almost mirror-like symmetry across the middle of the frame. On the water, distant boats are visible. These boats appear as small, white dots, adding a sense of scale and life to the otherwise still and grand natural scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is quiet and contemplative, emphasized by the dim lighting and soft grey-blue palette. The combination of water, sky, and textured sand makes this a visually interesting and soothing scene.","title":"The Columbia River, shown here at Rooster Rock State Park 18 miles east of Portland, is shown at a record low. River beds never seen before were exposed for more than three months because of a lack of precipitation the previous year.","placename":"Oregon","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555394","547047","555717","550391","554002","543058","550458","551216","545081","555400","548247","552916","547044","548030","547057","543059"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sand","half","waterscape","symmetry","water","dot","tide","boat","mirror","pattern"]}
