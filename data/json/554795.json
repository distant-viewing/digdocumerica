{"path":"554795.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"In the photograph, a woman with curly blonde hair is shown standing next to a brick wall, illuminated by a soft, indirect light source which appears to be coming from above her right shoulder. She is dressed in a dark jacket with a zipped front and appears to be in middle age, with her facial expression showing a mixture of seriousness and contemplation.\n\nThe woman is pointing towards a specific section of the wall at her side, suggesting she is either examining or explaining something about the structure or the condition of the bricks. The bricks themselves are multi-colored, featuring different shades of red and black, with some visible signs of wear or aging. The mortar between the bricks is visibly aged as well.\n\nThe background of the photograph is quite dark, helping to focus the viewer's attention on the woman and the section of the wall she is interacting with. The lighting and the focused composition convey a sense of depth, emphasizing the texture and colors of the bricks. Overall, the photograph has a candid, possibly investigative feel to it, as if capturing a moment during an inspection or an informal presentation.","title":"Florence May Bethell lived in her home for 43 years until nearby blasting and stripping (about 2,000 feet away) caused her to move.
