{"path":"543422.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic aerial view of a rugged coastline where the forest meets the sea. The landscape is characterized by jagged rocks and pine-covered cliffs that sharply descend to meet the turbulent, foaming ocean waves. On the left side of the image, a prominent white building with a tall, thin tower possibly a lighthouse or bell tower, stands out against the dense greenery of the trees. The rocky shoreline is dotted with small buildings and paths that weave through the area, suggesting a managed, albeit natural environment. The overall composition beautifully contrasts the wild energy of the blue sea with the serene, dark green of the forest, encapsulating a dramatic and picturesque coastal scenery.","title":"Houses stand on cliffs of Pacific Grove","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543426","543061","545226","545125","543291","545934","543080","545122","543184","543086","543088","543243","543290","543090","545129","543340"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["tower","meet","turbulent","managed","sea","lighthouse","bell","pat","encapsulat","forest"]}
