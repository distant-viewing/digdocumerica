{"path":"554714.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a serene landscape during what appears to be autumn. The image prominently features a large, calm lake reflecting the clear sky above. The shoreline curves gently into a cove, bordered by a beach area with light-colored sand.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is densely covered with forests that display a brilliant array of fall colors, ranging from deep reds and bright oranges to golden yellows, painting a rich tapestry of fading green. Rolling hills or low mountains, covered in these autumn-hued trees, form a picturesque backdrop, emphasizing the vastness and untouched beauty of the area.\n\nAbove the landscape, the sky is pale blue, largely clear but with a few wispy, white vapor trails from aircraft, suggesting a sense of motion and human activity at a distance from this tranquil natural scene.\n\nThe combination of water, vibrant forest colors, and the undisturbed beach creates a peaceful and idyllic autumn setting, perfect for scenic appreciation and possibly indicating a locale appreciated for hiking, camping, or nature photography.","title":"Typical sand beaches where wind provides wave action on a lake in the fulton chain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York state.
