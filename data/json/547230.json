{"path":"547230.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric moment on a river at dusk. The composition centers on a small boat with two silhouetted figures, possibly engaged in fishing or leisurely rowing. The boat is positioned in a river that reflects the twilight hues of the setting sun. The atmosphere is calm, emphasized by the smooth surface of the water which mirrors the golden-orange glow emanating from the sunset.\n\nA striking feature of the image is the path of the sun's reflection, leading directly to the boat. This reflection creates a shimmering, golden trail on the water, enhancing the overall tranquility and glowing warmth of the scene. Trees line the horizon under a sky transitioning from the warm colors of sunset at the top to darker shades toward the bottom of the image, adding a distinct contrast and a sense of enclosure around the river.\n\nThe background is mostly obscured by the dusk, with just the silhouette of dense trees visible, suggesting a secluded or remote setting. The overall mood of the photograph is one of peace and simplicity, evoking a sense of quietude and connection with nature.","title":"Sunset on the polluted potomac","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["543143","551215","551214","551280","551313","552310","543880","552124","550771","545055","550303","543411","543956","551281","552038","550296"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","sunset","dusk","river","glow","reflection","sun","enclosure","centers","quietude"]}
