{"path":"542690.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an Asian man in a thoughtful pose, seated at a large wooden table. He is wearing glasses and a light blue short-sleeved shirt. His attention is focused on writing or drawing on a notepad with a pen, suggesting he is either analyzing or taking notes.\n\nSpread across the table are numerous photographs, presumably the subject of his study. Each photo is neatly organized and displays various subjects. The interaction between the man and these images suggests a meticulous examination, possibly for professional purposes, such as archiving, research, or artistic creation.\n\nThe environment appears to be a casual office or workspace, indicated by the utilitarian furniture and simple, practical layout. In the background, against a plain white wall, there's a metallic filing cabinet and another unidentified piece of wall-mounted equipment, which are blurry due to the focus on the man and the table.\n\nThe setting conveys a sense of quiet concentration and dedication to the task, with the natural light from the side illuminating the workspace and contributing to the atmosphere of intense focus and examination.","title":"Ron Oshima, California Department of Agriculture, working with photographs of damaged plants at the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["551897","555297","553088","557317","556250","556551","548252","544326","546572","552389","546552","556573","555430","547720","551899","546561"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["examination","table","workspace","subject","dedication","writing","cabinet","pen","note","wall"]}
