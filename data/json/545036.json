{"path":"545036.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph displays a large accumulation of freshly cut logs floating on water, likely a river or lake. The logs are tightly packed and extend into the distance, with some bound together by visible straps or cables. The surface texture of the logs is rough and bark-covered, showing fresh cuts with lighter wood color internally contrasted against the dark, weathered outer bark.\n\nIn the background, we can see a flat landscape with hills mildly rising in the distance, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. There are very few visible structures, but some utility poles and lines are seen extending across the scene hinting at human activity and infrastructure in the vicinity. The sky is overcast with a hint of blue, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nThe composition of the photograph uses a perspective view starting at one end of the log assembly, creating a strong diagonal line from the foreground to the background, guiding the viewerâ€™s eye through the entire length of the floating log arrangement. This composition emphasizes both the scale of the log collection and the natural setting in which they are placed. The water is calm, reflecting parts of the logs, which adds a peaceful yet industrious feel to the scene.","title":"Log storage at Weyerhaeuser pulp mill on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552178","545037","550325","552161","552197","550326","548004","550338","545028","548162","548018","552199","552163","550877","542596","555144"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","bark","float","bind","cut","strap","assembly","start","accumulation","extend"]}
