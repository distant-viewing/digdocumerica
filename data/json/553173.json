{"path":"553173.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene focused on a brass band performance in an urban square. The band, consisting of numerous musicians dressed in dark uniforms with white trousers, is arrayed in a horseshoe formation. They are playing a variety of brass instruments, including trumpets, trombones, tubas, and French horns, some of which are gleaming brightly in the sunlight.\n\nSurrounding the band, a large crowd of spectators is gathered, watching and listening to the performance. The audience includes people of various ages and appears to be a mix of men and women dressed in casual and semiformal attire, appropriate for a public daytime event. The setting includes trees and typical city architecture in the background, suggesting that the event is taking place in a centrally-located and possibly historic square. The atmosphere appears lively and festive, indicative of a special public celebration or gathering.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: noontime performance by the elder high school band, a catholic school celebrating its 50th anniversary","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557264","553297","553713","553286","549702","553201","556283","556279","552661","551806","551012","553284","551770","551014","554451","549567"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["band","brass","square","performance","horn","event","musician","gleam","audience","celebration"]}
