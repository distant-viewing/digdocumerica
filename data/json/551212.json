{"path":"551212.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This image provides an aerial view of a large dam structure beside a body of water, which is likely a river given the surrounding landscape. The dam is prominently featured in the composition, taking up the left side of the image diagonally. It's a bulky construct, equipped with numerous round mechanisms visible on the top - these could be parts of the dam's functional apparatus. The right end of the dam hosts a smaller building with a flat, possibly metallic roof.\n\nBeyond the dam, the water body – extending toward the horizon – is filled with a mix of recreational and possibly commercial boats. The opposite shore from the dam follows the water's edge and is heavily forested, contributing to the natural serenity and the scenic vista observed from this aerial perspective.\n\nTo the immediate right of the dam, parallel to it, there appears to be a road or walkway where a few vehicles are parked, suggesting access to the dam for maintenance or visitor purposes. The surrounding region beyond this road is sparsely developed, hinting at limited human habitation and a focus on the natural environment and possibly tourism or water management.\n\nThe overall atmosphere in the photograph, indicated by the subdued lighting and shadows, suggests it is either dawn or dusk, adding a tranquil and slightly mysterious quality to the scene.","title":"Osage River and Bagnell Dam","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["549004","548016","548007","548936","548927","548012","548003","549486","548947","548013","548847","544166","548940","548925","548024","551580"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","tourism","vista","host","serenity","mechanism","apparatus","water","habitation","walkway"]}
