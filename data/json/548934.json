{"path":"548934.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a vivid aerial view of a river landscape. The river curves gracefully through the frame, bordered by lush greenery on one side and rugged, reddish-brown mountain terrain on the other. In the river, there are several boats in motion, creating dynamic white trails in the water as they move. Each boat produces a distinct wake pattern, illustrating their speed and direction.\n\nIn the distance, the riverbanks are lined with additional green vegetative patches and clusters of buildings that blend somewhat with the natural environment due to their low profiles and scattered arrangement. The surrounding landscape is dominated by dry, rocky hills that display a range of red and brown hues, providing a stark contrast to the deep blue of the river. The light in the photograph suggests it is taken during a bright day under clear skies, enhancing the vivid colors and details of the scene.","title":"Boating on the Colorado river below parker dam","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548921","548916","548926","548935","551217","548939","549458","544749","549066","550562","551209","551208","550524","558064","551218","549456"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","trails","boat","produce","wake","speed","profile","surrounding","riverbank","direction"]}
