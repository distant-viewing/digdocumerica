{"path":"555170.jpg","date":"November 1970","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of numerous broken pieces of a fibrous, crystalline material, which appears to be erionite. The pieces exhibit a rich, deep pink and red color palette. Each fragment is distinct in its texture and formation, displaying long, thin, parallel grooves like layers or striations.\n\nThe composition of the image focuses on the textural details and the interplay of light and shadow across the surfaces of the crystals. The background is completely filled with more of the same type of material, enhancing the sense of density and texture. The photograph does not include any people or identifiable objects other than the erionite itself, directing full attention to its natural structural features and color variations.","title":"Macro photograph of wood chipped for the pulping process taken through a microscope in new Westminster, british Columbia near Bellingham, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["557582","555225","550606","553582","544907","555155","544682","550474","550475","545487","544815","545678","545558","546165","557626","555841"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["groove","striation","piece","material","fragment","variation","density","texture","direct","interplay"]}
