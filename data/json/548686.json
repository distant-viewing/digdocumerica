{"path":"548686.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene view of a forest canopy looking upward from the forest floor. The image is rich with various shades of green as light filters through the leaves, illuminating them against a relatively clear, bright sky.\n\nThe composition focuses primarily on a large tree with a robust and intricate branching pattern that dominates the center of the image. This tree has a rugged, dark trunk that divides into many strong limbs stretching upwards and outwards, covered with dense foliage. The leaves appear slightly translucent, glowing under the influence of the sunlight.\n\nAround this central tree, several other trees with thinner branches and different leaf types create a layered texture throughout the image. The colors range from deep green in the shaded areas to vibrant lime green where the sun hits directly.\n\nThe background, which is the sky viewed through the gaps in the canopy, appears as patches of light blue among the crowns of the trees.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a tranquil and somewhat enchanting aspect of forest life, emphasizing the lush, dense growth and the interplay of light and shadow typically seen in woodland areas.","title":"One of the prized mahogany trees for which key largo was famous.
