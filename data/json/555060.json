{"path":"555060.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of an aquatic organism, resembling a crustacean or similar marine invertebrate, suspended in water. The creature appears translucent with visible internal structures, hinting at its delicate and possibly juvenile stage. It has several appendages, which might be used for movement or feeding.\n\nThe background of the image is dark, creating a stark contrast with the subject and enhancing its visibility. Tiny particles and possibly microscopic organisms are scattered throughout the scene, illuminated against the dark backdrop, suggesting the photo was taken in a natural underwater environment where organic matter and plankton are present.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on the organism, with a clear emphasis on its physical features and structure, likely aiming to study or highlight the biological aspects of such marine creatures. The photograph captures the intricate details and fragile nature of life hidden within aquatic ecosystems.","title":"Ant pupa in a private forest preserve on Green Mountain, Kitsap County, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555365","555069","546308","548720","543187","551592","543905","543277","546313","546138","548713","544972","546350","557619","555022","543555"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["organism","creature","matter","hide","particle","suspend","aim","study","emphasis","stage"]}
