{"path":"553663.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a rural landscape bisected by a river. The river, flowing from the upper right to the lower left of the image, is flanked by lush greenery and agricultural fields exhibiting neat rows of crops. A prominent feature in the image is a bridge crossing the river; it appears to be a steel truss bridge painted in a light color. Adjacent to the bridge, on its left, is another smaller bridge or perhaps a dam structure.\n\nRunning parallel to the river are various dirt roads and paths that meander through the landscape, showcasing an arid and somewhat barren terrain that contrasts with the cultivated areas. The terrain is mostly brown, dotted with sparse greenery and small shrubs, suggesting a dry or semi-arid climate. No buildings or people are visible in the image, emphasizing the natural and undeveloped character of the area. The composition of the photograph, with its weaving paths and river, guides the viewer's eye through a dynamic yet serene rural scene.","title":"Aerial view of the Truckee River showing diversionary irrigation canal (uphill side)","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["542713","558042","549081","549260","558050","547227","547995","550392","548941","549262","542730","548097","553660","548096","545144","553668"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["bridge","river","path","bisect","dam","cultivate","greenery","meander","guide","left"]}
