{"path":"547924.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a vast expanse of grassy wetlands. The foreground prominently features dense clusters of blade-like grass, which appear to be slightly swayed by the wind, hinting at a breezy environment. The grass has a dual-tone coloring, predominantly rich green with hints of white or lighter green, likely reflecting sunlight or due to the type of vegetation.\n\nMoving towards the middle ground, the dense grass continues, stretching towards a body of water visible in the horizon. This suggests that the grassland might be a tidal flat or a marsh area adjacent to a larger water body.\n\nThe background consists of the water body that appears calm and reflective, bordered by a distant shoreline. The opposite shore is lined with gentle undulating hills, not densely forested but possibly covered with shrubbery or low-lying vegetation, under a clear sky conveying a serene day.\n\nOverall, the composition is largely dominated by natural elements, creating a tranquil and somewhat isolated landscape scene. This setting could be indicative of a coastal ecosystem, possibly important for environmental conservation, such as supporting biodiversity or acting as a natural barrier against erosion.","title":"Unspoiled marshlands on Sandy Hook Nature Preserve, less than 15 miles from New York, across the bay","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["547500","553084","557498","547532","547488","545033","557111","557499","547544","547589","550783","553856","544515","547547","547663","544530"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["grass","biodiversity","coloring","blade","marsh","grassland","body","shrubbery","conservation","wetland"]}
