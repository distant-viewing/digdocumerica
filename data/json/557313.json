The person is wearing a formal dark suit indicated by a visible black blazer and a white-cuffed shirt.

The lighting is vibrant, suggesting the photograph was taken during the day under natural light which enhances the reflection and transparency in the scene.","title":"Blackened aluminum collector cups are the heart of the solar energy collector developed by the international solarthermics corporation.
