{"path":"554833.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a large-scale mining or quarrying operation set in a vast, open landscape. In the foreground, there's a sweeping view of grassy fields, which gradually descend into the pit of the quarry. The focus of the scene is a large red crane positioned near the edge of an excavated area, suggesting ongoing mining activities.\n\nThe pit itself appears expansive, with various levels of excavation visible. Different shades of earthy browns and grays are evident in these layers, indicating the depth and scale of mining operations. To the right of the crane, large piles of extracted rocks or minerals are stacked, presenting a rugged terrain.\n\nThe background stretches into a distant horizon, showcasing a rural landscape dotted with sparse vegetation and small hills under a vast sky. The sky is striking with its array of high clouds softly highlighted by the sunlight, adding a serene atmosphere to the otherwise industrial scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its wide-angle view captures both the environmental impact and the industrious nature of the quarrying activity within a serene rural setting.","title":"A coal shovel works into a hillside off Route 9, near Cadiz, Ohio, and Steubenville.
