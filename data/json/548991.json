{"path":"548991.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an agricultural scene dominated by mechanized farming operations. In the foreground to the left, there is a lush, green crop, contrasting with a well-trodden beige path that cuts diagonally across the center of the image. On the right, the field appears to be either plowed or harvested, showing brown earth instead of greenery.\n\nIn the background, centered in the image, is a large, industrial irrigation system spraying water across the fields, creating an impressive display of arched water jets that sparkle in the sunlight. This system spans such a large area that it underscores the industrial scale of this agricultural enterprise.\n\nTo the far left, a red tractor or harvester is partially visible, accompanied by what appear to be farming implements or storage containers. This presence of machinery suggests active farming work, likely related to maintenance or harvesting of the crops.\n\nThe backdrop of the image features a hilly landscape, subtly shaded to indicate either soil variations or shadowing under low-hanging clouds, contributing to a rural, expansive setting typical of large-scale farm operations. The overhead power lines along the left horizon also indicate structured utility management in this farm area.","title":"Irrigating an alfalfa field on experimental farm operated by EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548950","548869","548875","548877","548820","543650","546825","548901","548907","553432","549178","548898","548902","544552","554029","553652"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["farming","crop","farm","system","implement","harvester","enterprise","tread","irrigation","harvesting"]}
