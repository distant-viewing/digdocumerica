{"path":"552161.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a large outdoor space, heavily utilized for industrial logging. The scene is dominated by countless logs, organized in rows, floating in water. These logs vary in size and are in different stages of waterlogging, with their dark brown hues suggestive of dampness and prolonged exposure to water.\n\nThe perspective of the image leads the viewer's eye towards a distant background where industrial structures can be vaguely seen under a cloudy sky, hinting at a possibly extensive logging operation nearby. The body of water housing the logs is calm, reflecting the overcast skies and some of the logs, contributing to a moody and somber atmosphere.\n\nThe image seems taken during either dawn or dusk, as suggested by the muted and limited light, casting a blue hue over the entire scene, emphasizing the industrial and somewhat bleak nature of the environment. This setting underscores themes of industry, nature, and possibly the environmental impact of logging practices.","title":"Logs rafted on commencement bay","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552197","552178","550326","545266","552199","552163","545036","545037","552162","548004","545028","550325","552204","552174","542921","542940"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","logging","dampness","housing","hue","practice","utilize","stage","exposure","dawn"]}
