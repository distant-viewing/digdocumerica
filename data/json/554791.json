{"path":"554791.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene framed by blurred foreground elements. In the foreground, the blurred silhouettes of what appear to be headstones or grave markers at either edge of the image add a mysterious depth, creating a strong contrast with the sharper, more distant industrial backdrop.\n\nThe industrial setting features several low buildings, some appearing to be made of metal, and large piles of earth or coal, suggesting this might be a mining or excavation site. Conveyor belts and other machinery are visible, indicating active work, while large barren, tree-covered terrains rise behind the industrial structures.\n\nAbove the industrial base, a rural landscape with small patches of farm buildings and trees can be seen, extending into a flat horizon. The sky is clear with soft hues, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon light, which gives the entire scene a tranquil but intriguing ambiance. The mix of industry with natural and possibly memorial elements in the foreground invites reflection on themes of life, progress, and memory.","title":"This cemetery is surrounded by stripped and abandoned land, a Hanna Coal Company preparation plant is in the background, off Route 9.","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["555542","543642","557220","546379","548850","554763","549965","545993","555629","551036","550343","556504","545239","545992","546122","545989"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["headstone","grave","memory","marker","progress","conveyor","coal","belt","excavation","farm"]}
