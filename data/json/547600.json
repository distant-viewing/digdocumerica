{"path":"547600.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene. The composition prominently features a trail of deeply imprinted footprints in the sand, leading our view toward the ocean. These footprints create a diagonal line across the frame from the foreground to the middle ground, where two individuals can be seen walking along the shore. The individuals appear small in size due to their distance from the camera, enhancing the vastness of the beach around them.\n\nThe sandy beach occupies a major part of the foreground and stretches far into the background, suggesting a quiet, secluded area. The water gently laps at the shore on the right side of the image, with subtle waves reflecting the sunlight. The lighting, possibly late afternoon or early morning, casts soft hues and shadows across the sand, creating a tranquil mood.\n\nThe background is relatively minimal, consisting of an open sky and the horizontal line where the sea meets the shore, reinforcing a sense of calm isolation. The overall feel of the photograph is peaceful and contemplative, evoking a sense of solitude and the natural beauty of the seaside.","title":"Tracks in the sand","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547607","548088","543493","547612","554159","548220","543287","557509","546970","546953","548221","543252","547608","545280","543069","546982"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["footprint","beach","shore","sand","imprint","seaside","lap","trail","meet","reinforce"]}
