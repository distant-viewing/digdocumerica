{"path":"557857.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts two men engaged in an activity involving equipment housed in a workshop or garage setting. One man, visible from the back, wears a white short-sleeved shirt and glasses; the other, also seen from behind, is dressed in a black jacket.\n\nThey are focused on a machine labeled \"Sun Infra-Red,\" which appears to be a piece of automotive diagnostic equipment. The machine features various dials and meters, and one section is labeled \"Performance Analyzer.\"  \n\nTo the right of the main device are other pieces of equipment adhered to the wall, including additional gauges and a cash-operated mechanism, possibly for activating the equipment. A small white cup is resting on the machine, suggesting the men might be in the midst of a work-related break or discussion. The background shows a dark green wall paneling, complementing the technical and utilitarian ambiance of the setting. The lighting in the image is subdued, leading to somewhat muted colors and a focus on the equipment and the activity at hand.","title":"A motorist, right, watches as both bulbs glow on the exhaust analyzer which indicate his vehicle has failed both the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions test. It took place at a safety lane in an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio. It was the second time his vehicle had failed the test. All light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles in the city and the remainder of Hamilton County must be tested annually.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557835","557912","557859","557851","557889","542763","549684","557858","557911","549689","557849","557852","549627","557829","553330","556557"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["equipment","machine","cash","paneling","piece","gauge","meter","dial","wall","cup"]}
