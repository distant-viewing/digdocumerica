{"path":"543406.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat moody scene involving a group of tall pine trees enveloped in mist. The trees, which appear to be of significant height, dominate the composition as they rise against a foggy backdrop. The atmosphere is calm and slightly ethereal, characterized by a limited color palette primarily composed of deep blues and muted greens, hinting at either dawn or dusk light conditions.\n\nOn the ground, the soft contours of what appears to be a grassy landscape can be discerned, likely part of a natural or park setting. The trees themselves display considerable variation in their silhouettes, with some branches densely clustered near the top while others are more sparsely adorned, contributing to a dynamic and organic visual.\n\nThe thickness of the fog adds a layer of mystery and depth to the scene, obscuring the details of the environment and focusing attention on the silhouetted forms of the trees. There are no visible human figures or man-made structures in the immediate foreground, reinforcing the natural and untouched quality of the scene. Overall, the photograph conveys a strong sense of solitude and quietude, inviting contemplation.","title":"Trees rise out of morning mist","placename":"Monterey County (Calif.)","location":"Monterey County, California","nn1":["557601","542849","542929","554754","555124","557019","555119","542926","555128","542847","542930","553579","555122","543312","555110","543621"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["thickness","visual","quietude","mystery","tree","fog","variation","contemplation","contour","dawn"]}
