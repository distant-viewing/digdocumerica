{"path":"553146.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment among three young individuals, apparently engaged in a deep and focused conversation. The setting is an outdoor public space with a blurred background indicating a city environment with some greenery and a building vaguely visible.\n\nOn the left, a young man with shoulder-length hair is wearing a light olive green jacket over a darker shirt. He is seated and slightly leaning forward, his gaze directed intensely towards the person in the center, showing engagement in the discussion.\n\nIn the middle, another young man with shoulder-length brown hair and large, round glasses is captured mid-speech or explanation, as evidenced by his mouth slightly open and his focused expression. He wears a white t-shirt under an unbuttoned light-colored shirt with vertical stripes.\n\nTo the right, a person (possibly male) is dressed in a distinctive bright orange hoodie and light cream pants. His hair is pulled back, possibly into a ponytail, and holds several books or notebooks in his lap, suggesting they might be students or involved in an academic discussion.\n\nThe interaction seems intense and focused, with the participants leaning in towards each other, indicating a shared interest in the topic. The overall mood is one of youthful engagement and intellectual exchange in an informal, everyday setting.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: member of the hare krishna sect proselytizes","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553167","555899","546541","553166","545358","555966","551853","557856","555287","551433","551482","553244","544314","551818","554322","557030"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["discussion","shoulder","length","hair","engagement","ponytail","topic","lean","exchange","student"]}
