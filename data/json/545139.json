{"path":"545139.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph showcases a hilly and barren landscape seen from an elevated or aerial perspective, possibly taken from an aircraft, as suggested by the curved edge of what seems to be an aircraft window or structure at the bottom left corner of the image. The terrain is characterized by weathered hills and exposed soil with sparse vegetation, hinting at deforestation or land degradation. The hills roll into the distance, weaving an undulating pattern of brown and green tones, segmented by dirt roads that snake through the landscape. In the deeper background, denser forests and a river in a valley can be seen, contrasting the foregroundâ€™s barrenness. The overall mood conveyed is one of desolation and stark natural beauty, documenting the impact of human or natural activity on a once richer environment. The image is slightly grainy, suggesting it might be older or taken with a film camera. The light is diffuse, with no hard shadows, indicating either an overcast sky or the photo being taken during a gentle time of day.","title":"Clearcut areas from logging operations","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553565","550397","550598","552560","550510","550578","549179","549182","550395","546385","549184","543665","545895","555873","549150","553564"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["aircraft","weathered","deforestation","curved","denser","weave","hill","take","snake","desolation"]}
