{"path":"556660.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a dark subway station, where passengers wait for the arrival of the subway train. The setting has a moody, somewhat dim ambiance, mostly illuminated by the headlights of the approaching train and sparse artificial lighting above.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a row of passengers stands along the platform edge. The passengers are diverse in terms of age and attire, suggesting it's a typical urban crowd. Some are facing towards the train as it approaches, while others are engaged in conversation or looking elsewhere.\n\nThe right side of the image features the subway train marked with the number \"5\" and the sign \"Dyre Ave\" indicating its route. The train has just partially entered the frame, with its headlights casting a bright glow on the tracks, adding a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nThe subway station itself appears to be relatively aged, with industrial metallic structures partially visible and tiled walls. The platform and the tracks are well-worn, indicative of a heavily utilized urban transit system.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, focusing on a side view of both the incoming train and the awaiting passengers, captures a typical moment of daily life in public transit, with a focus on movement, anticipation, and urban environment.","title":"Subway passengers line a Lexington avenue line platform awaiting transportation.  In 1970 a total of 2.1 million passengers rode the 232-mile system daily the longest in the world.  However that number represented a decrease of 100,000 riders in a 10-year period.  Despite the crucial importance of this New York city transit authority system, voters have refused to okay any more funds for improvements or to allow an increase in the 35-cent fare","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556650","551895","551883","551894","556663","556821","556651","556823","556818","551889","556774","548259","556665","556767","548263","556658"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","subway","passenger","headlight","transit","platform","station","arrival","track","anticipation"]}
