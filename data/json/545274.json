{"path":"545274.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene likely from a fish market or a similar setting where large catches are weighed. The primary focus of the image is on a hanging scale, prominently displaying its face which has gradients marked from 0 to 100 pounds and smaller markings in between. The scale is labeled with the brand \"Chatillon.\"\n\nSuspended from the scale by a metal chain is a metal scoop or pan, which contains two large fish. These fish appear somewhat metallic in color, suggesting they might be wet or have a naturally shiny skin. The scoop itself looks industrial, made from a heavy metal with raised sides and handles for lifting.\n\nThe environment around the scale and scoop is rustic and shows signs of wear and moisture, possibly indicating outdoor or semi-outdoor conditions. There are white washed walls and a support pillar visible in the background, giving a sense of an enclosed space, yet the way light falls into the scene suggests an opening or door nearby.\n\nThe image has a candid and utilitarian feel, emphasizing the weight and size of the catch rather than aesthetic details. This setting is typical of a workspace where the primary activity is the handling and processing of fish, possibly for sale or distribution.","title":"Weighing fish that were raised in ponds on the Quinault Lake.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545284","544995","554093","554095","547856","550320","545198","547881","547848","554098","553095","545211","545063","545951","544987","545202"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["scoop","fish","catch","scale","pan","metal","weight","distribution","brand","pillar"]}
