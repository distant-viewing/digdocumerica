{"path":"542587.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat gritty industrial setting under overcast skies. The scene is largely occupied by a variety of large tanks, likely for storage, arranged notably in the midground of the image. These tanks are cylindrical and vary in color, primarily shades of white, silver, and blue. The environment bears a utilitarian essence, with these storage units situated behind a wire fence and multiple wooden pallets leaning against one structure, suggesting loading or unloading activities.\n\nThe foreground of the image consists of a dirt ground, sprinkled sparsely with vegetation, indicating a dry or arid climate. The dirt is notably marked by tracks — perhaps from vehicles — and is dappled with stains or patches of oil or other industrial materials, reflecting the area's use. An intriguing detail lies in the prominent yolk-yellow stain in the foreground, drawing visual focus due to its bright color against the muted surroundings. This might indicate a spill of some sort, possibly chemical.\n\nBeyond the industrial setup, the background features a partial view of distant mountains under a somber sky, suggesting a remote or isolated location typically chosen for such industrial facilities. The weather, with its looming clouds, adds a moody, almost somber tone to the setting, amplifying the industrial feel of the photograph. Utility poles and additional infrastructure contextualize the scene within a developed yet stark industrial landscape.","title":"Spilled sulphur on ground at T-M-T Chemical Company","placename":"Fresno County (Calif.)","location":"Fresno County, California","nn1":["546108","556402","549975","545273","546064","557386","546058","544179","546221","552021","546037","542705","547505","549977","549960","545998"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["stain","spill","tank","pallet","storage","dirt","unloading","silver","sort","oil"]}
