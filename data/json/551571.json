{"path":"551571.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a serene evening scene at a riverside. In the foreground, a group of six people and a dog are gathered on a rocky outcrop that jets into the river. One person, wearing shorts and a light-colored top, is engaged in fishing, casting a line into the water with a fishing rod. Next to this individual, a man, dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, stands looking out over the water, possibly watching the fishing line or simply enjoying the view. He is holding a beverage. The rest of the group, which includes two women and two men, are turned towards each other in casual conversation.\n\nThe backdrop features a calm river that reflects the hues of the twilight sky. On the opposite shore, densely wooded hills are faintly visible. The silhouette of a tree with outstretched branches overhangs slightly into the frame from the top right, adding a natural frame to the scene. The soft, dusky lighting enhances the peaceful ambiance of the picture, suggesting that it is either sunrise or sunset. The overall mood is tranquil and leisurely, with the group enjoying a quiet moment in nature.","title":"Enjoying the lake shore","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["542647","542564","549933","546811","549935","548737","551572","551350","543628","549716","544274","551516","543164","548141","554517","553081"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["fishing","group","overhang","jet","beverage","outcrop","riverside","sunrise","dog","rod"]}
