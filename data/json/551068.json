{"path":"551068.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features a highway scene depicting environmental and industrial activities. In the foreground, a curved highway stretches into the distance, with a large semi-truck moving toward the camera and a smaller car in the background driving away. The road is bordered by guardrails, emphasizing the curvature of the highway.\n\nIn the background, an industrial plant with multiple tall structures, including silos and smokestacks, dominates the scene. Smoke or steam is billowing out from several stacks, creating a significant presence of emissions in the air. The sky is tinted with a hazy pinkish hue, likely indicating either the time of day or pollution.\n\nThe setting appears to be somewhat urban or industrial based on the infrastructure and the presence of high-tension electrical lines above the plant. The general atmosphere of the photograph suggests themes related to transportation, industry, and environmental impact.","title":"The DuPont Belle Works in early morning smoke and haze--looking south on Route 60","placename":"Charleston (W.
