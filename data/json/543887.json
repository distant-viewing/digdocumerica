{"path":"543887.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene at a gas station in front of a large fireworks store. The store prominently displays multiple bold red signs with white text advertising \"SPACE AGE FIREWORKS\" and proclaiming phrases such as \"The Best Unusual Gifts\" and \"Lowest Prices for Miles.\" One sign boasts about the variety of international brands available including \"Atomic Brands,\" \"Space Age,\" and \"Out of this World.\"\n\nThe gas station is bustling with activity. Two children, a girl in a white sleeveless dress and a boy in blue shorts and a matching shirt, are in the foreground. The girl is looking down, perhaps at something she is holding, while the boy stands by a car, appearing to interact with an adult male, likely pumping gas, who is partially visible in the frame. \n\nSeveral cars, including a station wagon and a black sedan, are parked or pulling up to the pumps, suggesting a busy day. In the background, lush green hills under a bright blue sky create a serene landscape, juxtaposing the commercial activity at the foreground.\n\nThe time period is suggested by the make and model of the cars and the fashion, possibly situating the scene in the 1960s or 1970s. The overall ambiance is vibrant, capturing a slice of Americana centered around travel and roadside commerce.","title":"'Visual pollution'","placename":"South Pittsburg (Tenn.)","location":"South Pittsburg, Tennessee","nn1":["549003","547866","543878","546184","555465","553097","548174","555457","555485","550093","555452","555487","550096","555467","555484","555415"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["gas","station","store","girl","boy","make","matching","car","phrase","pump"]}
