{"path":"542543.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with a man standing in the foreground, who is focused on writing or noting something on a clipboard he holds. He is dressed in a casual white polo shirt and dark pants, and wears eyeglasses. His attention is directed toward what he is recording, seemingly undistracted by his surroundings.\n\nIn the background, there is a smoldering fire with dark smoke rising from a pile that appears to be primarily composed of wooden logs and debris. This gives the scene a sense of having occurred post some type of outdoor event or process, possibly related to land clearing or waste management.\n\nThe location seems to be a rural or semi-rural area, indicated by the presence of open spaces, scattered trees in the midground, and what looks like farm structures or simple buildings in the far background. The ground is unpaved and dusty, enhancing the rustic feel of the environment. Power lines run horizontally, intersecting the tree line in the distance, hinting at rural infrastructure.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a documentary style, capturing both the activity and the environment in a way that suggests the human interaction with land and the aftermath of a controlled burn or similar activity.","title":"Lou dooley, registered sanitarian with air pollution control board, checks fire at rodeo grounds","placename":"Clovis (Calif.)","location":"Clovis, California","nn1":["558310","552088","553584","548592","553639","553598","551088","553611","548854","553597","551243","556445","547673","545975","553562","550251"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["eyeglass","writing","clipboard","polo","record","burn","not","land","aftermath","clearing"]}
