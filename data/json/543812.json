{"path":"543812.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, a man is holding two large glass beakers, comparing the contents visibly. The beaker in his left hand contains a murky, brownish fluid, while the one in his right hand is filled with clear water. Both beakers have measurements marked on their sides, indicating they are used for scientific or testing purposes.\n\nThe man is partially visible, with the focus being on his hands and the beakers he's holding. He's wearing a striped gray and maroon shirt with sleeves pushed up to his elbows, revealing a watch on his wrist. His facial features are partially seen, with a focus that suggests he is analyzing the contents of the beakers.\n\nIn the background, there's an industrial setting with structures that resemble a water treatment facility. There are visible tanks and fencing, creating an atmosphere of a working area dedicated to processing or scientific research. The ground shows a partly constructed or under-maintenance site with materials like wooden planks piled up. The background is slightly out of focus, emphasizing the clarity of the water samples being examined.","title":"Technician holds samples of water as it comes to the plant (left) and water after treatment.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["543799","543808","543803","546296","543834","549333","546277","549605","555281","543801","546287","542666","555250","549628","549611","545002"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["content","analyze","hand","elbow","fluid","wrist","fencing","measurement","testing","sample"]}
