{"path":"549260.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph portrays an aerial view of a rural landscape, predominantly featuring a winding river that meanders through various types of land use. The river is the central feature of the image, with various channels and offshoots surrounded by lush greenery that stands in contrast with the surrounding landscape.\n\nAround the river, there are large patches of farmland which are divided into different sections, demonstrating varying shades of browns and greens, suggesting different types of crops or stages of cultivation. Some patches are well demarcated, whereas others blend more softly into each other.\n\nThe landscape also shows subtle elevation changes with gently rolling hills surrounding the flat river valley. There are sparse settlements visible through small clusters of buildings beside the river, indicating rural habitation.\n\nThe broader landscape further from the river shows more agricultural fields, and the horizon stretches into a mix of more fertile fields and areas appearing drier and less cultivated. \n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a serene and sparsely populated rural area, focused on agriculture, nestled within a river valley. The image composition captures the interplay between water and land use, highlighting the natural and human-made patterns in the landscape.","title":"The Bighorn River near Hardin.
