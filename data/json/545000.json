{"path":"545000.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque dusk scene overlooking a coastal landscape. The sky, filled with a dynamic and striking blend of clouds, is painted in various shades: deep blues and greys near the top evolve into vibrant oranges and reds closer to the horizon, suggesting the sun has just set or is about to. This vivid sky reflects over the calm water below, enhancing the hues and adding a magical quality to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, the terrain is silhouetted against the illuminated sky and water, showing an area that features both dense vegetation and some structures which appear to be part of a dock or pier extending into the water. This suggests it might be a fishing community or an area frequented for water-related activities.\n\nFurther in the distance, the silhouettes of hills or low mountains are visible, adding depth and enhancing the natural beauty of the landscape. The tranquility of the scene is intensified by the absence of visible people or movement, directing the viewer's focus primarily on the natural aesthetics and the peaceful interplay of sky and water. The overall composition of the photograph, with its rich colors and serene setting, evokes a sense of calm and beauty in nature.","title":"The mouth of the Columbia River between Astoria, Oregon and the state of Washington","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545030","552335","545019","553989","557497","547731","554759","547110","545145","545149","552338","550646","552277","554404","547352","552263"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["water","calm","absence","pier","grey","beauty","orange","aesthetic","dock","red"]}
