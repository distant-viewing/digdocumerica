{"path":"550855.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an industrial area situated along a river bend. The setting shows several large industrial buildings with a variety of architectural styles and sizes. The main building is a multi-story structure with a prominent smokestack emitting no visible smoke. Adjacent to it are flat-roofed buildings, likely part of the same industrial complex.\n\nThe river curves around the industrial site, reflecting a distinctive brown color typical of urban water bodies. On the banks of the river are small patches of greenery, including a few trees and grass-covered areas, which add a natural element to the otherwise industrial scene.\n\nThe infrastructure around the area includes multiple bridges—possibly for vehicles and trains—as well as paved roads running parallel to the river. Also visible are train tracks with several freight cars parked alongside the river, indicating the industrial nature of the area and suggesting the transportation of goods.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights the interaction between industrial activities and their surrounding environment, with a focus on transportation and manufacturing facilities. The area is devoid of visible human activity in the photo, focusing mainly on the structures and the landscape.","title":"Consolidated paper company at appleton, near the northern tip of lake winnebago in the fox river valley","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["551192","550856","545889","550890","546705","551191","549968","557295","551201","551173","549495","557223","552187","551202","552182","548340"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["river","train","transportation","freight","pave","good","manufacturing","smokestack","bend","complex"]}
