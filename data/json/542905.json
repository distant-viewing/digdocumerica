{"path":"542905.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling and picturesque scene at a harbor full of various boats. In the foreground, multiple boats are docked at a wooden pier, including a row of colorful fishing boats, each distinctly named and numbered. One boat prominently displayed is named “Isabel”, painted in light green and white, and another called “Joe” in red and white, indicating a personal touch to these marine vessels.\n\nFurther back, a larger vintage-style boat with a white hull and varnished wooden deck houses is being attended to by a man dressed in a dark jacket and pants. He appears to be engaged in a task on the boat, perhaps preparing for departure or maintaining the vessel.\n\nThe harbor itself is calm with mild ripples on the water surface, reflecting hints of the surroundings. The background features a tree-covered hillside speckled with residential houses, imparting a serene, small-town vibe. A misty or foggy atmosphere suggests early morning or late afternoon, adding a soft, diffuse light to the scene which enhances the tranquil mood.\n\nOverall, the composition with its filled docks and moored boats, set against a quiet town landscape, conveys a sense of daily life and activity in a maritime community. The photograph also showcases the blend of natural beauty and human presence, typical of coastal harbor towns.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development.","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542872","543358","548235","547565","546998","542876","542907","543035","542911","542877","548249","548078","542878","543246","542871","542873"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","harbor","town","vessel","departure","house","hull","hillside","pier","vibe"]}
