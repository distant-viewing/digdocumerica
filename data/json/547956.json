{"path":"547956.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph shows an industrial scene featuring a large concrete drainage canal with several prominent features. The canal appears to be vast with water and some debris pooled at the bottom. Parallel to the canal are two lines of substantial red pipes, supported by a framework of red beams and columns. These pipes are equipped with black and red valves and flanges, adding to the industrial feel of the image.\n\nIn the middle of the photograph, there is a man walking along a narrow concrete pathway at the bottom of the canal. He wears dark clothing and a cap, and holds papers in one hand as he moves along the path, seemingly inspecting the area or proceeding towards a specific task.\n\nThe background shows a gloomy, overcast sky, which casts a diffused light over the entire scene, accentuating the industrial gray and metallic tones. Behind the canal, industrial buildings, possible factories or processing plants, can be seen contributing to a scene of an operational industrial area. The overall atmosphere of the image communicates a sense of solitude and focus on maintenance or inspection tasks within an industrial environment.","title":"Aeration tanks under construction at the new Spring Creek Water Pollution Control Plant.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547948","543649","557388","543810","553428","557386","544702","546046","550225","543653","547890","550853","546206","551925","557387","557390"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["canal","pipe","bottom","valve","task","drainage","parallel","inspection","communicate","inspect"]}
