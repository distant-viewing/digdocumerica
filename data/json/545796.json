{"path":"545796.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a striking aerial view of a rugged canyon landscape at dusk. The terrain is characterized by deep gorges, layered rock formations, and dramatic cliffs. The color palette is rich with shades of deep reds, browns, and umbers, typical of sedimentary rock formations. Shadows cast across the canyons emphasize the textured surfaces and sheer depth.\n\nIn the distance, there are flat-topped mesas and buttes which rise sharply from the valley floors, standing out against a more subdued background. These landforms contribute to the dramatic and varied topography, typical of arid regions shaped by erosion.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests early morning or late evening, as the low angle of the sun creates deep shadows and highlights the three-dimensional quality of the landscape. There are no visible water bodies or vegetation, indicating an arid climate. No human presence, structures, or activities are apparent, emphasizing the natural and untouched aspect of this scenic wilderness area. The vastness and untouched nature of the scenery evoke a sense of solitude and the ancient geological history of the Earth.","title":"Aerial view of Upheaval Dome, perhaps the most geologically interesting feature of the Canyonlands. It is a vast crater, more than a mile across, formed when a salt dome thrust itself up from beneath the earth. The rocks in the center are the oldest, having come from deepest in the earth.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545802","545799","545750","544950","545800","545765","545787","552690","545798","545761","545748","544745","545792","550481","545794","545795"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["canyon","butte","gorge","mesa","formation","landform","rock","topography","history","erosion"]}
