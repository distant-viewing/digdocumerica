{"path":"553788.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene silhouette of an urban skyline against a shimmering body of water, likely an ocean, viewed from a high vantage point. The sky and ocean are bathed in a muted, golden hue, suggesting the photo was taken at sunset or sunrise. No sky is visible due to the brightness of the scene.\n\nIn the lower portion of the image, the outlines of several high-rise buildings can be seen, their forms reduced to dark, almost black shapes because of the backlighting from the golden reflection on the water. These buildings are densely packed, typical of a city's coastal skyline. This silhouette creates a stark contrast with the brightly lit water.\n\nThe body of water is expansive, occupying the middle portion of the image, and is textured by light waves or ripples. The sunlight on the water is diffused, creating a wide band of light that gives the water a metallic sheen. A small sailboat is visible, a tiny silhouette against the vast water, contributing to the calm and peaceful atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is tranquil and somewhat introspective, highlighted by the play of light and the peacefulness of the waterfront setting. The composition masterfully utilizes the contrast between light and dark, emphasizing the natural beauty and the quiet grandeur of an urban waterfront at the beginning or end of the day.","title":"City skyline against the afternoon sun","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["552263","547147","555716","552264","545030","548383","550758","545019","548328","556189","552261","544707","552265","543119","545022","550291"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["not","waterfro","silhouette","water","ocean","skyline","beginning","portion","reduce","backlighting"]}
