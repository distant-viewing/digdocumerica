{"path":"549863.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures an urban street scene that appears to be bustling with activity. The image portrays a busy city roadway, likely in a business or commercial district given the signage and dense traffic. Several cars, including yellows taxis and other vehicles, are compactly arranged on the street, indicating a traffic-congested area.\n\nIn the foreground, a woman stands out prominently; she is dressed in a white fur coat, contributing to a sense of personal style amidst the urban environment. Her solemn expression and direct gaze towards the camera make her a focal point of the image. She is walking between cars, which suggests that the traffic might be stalled or moving very slowly.\n\nThe background of the photograph is crowded with numerous pedestrians who are variably dressed, likely due to cold weather, as indicated by some wearing hats and thick coats. Buildings line the street, and business signs are visible, including one that humorously reads \"Warm places make warm people.\"\n\nThis setting likely portrays a city's everyday hustle, where various elements of city life—traffic, diverse people, commercial advertisements, and architecture—coalesce to provide a dynamic and somewhat chaotic atmosphere. The lighting and colors in the photograph are somewhat muted, contributing to the gritty, authentic feel of an overcast day in a bustling city setting.","title":"Midtown traffic congestion and jaywalking pedestrians","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547191","549849","554310","549874","546626","554314","548369","556199","548410","554331","549859","555782","553822","546672","552711","554329"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["traffic","city","business","street","coat","taxi","bustle","portray","stall","hustle"]}
