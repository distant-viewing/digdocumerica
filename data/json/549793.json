{"path":"549793.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a vivid scene at what appears to be a landfill or dump site. It shows a large pile of garbage covering the ground, consisting of miscellaneous debris and waste materials that have a varied appearance in texture and color, predominantly muted tones of brown, grey, and green, with occasional flashes of brighter colors like red or blue from different types of waste.\n\nA focal point of the image is a large, yellow bulldozer moving on top of the garbage pile. The bulldozer is emitting dark black smoke from a stack, suggesting it is powered by diesel or a similar fuel. The bulldozer appears to be in operation, moving or compressing the garbage as evidenced by the dust and debris disturbed around its tracks, which adds a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nThe background of the photograph is relatively clear, showing a structure that resembles a container or another heavy piece of machinery at the site. The sky is very bright and mostly clear, suggesting the photo was taken on a sunny day. This lighting casts stark shadows and highlights the textures of the garbage and machinery, enhancing the industrial feel of the scene.","title":"In last stage of city waste disposal process, garbage brought by barge from Manhattan is dumped from carts at outer edges of Staten Island landfill.
