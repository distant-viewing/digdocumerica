{"path":"555642.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a barren, rocky landscape under a clear blue sky. The terrain is primarily composed of reddish-brown rocky soil interspersed with sparse green vegetation. The foreground shows a closer view of the rugged ground, which is uneven and littered with numerous rocks and small boulders.\n\nIn the middle ground, the landscape slightly slopes downward before rising again, leading the eye towards the gently rolling hills in the background. These hills line the horizon and extend from one side of the frame to the other, further emphasizing the vast, open nature of the landscape without any visible man-made structures or human presence.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its wide expanse of natural, untouched terrain under a vast sky, communicates a sense of isolation and the arid conditions of this environment. The lighting and clarity of the image suggest it was taken during the day with good visibility, highlighting the starkness and minimalistic beauty of this rugged landscape.","title":"Strip mined land which has been recontoured near Chandlersville, in southeastern Ohio","placename":"Chandlersville (Ohio)","location":"Chandlersville, Ohio","nn1":["555885","555573","544401","549183","544016","543635","549179","549130","544027","552685","543838","544019","545895","543665","548673","552903"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["composed","starkness","hill","boulder","communicate","rug","landscape","clarity","terrain","litter"]}
