{"path":"550079.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene, likely from the 1970s, featuring a woman and various elements associated with street photography. The central figure, a woman, stands by a tripod-mounted camera, angled towards her as if ready for a photo shoot. She is dressed in a patterned, floral mini dress with puffed sleeves, a prominent collar, and a cinched waist, complimented by dark, high-heeled shoes. Her attention seems directed towards a man standing in front of her, visible only from the back, wearing a patterned shirt.\n\nTo her side, there’s a sign leaning against what appears to be a metal post or another tripod leg, labeled \"INSTANT PHOTOS 10¢\". The sign features examples of photos that might be offered, indicating she is perhaps working as a street photographer. \n\nIn the background, one can observe a grassy park area with trees, some other park visitors casually dressed, reflecting a relaxed, communal atmosphere. A young girl in a sleeveless dress can also be glimpsed, walking through the scene. This adds a dynamic element, suggesting a public, possibly busy setting, likely within a park or a similar recreational area where people gather for leisure. \n\nThe photograph as a whole offers a slice of life from a past era, capturing the essence of outdoor, casual photography in a community setting, adorned by the fashion and cultural elements of the time.","title":"On the mall, Cleveland's busy civic center","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551835","553204","551124","545231","549324","556808","554270","556532","548483","557039","550082","553183","553761","551144","551820","551545"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["tripod","photography","patterned","heel","park","dress","example","angl","photographer","waist"]}
