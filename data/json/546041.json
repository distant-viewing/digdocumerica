The man is dressed in a dark-colored jumpsuit and sports a wine-colored safety helmet equipped with a visor and ear protection. He wears a gentle smile and his expression reflects a sense of contentment or pride. The helmet has noticeable scratches and marks, suggesting regular use.\n\nBehind him is an intricate arrangement of steel structures, possibly part of a large machine or a construction framework, indicating that this might be a setting in an industrial or construction area. The background consists of metal beams and other mechanical components forming a crisscross pattern, painted in white but showing signs of exposure demonstrating a work-intensive environment.\n\nThe ambient light source seems natural, casting clear daylight on the subject and enhancing the details on his face and the reflective surfaces of the helmet. The focus on the man suggests he plays a significant role, likely emphasizing the importance of safety and skilled labor in industrial settings.","title":"Avondale shipyard worker wears special ear muffs for protection from the heavy level of industrial noise pollution.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["556867","554043","556391","546032","544171","553025","554953","553610","544835","542783","544105","549632","547163","556320","555263","553634"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["helmet","safety","jumpsuit","contentment","scratch","pride","construction","ear","protection","mark"]}
