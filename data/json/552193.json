{"path":"552193.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image features an aerial view of an industrial area located alongside a beachfront. In the foreground, we can see a large industrial complex with several buildings, including one with a tall chimney emitting thick, dark smoke into the air. The smoke is dispersing into the sky, forming a noticeable plume.\n\nAdjacent to the industrial area, there is a busy cargo port filled with many idle ships and large cranes used for loading and unloading shipments. Several smaller buildings, possibly storage facilities, and numerous containers are scattered around the docks, contributing to a scene bustling with industrial activity.\n\nThe background offers a striking contrast with a calm and expansive coastal view where the shoreline gently curves into the distance. Beyond the coast, a range of mountains can be seen under a haze, softly outlining the horizon.\n\nOverall, the photo paints a scene of industrial vigor right next to natural beauty, highlighting a stark coexistence of man-made infrastructure and the natural environment.","title":"Black smoke pouring from Crown Zellerbach kraft pulp mill","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543000","543001","547058","552181","551609","546391","552196","549472","552191","551574","551607","555769","551566","548423","550890","548107"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["beachfront","smoke","unloading","coast","port","coexistence","cargo","plume","ship","chimney"]}
