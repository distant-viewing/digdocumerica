{"path":"543554.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of an aquatic environment, specifically focusing on both water and a muddy, textured surface that possibly includes some aquatic plant life or algae formation. The upper portion of the image shows clear, shallow water that allows visibility of smooth stones beneath the water surface. The reflections and ripples on the water add a dynamic texture, distorting the stones underneath and creating a mosaic of light and dark patterns.\n\nIn contrast, the bottom portion of the image displays a dramatically different texture, possibly of a muddy bank or a densely algae-covered surface. This portion is characterized by a rough, clumpy texture with a mottled pattern of dark and light green, suggesting the presence of wet, possibly slimy vegetation. There are no discernible animals or human activities evident in the scene, focusing purely on the natural elements.\n\nThe division between water and the textured surface creates a natural diagonal line across the photo, giving the composition a sense of dynamic contrast between the aquatic environment and the solid, organically textured surface. This setup provides insight into the varied textures and elements present in a freshwater ecosystem. Also, the natural light seems to be enhancing the details and colors in both segments of the photograph, lending depth and vibrancy to the image.","title":"Scum on waters of truckee river","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["545674","546875","542582","543555","547905","546202","550726","550341","555626","543185","553388","545850","543558","544765","545923","544992"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["algae","portion","surface","texture","distort","stone","mosaic","insight","division","water"]}
