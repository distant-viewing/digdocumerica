{"path":"553359.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a group of four women engaging in an outdoor activity in a forested area. They are dressed in casual, comfortable clothing suited for a day in nature. One of the women on the left side, wearing a floral print blouse and slacks, appears to be standing on a rocky outcropping, engaging in conversation with another woman seated to her right. This seated woman is dressed in a jacket and patterned pants, and she too is actively participating in the conversation.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, another woman, dressed comfortably in a solid-colored shirt and blue pants, stands amidst lush green foliage, deeply engrossed in discussion with the fourth woman. This fourth woman, also seated, wears a distinctive, stylish, animal print blouse and dark pants. She looks attentively off towards the side, likely listening or observing something in the environment.\n\nThe setting is dense with greenery, featuring a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees, and the natural sunlight filtering through the leaves creates a vibrant, lively backdrop. The women, positioned on and amongst large rocks and surrounded by undergrowth and mature trees, seem to be enjoying each otherâ€™s company in this serene wilderness setting.","title":"\"Fern freaks\" follow the shore of the Nissitisset River, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553364","552944","557005","545308","553357","544743","554510","543332","554665","543236","544739","558096","558066","548646","557175","554662"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["woman","print","blouse","pant","outcropping","conversation","slack","undergrowth","seat","participate"]}
