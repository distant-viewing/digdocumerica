{"path":"552656.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a parade, specifically focusing on a marching band composed mainly of young women dressed in matching uniforms. The uniforms are vibrant red and white, consisting of a red top, a white pleated skirt, and white boots. Each member of the band is holding a baton, and they are presumably performing a routine involving twirling and marching as they move down the street.\n\nThe setting is an urban street lined with two-story brick buildings featuring various storefronts, including visible signage that reads \"HENNESY'S.\" The architecture suggests a small to medium-sized town with an early-to-mid 20th century North American main street aesthetic. \n\nThe sky is clear with few clouds, indicating it is a sunny day, which creates bright lighting and deep shadows in the photograph. The perspective is low to the ground, capturing the performers from a slightly upward angle, which emphasizes their motion and the dynamic nature of the parade. Onlookers are visible on the sidewalks, observing the parade, but they are mostly out of focus, highlighting the performers in the foreground. The image conveys a sense of community and celebration, typical of a festive local event.","title":"Labor Day weekend brings the annual Garfield County Fair parade","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["547022","556279","552653","546995","554451","549577","552661","549567","556283","554449","556278","553713","552660","557714","557710","553173"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Crowds"],"terms":["parade","performer","band","uniform","street","onlooker","storefront","celebration","routine","member"]}
