{"path":"543759.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a rugged natural landscape, with a strong focus on both industrial elements and natural beauty. In the foreground, there is a large rusty metal pipe, partially cropped by the frame, extending from the left side of the image. Water is flowing out of this pipe with considerable force, creating a dynamic stream that splashes as it hits the rocky ground below.\n\nThe background reveals a mountainous scene. The central mountain, framed by a partly cloudy sky, has patches of snow on its upper reaches, indicating perhaps a late spring or early winter season. The middle distance of the composition shows rolling terrain with sparse vegetation, predominantly brown and dry, which suggests that this may be an environment that experiences harsh or varying weather conditions.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is rocky and uneven, strewn with stones and boulders, and a few scattered dried bushes, underscoring a somewhat barren and desolate natural environment. The overall color palette of the image includes earth tones with the rusty reds of the pipe contrasting against the muted browns and grays of the rocky landscape and the white of the snow on the mountain.\n\nThis photograph could be illustrating themes of environmental impact and the juxtaposition of human-made structures within natural settings. The presence of the pipe suggests industrial activity, possibly related to mining or water management, implying a narrative about human intrusion in natural landscapes.","title":"Pipe spills water from Idarado Mill into the San Miguel River.","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["543670","543830","543170","552994","552062","543666","552134","547121","544769","553467","550684","546829","549000","545615","543815","549118"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["pipe","snow","reach","intrusion","mountain","boulder","force","terrain","white","stream"]}
