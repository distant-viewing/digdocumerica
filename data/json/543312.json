{"path":"543312.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, misty landscape likely taken at dawn or dusk, based on the soft, muted lighting. The image shows a swath of well-maintained, vibrant green grass that serves as a foreground, which is possibly part of a golf course. Stretching across the middle to the upper portion of the photo is a dense cluster of tall, slender pine trees. The trees are shrouded in fog, which gives the scene a mysterious and ethereal quality.\n\nThe fog diffuses light and obscures parts of the trees and the background, enhancing the atmosphere of tranquility and isolation. There are no visible human figures or animals in the picture, which focuses entirely on the natural elements of the landscape. The combination of the fog, the towering pines, and the lush grass creates a picturesque, peaceful setting that evokes a sense of calm and quiet solitude. The overall composition and the natural elements suggest a cool, damp climate typical of coastal or mountainous areas where fog is common.","title":"California--Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["555536","543406","557014","554754","545012","542849","555119","542847","555124","545209","557019","555126","555132","557601","555110","556985"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["fog","pine","swath","golf","course","misty","shroude","grass","combination","diffuse"]}
