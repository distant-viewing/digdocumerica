{"path":"544039.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting with significant environmental impact, highlighted by the backdrop of a natural landscape. In the foreground, there are arid, sparsely vegetated hills with a winding dirt road cutting through them. This foreground sets a stark, dry tone for the image.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by a substantial industrial complex, characterized by large buildings and towering smokestacks from which thick white smoke billows out. This smoke blends into a hazy cloud that mingles with the natural clouds above, suggesting air pollution.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by rugged mountains that rise majestically, providing a stark contrast to the industrial activity in the foreground. The mountains appear more natural and untouched compared to the industrial activity at their base.\n\nThis juxtaposition highlights the intrusion of industrial development into natural landscapes and possibly hints at the environmental degradation that such facilities can cause. The composition of the photograph, with its layers from dry hills in the foreground to the smoky industry and then to the mountains, tells a story of gradual but impactful human influence on natural environments.","title":"Mining town of Morenci is half hidden by smoke of smelter stacks.
