{"path":"545120.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene marine scene, characterized by a small fishing boat moving through the water near a large rocky promontory. The boat is equipped with multiple fishing rods, extending from the stern, suggesting the boat is either in the process of fishing or prepared to fish. The water around the boat appears calm, reflecting a gentle movement. Set against an early evening or late afternoon sky, the backdrop features a striking contrast between the dark silhouette of the steep, imposing cliff and the lighter blue of the clear sky above, which is without any visible clouds.\n\nThe photograph has a somewhat nostalgic feel, possibly due to its slightly grainy texture typical of film photography. The angle of the sunlight, illuminated from the side, highlights the textures of the cliff and creates a silhouette of the boat and its occupants, adding to the dramatic and peaceful quality of the scene. The overall composition emphasizes the vastness of the natural environment compared to the small, human element of the boat, underscoring a sense of solitude and the scale of nature's grandeur.","title":"Cape Kiwanda, site of excellent salmon fishing, and of a potential nuclear plant","placename":"Kiwanda, Cape (Or.)","location":"Kiwanda, Cape, Oregon","nn1":["545055","554147","549374","547556","552308","547549","548247","545170","543411","555694","545900","543046","547553","549380","547558","553991"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","fishing","cliff","silhouette","occupant","photography","rod","film","grandeur","texture"]}
