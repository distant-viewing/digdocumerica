{"path":"548615.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man sitting on a red public bench. He is dressed in both casual and formal attire: sporting a dark blazer on top and, more casually, navy shorts. His right foot is atop the bench, showing off a white sock and a black loafer. The man has a genial expression with a broad smile.\n\nThe setting appears to be a sunny outdoor area, possibly a park, given the presence of palm trees in the background alongside other lush greenery. Behind the man and the bench, there is a clear view of a five-story, white-colored building that looks relatively modern, suggesting an urban backdrop. The sky is bright and clear, indicating a sunny day.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a joyful, relaxed moment of an elderly man enjoying his day in a public space, blending a sense of personal style with his surroundings.","title":"Resident of South Beach.
