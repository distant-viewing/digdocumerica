{"path":"555752.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a vivid and diverse landscape, showing a mix of natural and industrial elements. At the forefront of the image is a large, cluttered area filled with various debris and equipment, likely an industrial or waste disposal site. You can see assorted chunks of machinery, containers, and scattered items that cover the ground, creating a chaotic and busy appearance. Some blue and white structures, possibly temporary shelters or storage units, are also visible among the debris.\n\nThe middle part of the image features expansive green fields that are divided into irregular plots by dark, meandering waterways or drainage ditches. These fields are likely agricultural or undeveloped lands, offering a stark contrast to the cluttered site in the foreground.\n\nIn the background, parallel lines suggest a highway or railway, beyond which more green fields and scattered ponds or wetlands can be seen. These ponds reflect light and add a natural aesthetic to the otherwise human-altered landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a snapshot of a region where industrial, agricultural, and natural environments intersect. The photograph likely serves to highlight environmental or land use contrasts within the area.","title":"Destruction of wetlands at Hackensack meadows, New Jersey lands adjacent to the bight, rivers flowing into it, and bays and estuaries edging it have direct impact upon the environment of the coastal waters.
