{"path":"552020.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph features an expansive view of a large body of water with several visible activities and structural features. In the foreground, we see a large barge moving through the water from left to right. It produces a noticeable wake behind it and appears to be following a path marked by buoys. There are also two smaller boats visible; one closer to the barge and another near the bottom right of the image. These boats are likely tugboats, indicated by their size and the waves they are generating.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple docks or shipping terminals extensively loaded with cargo containers, suggesting this area is a significant commercial port. Several cranes and other industrial equipment are visible, supporting the operation of loading and unloading goods. The waterfront is lined with multiple large buildings, possibly warehouses or processing facilities.\n\nBeyond the immediate industrial zone, the image captures an urban skyline with high-rise buildings, indicating a large city's proximity. The sky is clear, and the overall lighting suggests it might be midday. The aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of the industrial maritime activities and their integration into the urban environment.","title":"Kill Van Kull with Bayonne in the background.
