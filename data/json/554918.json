{"path":"554918.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of manual labor, likely at a construction or industrial site. The setting is a cluttered workshop filled with a variety of tools and equipment. In the center, a worker wearing protective gear, including a helmet, is intensely focused on welding a piece of metal. The welding process generates a vivid and dynamic spray of sparks that fan out across the scene, highlighting the intensity and heat of the work.\n\nThe background is densely packed with assorted objects related to the worker's task: hanging electrical wires, shelving stocked with equipment, and protective clothing hanging on the wall, further suggesting that this is a habitual workspace for physically demanding and potentially hazardous tasks. Various pieces of metal and machinery parts are scattered around, reinforcing the industrial nature of the work environment.\n\nThis image conveys a palpable sense of energy and craftsmanship, emphasizing the gritty and physical aspect of manual labor. The long exposure used to capture the image of the sparks in motion adds a dynamic flair to the otherwise dark and enclosed space.","title":"Machinery being repaired at a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554931","558303","544316","558304","555955","556269","544331","556863","556267","549695","546023","554864","545536","544001","544004","549693"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["spark","labor","parts","worker","hang","demand","flair","fan","stock","piece"]}
