{"path":"552230.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic aerial view of a sunset over a watery landscape, possibly a river or coastal area. The central focus is the spectacular reflection of the sun on the water which creates a glowing path that leads into the horizon. The surrounding area is dimly lit, highlighting several key features:\n\n1. **Sunset and Sky**: The sky is adorned with multiple hues, mostly orange and yellow around the sun, blending into darker tones towards the edges of the photograph. Clouds are faint but visible, creating a layered effect in the sky.\n\n2. **Water Bodies**: The water is calm, reflecting the sunset brilliantly. It seems to be a river or a series of interconnected waterways that dominate the landscape, speckled with numerous reflective surfaces possibly due to the low sun angle.\n\n3. **Land**: The landmasses are mostly silhouetted against the bright water, with details obscured by the shadows. These include peninsulas and possibly small islands, which are interspersed throughout the water body.\n\n4. **Human Elements**: There appears to be a road or bridge running along one of the landforms, discernible due to its linear, lighter appearance contrasting with the surrounding dark land masses.\n\n5. **General Atmosphere**: The overall tone of the image is serene and somewhat mysterious, enhanced by the muted lighting and the vast expanse of nature it encompasses. The time of day and the orientation of light suggest that this is either an early morning or late evening scene.\n\nThis photograph might evoke feelings of tranquility and a sense of the vastness of the natural world, juxtaposed subtly with human influence seen in the infrastructure present.","title":"Lake Washington at sunset.
