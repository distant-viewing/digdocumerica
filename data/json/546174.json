{"path":"546174.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a vintage bus with several passengers visible through its large, rectangular windows. The bus has a classic design with dark panels lined with rivets and bright red upper portions including the window frames. On the side of the bus, a prominent advertisement for \"Taaka Vodka\" is featured, displaying a graphic of the vodka bottle and cartoon illustrations of two people, along with the slogan \"Mixes easy... just add people.\"\n\nInside the bus, three individuals can be seen, each engaged in different activities: the first person, seated near the first window, is reading something from a small book, the second person at the middle window is also reading or examining a small, notebook-like object closely, and the third person by the last window appears to be looking out or is in thought. The interior of the bus suggests modest comfort with a functional design typical of public transport from previous decades.\n\nThe bus's overall ambiance is somewhat nostalgic, highlighting an era of simpler, yet distinctive, public transport design. The setting does not reveal much about the location or the time of day, but the focus is clearly on the interaction of the advertisement with the everyday activity of bus passengers.","title":"Trolley car","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546244","554264","556795","556745","556797","556748","555978","556743","546604","556756","554241","556034","553957","546655","556792","556789"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["bus","window","advertisement","passenger","transport","person","rivet","cartoon","notebook","graphic"]}
