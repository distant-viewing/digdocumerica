{"path":"544464.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts the aftermath of a destructive event, possibly a storm, as viewed from the interior of a severely damaged building. The foreground shows a scene of chaos inside what appears to be the skeletal remains of a building; fragments of the structure and debris are strewn across the floor, and portions of the wall and ceiling are torn away, exposing the exterior.\n\nIn the exterior, we can see a yard littered with debris, including large pieces of corrugated metal, chunks of wood, and other unidentifiable materials scattered across the ground. The scene is set in a residential area, as indicated by the presence of green, leafy trees and grass, which suggest a tranquil environment that contrasts sharply with the devastation.\n\nThe damage visible in the photograph indicates a violent force, tearing apart man-made structures with little regard for their integrity, resulting in exposed interiors and scattered remnants. The image encapsulates a moment of quiet after what must have been a powerful and noisy event, highlighting the stark contrast between human constructions and the overwhelming force of nature. This portrayal vividly communicates the impact of natural disasters on human settings, evoking a sense of loss and the need for recovery and rebuilding.","title":"Part of widespread damage caused by flooding of Guadalupe River","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["544463","547079","544797","547888","557993","544467","544461","547868","544458","547130","544583","544468","545966","554437","555540","550260"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["tear","force","damage","exterior","interior","expose","loss","recovery","regard","chunk"]}
