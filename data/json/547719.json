{"path":"547719.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a striking and serene sunset landscape. At the center of the image, the sun is setting, radiating a bright, warm glow that subtly transitions from golden yellow at its core to a gentle orange and then into darker shades of purple and blue that fill the sky. Dominating the foreground are the silhouetted forms of two trees, one significantly larger and more robust than the other, set against the illuminated backdrop of the sun's descent. These trees appear as dark, detailed outlines that stand out sharply against the lighter sky.\n\nThe setting sun is framed by an expansive sky, which shows a scattering of clouds. These clouds catch some of the fading light, creating a varied texture of grays and whites that contrast with the darker parts of the sky. The lower horizon is a simple, flat line that suggests a wide, open plain, typical of a savannah or grassland. This line separates the sky from the land subtly, enhancing the vastness and open space conveyed in the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its simple, powerful elements—the sun, the trees, and the expansive sky—creates a calm yet dramatic scene that highlights the natural beauty and tranquility of the landscape at sunset.","title":"California--near Calipatria in the Imperial Valley, southwest of Blythe","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["554731","552335","552338","543410","557957","543145","543137","549847","557447","542625","542680","546100","550646","557629","543415","542618"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","sunset","core","descent","scattering","set","grassland","radiate","sky","cloud"]}
