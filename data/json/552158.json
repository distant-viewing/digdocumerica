{"path":"552158.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph presents a scene of environmental debris and pollution near a body of water. In the foreground, there is a large accumulation of scattered wooden planks and other fragments scattered haphazardly. The wood appears weathered and worn, suggesting it might be wreckage or discarded construction material. Portions of the wood are submerged in dark, murky water, indicating the proximity to a water body.\n\nTowards the midground, there is a partially sunken object that resembles part of a wooden structure, perhaps a boat or a dock, that is deteriorating and collapsing into the water. This object is large, dark-colored, and heavily weathered, contributing to the overall scene of decay and neglect.\n\nThe background features calm blue water, suggesting a lake or a slow-moving river. The overall ambiance is somber and serves as a stark reminder of the impact of pollution and the abandonment of man-made structures in natural environments. The composition powerfully conveys themes of decay and environmental degradation.","title":"Low tide exposes steel log bands dumped in the Snohomish River.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550352","549311","547626","555784","547582","552046","547897","552204","547907","551440","552127","549307","546854","547525","547622","546838"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["decay","pollution","wood","reminder","wreckage","water","dark","fragment","object","accumulation"]}
