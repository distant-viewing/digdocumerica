{"path":"551455.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a towering, dark-toned skyscraper under a cloudy blue sky. The building, which dominates the composition, has a sleek, reflective surface that mirrors the clouds and light, featuring a curved design that adds a modern, dynamic aspect to the urban skyline.\n\nIn the foreground, a distinctive streetlamp draws immediate attention. This lamp features a unique design with three transparent, cylindrical casings mounted on a metallic pole, each housing multiple light bulbs. The clarity of these casings contrasts with the dark, opaque façade of the skyscraper, creating a striking visual juxtaposition.\n\nThe setting appears to be an urban area, indicative of a bustling city center, showcasing architectural innovation and design. There is also a faint, older building with classical architectural elements visible in the reflection on the skyscraper, adding a layer of historical context to the scene. This mix of modern and traditional elements suggests a complex, layered urban environment.","title":"New I.D.S. building is background to light fixture on Nicollet Mall.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["550007","555426","549997","553328","549317","555278","545869","549487","557271","550011","546539","545885","549971","555419","555736","544668"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["skyscraper","design","bulb","layer","housing","façade","clarity","lamp","mirror","aspect"]}
