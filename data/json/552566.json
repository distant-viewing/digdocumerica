{"path":"552566.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a pastoral scene set in a hilly landscape. The photo shows a group of cows, mostly reddish-brown in color, grazing and walking along a grass-covered hillside. To the right, the hillside is bordered by a dense forest of tall, thin trees that appear to be a type of conifer. The foreground on the left shows a rugged terrain with patches of grass and some bare earth, gently sloping downwards.\n\nThere is a winding dirt path visible, running parallel to a wooden fence that divides the grassy hill from the tree line. The path seems well-trodden, possibly used by the cattle or by farmers to access different parts of this rural area.\n\nIn the background, multiple hills rise one behind another, creating layers of varying shades of green and brown under a clear blue sky. The sunlight enhances the vivid colors of the landscape, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day. This scene is serene and picturesque, typical of a rural or agricultural setting.","title":"The oldlands' summer cow camp is fifteen miles south of their piceance creek ranch.
