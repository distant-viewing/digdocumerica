{"path":"547848.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures an array of fresh seafood displayed on ice, likely taken at a fish market. The assortment features various fish and other seafood. In the forefront, several whole fish with glistening scales and sharp features are placed prominently. Some of these fish have distinctive, streamlined bodies with darker backs and lighter bellies. There are also what appear to be cut sections of larger fish or fillets with white, fleshy textures visible.\n\nScattered among the fish are crushed ice particles providing a fresh, chilled look to the display. A couple of small, brown tags with handwritten markings can be seen inserted into the ice among the seafood, possibly indicating prices or types of fish. The angle and soft lighting accentuate the fresh, moist appearance of the seafood, suggesting that the image was taken in natural light, possibly near a window where some sunlight is trickling in, casting subtle shadows and giving a muted, cool tonal quality to the photograph. The background is obscured with a focus on the fish, emphasizing the detail and freshness of the market's offerings.\n","title":"Fresh fish for sale in Sheepshead Bay, fishing and boating center.","placename":"Brooklyn (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Brooklyn, New York","nn1":["554095","545063","554093","544987","554098","542892","545075","544995","547856","550320","546792","544978","545284","543189","545274","543916"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","seafood","ice","market","freshness","offering","price","tag","particle","assortment"]}
