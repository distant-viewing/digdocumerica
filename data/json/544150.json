{"path":"544150.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic nighttime scene of a massive dam. The dam, illuminated by ambient light, is visible in the composition, extending horizontally across the image and is partially obscured by the dark rocky foreground.\n\nThe terrain around the dam is rugged and stark, characterized by deep canyons and eroded rock formations which are typical of arid, desert landscapes. The rocks and cliffs are dark, primarily in shades of deep reds and browns, suggesting this might be a location such as the American Southwest.\n\nIn the lower center of the image, water can be seen cascading from the opening at the bottom of the dam, producing a powerful spray that is highlighted by the ambient lighting, creating a misty effect in the canyon below. This suggests that the dam is actively releasing water, possibly as a controlled spillway release or hydroelectric generation activity.\n\nNo people are visible in the photograph, emphasizing the isolation and natural beauty of the environment. The sky, barely visible at the top, appears to be dusky, possibly at dawn or dusk, contributing to the overall low-light conditions of the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a compelling interaction between human-made structures and the natural environment, showcasing both the immense scale of the dam and the rugged, untouched quality of the surrounding landscape.","title":"View of glen canyon dam from overlook","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544166","544141","553828","549004","553136","544151","548013","548927","548925","544140","548012","548947","548007","550654","550701","551212"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","release","canyon","spillway","generation","nighttime","erode","produce","rock","cascade"]}
