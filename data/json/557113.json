{"path":"557113.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph captures a portrait of an elder man and woman standing outdoors in a rural setting. Both individuals are dressed in casual farm clothing. The woman wears a light-colored dress adorned with a floral pattern and a white apron, and she has her hair wrapped in a scarf. She leans slightly on a wooden stick. The man is dressed in a light yellow-checked shirt and matching trousers, topped with a blue cap, and holds a gardening hoe.\n\nBehind them, the background features a landscape of gentle hills with dense greenery and sparse autumnal trees. A small collection of buildings, possibly a small village or farmhouses, can be seen in the mid-distance. The architecture is simple, with visible white and wooden exteriors.\n\nThe overall ambience of the image suggests a peaceful, rustic lifestyle, possibly capturing a moment of rest after or before work in their fields or garden. The expressions on their faces reflect warmth and a contented life, possibly indicating their relationship or close bond.","title":"Louis and Ruth Cruse shown planting fruit trees outside their home in White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy in Doniphan County in the extreme northeast corner of the state.
