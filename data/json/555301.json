{"path":"555301.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a warning sign hung on a wall composed of turquoise blue tiles. The sign itself is rectangular and is attached to the tile surface. It is creamy white in color with a border that appears a bit torn or worn down at the edges. The text on the sign is bold and red, reading \"DANGER - WATER UNFIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION\". The lettering is all in uppercase, which emphasizes the warning message. The word \"DANGER\" is larger than the other text, drawing particular attention to the severity of the warning. The lighting in the photograph casts a subtle reflection and slight shadow on some tiles, indicating either a glossy finish of the tiles or the angle of lighting. The tiles are laid in a grid-like pattern, and the condition of the wall appears clean and well-maintained apart from the purposeful sign conveying an important message regarding water safety.","title":"Sign in a restroom along interstate 25 south of Colorado springs, Colorado, warns that water is undrinkable","placename":"Colorado Springs (Colo.)","location":"Colorado Springs, Colorado","nn1":["550272","544227","546240","548063","550688","553749","544971","548865","545621","545949","557879","543645","554567","553905","553859","546303"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["tile","warning","danger","message","sign","text","consumption","severity","regard","wall"]}
