{"path":"557805.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This image captures a vibrant street scene likely from a mid-20th century American town. The photograph features a main street with a distinctive building that draws architectural inspiration from traditional European styles, notably with its red roofing and a charming tower with a pointed roof that resembles a turret. The building is decorated in a quaint, picturesque manner, contributing to the charm of the small town. \n\nIn front of the building, vintage cars are parked along the street, showcasing models from probably the 1950s or 1960s based on their design. The colors of the vehicles vary, including a notable green car which stands out due to its unique tone among other more conventional colored cars. \n\nOn the street, a man is captured walking across a pedestrian crossing. He appears to be middle-aged, dressed in a light-colored suit and trousers, and carrying what looks like a briefcase, giving him a formal appearance that suggests he might be a businessman or traveling salesperson.\n\nThe overall busyness of the scene is emphasised by more vehicles visible in the distant background, along with a clear blue sky peppered with a few fluffy clouds. This setting not only provides a glimpse into the architectural and automotive styles of the era but also reflects everyday life in what appears to be a small, bustling community. The ambiance suggests a warm, sunny day, adding to the lively and inviting feel of the town.","title":"Main Street shopping district in Helen shows the village stores with a unified Bavarian alpine theme. The street is split into two blocks of approximately equal length by the Alte Strasse (Old Street) under the small tower in the background at the right. The Old Street is a cobblestoned cul-de-sac with shops. Helen gained recognition after the townsfolk decided to Renovate the storefronts with a common theme. The project is a success.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557655","546440","546428","552602","542900","557705","556709","549882","545216","557155","556225","549872","548388","551106","551135","551125"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["town","street","turret","busyness","1950","car","briefcase","pepper","crossing","roofing"]}
