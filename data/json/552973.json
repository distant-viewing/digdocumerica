{"path":"552973.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph features three young men sitting and leaning against an urban backdrop, which includes exposed brick walls and a panel of electrical meters. The man on the left, wearing a yellow t-shirt and leaning his arm on a metal bar, is looking at the camera with an intense expression, his other arm crossing in front of him. The middle man is sitting on a metal structure, wearing a sleeveless green tank top and striped pants, with a calm expression and his hands clasped together. The third man, on the right, is wearing a white t-shirt and similarly striped pants, sitting with one arm resting on his leg and slightly turned away, looking off to the side.\n\nThe background bears signs of urban life with graffiti and writings on the walls and meters, such as names and the word \"Ray\" spray-painted in large letters. The environment suggests a somewhat neglected or rundown urban setting, possibly an alley or the back part of a building. The scene captures a moment of rest or casual interaction among the group, giving a glimpse into their daily environment and interactions. The overall mood is relaxed but carries a hint of the gritty urban atmosphere.","title":"The chicano area, or second ward, is slowly giving way to urban renewal.  (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
