{"path":"548477.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a suburban street scene, likely from the 1970s or 1980s, given the style of cars and advertisements visible. In the foreground, on the left, there's a street corner with a signpost including a street sign that says \"NEPTUNE RD.\" Mounted below it is a multi-tier advertising sign featuring logos and names of various companies such as Delta Airlines, TWA Air Freight, and several advertisements related to travel and transportation services.\n\nThe road itself curves slightly and is lined with large, leafy trees that provide a lush canopy over the scene. Parked along the roadside are several vintage cars which further enhance the nostalgic feel of the image. Visible on the right, the photograph shows a pedestrian overpass leading over what could be a park or roadway, indicated by the green areas on either side.\n\nIn the background, residential buildings can be seen, essentially typical two-story homes with porches, characteristic of many American suburbs from this period. The architecture and the design of the neighborhood, combined with the visible elements and details, suggest a community close to an airport, given the focus of the advertisements on air travel and transportation.","title":"Neptune Road","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545419","548500","557840","548889","555584","555438","547859","556435","550105","547369","551021","550093","544452","558039","548504","549113"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["advertisement","travel","street","transportation","signpost","suburb","airport","overpass","say","advertising"]}
