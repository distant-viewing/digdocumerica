{"path":"544498.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a large industrial area with extensive excavation work, possibly a mining or quarry site. The site is characterized by large, curving terraces of exposed earth forming patterns reminiscent of concentric circles, interspersed with strips of unexcavated land. These patterns create a unique, almost artistic geometry when viewed from above.\n\nIn the surrounding landscape, there is a contrast between the rugged, disturbed terrain of the excavation site and the lush green fields extending to the horizon. The fields are presumably agricultural, spanning vast areas with different shades of green, suggesting various types of crops.\n\nOn the left side of the image, near the bottom, there's a body of water, possibly a small lake or retention pond formed due to the excavation. There are some patches of green vegetation around the excavation site, which help to delineate the borders of the disturbed areas.\n\nToward the bottom of the image, several roads or tracks can be seen leading to and from the excavation site, providing access for vehicles, which are visible as small specks in the image, indicating activity and movement within the area.\n\nThis location is a striking representation of human impact on the natural environment, depicted by the contrast between agricultural productivity and industrial alteration. The combination of natural and altered landscapes under a partly cloudy sky provides a compelling and thought-provoking image.","title":"Saga development","placename":"Perrine (Fla.)","location":"Perrine, Florida","nn1":["543861","550573","543674","551204","550574","552004","549170","553050","549174","544438","550572","555812","553051","550568","547225","554815"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["excavation","site","bottom","productivity","quarry","terrace","provoke","delineate","circle","alteration"]}
