{"path":"544975.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively scene of people dining under a large tent with a festive atmosphere. The tent has a bright red and yellow canopy, and there are numerous people seated at long tables covered with white tablecloths. \n\nIn the foreground, there are two main figures at the table. To the right, a man wearing glasses and a patterned brown and orange Hawaiian-style shirt is looking down, apparently focused on his plate, which is partially filled with salad and corn on the cob. To the left, a woman wearing a green sleeveless blouse and a yellow hat with a brown band is eagerly biting into a corn cob she holds in both hands.\n\nBehind them, there are additional diners, including a couple to the left of the woman, both engaged in eating their meals, with the woman similarly eating corn on the cob. Their active engagement with their food suggests a casual and enjoyable mealtime setting.\n\nThe table is cluttered with various dining elements such as white styrofoam cups, condiment bottles, cutlery wrapped in napkins, and portions of bread or rolls, some with small pats of butter on them. The apparent enjoyment and focus of the diners, along with the casual dining setup, contribute to a convivial, community-oriented atmosphere typical of outdoor or event-based communal meals.","title":"Salmon bake, held by community of Browns Point to raise money for children's playground.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544990","551276","554861","551277","557792","556530","557795","549444","557664","545738","558188","558294","551336","557934","543631","551419"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["corn","diner","dining","table","eat","tent","meal","condiment","woman","sleeveless"]}
