{"path":"550744.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an urban riverfront scene, dominated by a prominent stone bridge in the foreground, which crosses over a wide river with visible ripples and some white water. The bridge appears sturdy and functional, carrying a few cars across its span. On the farther side of the bridge, it connects to a dense, historic-looking town.\n\nThe town is built on a slope rising from the river, and is composed of various buildings with a mixture of architectural styles, predominantly red brick buildings, that seem to be from the late 19th to early 20th century. Notable features of the town include a church with a tall, white steeple that punctuates the skyline significantly. In addition to the church, other significant buildings are visibly labeled, such as \"First National Ice Co.\" and \"Casco Bank\", which contribute to the feeling of a bustling small town center.\n\nThe color palette of the scene is dominated by muted reds, browns and greys under an overcast sky, lending an atmosphere of gloom or impending rain. The natural setting around the town features lush green hills, indicating a temperate climate and adding a natural contrast to the urban environment. The overall composition effectively portrays a typical small American town scene capturing both its architectural heritage and natural surroundings.","title":"Looking across the Androscoggin River to the city of Auburn from the Lewiston side.
