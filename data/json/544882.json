{"path":"544882.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a small town street scene, likely in a rural or semi-rural area. The image includes several buildings and a variety of signage, giving it a quaint, somewhat historical ambiance.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, there is a two-story building with a flat facade and what appears to be a weathered white paint job. Attached to this building is a single-story extension with a sloped roof. This building complex has a rustic wooden fence running in front of it, and there's a large green tree partially obscuring it.\n\nMoving towards the center and right side of the image, there is a single-story building painted green with a large sign that reads \"Villa Grove Cafe,\" indicating it is a local eatery. Next to this café, continuing on the right, there's a series of other commercial establishments, all single-story and similar in height and style.\n\nFurther right, you can see a more distinguishable setup including gasoline pumps from Texaco, suggesting a gas station. Adjacent to it are signs indicating the presence of a liquor store and other businesses, possibly offering food and general merchandise (“FOOD” signage visible).\n\nThe backdrop of the street scene is a relatively flat landscape with large, open skies that are partly cloudy, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light. The presence of dramatic clouds adds a stark natural element contrasted against the small-town commercial setting. There are no visible vehicles or people, which contributes to a sense of quietness and possibly the photo being taken during a non-peak time or era. The road itself is visible in the foreground, curving slightly as it leads up to and past the gas station.","title":"Colorado--Villa Grove","placename":"Villa Grove (Colo.)","location":"Villa Grove, Colorado","nn1":["545610","558028","557155","558037","557655","552526","556368","557661","551117","551106","554709","556420","552601","545614","558020","551070"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["story","gas","food","signage","town","station","sloped","job","merchandise","café"]}
