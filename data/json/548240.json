{"path":"548240.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures two elderly women standing on the steps of a building that appears to be quite formal and institutional in nature, possibly a church or a government edifice. The building features a classical architectural style with large, symmetrically arranged columns supporting a muted-colored facade. The women are dressed in dark, conservative outerwear suitable for cooler weather, and both are holding handbags. They appear to be engaging in a congenial conversation or farewell, as they are smiling and one of them is gesturing with her hand.\n\nOne of the building's entrance doors is open, welcoming or bidding them farewell, and is flanked by two lamps which emphasize the entranceway. The steps leading up to the door are made of stone, complementing the sturdy and dignified appearance of the building. This setting and their attire suggest they may have attended an event or a service inside.\n\nThe background is barely visible due to the focus on the women and the architecture, but it suggests an open area possibly with sparse vegetation, typical of a well-maintained public or institutional space. The overall composition of the photo conveys a sense of a peaceful and respectful atmosphere.","title":"The Rockport Congregational Church on Sunday morning","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["556176","547006","553484","549290","551817","546489","547411","558402","551923","547379","547175","546855","557702","551813","543036","548625"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["step","woman","door","government","handbag","welcome","attend","building","church","gesture"]}
