{"path":"550512.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph portrays a panoramic view of a rugged, mountainous landscape, likely captured from an elevated or aerial perspective. At the forefront, a winding river cuts through the valleys, surrounded by dense patches of green vegetation. The river appears to meander from the lower left corner and snakes through the landscape towards the central right side of the image, showcasing patterns of erosion and sediment deposition along its banks.\n\nBeyond the river, the terrain opens into a sweeping valley floor that seems relatively flat compared to the surrounding areas. This expanse is sparsely vegetated, hinting at a possible alpine or tundra environment where tree growth is limited by altitude.\n\nRising dramatically from the valley floor are several mountain ranges. Their sharp peaks, some capped with snow, suggest a high-altitude region, possibly part of a chain of mountains accustomed to harsh, cold climates. The mountains exhibit different elevations and layers of geological formations, possibly indicating varying ages and types of rock.\n\nIn terms of color and lighting, the photograph has a cool tone overall, with the greens of the vegetation contrasting subtly against the earthy browns and the grays and whites of the rocky mountainous terrain.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or structures in the image, emphasizing the natural and possibly remote aspect of the landscape, which might appeal to those interested in geology, hydrology, or wilderness exploration. The image captures both the expansive scale and the secluded beauty of this rugged terrain.","title":"The Chandalar Shelf uplit as seen from the headwaters of the Dietrich River. This view looks northeast up the shelf. Pipeline and road will ascend the Bluff to reach the shelf proper, then proceed straight across the northwestern tributary of the North Fork of the Chandalar River seen in the middle distance.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550523","550513","550529","550511","550518","550498","550441","550510","550507","550596","550401","550497","550526","550418","550402","550633"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["valley","altitude","mountain","tundra","deposition","geology","river","floor","terrain","snake"]}
