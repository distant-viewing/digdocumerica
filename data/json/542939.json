{"path":"542939.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a dense forest from an aerial perspective. Most striking are the numerous trees, primarily conifers, which vary in condition from healthy and vibrant to dead or dying. The trees that are dead stand out markedly because they lack foliage and their trunks and branches are pale or white-toned, contrasting sharply against the darker, living trees.\n\nThe lush green colors suggest that the living trees are healthy, likely indicating resilient growth conditions such as sufficient moisture and nutrients. This environment is densely packed, as the trees collectively form a thick canopy. In areas where trees have died, there is increased visibility to the forest floor, or to other trees further beneath the canopy.\n\nThe focus and framing of the image uses natural lighting, possibly taken during midday considering how the light penetrates the forest. The perspective is slightly angled, not perfectly perpendicular to the forest, adding a dynamic element to how the trees are visualized. This angle allows one to appreciate both the height of the trees and the density of the forest.\n\nThis image could be used to illustrate concepts like forest health, the impact of diseases or pests on woodland areas, or the natural process of forest regeneration. The stark contrast between living and dead trees might evoke discussions or thoughts about environmental issues, conservation efforts, or the lifecycle of forest ecosystems.","title":"Pine forest","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555114","554746","545259","555201","542725","555120","555108","555133","554964","555096","555138","542745","555125","555115","554960","555183"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","tree","canopy","concept","lifecycle","perspective","health","conifer","discussion","conservation"]}
