{"path":"557559.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases a tranquil scene of tall grasses silhouetted against a dimly illuminated background, likely depicting either a sunrise or a sunset. What captures the essence of this image is the way light filters through the dense grass, creating a textured mosaic of light and shadow. The tall grasses, which appear as slender blades and possibly seed heads, stand out distinctly against the softer, diffused light in the background which suggests the sky. The composition focuses entirely on these natural elements, provoking a calm and serene mood evoked by the interplay of the natural contours and the subdued lighting. The hues are predominantly dark, punctuated by softer grey and white tones where the light manages to break through the vegetation.","title":"Vegetation in the Santa Monica Mountains near the west edge of Los Angeles County, California. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in the metropolitan area. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure. Several commissions have been authorized by the legislature to restrict coastal development and recommend guidelines for the future.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552312","545069","557104","545495","547616","546154","552485","552504","550389","551370","557191","545209","549847","544884","552554","550489"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grass","seed","mosaic","provoke","blade","sunrise","punctuate","contour","essence","way"]}
