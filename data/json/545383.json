{"path":"545383.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in what appears to be a lower-income residential area. Three children are depicted in the image, engaging with each other in front of traditional wooden houses.\n\nThe central focus of the image is on two boys in the foreground. One boy, wearing a green shirt, is seated and seems to be speaking or gesturing passionately, while holding onto a stick. The other boy, wearing a striped shirt, stands behind him, holding onto the same stick, and looks slightly amused or curious about what the seated boy is saying or doing.\n\nIn the background, another child, also sitting, observes them. This child appears younger and is dressed in a horizontally striped shirt.\n\nThe houses in the image are elevated on stilts, suggesting a region that might be prone to flooding or other environmental challenges. The architecture is simple, with exposed wood and basic construction, and the surroundings are unkempt, with visible debris and bare ground.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, during what seems to be either late afternoon or early evening, given the warm, soft lighting that bathes the scene, highlighting the expressions and actions of the children and the rustic textures of the wooden houses.","title":"Neighborhood near steel plant","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545526","545509","545436","545546","556163","545379","551001","545319","552958","551129","551130","555950","546043","556166","543538","550249"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","child","stick","house","income","stilt","shirt","flooding","challenge","action"]}
