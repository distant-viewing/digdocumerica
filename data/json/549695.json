{"path":"549695.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid, intense scene inside an industrial environment that appears to be a foundry or metalworking facility. The image shows two workers engaged in the process of metal casting or handling molten metal. They are situated on the right and left sides of the composition, each manipulating large crucibles filled with glowing, molten material.\n\nThe worker on the left wears a protective helmet and clothing, and is shown handling the molten metal with a long rod, likely used for stirring or transferring the metal. Sparks and droplets of hot metal fly through the air around this worker, creating a dynamic, almost fiery environment. On the right, another worker, similarly attired in safety gear, is seen pouring the molten metal into another container or mold, guiding the flow with careful attention.\n\nThe background is dark and mostly obscured by the intense light emanating from the molten metal, highlighting the workers and their immediate tasks while subduing details of the surroundings. Little can be discerned in the dim environment beyond the immediate workstations, emphasizing the focus and isolation of the tasks at hand.\n\nOverall, the image conveys the harsh, heated conditions and the meticulous, dangerous nature of work in a metal casting facility. The glow of the metal, the flight of sparks, and the serious focus of the workers underscore the intensity and critical nature of their work.","title":"Hot metal on an assembly line at the Ford foundry in Dearborn","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["544000","549694","544041","543996","544004","545536","557402","549693","557400","545532","544331","557395","544001","544049","557401","544018"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["worker","metal","spark","workstation","fly","task","facility","droplet","work","flight"]}
