{"path":"546888.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing close-up view potentially within an industrial or mechanical setting. The central focus of the image is a large, serrated gear or rotor blade shown in middle distance, spanning horizontally across the image. The gear displays sharp, uniform teeth, indicating its function involves meshing with other components, possibly as part of machinery. It is adorned with icicles, suggesting the environment is cold enough for water to freeze. \n\nThe background and foreground consist of a rough, granular texture, perhaps indicative of sediment, wear particles, or some form of industrial debris. The overall color tone is a blend of dark shades with hints of purplish hues, likely a result of lighting conditions or the photographic process used.\n\nAdditional structural elements can be seen at the top and the bottom of the photo, likely parts of the machinery or enclosure holding the gear in place. These elements contribute to a sense of enclosure around the gear, enhancing the focus on its form and the icicles hanging from it.\n\nOverall, the composition uses depth and texture to create a visually compelling scene that emphasizes both the harsh conditions and the mechanical nature of the setting.","title":"Water filters at the backriver sewage treatment plant.
