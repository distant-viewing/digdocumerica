{"path":"547533.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene where nature and technology intersect. In the foreground, there are densely packed trees with rich greenery, featuring a mix of dark and light green tones which suggests that it's possibly spring or summer. The trees are tall, showing lush, full canopies that frame the sides of the image and create a natural border.\n\nIn the middle of the composition, somewhat centered between the trees, is a helicopter in mid-flight. It appears to be a small, possibly civilian helicopter, characterized by its compact body and relatively short rotor blades. The helicopter is shown in side profile, with its body color being predominantly white, accented with darker shading that could be either a design element or a shadow effect. The rotor of the helicopter is in motion, which suggests the helicopter is either in the process of flying through the area or possibly surveying the location.\n\nThe background behind the helicopter is a muted bluish tone, likely representing the sky, but it's mostly obscured by the trees and the angle of the view. This backdrop provides a calm and somewhat overcast sky, enhancing the tranquility of the setting despite the presence of a mechanical object.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a visual story of a helicopter flying through a quiet, wooded area, perhaps near the edge of a forest, blending elements of human activity with the natural environment.","title":"Spraying gypsy moth by helicopter","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["545642","544737","545637","545638","544771","544741","552372","552365","555835","544606","544491","548899","552373","552393","556906","553564"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["helicopter","rotor","blade","tree","flight","border","technology","profile","calm","tone"]}
