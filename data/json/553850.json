{"path":"553850.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up of a person's hands holding what appears to be an ancient, fossilized skull. The skull is largely intact with visible details such as eye sockets, a nasal opening, and other crevices and textures typical of fossils. The color of the skull is a muted gray-tan, consistent with many stone fossils, and its surface is cracked and weathered, indicating significant age.\n\nThe person holding the skull is using both hands to support it, suggesting its size and weight. Each hand is gently cradling the skull, one at the back and the other supporting it from below. The person's hands appear well-cared for, with short, clean fingernails.\n\nThe background is dark, likely to emphasize the details of the fossil. There is no discernible environment or other objects in the frame, focusing all attention on the skull and the handling thereof. The lighting is soft and directional, casting gentle shadows that highlight the textures of the fossil's surface. This helps to illustrate the contours and physical features of the skull, making it the central subject of the photograph.","title":"Normal lung, shown for comparison with lung affected by black-lung disease.
