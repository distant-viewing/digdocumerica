{"path":"552100.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a distressing scene of environmental pollution. It captures a large accumulation of trash spread across a natural landscape near a riverbank. The foreground prominently features a pile of various discarded items such as empty bottles, metal objects, containers, and random debris tangled amongst leafless branches and scattered foliage. Notably, a faded and dirty \"Coca-Cola\" sign is mixed within the trash, adding a vivid detail that contrasts starkly with the natural setting.\n\nIn the background, the river stretches across the image, its calm waters extending to the treeline on the opposite bank. Above this line, the clear blue sky fills the top of the frame. The overall composition effectively juxtaposes the serene beauty of the natural river landscape against the chaotic and grim foreground filled with human waste, highlighting the intrusive impact of pollution in natural environments.","title":"The owner of this huge junk shop on the Kansas river in bonner springs died in 1971.
