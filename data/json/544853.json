{"path":"544853.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene on a mountainous road, likely from the 1970s given the style of the cars and clothing. The setting is a curved road with a low stone wall on the side closest to the viewer, beyond which there is a steep, wooded incline.\n\nSeveral vintage cars, predominantly sedans, are parked along the road. The colors of the vehicles range from yellows to deep reds and maroons, and their designs suggest American makes from the era, characterized by long bodies and prominent grilles.\n\nA group of people, both men and women of varying ages, are scattered along the roadside. Some are standing by the stone wall, looking out presumably at a view not visible in the image, while others are more engaged in conversation with each other. The attire of the people is casual, featuring bright colors and patterns typical of 1970s fashion, like stripes and vibrant jackets.\n\nThe road continues into the distance, curving around the mountain, with more cars visible further along. The natural surroundings suggest a high-altitude location, possibly a national park or a scenic overlook, given the dense pine trees and rugged terrain.\n\nOverall, the photograph offers a nostalgic glimpse into a leisurely day out, possibly a road trip or a family outing, with visible enjoyment and relaxation amid a picturesque natural setting.","title":"Scenic viewpoint","placename":"Rocky Mountain National Park (Colo.)","location":"Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado","nn1":["544389","557684","547185","554710","557705","543856","557016","551240","557655","551324","554706","554699","554031","554551","557230","551116"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["road","stone","maroon","1970","car","incline","grille","wall","trip","pine"]}
