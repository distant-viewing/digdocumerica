{"path":"547771.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph captures a rural scene on a foggy day, presenting elements that suggest neglect or abandonment. In the foreground, we see a dilapidated wooden fence that leads the eye towards an old, overturned car left in disrepair. The car, which seems to be a shell with missing parts and rusted metal, is surrounded by overgrown grass and wild plants, contributing to the sense of decay.\n\nBeyond the car, the landscape opens up to a field bordered by another fence, guiding the view towards the background where two farm buildings are visible. These buildings, likely barns or storage sheds, appear weathered and slightly disheveled, reinforcing the theme of abandonment. Their simple, rectangular forms stand stark against the misty backdrop, which blurs the line between the land and the overcast sky.\n\nThe environment is moist and lush, indicated by the vibrant greenery and the wet ground, suggesting recent rains or a naturally damp climate. This setting evokes a somber and lonely atmosphere, highlighted by the lack of human presence and the quiet emptiness that pervades the scene. The color palette is muted, dominated by the greens of the vegetation, the grays of the sky and structures, and the earthy browns of the wooden elements and the car, all softened by the fog.","title":"Farmland, north of Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["547535","553007","554561","550797","552673","549107","547587","550279","550795","546405","556313","553008","542925","544060","547024","553010"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","abandonment","pervade","emptiness","fence","overturn","shell","miss","soften","fog"]}
