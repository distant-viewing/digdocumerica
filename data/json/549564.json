{"path":"549564.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene focusing on a water discharge area by an old structure, possibly a dam or wastewater treatment facility. The main subject is a large, aging concrete building or structure with multiple levels, showing considerable wear and weathering. It features exposed frameworks, several enclosures, and rectangular openings, suggesting it might be used for water management or regulation.\n\nIn the foreground, dirty white water vigorously flows out from a pipe or conduit situated at the lower part of the structure, creating a turbulent patch in the otherwise calmer, greenish-colored body of water. This suggests the mixing of different water streams, possibly involving some form of discharge or pollution.\n\nThe background and immediate surroundings are not lush or scenic but instead show a functional, somewhat harsh industrial landscape. There are piles of gravel or rubble near the structure, adding to the sense of an operational, utilitarian environment. The scene lacks any visible plant life or vibrant natural elements, reinforcing a somber, industrial atmosphere. No people are visible, focusing attention entirely on the interaction between man-made structures and the natural water body.","title":"Outfall from the city of Niagara Falls sewage treatment plant pours into the Niagara River below the falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["550959","546891","550193","550713","550720","546793","557247","544040","550684","543810","551562","552070","551180","552136","550719","547948"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["discharge","wastewater","water","conduit","regulation","structure","enclosure","rubble","treatment","dam"]}
