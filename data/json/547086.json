{"path":"547086.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a woman engaging in outdoor gardening beside a house. She is in the process of using a shovel, which she's inserted into the soil, hinting at work such as planting or landscaping. The setting appears to be a cool day given her attire; sheâ€™s wearing a quilted dark blue jacket over a blue floral shirt, and blue jeans. Her blonde hair is styled back, and she is focused on her task.\n\nThe background shows the corner of a traditional house with white siding and a white-painted brick overlay at the base. A white-framed window partially appears in the frame. The natural light suggests either a cloudy day or diffused sunlight, contributing to the serene yet active atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe soil at her feet is freshly turned, indicating the beginning stages of the gardening activity, and small clumps and stones are visible within the dirt, adding a textural element to the photograph. Overall, the image conveys a sense of productive solitude and domestic outdoor activity.","title":"Zion homeowner digging out after severe storm on Lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547281","547385","552574","551104","549298","551748","550055","548311","543319","551702","557289","551701","551730","546437","552401","551080"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["gardening","beginning","soil","planting","overlay","shovel","clump","house","landscaping","foot"]}
