{"path":"557924.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a car wash during a wet day. The sky appears overcast and the ground is visibly wet, suggesting recent rain. The setting includes a simple white building, marked as a car wash station, with a roof extending over part of the forecourt providing shelter from the weather.\n\nAt the forefront of the image, a bright blue Volkswagen Beetle, notably featuring a white and dark checkered decal across the front of its body, stands out. The driver side door is open, and a man appears to be either entering or exiting the vehicle. Another individual, a woman with blonde hair, stands next to the vehicle, hands resting on the open door, seemingly engaged in a conversation with the man.\n\nThere are additional vehicles in the scene, emphasizing the busy nature of this place. To the left, partially under the car wash shelter, one can see a red car, possibly another Volkswagen Beetle, with its front hood up and a person working on it. Farther in the background and to the right, another car is visible, demonstrating signs of ongoing maintenance or washing.\n\nIn the backdrop, there are other elements that add to the bustling garage ambiance: a gas station advertisement for a car wash special priced at 25 cents, signs atop poles possibly indicating prices and services, and other assorted infrastructure and buildings that hint at a suburban setting.\n\nOverall, the image provides a vivid snapshot of everyday life from a past era, centered around car maintenance and the small interactions that occur in such communal spaces.","title":"Young woman has stopped at a service station for engine adjustment after her car had failed the emissions test at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. All light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must pass carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions tests annually as well as a safety check that has been in effect since 1940. All other type vehicles registered in the city must undergo only the safety check (see pictures #15471 through 78).","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557926","557766","557927","551920","557921","557905","550093","557875","553488","546128","557878","557893","557874","546665","551912","550096"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["wash","car","price","shelter","decal","maintenance","station","washing","door","vehicle"]}
