{"path":"554932.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image captures a rustic and serene rural scene, highlighted by the gentle glow of either early morning or late afternoon sunlight casting long shadows over the ground. The setting is an open field with patches of sunlit grass contrasting with darker areas shaded by tall trees in the background. The composition includes multiple sheep, mostly concentrated on the left side of the frame, grazing on the field. They are unevenly spread across the field, engaged in eating, and are covered in thick, curly wool.\n\nProminently positioned near the center of the photograph is a small, alert Jack Russell Terrier, standing on its hind legs, possibly watching or herding the sheep. The dogâ€™s presence among the sheep adds a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil and pastoral setting.\n\nThe background is simple and natural, featuring tall trees that appear somewhat silhouetted against a lighter sky, hinting at a woodland edge surrounding the field. The scene evokes a peaceful and traditional pastoral life, possibly suggesting the daily routines in a rural farming landscape. The overall ambience is calm, underscored by the soft, natural lighting and the shadows that texture the field.","title":"Angora goats, herded by a \"wild dog\" on a farm near Leakey, Texas.
