{"path":"554574.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up of delicate wildflowers against a softly blurred, mostly green background. The flowers, which are the focal point of the image, appear to be a variety of honeysuckle. Each flower has slender, elongated white petals that fan out and curve slightly backwards, revealing prominent stamens that extend outward from the center of the flower. There are multiple stamens per flower, each topped with yellow anthers. Soft light illuminates the flowers, enhancing their delicate textures and pale color.\n\nThe flowers are clustered at the end of a thin, green stalk, suggesting they are part of a single plant. The depth of field is shallow, keeping only the flowers in sharp focus while the background features a bokeh effect with varied shades of dark and light green, which could be other plants or leaves. This artistic choice highlights the flowers' subtle beauty against the natural backdrop, emphasizing their structure and the graceful arrangement of their petals and stamens. The overall mood of the photograph is serene and focuses on the simplicity and intricate detail of nature.","title":"Closeup of trout lily (Clintonia), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554576","545726","557618","545695","543597","547642","549230","543623","544875","557167","553368","545291","554595","542970","551368","553366"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","stamen","petal","fan","stalk","choice","plant","close","wildflower","up"]}
