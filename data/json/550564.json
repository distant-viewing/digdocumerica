{"path":"550564.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image displays an aerial view of a dense forest, with the trees tightly packed together, spanning across the entire frame. The forest primarily consists of coniferous trees, evident from the pointed, needled shapes of the tree tops. Various shades of green and some hints of yellow are visible, suggesting a mix of tree species or possibly changes due to seasonal variation.\n\nThe texture of the treetops creates a uniform, rugged pattern that gives an impression of a velvety or brush-like surface from this altitude. There is no visible presence of roads, clearings, water bodies or any signs of human activity, emphasizing the untouched and natural state of the landscape. The shot is taken from directly above, providing a symmetric and encompassing view of the forest, highlighting the vastness and density of the trees. There are no other significant elements besides the forest in the image, placing full focus on the natural environment.","title":"Upland taiga, typical of this area.
