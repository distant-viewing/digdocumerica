{"path":"546665.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene involving several people and vehicles, likely taking place in a city. The foreground is dominated by a classic, dark Volkswagen Beetle, shown from a close, side angle. Its headlights and shiny chrome bumpers are clearly visible, contrasting with the carâ€™s dark color.\n\nIn the background, a group of people and two police officers on motorcycles are gathered. The people appear to be engaged in conversation or observing something out of the frame. The two motorcycles are parked, and the officers are standing on the road, suggesting this might involve some official or organized event. The individuals present are dressed in various casual and formal attire, indicating a mix of possibly everyday passersby and security or event coordinators.\n\nThe setting includes buildings that resemble governmental or institutional architecture, possibly a courtyard or a closed off street near prominent buildings, adding a sense of a formal or significant event happening. The image has a retro aesthetic, perhaps from the mid-20th century, suggested by the design of the vehicles and the clothing style of the figures. The distance from the center of activity gives the viewer a candid, almost voyeuristic perspective of the scene, inviting speculation about the nature of the event captured.","title":"Police question driver of car that was reported as stolen","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["551912","542817","556712","552412","557921","555476","556753","555475","557841","550909","557874","557882","553019","547495","542634","556538"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["event","motorcycle","officer","courtyard","involve","happen","passersby","security","bumper","retro"]}
