{"path":"551599.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a maritime scene that includes a series of industrial structures and boats on a body of water. Specifically, the image highlights two parallel structures that appear to be loading terminals or docks for barges. Each of these elongated structures is aligned from top to bottom in the image, with support pillars visible at intervals, indicating their robust construction.\n\nOn and around these docks, there are several vessels: \n1. A tugboat is directly adjacent to the lower dock, positioned at the front left of the image. This vessel, which is red and white, seems to be maneuvering or assisting a barge.\n2. A large barge is moored at each of the docks. These barges are filled with what could be containers or some other form of cargo, arranged in a neatly organized fashion across the length of the barges.\n3. Between the two docks, a small boat is moving away from the camera view, creating a light wake in the dark water.\n\nThe water itself exhibits a gradient of colors likely due to lighting conditions or water depth, ranging from dark blue to lighter brown towards the shore, indicating possible sediment or shallower water.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the human influence on maritime logistics and transportation, captured from an overhead perspective that illustrates the scale and operation of cargo handling and transport.","title":"Ore docks of burlington northern railroad.
