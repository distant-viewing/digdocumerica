{"path":"544388.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a group of four scuba divers near the edge of a body of water, possibly a sea or lake. The divers are equipped with full scuba gear including wetsuits, fins, masks, snorkels, and brightly colored buoyancy compensatorsâ€”one in yellow, one in bright orange, and two in red. Additionally, they carry air tanks, evident from the steel cylinders strapped to their backs; the tanks are variously colored in yellow, silver, and possibly another shade of yellow or orange.\n\nThree of the divers are facing towards each other while one, with a mask positioned on top of their head, is oriented towards the camera, engaging directly with either the photographer or another member in the group. This central figure is wearing a bright orange suit and appears to be holding a conversation or giving instructions, based on the attentive posture and close proximity of the others.\n\nThe background of the scene is minimally detailed, emphasizing the calm, reflective blue water that stretches to the upper edge of the photograph. The lighting is bright, suggesting daylight conditions with good visibility.\n\nThis arrangement and the equipment worn by the figures indicate a preparatory or instructional activity before or after a dive, focused on interaction and possibly safety checks or debriefing. The overall mood is professional and focused, given the context and gear involved.","title":"Scuba class at lake powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544129","549347","549369","554614","552276","543065","549265","554613","555834","555830","548675","548727","547134","553783","548681","556597"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["diver","scuba","mask","gear","snorkel","dive","wetsuit","tank","fin","cylinder"]}
