{"path":"557237.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph showcases a striking contrast between traditional and modern architectural styles. In the foreground, several teal-colored domes with golden finials top what appears to be a traditional, possibly Eastern Orthodox, church. The distinctive architecture of the church, featuring ornately patterned brickwork and multiple smaller domes, brings an old-world charm that stands out vividly against the skyline.\n\nIn the background, a cityscape composed of various tall buildings, including skyscrapers, can be seen. These buildings represent typical mid-20th century urban design, with straightforward, functional structures made of materials such as concrete and glass. This juxtaposition not only highlights different architectural eras and styles but also suggests a cultural and temporal layering within the urban environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is somewhat overcast, with a cloudy sky that casts a soft, diffused light, dampening the vibrancy of the colors and creating a mood that feels both nostalgic and contemplative.","title":"Contrasting architecture in Southside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, compares the East Block church influence with that of the city's skyline.","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["550001","545873","549997","551442","547229","550062","550011","552042","550024","545429","550271","558030","546499","549971","546521","544668"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["dome","church","layering","teal","brickwork","vibrancy","world","concrete","skyscraper","charm"]}
