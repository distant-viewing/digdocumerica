{"path":"551249.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a rocky natural setting with a single individual, a woman, reclining on a large stone surface beside a body of water. The woman is wearing a two-piece bathing suit with brightly colored floral patterns and she is lying face up on a yellow towel. Beside her is a pair of sunglasses and a folded piece of blue fabric, possibly a shirt or a towel. \n\nIn the background, there is an abundance of plants and a pile of what appears to be litter, consisting primarily of empty drink cans that are scattered among the rocks and vegetation. The environment suggests a recreational area, possibly frequented by visitors, but there is evident disregard for clean-up shown by the discarded cans.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of relaxation juxtaposed with environmental neglect. It emphasizes a contrast between human leisure activities and their impact on natural surroundings.","title":"Sublime indifference?
