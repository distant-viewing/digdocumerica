{"path":"555764.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a busy port area and surrounding environment, likely taken during the mid to late 20th century based on the appearance and quality of the image. The scene captures multiple elements indicative of a thriving industrial and maritime location.\n\nIn the center and left portion of the image, you can see a large body of water with several ships, both moving and docked. There are oil or fuel storage tanks near the shoreline, suggesting the presence of a petroleum handling or storage facility. This part of the port includes various large, industrial buildings and some smaller structures, potentially warehouses or factories.\n\nA notable feature is the multiple bridges visible in the scene. On the left side, there is a large arched bridge, possibly a road or railway bridge, crossing over the water. There are also two drawbridges; one is in the lowered position, allowing road traffic, and the other is raised, presumably to let maritime traffic pass through.\n\nThe right side of the photograph shows more bodies of water and land with dense greenery, suggesting residential or less developed areas beyond the industrial waterfront. Visible smoke or steam in the background possibly indicates ongoing industrial activity.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its wide coverage of both industrial and natural landscapes, provides a comprehensive view of the interconnectedness of urban-industrial infrastructure with natural waterways. The image is framed in such a way that leads the viewerâ€™s eye across the bridges and the water, circling back to the industrial heart of the scene. This photograph likely serves as a historical record of industrial development in a coastal area.","title":"Newark Bay, New Jersey. Lands adjacent to the bight, rivers flowing into it, and bays and estuaries edging it have direct impact upon the environment of the coastal waters. The New York, New Jersey metropolitan region is one of the most congested urban and industrial areas in the world.
