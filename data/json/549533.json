{"path":"549533.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a rugged coastline featuring intricate wood construction structures that appear to be built on rocks or a coastal reef. The ocean water surrounding the structures is foamy and turbulent, suggesting strong waves or rapids. On the wooden structures, groups of multiple golden-colored statutes, possibly representing people or mythical figures, are placed in clusters, standing upright. These figures are positioned in different areas on the wooden platforms that appear interconnected and reinforced with additional wooden elements, providing stability against the ocean's force.\n\nThe overall impression is of an organized, dramatic setting where these structures and figurative elements face the natural energy of the sea. The artistic installation or cultural display utilizes the natural environment and human-made forms to create a striking visual narrative. The interaction between these static figures and the dynamic ocean evokes themes of resilience, tradition, or mysticism, depending on their cultural context.","title":"Tourists swathed in yellow raingear cluster at \"Cave-of-the-Winds\" at the base of the cliffs on Goat Island for a head-on view of the American Falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["543288","543426","543242","553772","543359","547118","543405","552955","554152","549338","546378","545024","553923","547068","543364","545130"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["ocean","figure","reef","stability","rapid","tradition","installation","force","structure","resilience"]}
