{"path":"551743.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a richly planted urban garden amid a bustling cityscape. The foreground prominently features a lush, vibrant assortment of flowers, including roses and other flowering plants with varied hues of yellows, reds, and whites. A narrow, winding pathway, seemingly made of stone or concrete, creates a guiding line that moves the viewer's eye through the diverse flora.\n\nBeyond the immediate garden setting, the midground reveals activity on the city streets, with cars and a few pedestrians (including one person crossing the street and others walking along the sidewalk). The cars are of vintage styles, indicating the photo may be from a few decades earlier. Various commercial signs can be seen, indicating the presence of shops, adding a layer of urban daily life to the scene.\n\nIn the background, a series of buildings of varying architectural styles and heights line the street. On the left, a tall, red brick building with multiple stories features large windows and decorative quoins, suggesting a residential or a mixed-use building. The center and right of the image show other buildings, including one with a flat iron facade, adding architectural diversity to the scene. The skyline gives a sense of a dense, built environment typical of city centers, possibly in an area combining both commercial and residential uses.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the serene, colorful garden in the foreground against the bustling, urban environment in the background, highlighting a slice of city life where natural beauty is integrated into the urban landscape.","title":"Community pressures made possible this garden in a lot acquired by adjacent St. Vincent's Hospital for its future expansion. The garden is maintained by volunteers working mostly at lunch hours. The result is a magnificent display of plants in profuse and continual bloom.
