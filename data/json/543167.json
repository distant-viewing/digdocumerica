{"path":"543167.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph showcases an intriguing natural ice formation on plant matter, possibly near a body of water. The focus of the image is a cluster of ice that has formed bulbous, clear shapes, resembling oversized water droplets or glass pebbles. These ice formations have gathered densely at the core of the image, clinging to strands of what appears to be dried grass or reed plants.\n\nThe surrounding area is dark, likely intimating that the water or possibly wet, dark soil is nearby, reflecting light in some patches which adds a sparkling contrast to the otherwise dark environment. The ice-packed plants are lit up brightly, perhaps by natural light, accentuating their translucency and the intricate detail of each individual ice formation.\n\nThe overall composition foregrounds the icy textures against the dark background, creating a dramatic and detailed visual focus on the natural phenomena of ice encapsulating and preserving the slender plants. Such scenes are common in cold environments where freezing temperatures cause water around and within plants to freeze rapidly, often creating artistic, sculptural formations.","title":"At an elevation of 11,200 feet, ice remains through may","placename":"Monarch Lakes (Calif.)","location":"Monarch Lakes, California","nn1":["557197","557607","557200","543562","557198","557199","543098","543565","547166","557609","547145","543656","545923","543770","557592","543564"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["ice","formation","plant","packed","icy","core","phenomena","freeze","strand","matter"]}
