{"path":"545535.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people engaged in manual labor in a natural outdoor setting. The scene depicts multiple individuals, most likely volunteers or workers, actively participating in clearing vegetation and debris from a muddy, water-filled trench or small stream. The water is murky, showing a reddish-brown color, possibly due to soil erosion or sediment.\n\nThe workers are dressed in simple, casual clothing suitable for laborious activities: white T-shirts, trousers, and boots or high-wading shoes. Some are wearing hats for protection against the sun. The equipment used in their tasks includes shovels, sticks, and possibly machetes or similar tools to cut down overgrown vegetation.\n\nIn the background, there are green trees, dense shrubs, and a glimpse of a building in the far right corner. The atmosphere looks humid and overcast, suggesting a warm, possibly summer season. The environment suggests a rural or semi-rural area, giving the impression of a community effort to maintain or restore a natural waterway.","title":"Prisoners from Jefferson County jail clear branches from polluted stream.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545531","543439","550224","551427","555876","555562","544003","548191","542655","544469","542601","548198","552948","551416","555877","545725"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["worker","trench","wade","shovel","protection","participate","stick","sediment","boot","clear"]}
