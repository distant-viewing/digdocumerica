{"path":"550123.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of a large building's exterior facade made up of many large glass windows framed in dark material, possibly metallic. The building appears modernistic, primarily featuring a grid pattern created by the intersection of the window frames. Most windows reflect the sky and some indistinct external structures which are not clearly visible due to the glare.\n\nThe building's windows vary slightly in details; a few windows are opaque or adorned with curtains, suggesting interior spaces of different uses or privacy preferences. Particular attention is given to one window where the curtains are slightly parted, and a person is visible sitting close to the window. This individual seems to be engaged in an activity, perhaps reading or looking out, sitting in a casual, relaxed pose.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the repetitiveness and uniformity of modern office or apartment buildings, while the individual at the window adds a human element, hinting at the personal stories unfolding within this architectural grid.","title":"Park centre, downtown apartment building at east 12th and chester streets.
