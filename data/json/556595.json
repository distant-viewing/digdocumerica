{"path":"556595.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly couple posing beside a bright orange vehicle, likely a pickup truck, which prominently features a yellow light on its roof. The setting appears to be in a rural area with lush greenery in the background and a dirt road beneath them.\n\nThe man, positioned on the right, is leaning comfortably against the truck with his left arm resting atop the open window. He is smiling gently at the camera, wearing a light blue and white checkered short-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and a dark fedora hat. His expression and posture emit a sense of contentment and relaxation.\n\nThe woman stands to his left, closer to the center of the frame. She wears a black and white patterned blouse adorned with large buttons and a kerchief around her neck, possibly for warmth or as a fashion statement. Her hair is styled in curls, and she wears glasses. Her facial expression is more serious compared to the man's, adding a contrast between the two.\n\nThe overall composition and the vintage style of their clothing suggest that the photograph may have been taken several decades ago. The presence of the truck and their attire also imply a certain working-class or rural lifestyle, possibly highlighting their identity or life in a specific region. The image conveys warmth and a snapshot of life in a less urbanized setting.","title":"Mr. and Mrs. Berry Howard of Cumberland, Kentucky, and the new truck he just bought with some of his black lung payments, he retired from the mines several years ago, the disease results from coal dust particles filling air sacs in the lungs and causes a progressive shortness of breath.","placename":"Cumberland (Ky.)","location":"Cumberland, Kentucky","nn1":["552609","546092","544349","554192","557113","544329","545504","556493","548306","546093","548614","551948","552087","550152","546176","548303"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["truck","warmth","contentment","statement","fedora","working","identity","class","pickup","lifestyle"]}
