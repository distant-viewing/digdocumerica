{"path":"549039.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a barren, open landscape, likely a desert area, under a clear blue sky. Dominating the foreground is a white wooden sign with hand-painted black lettering that reads \"LAND FOR SALE\" followed by a phone number and a P.O. box address in Downey, California with a ZIP code. The terrain in the picture is flat and largely devoid of vegetation, except for sparse patches of small bushes and some grass. In the distance, several low mountains or large hills can be seen under the bright daylight, adding some variation to the otherwise flat landscape. The setting appears dry and arid, indicative of a desert environment. The image captures a sense of solitude and emptiness, emphasizing the availability of the vast land for sale.","title":"Desert real estate","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545824","557553","543115","547648","543637","554123","543641","544136","543556","554133","556989","545049","543100","553831","543101","544118"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sale","desert","code","emptiness","availability","address","phone","land","lettering","variation"]}
