{"path":"546364.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a focused and detailed activity involving scientific or medical work. The central focus of the image is on the hands of a person, presumably a scientist or environmental analyst, performing a procedure on a large clam or mollusk. One hand is holding the clam open while the other is using a syringe-like tool to either extract a sample from the clam or inject something into it.\n\nThe tool used resembles a plastic syringe with gradations, indicating measurement, and it has text that partially reads “STRIX,” suggesting it is a specialized device for scientific purposes.\n\nIn the background, there's a partially visible sign that reads \"U.S. GOVERNMENT,\" \"CLEAN WATER,\" and \"EPA-REGION IV,\" implying that this activity is related to environmental monitoring or analysis, probably under the auspices of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, particularly in Region IV.\n\nThe focus and lighting on the action indicate a precise and possibly delicate operation, emphasizing the importance of the sampling or testing process, which could be part of environmental conservation efforts, specifically concerning water quality and the health of aquatic life. The person's hands appear professional and skilled, suggesting experience and care in handling the specimen. The background blurred sign sets a formal and governmental tone, aligning the activity to official and possibly regulatory actions related to environmental health and management.","title":"A biologist is injecting a fish with formaldehyde preparatory to shipment to the lab for tissue analysis.
