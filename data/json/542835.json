{"path":"542835.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning aerial view of a forested landscape with significant signs of logging or clearing activity. The majority of the frame shows densely packed, dark green conifer trees, likely indicating a mountainous or hilly terrain. The most visually compelling feature is a series of winding dirt roads or paths that cut through the terrain, creating a contrast with the surrounding vegetation. These roads carve through lighter colored areas where trees have been removed, displaying bare earth or possibly grassy patches, which appear bright under the sunlight.\n\nThe pattern of the roads suggests systematic logging operations, designed to allow access to different sections of the forest. The top left of the image shows where the road enters or continues into a dense forest, possibly linking up with other forest management or logging sites. The composition of the image, with the interplay of natural forests and human-made clearings, creates a dynamic visual that speaks to the interaction between natural landscapes and human activities. The image may provoke thoughts on resource management, conservation, and the environmental impact of logging.\n\nOverall, the photograph gives a bird's-eye view of human influence on a natural setting, characterized by the stark geometric lines of roads against the organic forms of the forest.","title":"\"Clear cutting\"","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542834","542833","556922","545143","557001","556933","555085","542836","542832","556938","556935","555109","556996","551204","542823","555221"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["forest","road","clearing","management","visual","majority","influence","conifer","logging","conservation"]}
