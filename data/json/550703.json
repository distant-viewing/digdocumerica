{"path":"550703.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up of a birch tree, focusing on its trunk. The birch tree's bark is peeling, revealing layers that vary from bright red to faded brown and white. The texture of the bark is rough and tactile, differentiating the smooth, silvery-white parts from the areas where the bark has peeled away in curvy, paper-like sheets. This peeling pattern creates a natural contrast and highlights the tree's characteristic features.\n\nThe tree is surrounded by green leaves, likely from the same or adjacent trees, adding a natural, lush backdrop to the scene. These leaves appear well-lit, suggesting the photograph was taken on a sunny day, providing a vibrant green hue against the reddish and whitish tones of the tree trunk.\n\nThe background is softly focused and offers a glimpse of the forest setting characterized by various shades of green, suggesting this scene is situated in a wooded area. The light and shadows suggest a natural forest environment with abundant vegetation.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph draws attention to the unique beauty and detailed textures of the birch tree's bark, set against a quintessentially wooded backdrop, encapsulating a serene moment in a natural setting.","title":"Mutilated tree in the \"Shelburne Birches\" area on the Androscoggin River.
