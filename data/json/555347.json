{"path":"555347.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph shows a scene involving a solar energy installation. In the foreground, a large, intricate mechanical apparatus is featured prominently. It seems to be part of a solar tracking system, equipped with gears, metal frames, and possibly reflective or photovoltaic surfaces aimed at optimizing the capture of solar energy.\n\nA man stands in the background on the right side of the image. He is on a raised, angled structure, possibly a roof or specially designed platform that supports the solar equipment. The man has long hair, a beard, and is wearing a light-colored short-sleeved shirt. He appears to be overseeing or working on the installation, possibly adjusting or checking the equipment.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, evidenced by the clear blue sky in the background and the bright sunlight illuminating the scene. The environment seems to be well-organized and technical, focusing on renewable energy technologies. Additionally, architectural elements like the white wall or barrier on the right side and possibly the edge of another building on the upper left indicate the installation is near or on a building structure, emphasizing an integrated approach to solar technology application.","title":"Prototype of a linear parabolic reflector used to gather the sun's energy and heat fluid in the center pipe to several hundred degrees F. \"Solar farms\" with banks of such reflectors covering many square miles could drive large turbines and generators and provide almost half the country's electrical energy needs according to the designers.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["555349","555323","555348","555293","555343","557328","555341","555327","555309","557312","557332","557320","557319","555333","557334","555331"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["installation","energy","technology","application","optimize","oversee","equipment","beard","apparatus","approach"]}
