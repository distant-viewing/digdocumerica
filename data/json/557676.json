{"path":"557676.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and cozy porch scene featuring a Dalmatian dog comfortably resting on a colorful striped lawn chair. The chair, constructed with aluminum frames and bearing multi-colored fabric straps in shades of blue, yellow, and green, holds the dog in a sleepy posture, with its head resting gently on the armrest, appearing relaxed and content.\n\nThe setting is lush and natural, indicative of a quiet countryside location. The porch floor appears to be made of a gray, rough-textured material, possibly concrete. To the left of the frame, there's a partial view of a dark motorcycle (only the handlebar and a small portion of the frame are visible), which adds a rustic or adventurous edge to the otherwise peaceful scene. A pot with a healthy plant sits upon what seems to be a heating stove or a small black metal piece of furniture, adding a touch of homeliness.\n\nTrees and greenery lightly blur into the background due to the depth of field used in the shot, providing a soft, natural backdrop that enhances the feeling of tranquility. The upper portion of the image shows the white siding of the house and a simple porch roof, suggesting the dog is in a sheltered and familiar domestic space.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a quiet, restful day at home with nature and tranquility enveloping the domestic outdoor life, highlighted by the presence of the resting Dalmatian which gives life and character to the composition.","title":"The Andy Adams dog takes his ease at the family home on Chattahoochee Drive in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. The family planned to sell their 2 1/2-acre plot and move farther into the mountains because they felt the village the family had lived in for 20 years was becoming \"too crowded\" and the last child still at home wanted to go where he could \"shoot my gun\". A planning report warns that the town could become a tourist center and lose its character if commercial development is unchecked.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557761","553089","545525","553485","555581","555580","546990","551000","556549","551273","543347","557672","547767","549928","557637","549716"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["dog","porch","rest","chair","stove","portion","heating","handlebar","aluminum","strap"]}
