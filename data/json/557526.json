{"path":"557526.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a residential area nestled in a valley with a backdrop of lush, mountainous terrain. Several homes, which appear to be prefabricated or mobile homes, are prominently displayed in the forefront of the image. These homes vary in design; some have slanted roofs, and others have flat roofs, indicated by the different styles and colors such as white, beige, and brown. The scene captures a tranquil suburban setting with homes placed closely together, equipped with small yards and minimal landscaping.\n\nThe background is dominated by a steep, densely forested mountain which gives a sense of seclusion and natural beauty surrounding the community. The sky is overcast, casting muted lighting over the entire scene and enhancing the tranquility and isolation of this valley community.\n\nThe homes show features like large windows, extended porches or sunrooms, and external air conditioning units, indicating a warm climate. There isn't much visible activity in the photograph; however, the presence of these homes indicates a quiet, everyday life within a picturesque, remote setting. The overall composition of the photo, with homes in the forefront and mountains in the back, highlights the interaction between human habitation and the natural environment.","title":"Seminole springs Mobile home park on mulholland drive near Malibu, California, on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county is one of the few developments in the santa monica mountains","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["557404","556580","557527","552603","557339","556468","553927","551101","557547","556472","553929","544816","557379","556394","556601","556423"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["hom","home","forefront","valley","conditioning","porche","community","landscaping","mountain","seclusion"]}
