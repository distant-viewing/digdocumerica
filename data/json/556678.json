{"path":"556678.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"In this photograph, we see a man and a woman engaged in a conversation at a train station information booth. The booth is marked by a sign overhead reading \"TRAIN INFORMATION.\" The sign is suspended by metal poles with spiral decorations near the top, which adds an ornamental touch to the functional setting. The man is dressed in a dark suit and tie and stands on one side of the booth, leaning slightly forward toward the woman as he speaks, suggesting a helpful or informative gesture. He wears glasses and has a serious expression.\n\nThe woman, who appears to be a traveler or a customer, is seated on the other side of the booth. She is wearing a sleeveless blouse with a dark cardigan and is also wearing glasses. She looks attentively at the man, likely listening or inquiring about train-related information. \n\nThe background of the photograph is softly focused but busy with other individuals who might be passengers or station staff, suggesting a bustling station environment. The architecture of the station includes large, open spaces with high ceilings, characteristic of many train stations. The setting and attire suggest this photograph might be from a few decades ago due to the somewhat dated style of clothing and the color tone of the image.","title":"Passenger receives amtrak train information at a counter in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's 30th street station.
