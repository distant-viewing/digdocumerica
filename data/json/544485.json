{"path":"544485.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph shows an outdoor park scene under a sunny, partly cloudy sky. The picture looks to be taken from an elevated point, giving a broad view of the area which includes lush greenery and recreational amenities. \n\nThe park features winding dirt paths, several of which form a loop around a grassy central area with scattered trees, primarily palms. Several picnic tables with attached benches and roofed shelters are distributed across the park, providing shaded areas for visitors to sit and relax.\n\nIn the background, the horizon displays a mixed landscape of dense low trees and some open fields, hinting at a suburban or semi-rural environment. No people are visible in the picture, giving the park a serene, empty look. There are a few cars parked along the side of the paths, implying some visitors might be present, though not captured in the visual field of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements in the image evoke a sense of peaceful public space designed for leisure and enjoyment of natural surroundings.","title":"Picnic area","placename":"Okeechobee, Lake (Fla.)","location":"Okeechobee, Lake, Florida","nn1":["553043","546259","553899","553903","550074","550075","556296","556181","544808","550071","552036","553065","550161","549516","557257","551713"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["park","visitor","picture","loop","path","amenity","picnic","shelter","palm","field"]}
