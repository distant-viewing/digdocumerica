{"path":"557236.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river scene, taken from beneath a bridge structure. A prominent feature in the image is a long, curving line of cylindrical, segmented floats on the surface of the water, primarily colored in red and yellow. These floats form a barrier or delineation on the river, and they reflect gently on the waterâ€™s surface, creating a visual texture contrast to the dark water.\n\nThe bridge from which the image is shot is visible in the top left corner, showing sections of its metal undergirding, which provides geometric patterns against the sky. Beyond the floats and under the bridge, the river extends towards a hazy background, flanked by lush, tree-covered hills that hug the shoreline, suggesting a tranquil, green landscape.\n\nSky and lighting conditions seem slightly overcast, with softer light diffusing through the clouds, resulting in subdued yet rich color tones through the image. The overall feel of the environment is peaceful, with natural and constructed elements coexisting quietly. There is no sign of active human presence or movement, which amplifies the stillness of the scene.","title":"Oil spill boom laid by the United States Coast Guard near the point where the Monongahela River and Allegheny Rivers meet to form the Ohio River.
