{"path":"557293.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a large factory or plant structure. The factory has multiple sections with varying shapes and sizes, including silos, towers, and rectangular buildings. One prominent feature is a tall, thin smokestack emitting a stream of dark smoke into the sky.\n\nIn front of the factory, we can see a foreground of dry, tall grass, which suggests a vantage point from a field or undeveloped land. The background is relatively clear with a light blue sky, and there are no significant clouds visible.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's an electrical pylon, indicating the presence of high-voltage power lines, which are common around industrial areas for power supply. The vegetation visible in the image, particularly a few leafless trees, suggests that the photograph may have been taken during the colder months of the year.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a snapshot of industrial activity, likely focusing on themes of industry, energy production, or environmental impact.","title":"West penn power plant, north of Pittsburgh.
