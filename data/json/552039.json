{"path":"552039.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil sunset scene focused on a sailboat drifting over a calm body of water, likely a lake or river. The setting sun paints the scene in warm oranges and yellows, highlighting the sparkling water and creating a silhouette effect.\n\nIn the foreground, a tree with gnarled branches partially obscures the view, adding depth and a sense of being a hidden observer to the scene. The branches are adorned with leaves, suggesting a tree in full foliage, typical of spring or summer seasons.\n\nThe middle ground prominently features a sailboat with a single white sail unfurled, gliding gracefully across the water. The boat's reflection shimmers on the surface of the lake, enhancing the peaceful ambiance of the photograph.\n\nThe background shows a distant shoreline under a gradient twilight sky, gently transitioning from orange near the horizon to a deeper blue above, suggestive of the late evening. There are no visible buildings or people; the focus remains steadfastly on the natural beauty and the simple pleasure of sailing.\n\nOverall, the composition utilizes natural framing, with the treeâ€™s branches and trunk creating a vignette effect, focusing the viewer's attention onto the sailboat and the expansive, serene water. The photograph evokes feelings of tranquility and a connection with nature, typical of leisurely sunset sailing.","title":"Evening sail on the Niagara River","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["548118","552038","552293","552345","543613","552344","553990","543880","553991","543143","548117","551215","551214","551541","547273","544669"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["sailboat","sailing","branch","sunset","vignette","lake","effect","pleasure","observer","framing"]}
