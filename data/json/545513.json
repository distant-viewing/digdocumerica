{"path":"545513.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures an environmental scene depicting a watercourse or small creek, flowing with strikingly red, muddy water that suggests pollution or high levels of sediment. The water flows through a grassy area, with patches of green grass visible on either side of the reddish-brown water. The foreground shows the edge of the water surrounded by dense, wet grass, indicating recent heavy rainfall or overflow from the watercourse.\n\nThe background includes trees and residential houses with lit windows, suggesting the time may be dusk or dawn, as there is still some natural light but also lights turned on inside the homes. The area is likely suburban, given the presence of maintained lawns and structured homes. A road runs parallel to the creek on the right side, with a streetlamp visible and a car partially seen in deeper background. The overall lighting is dim, commensurate with twilight, and the atmosphere feels quiet except for the likely sound of flowing water. The ominous tone of the image, emphasized by the polluted color of the water, highlights environmental concerns.","title":"Stream near Birmingham shows effect of pollution by the steel industry.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["543819","551077","545473","553434","552430","550946","546126","555549","553427","552023","544858","552069","544804","546111","557999","552046"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["creek","flow","sound","home","water","overflow","rainfall","grass","sediment","concern"]}
