{"path":"548213.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph showcases a natural, somewhat serene landscape with a prominent man-made feature in the foreground. At the bottom right of the image, there is a large, rusty metal lid or cover, likely of a manhole or a similar underground access point, which is set into the ground. The lid has a series of concentric circles and dot patterns, adding a somewhat decorative aspect to its otherwise utilitarian appearance.\n\nThe background reveals a calm river reflecting the sky, surrounded by a lush environment. On either side of the riverbank, there are trees and shrubs, and the water looks still, possibly suggesting a secluded or less disturbed location. The foreground where the manhole cover is situated is a sandy area that leads up to the water's edge. The sand has sparse vegetation and appears dry, with various small plants and debris scattered around, giving a rough and somewhat barren texture to this part of the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition uses the contrasting elements of industrial and natural to potentially comment on human impact on natural landscapes, or simply to juxtapose these elements visually. Light and shadow play subtly across the scene, enhancing the texture and depth of the natural surroundings and highlighting the metallic sheen of the manhole cover.","title":"Sewage pipe at the City of Portland Columbia Boulevard Sewage Treatment Plant","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["552255","550465","551519","544674","552040","549053","547121","552254","552062","548870","543759","558003","547098","548194","551166","543109"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["cover","lid","circle","dot","sheen","access","texture","riverbank","aspect","sand"]}
