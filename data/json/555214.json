{"path":"555214.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a natural landscape scene dominated by a river and surrounding forested area. In the foreground, there is a muddy and partially submerged track or road that runs parallel to the river. The track is wet, suggesting recent rainfall or river overflow, and is covered with tire marks and puddles of water.\n\nThe river, which occupies the middle of the composition, appears swollen and fast-flowing. It curves gently from the left to the right side of the frame. The water is murky, likely a gray or dark color, reflecting an overcast sky. Debris, possibly consisting of branches and leaves, can be seen caught on the protruding rocks and along the banks.\n\nThe landscape on either side of the river is thick with deciduous and coniferous trees, some of which are partially bare, indicating it might be late fall or early spring. The trees on the left are closer to the viewer and denser. In contrast, the trees on the right bank are further in the distance and the bank is steeper.\n\nThe background shows a hill rising up from the right side of the riverbank, covered with similar sparse and bare trees. The sky is overcast, lighting is flat, and the overall color tone of the image is cool, with dominant hues of blue and gray, reflecting a moody and slightly desolate ambiance. No people or animals are visible in this scene, emphasizing the solitude and untouched nature of the setting.","title":"John's Creek on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington.
