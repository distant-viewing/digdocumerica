{"path":"550915.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This image depicts a harbor scene captured in silhouette against a brilliant sky, highlighting the shimmering water. Several tugboats or small vessels are visible in the water, which reflects the sunlight, creating a sparkling effect. To the right, there's a towering crane stationed on a dock, forming a stark silhouette. The crane's architecture suggests it's intended for loading and unloading ships. Behind these foreground elements is a linear city skyline punctuated by multiple high-rise buildings, rendered as dark silhouettes due to backlighting. The skyline suggests a distant urban center. The photo is likely taken during sunrise or sunset, as indicated by the low angle of the sun and the enriched, dramatic lighting of the sky and water. This setup creates a striking contrast between the dark figures of the boats, crane, and cityscape against the illuminated sky and water. Overall, the photograph offers a serene yet industrial tableau, emphasizing geometry and the interplay of light and shadow.","title":"Houston ship channel at dusk--skyline of downtown Houston in background","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550910","544655","555807","544671","549892","547102","550906","547113","550918","552265","553788","555731","546114","546925","555800","548403"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["crane","silhouette","skyline","render","backlighting","unload","tableau","tugboat","intend","harbor"]}
