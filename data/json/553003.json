{"path":"553003.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene riverside scene. The river is quite wide and appears to have a flowing current, with the water displaying a muddy brown color that is typical of rivers carrying a considerable amount of sediment. The foreground shows the edge of the riverbank, partially covered in lush, green vegetation and some small plants that are partially submerged in water, indicating a high water level.\n\nOverhanging branches from trees frame the top portion of the image, contributing to a natural, tucked-away feel. The left side of the photo is somewhat shadowed by these trees, contrasting with the brighter light on the river and opposite bank.\n\nAcross the river, you can see a high riverbank that appears to be eroding or has eroded significantly, offering a view of bare earth and some vegetation. Atop this bank, there is a striking mound of what looks like white debris or possibly dumped material, which contrasts sharply with the natural colors of the scene. In the background, behind this white mound, there is a glimpse of some infrastructure, possibly buildings that are obscured and blending into the dense greenery surrounding them. The sky is overcast, with gray clouds suggesting an overcast day, which softens the overall light in the scene.","title":"Junked autos shoved over the bank of the brazos river at richmond.
