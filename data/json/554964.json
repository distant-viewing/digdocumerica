{"path":"554964.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image features a dense forest canopy viewed from above. The trees are lush and predominantly dark green, giving an impression of thick, healthy vegetation. Among the sea of green, there are a few trees with brownish or lighter green foliage, possibly indicating seasonal changes or dying vegetation. There are no visible paths, clearings, or human-made objects; the natural expanse appears almost untouched. The photograph gives an almost textural quality to the forest, highlighting the natural diversity and compactness of the woodland. The overall mood is somewhat dark and mysterious due to the depth and uniformity of the colors.","title":"Aerial view of old growth Douglas fir forest in the olympic national timberland, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552844","554957","550566","543542","545488","550564","555043","554425","554961","555054","543487","547647","546947","554975","550791","553594"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["brownish","die","uniformity","forest","diversity","clearing","woodland","change","canopy","vegetation"]}
