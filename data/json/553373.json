{"path":"553373.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural woodland setting along a dirt path that is dappled with sunlight filtering through a dense canopy of green leaves. The path is uneven and bordered by lush foliage and tree trunks, creating a feeling of being enveloped by nature.\n\nIn the foreground, two individuals are seen. One person is positioned slightly to the left in the frame and dressed in a blue top with a backpack, appearing to be pausing or looking around, possibly exploring the surroundings. The second person is walking away from the camera towards the right side of the frame and is dressed in a green top and dark pants; this individual adds a sense of depth and perspective to the scene.\n\nAlong the path, there are several puddles reflecting the greenery and the sunlight, adding a reflective element to the composition. The woodland scene is peaceful, with no visible buildings or signs of urban life, which suggests a setting away from city disturbances. This peaceful setting is indicative of a quiet walk or hike in a forested area.","title":"\"Fern freaks\" follow the shore of the Nissitisset River, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["547045","545512","553464","555215","543490","551942","557018","554720","543581","554705","547011","543446","557940","554423","557822","554664"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["path","walk","backpack","puddle","woodland","disturbance","sunlight","person","canopy","trunk"]}
