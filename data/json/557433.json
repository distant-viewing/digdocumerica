{"path":"557433.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of numerous vibrant orange poppy flowers. The majority of the frame is filled with these bright blossoms, highlighted by their vivid orange petals which stand out against a darker, earth-toned background. The poppies have a silky texture with delicate petals and are shown in various stages of bloom, with some flowers fully opened to expose their inner structures and stamens, while others are partially closed. Slim, green stems and small, unopened buds can also be seen interspersed among the flowers. The background, while mostly obscured by the dense coverage of the flowers, appears to be natural and earthy, likely a garden or a wild field setting. The overall composition of the image focuses on the natural beauty and dense cluster formation of the poppies, creating a lush and engaging visual texture with a strong emphasis on color and natural form.","title":"Closeup of flowers planted by the developer around Spyglass homes built on a terraced hillside, which have a good view of the harbor development below.
