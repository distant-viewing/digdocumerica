{"path":"550598.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a vast and scenic landscape, likely from an aerial perspective. The terrain is predominantly flat and covered with a brown and dark soil or vegetation, which gives a sense of a barren or marshy wilderness. Scattered throughout the landscape are numerous small bodies of water, varying in shape and size, reflective and dark, suggesting they could be shallow ponds or lakes.\n\nIn the foreground, a winding road or pathway cuts through the terrain, marked by its lighter color against the darker earth. Alongside the road, there is a meandering river or stream, with its silvery surface winding through the land, reflecting light and creating a contrast with the surrounding darker soil.\n\nThe background is dominated by a mountain range with soft, rounded peaks that fade into the distance under a cloudy sky. The sky is overcast with varying tones of white and gray clouds, hinting at a cool or temperate climate.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is rich in natural textures and forms a tranquil, yet desolate, wilderness scene with no visible human presence or activity, emphasizing the remoteness and untouched nature of the environment.","title":"Isabel pass, elevation 3,000 feet, the highest point of passage through the Alaska range.
