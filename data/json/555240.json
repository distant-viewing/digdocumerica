{"path":"555240.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a man in an industrial or workshop setting, examining a bright red document attached to what appears to be machinery. The man, wearing a light colored shirt and a baseball cap, looks intently at the document which bears a prominent black symbol indicating hazardous or toxic material (represented by a skull inside a triangle above two crossed bones and a plant). His expression is serious, focused on reading the text, which is not completely visible. His left hand holds the document while his right hand extends partially out of frame, likely towards a control or part of the machine.\n\nThe lighting is dim with more focus on the document and the man's face, highlighting the importance of the information being reviewed. The background is largely obscured by shadows, placing full emphasis on the man and the document. This photograph likely captures a moment related to workplace safety or hazard identification, pointing to themes of industrial safety regulations or chemical handling practices.","title":"An Environmental Protection Agency pesticides inspector simulates placing a \"stop sale\" sticker on a drum of chemical in Greenville, Mississippi.
