{"path":"553349.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a dynamic river scene, characterized by a wide, cascading waterfall in the background. The waterfall extends across the entire width of the image, with water pouring over what appears to be a man-made barrier, likely a dam. The water at the top of the waterfall is fairly smooth, indicating a calm upstream flow, before it violently crashes down into a foamy, turbulent pool below.\n\nIn the foreground, to the left, there is a rocky embankment, partially covered in small patches of grass or moss, which slopes down to meet the river's edge. This area appears slightly rugged and natural, contrasting with the man-made structure of the dam.\n\nFurther into the background, on the right side across the river, a few bare, thin trees are visible. Behind these trees, the scene blurs into what seems to be a residential area, hinted by faint outlines of buildings partially obscured by the trees.\n\nOverall, the image captures a blend of human intervention in nature (the dam) and the natural, though somewhat restrained, river environment. The photograph could be emphasizing themes of water management, natural landscapes, or the juxtaposition of man-made structures with natural settings.","title":"Water pollution control facilities will be built on the Nashua River.
