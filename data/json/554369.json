{"path":"554369.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The image captures a close-up view of the rear end of a large vehicle, likely a truck, prominently featuring the cargo area. The back of the truck has a textured, reflective metal surface with a design that is intended to give an impression similar to the pattern on a diamond plate. Painted on the center of this metallic background is a large American flag in its traditional red, white, and blue colors, appearing as if it is waving in the wind. The flag's pole is painted near the left edge of the view, suggesting the flag is affixed there.\n\nAbove the flag, the name \"BLUE FLEET DIST. CORP.\" is printed in bold, capital letters, indicating the name of the company owning the truck. Below this text, the metal surface continues, and above the truckâ€™s roof, a blurry building and some trees can be seen, hinting at an urban setting. The truck itself, visible at the bottom of the image, shows only the top part of the cabin, which includes a chrome detail and spotlights arranged in a horizontal manner. The left side of another truck, also part of the \"Blue Fleet Dist. Corp.\" is visible to the right in the image, suggesting this photo might have been taken in a fleet parking area or during a logistics operation.","title":"Proud backdrop for truck driver's cab","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557044","544370","555817","548275","544061","547962","548980","556714","549883","546052","544720","547666","545466","542854","547093","550707"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","flag","name","spotlight","diamond","affix","capital","logistic","intend","chrome"]}
