{"path":"545485.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a moment from a medical or health-related environment. The image mainly features an elderly bald man wearing glasses and a light blue, patterned shirt, possibly a hospital gown. He is actively taking his own blood pressure using a green, wall-mounted manual sphygmomanometer, which includes a dial gauge and a stethoscope.\n\nThe subject is seated slightly out of focus, seen in profile from the right side. He holds the bulb of the blood pressure cuff in his right hand, pumping it to inflate the cuff around his arm, and places the stethoscope earpieces in his ears and the diaphragm near the cuff to listen to his pulse.\n\nThe environment appears clinical, with a plain, light-colored wall that suggests a medical facility setting. The sphygmomanometer is prominently mounted on the wall, with its cuff and tubes hanging neatly, which serves as the central technical detail in the photograph.\n\nThis scene illustrates a common healthcare activity, emphasizing self-management of health, possibly in a clinical or home setting. There is a sense of diligence and focus on the part of the elderly man as he performs this routine, but critical, health monitoring task.","title":"Emphysema patient mr.
