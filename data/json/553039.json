{"path":"553039.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy and cluttered landfill scene. The area is densely littered with a vast array of discarded items including boxes, buckets, household trash, and construction debris. Several cars and vans are parked amidst the garbage, and multiple people are visible; they appear to be active, possibly sorting through or adding to the piles of waste.\n\nThe background reveals a contrasting suburban setting with rows of houses neatly lined up, stretching into the distance. The skyline is relatively clear with a few small clouds, suggesting a sunny day. Overhead power lines are also visible, contributing to a sense of industrial or urban encroachment on the landscape.\n\nThis scene captures a moment of human interaction with the environment, highlighting issues related to waste management and its impact on surrounding communities. The stark difference between the foreground littered with debris and the orderly residential area in the background may serve as a visual commentary on environmental concerns and urban development.","title":"Jefferson County dump.
