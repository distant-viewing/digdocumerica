{"path":"544630.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"In the photograph, a man is engaged in an activity with a large sea turtle at nighttime on a sandy beach setting. The man, wearing a yellow long-sleeve shirt and dark pants, is kneeling beside the turtle, focusing on a task at hand near the creature’s head. His attention is directed towards a small pile of sand close to the turtle’s flipper where he appears to be either taking samples or analyzing something.\n\nThe turtle, possibly a loggerhead due to its large head and robust body, is resting on the sandy beach. The turtle's coloration blends with the sandy environment, sporting shades of brown and grey on its shell and skin. The man has a variety of equipment around him which includes a portable light source providing illumination and a black bag resting partly open in the sand, suggesting the presence of more tools or equipment inside.\n\nThe background is dark due to it being nighttime, and the focus on the foreground with the man and turtle is illuminated by a spotlight or flash from the camera, casting visible shadows on the ground. The setting seems remote and undisturbed, apart from the activity taking place, indicative of conservation or research work likely focused on the sea turtle. The overall scene hints at a scientific or conservation effort, perhaps involving monitoring, tagging, or studying the turtle.","title":"Jim Walters, naturalist for Everglades National Park, studies nesting habits of loggerhead turtles.","placename":"East Cape (Fla.)","location":"East Cape, Florida","nn1":["544626","544615","546362","546308","545077","552290","548714","545076","545080","546334","544487","552289","545208","546290","546350","546364"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["nighttime","conservation","sand","spotlight","head","beach","sea","man","creature","sample"]}
