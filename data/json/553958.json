{"path":"553958.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a colorful and detailed garment, which seems to be a shirt made from fabric printed with a Hawaiian-themed pattern. The pattern on the fabric includes an array of motifs that are typically associated with Hawaiian culture and geography.\n\nThe fabric prominently features the names of various Hawaiian islands such as \"Maui,\" \"Molokai,\" \"Oahu,\" \"Kahoolawe,\" \"Lanai,\" and references to \"Hawaii.\" These names are arranged around representations of the islands themselves, depicted in a somewhat abstract, map-like style.\n\nIllustrated within and around the island shapes are various images that enhance the tropical and cultural theme. These illustrations include people dressed in traditional Hawaiian attire, which includes hula dancers and others wearing leis. There are also images of sailboats, palm trees, sea turtles, and hibiscus flowers, which are all emblematic of Hawaiian life and nature.\n\nThe colors of the fabric are warm and earthy, with shades of brown, orange, and cream, creating a vibrant but harmonious appearance. The backdrop of the photograph is simple and dark, which helps accentuate the vivid colors and intricate details of the shirt's fabric. The focus and framing of the photo on just a portion of the shirt suggest an artistic or promotional intent, emphasizing the beauty and unique design of the garment.","title":"Tourist in an appropriate shirt","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["553915","553758","553916","553918","553712","553708","553917","554116","553959","554150","554117","553711","553948","544682","553738","546396"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fabric","island","garment","name","intent","geography","illustration","the","reference","shirt"]}
