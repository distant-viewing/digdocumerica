{"path":"555237.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph takes place within a storage or warehouse environment, where a man is inspecting a collection of containers. The person, a man wearing a yellow hard hat and dressed in a white shirt paired with plaid pants, is standing among multiple rows of large industrial barrels and buckets. The buckets are primarily yellow, labeled prominently with the \"Val√©go\" brand, and are stacked on wooden pallets. The barrels are dark, possibly black, and are also labeled. These containers are arranged neatly on shelving units made of metal and wood, which fill the space surrounding the man.\n\nThe man appears to be focused on a task, possibly checking inventory or examining the containers for any specific reason related to their contents or labeling. The setting is dimly lit, with more focus lighting above him, illuminating parts of the storage area. The surroundings suggest a setting typical of a warehouse used for storing chemicals or industrial products, indicated by the standardized labeling and safety-focused attire of the individual. The overall atmosphere gives off a practical, work-oriented vibe.","title":"Environmental Protection Agency pesticides inspector checks labels on containers during a routine inspection of the Valley Chemical Company, Greenville, Mississippi.","placename":"Mississippi","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555242","555243","555244","555236","555245","543706","555246","551588","546918","548994","555816","555815","555263","555239","555253","555235"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["container","barrel","bucket","warehouse","label","reason","pallet","storage","man","brand"]}
