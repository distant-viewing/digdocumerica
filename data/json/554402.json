{"path":"554402.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and expansive mountain landscape, likely taken from a high vantage point. The foreground is framed by the silhouettes of evergreen trees, adding depth and a touch of wilderness to the scene. Beyond the trees, rolling hills and mountain ranges stretch into the distance in varying shades of blue and green, created by atmospheric perspective. You can observe a clear layering of mountain ridges, each fading progressively lighter as they recede into the background, which suggests a considerable depth of field.\n\nMoreover, there are small patches of white that appear to be bodies of water nestled in the valleys between some of the mountain ridges. These features add a picturesque quality to the photograph and help to break the continuity of the mountainous terrain with their reflective surfaces, potentially catching sunlight.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is both tranquil and majestic, inviting the viewer to appreciate the natural beauty and undisturbed peace of a high-altitude landscape. The lighting, likely either early morning or late afternoon, subtly enhances the contours and textures of the hills and valleys, providing the scene with a soft and warm ambiance.","title":"View southwest over the High Peaks region, from a point near the summit of Algonquin Peak.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554398","542923","555131","552173","557519","554634","544070","557558","546764","542681","543582","550421","550415","543023","549249","550413"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["mountain","ridge","valley","continuity","layering","peace","hill","depth","altitude","white"]}
