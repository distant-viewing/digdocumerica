{"path":"550390.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a stark and serene landscape at what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and color tones in the sky. The foreground is dominated by a dark, expansive flat field, which leads to an unbroken horizon line dividing the land from the sky. The sky itself is a dramatic and central element of the image, filled with scattered clouds that vary in density and tone, ranging from light purples to deep blues and grays.\n\nA notable feature in the sky is a distinct rain shaft visible over the horizon, where a concentration of precipitation is visibly falling from a cloud to the earth, suggesting a distant storm. A subtle orange or light violet hue near this storm suggests the presence of a setting or rising sun, contributing to the overall moody and atmospheric quality of the scene. The vast open space conveys a sense of isolation and tranquility.\n\nThe composition is simple yet powerful, with a horizontal division between the earth and the sky, emphasizing the wideness of the landscape and the expansive sky above. The image evokes a feeling of solitude and the natural beauty of a remote outdoor setting.","title":"View south from the start of the pipeline route toward the brooks range.
