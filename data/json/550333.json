{"path":"550333.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic industrial scene characterized by multiple smokestacks and dense emissions. The color palette is relatively dark and moody, emphasizing the hues of stormy gray and deep purples in the sky, which is dotted with heavy clouds.\n\nForemost in the image, several tall, narrow smokestacks rise prominently, emitting thick plumes of white smoke that blend into the cloudy sky. These smoke structures vary slightly in appearance; some are plain, cylindrical and vertical, while others have visible external reinforcements.\n\nIn addition to the smokestacks, there are various industrial buildings visible in the mid-ground, characterized by flat, angular roofs and muted colors that suggest a utilitarian purpose. These buildings add to the overall industrial atmosphere of the scene, appearing squat and sturdy against the backdrop of the active smokestacks.\n\nThe background consists of a cloud-filled sky that hints at the potential for stormy weather, enhancing the brooding, industrial feel of the image. The contrast between the natural sky and the man-made emissions from the smokestacks creates a powerful visual commentary on industry and environment.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the vertical lines of the smokestacks and the horizontal lines of the industrial buildings to draw the eye through the scene, while the smoke and clouds add texture and depth.","title":"Georgia Pacific paper plant on St. Croix River in Woodland","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["545439","550676","547204","550987","550172","545239","555737","557380","550195","550821","550982","552190","550981","546237","550168","557218"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","emission","smoke","cloud","potential","reinforcement","addition","commentary","purple","line"]}
