{"path":"543918.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and somewhat moody natural scene featuring a single bird, likely a duck or similar waterfowl, swimming in a body of water. The color palette of the image is predominantly rich red and purple hues, suggesting the photo may have been taken during early morning or late evening hours or possibly using a special filter to achieve this effect.\n\nThe bird is reasonably centered in the image and appears in profile, swimming from right to left. Water ripples fan out beautifully from the bird, indicating its recent movement through the calm water surface. These ripples create textured patterns that contrast with the smooth appearance of the rest of the water.\n\nThe background is delicately blurred, with the same red and purple tones fading into darkness at the top of the frame, giving it a soft and undistinctive backdrop that helps to highlight the bird as the focal point of the composition. There is no visible shoreline or other objects; the emphasis is entirely on the water and the bird. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with the bird's presence adding a tranquil life to the otherwise still waterscape.","title":"Birds in marsh","placename":"Galveston Bay (Tex.)","location":"Galveston Bay, Texas","nn1":["555551","550388","558092","548832","557448","543063","553777","543922","547744","557495","544539","545142","543923","548840","547322","551377"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","swim","ripple","duck","waterscape","fan","water","darkness","profile","emphasis"]}
