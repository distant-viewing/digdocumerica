{"path":"558147.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph displays a historical building and a monument positioned in the foreground. The building, described as a \"County House\" according to the signage above its entrance, appears to be an older, architecturally detailed structure likely from the late 19th or early 20th century. It has a symmetric design featuring a central section flanked by two wings that are three stories high. The fa√ßade is constructed with red and beige brick, and it includes ornamental stonework around the windows and at the corners of the building. There is a central arched entrance with stone trim, above which is a decorative pediment with a circular inset that possibly hosts a clock or emblem, though it's not distinctly visible in this image.\n\nIn front of the building is a large green lawn, which is well-maintained and adds a peaceful, expansive feel to the setting. A monument, prominently placed in the foreground on the right side of the image, commemorates \"The Pioneers of Brown County\" from 1849 to 1949. This circular monument features a high relief sculpture illustrating pioneer figures and a covered wagon, emblematic of the historic migration and settlement period. Below the relief, a detailed inscription is written, surrounded by an ornamental border, likely outlining historical data or a dedication to the pioneers. The inclusion of this monument suggests the significance of the site in local history, possibly serving as a hub for community or governmental activities within Brown County.\n\nOverall, the image has a clear, bright blue sky as a background, lending a sense of clarity and brightness to the scene. No people are visibly interacting in the space, providing a serene and somewhat solemn portrayal of this historical location.","title":"Brown county courthouse located in the county seat of New Ulm, Minnesota, on state street.
