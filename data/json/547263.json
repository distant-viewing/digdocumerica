{"path":"547263.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph is an aerial shot featuring a sprawling urban and natural landscape intersected by a large, brown-colored river. Prominent in the image is a sturdy bridge with multiple arches spanning the river, carrying a significant amount of vehicular traffic. The river splits around a small, wooded island, and there are various boats docked along the riverbank.\n\nThe urban setting adjacent to the river includes a variety of buildings, roads, and open spaces, which appear to be densely packed into the river's surroundings. Architectural features and urban parks add to the cityscape. In the backdrop, the scene stretches into a more open area with fewer structures, possibly indicating the outskirts of the city or a less densely populated suburb.\n\nIn the distance, notable landmarks including a tall, slender obelisk-like structure, possibly a historic monument, is visible, asserting its presence against the skyline. The environment suggests a clear day with good visibility, amplifying the scenic and expansive view of the river and the city. The photo captures a bustling yet serene aspect of urban life alongside nature, showcasing a harmonious blend of city development and natural beauty.","title":"Looking south from the Key Bridge.
