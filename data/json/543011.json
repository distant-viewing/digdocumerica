{"path":"543011.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene, characterized by a significant amount of steam and smoke emissions. Prominently featured is an industrial plant or factory with multiple structures, including a large building with a flat roof and several attached, smaller compartments. These buildings are predominantly in light and darker industrial colors.\n\nThere are multiple smokestacks visible, with one taller chimney in the scene emitting a large volume of smoke or steam upwards. The factory also features a complex network of pipes, some of which are transitionally elevated on frameworks, visible against the contrasting background of dense, dark green forested hills, and a clear sky.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a cluttered field possibly containing debris, hinting at either construction, maintenance, or discarded materials. Electrical lines and poles are sporadically placed in the lower region of the frame, possibly indicating this area's development or logistical setup.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo captures a moment of intense industrial activity, situated in a natural landscape, illustrating a juxtaposition between industrial development and the environment. The quality and mood of the lighting suggest that the photo might have been taken during the morning or late afternoon, indicated by a somewhat softer light and long shadows.","title":"California--humboldt coast","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["551054","551026","557225","550716","550329","543813","557374","544691","548195","546908","550983","557293","551056","544173","550672","551060"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["steam","factory","development","smoke","cluttered","volume","compartment","discard","contrasting","upward"]}
