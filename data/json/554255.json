{"path":"554255.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a winter scene focused on a ski slope that is lined with a row of modern, multi-story, angular buildings that appear to be part of a ski resort. These buildings feature vertical rectangular design elements, many of which protrude like towers, and large windows are visible on their facades. The architecture uses earthy tones that blend well with the natural environment.\n\nOn the ski slope in front of these buildings, three skiers are pictured in action: skiing down the slope towards the foreground. All skiers are wearing typical winter sports attire. The snow-covered ground shows traces of numerous ski tracks, indicating frequent use of this slope.\n\nThe background reveals a mountainous terrain, partially covered with trees and topped with a relatively smooth, snow-covered summit. The sky is clear, contributing to the visibility and brightness of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a vibrant winter sports scene, combining elements of modern architecture with the natural beauty and recreational appeal of a snowy landscape.","title":"West village condominiums follow a ski slope at snowmass mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554236","554235","554213","554234","554292","550017","554275","554249","554251","554253","554279","554281","554257","550004","554254","554242"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ski","slope","skier","winter","sport","snow","summit","resort","trace","cover"]}
