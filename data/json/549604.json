{"path":"549604.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a man engaged in a scientific experiment in a laboratory setting. The man, who appears to be in his middle years, has medium-length brown hair and is wearing a light-colored lab coat. He is focused on his task, examining a piece of scientific equipment closely. He holds a syringe-like instrument, possibly a pipette, with which he interacts with a laboratory flask.\n\nThe flask, placed on an illuminated base, contains a purple-colored liquid, and is central to his experiment. The surrounding equipment includes a sturdy metal stand to which the pipette is attached, allowing for precise measurement or addition of materials.\n\nIn the background, we see a cluttered laboratory environment with various other pieces of equipment and containers, indicating a well-used and functional workspace. Notably, there are rubber tubes and another blue gas cylinder, which might be part of the setup for heating or another laboratory process. The presence of a small desktop lamp provides additional lighting to the workspace, essential for conducting detailed and precise work.\n\nThe scene is rich with the elements typical of a chemical or biological research laboratory and captures the intense focus and careful handling required in scientific experiments.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical, biological and meteorological conditions in Lake Superior.
