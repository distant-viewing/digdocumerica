{"path":"549038.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene at a rodeo event, featuring a young participant in action. The central figure is a youth, dressed in traditional rodeo attire, featuring a white shirt with a large star on the chest, tucked into blue jeans which are accented with a large belt buckle. The youth, also wearing a tan cowboy hat, is energetically pulling on a rope tied around a running steer's horns, attempting to control or redirect the animal.\n\nThe steer, a brown creature, displays a moment of motion as dust is kicked up around its hooves, indicating the speed and struggle involved in this event. It has a green rope wrapped around its horns, which is held by the youth.\n\nIn the background, separated by a fence, stands another individual wearing a cowboy hat, seemingly observing or officiating the event. The setting appears to be an outdoor rodeo arena with fences and bleachers filled with a few spectators in the distance, surrounded by structures that suggest a rural or fairground environment. The entire scene is filled with action and a cloud of dust, lending a gritty, energetic quality to the moment captured in the photograph.","title":"\"junior rodeo\" is sponsored by the parker indian rodeo association and takes place on the Colorado river indian reservation","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["552672","552580","553108","552665","543686","553110","552667","552579","552564","553104","543779","549045","552664","552563","548830","552575"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["youth","horn","steer","cowboy","event","rope","action","buckle","arena","fence"]}
