{"path":"544955.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a rural, slightly overcast scene with a mix of human-made and natural elements. In the foreground, there is an area of unkempt, dry grass and scattered litter. A prominent billboard, sponsored by Shasta Beverages, stands at the left edge and reads \"Litter is bad news. Don't spread it around.\" The billboard's message provides a stark contrast against the visible litter on the ground.\n\nBeyond the front area, there are two horses grazing on the grass within a fenced enclosure. The fence, made of wood and wire, runs parallel to the foreground and stretches into the distance. The backdrop is dominated by gentle, grassy hills that fill the horizon, creating a quiet and relatively undisturbed rural atmosphere.\n\nAdding to the industrial touch, behind the horses, further back, there are at least three old gasoline pumps and advertisements, including recognizable brand signs such as \"Chevrolet\" and \"Texaco.\" The presence of these pumps suggests that this area might have been used for vehicle service, possibly a small, rural filling station.\n\nUtility poles with power lines recede into the background along a road or path, parallel to and right of the fence, which helps draw the eye through the scene. The sky is slightly overcast, casting a soft light that mutes the colors in the picture, emphasizing a somber, neglected feel.","title":"Along route 580, near San Francisco","placename":"San Leandro (Calif.)","location":"San Leandro, California","nn1":["544425","544726","555609","547782","543844","552090","556615","544730","554161","546130","549156","556313","549191","552501","544174","546102"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["litter","billboard","horse","pumps","fence","fenced","gasoline","enclosure","pump","recede"]}
