{"path":"553082.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The image captures a serene lakeside scene punctuated by natural elements and human activity. The setting is a pebbly lakeshore lined with slender, leafy trees that are partially submerged in the lake water, suggesting a high water level or possibly a flooding event. It appears to be a windy day, as indicated by the slight chop on the lake's surface and the bending branches of the trees.\n\nA single person, a man, stands near the right edge of the frame. He is wearing casual clothing—a shirt, jeans, and shoes—and is engaged in fishing, holding a fishing rod out towards the water. His attention is directed away from the viewer, focused on the water before him.\n\nIn the foreground, to the left of the man, there's a picnic area featuring at least one wooden table, hinting at a recreational or park setting intended for leisure activities like picnicking and fishing. The background landscape across the lake is gently rolling hills, which are sparsely vegetated, suggesting a semi-arid region or a place where trees are not densely populated. The sky is fairly clear with minimal cloud coverage, indicating a sunny day, which is reflected in the overall lighting of the scene that casts soft shadows on the ground.\n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a peaceful, leisurely atmosphere, inviting contemplation or relaxation by the water’s edge.","title":"Overflowing Lahontan Reservoir.
