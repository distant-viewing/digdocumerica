{"path":"549050.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of six people engaged in the activity of collecting or sorting items, presumably vegetables or fruits, outdoors in a rural setting. The ground is densely covered with round objects, possibly vegetables or fruits, adding to the agricultural aspect of the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, two men are crouching and kneeling close to a cardboard box filled with the collected items. One of the men, who is nearer to the viewer and wearing a hat, is placing items into the box. Another man, on the left side, is observing the process intently.\n\nMoving to the midground, there are four more people involved in similar activities. One kneels while the others are bent over, picking up items from the ground. They also have containers like buckets or baskets which seem to be used for holding the items. The clothing of all individuals is casual, suitable for fieldworkâ€”long pants, shirts, and protective hats against the sun.\n\nIn the background, the environment is open and flat, likely a large field or farmland. The weather appears clear and sunny, casting shadows and creating a bright atmosphere. Distant mountains can be seen lining the horizon, adding a scenic backdrop to the agricultural activity.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a moment of agricultural labor under a bright, clear sky, emphasizing a sense of communal or group effort in this rural setting.","title":"Industrious scavengers take advantage of processing plants offer of \"free onions\" from its discards","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["546964","543845","554108","557478","553879","553659","549044","554922","543862","558245","543481","549084","543157","543858","549036","543454"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["item","vegetable","fruit","kneel","collect","box","fieldwork","farmland","crouch","pick"]}
