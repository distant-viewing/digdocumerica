From the viewpoint of the camera, four individuals are visible:\n\n1. **Far right**: A man wearing sunglasses, dressed in a light-colored jacket. He sits with his body slightly turned away from the camera, looking out the window. His expression is neutral, and his right arm rests on the back of the seat.\n\n2. **Center-right**: A woman with her hair pulled back in a bun, wearing a textured woolen sweater, and spectacles with dark, rounded frames. She is engrossed in knitting, looking down at her work as her hands handle the yarn and knitting needles.\n\n3. **Center-left**: Another woman wearing a dark blue jacket with white trim and a hood. She has straight blonde hair that falls around her shoulders. She sits facing forward, looking down slightly with a serene expression.\n\n4. **Far left**: Partially visible, this person has their back to the camera, wearing a dark hooded garment, with blonde curly hair cascading out from the hood.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is visible with red and silver metal poles and partial views of other seats. Light from windows casts natural illumination inside. The overall mood in the bus seems quiet and subdued, with passengers engaged in their own activities or thoughts.","title":"AM riders on Shirley Highway (VA) express bus into Washington, DC","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556745","554241","556756","556795","556797","555978","556796","556743","549893","556748","546597","554264","556034","556839","556739","556740"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["hood","seat","bus","hair","camera","bun","back","spectacle","jacket","garment"]}
