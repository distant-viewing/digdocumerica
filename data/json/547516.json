{"path":"547516.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a troubling scene of pollution in a natural marshland area. The foreground shows a littered patch where various types of refuse have accumulated. Visible trash includes cardboard boxes, a rusted barrel, discarded papers, some wooden planks, and miscellaneous garbage, scattered haphazardly across the muddy ground. The central area of the image shows standing water, reflecting some of the debris and surrounded by dense, tall marsh grasses, indicative of a wetland environment.\n\nBeyond the immediate scene of pollution, the background shows an expansive view of the marsh, stretching out toward a hazy horizon. The vast field of tall, dense reeds and grasses extends into the distance, intersected by pockets of standing water, suggesting a wider, water-rich ecosystem typical of marshlands. There are no visible animals or people, but the presence of distant structures on the horizon hints at human habitation or activity in the vicinity.\n\nThe overall composition and state of the area underline environmental neglect, where the serene natural landscape of the marsh is marred by human-generated waste, posing a stark commentary on pollution and environmental degradation.","title":"'Middletown dump meets the salt marsh'","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547512","547520","547521","551441","550812","551440","547525","547844","544647","547907","547524","550800","550352","548741","552089","544813"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["marshland","pollution","accumulate","marsh","commentary","generate","pocket","cardboard","refuse","reed"]}
