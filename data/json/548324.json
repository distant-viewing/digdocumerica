{"path":"548324.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy industrial scene at what appears to be a waste management facility or scrapyard. In the foreground, there is a large mechanical claw crane, characterized by its heavy, metal structure and a set of mechanical claws. This crane is engaged in the activity of grabbing and moving large amounts of debris or waste, which is scattered across the scene. A cloud of dust or smoke is visible around the area where the crane is operating, suggesting the movement of materials.\n\nTo the left and slightly behind the crane, there are several industrial vehicles which appear to be either dump trucks or specialized machinery related to waste management, further emphasizing the industrial function of the site. The background features multiple industrial buildings with nondescript gray and brown coloring, likely storage or processing facilities associated with the site. These buildings are equipped with large, round ventilation ducts on the roofs.\n\nOverhead, the sky is slightly overcast, casting a muted light over the entire scene, which gives a grim and gritty feel to the image. There are also power lines visible, crisscrossing above, which adds to the industrial aesthetic. The dominant colors in the photo are earth tonesâ€”browns, grays, and muted yellows, which all suggest an environment focused on heavy industry and waste management.","title":"Landfill is loaded on barges for use at fresh kills, on the west shore of Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549791","545544","548110","549800","547610","546253","547611","555593","547621","549792","547010","547615","547181","553012","554435","546030"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","crane","claw","management","duct","grab","scrapyard","ventilation","site","coloring"]}
