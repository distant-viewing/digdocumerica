{"path":"547754.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene, featuring three sailboats gliding gently across the water. The clarity and stillness of the lake reflect the light and colors of the skies and surrounding landscapes. In the foreground, a leafy willow branch gracefully dangles, partially framing the scene and adding a touch of natural beauty, softly swaying to the rhythm of the breeze.\n\nThe sailboats, small and equipped with single sails, are spaced out over the lake, their sails filled with a gentle breeze. Each boat carries one or two occupants, busily maneuvering or steadying their crafts. The silhouettes of the sailors are visible against the light reflecting off the water, suggesting a calm yet focused activity.\n\nOn the shore, near the bottom left corner of the photograph, sits a small boat, suggesting preparations or the conclusion of a day's sailing. Tufts of grass and reeds protrude from the waterâ€™s edge, emphasizing the natural lakeside environment. The background is less distinct, dominated by soft, faded hues which suggest trees and other vegetation, providing a stark contrast to the vibrant and detailed foreground. This idyllic setting speaks to a quiet, leisurely afternoon spent on the water, immersed in tranquility and the simple joys of sailing.","title":"A Sunday afternoon sail on White Rock Lake","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["547757","547781","552345","548555","543936","552297","548118","544669","543994","547273","557562","557416","552039","543626","549411","544021"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["lakeside","breeze","sailing","sailboat","sail","steady","sailor","glide","rhythm","dangle"]}
