{"path":"552308.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene fishing scene on a body of water, likely a lake or a calm sea, under what appears to be early evening or late afternoon lighting. The main focus is a small boat in the foreground, where an individual, silhouetted against the light, is standing and fishing. He seems to be actively handling a fishing rod, suggesting that he is either casting or retrieving the line.\n\nThe boat is modest in size, equipped with an outboard motor, showing that it is used for leisure activities like fishing rather than commercial purposes. Sitting relatively low in the water, it gently floats on the shimmering surface where the sun's reflections dance brightly, enhancing the tranquility of the scene.\n\nIn the background, the horizon is marked by a layered landscape of distant hills or low mountains, somewhat obscured by haze or clouds, which adds a sense of depth and vastness to the setting. Two additional boats are visible at different distances on the water, suggesting that this is a popular area for fishing enthusiasts.\n\nThe sky above this picturesque setting is patchily clouded, possibly hinting at an early sunset with its mixture of light and shadow interplaying above. The overall mood is peaceful, characterized by the solitude and calm associated with fishing. The composition benefits from the natural backlighting, which highlights the edges of the boats and the fisherman, providing a dramatic and somewhat pensive atmosphere.","title":"Salmon fishermen mooching (drift fishing a tide rip) on Puget Sound off Point Defiance","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552313","547549","547555","552309","545055","543753","557565","554147","545120","552317","552124","551572","547553","546976","547556","547558"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","fisherman","retrieve","enthusiast","dance","backlighting","motor","cloud","rod"]}
