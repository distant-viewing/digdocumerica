{"path":"551970.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, everyday scene in an outdoor setting. The central figure is a person dressed in a light blue jacket and dark trousers, sitting on a red park bench. The individual, who is wearing a dark knit cap, is engrossed in reading a book or newspaper, resting it on their lap, with their legs crossed and one foot on the ground.\n\nTo the right of the bench, there is a red bicycle leaning against it. The bicycle features a front basket filled with what appears to be a brown bag or bundle, possibly containing personal items or purchases. There are also items secured with a strap over the rear wheel of the bicycle.\n\nThe background suggests this moment is happening in a park or a similar recreational area. There are budding trees and visible foliage around, including some dandelions on the ground, hinting at a spring or summery day. The far background includes more trees and hints of a blue sky, suggesting a pleasant weather condition.\n\nOverall, it's a quiet, tranquil snapshot of a moment likely valued for relaxation and personal enjoyment, with the surrounding environment enhancing the peaceful composition of the photograph.","title":"Time to rest and read at foster avenue beach park","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["546566","549321","552723","552722","546555","551922","547748","543497","547251","551451","550051","545510","551434","553156","556776","553222"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["bicycle","bench","budding","happene","summery","dandelion","bundle","purchase","value","item"]}
