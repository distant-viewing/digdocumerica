{"path":"554891.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of several sheep tightly packed together. The sheep are primarily white, though their wool is marked with patches of dirt and occasional stains. Notably, their fleece is marked with red and blue paint, which is often used by farmers for identification and sorting purposes. The sheep have various facial expressions, with some looking directly towards the camera while others have their eyes partly closed or turned away, suggesting a calm yet confined setting.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is natural, highlighting patches of their wool with bright sunlight and casting some parts in shadow, creating a contrast that emphasizes the texture of their fleece and the vividness of the paint marks. There's no visible background due to the close framing of the sheep, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention entirely on the animals and their immediate interaction. The composition feels dynamic yet congested, conveying a sense of closeness among the group.","title":"Closeup of sheep on a ranch near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["554890","554888","554889","554928","554886","554894","550450","544391","555820","554779","554935","554887","550448","543269","554882","544384"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["sheep","wool","paint","farmer","identification","stain","closeness","mark","vividness","framing"]}
