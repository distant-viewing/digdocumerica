{"path":"553597.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic moment in a forest affected by fire. The scene is dense with dark, charred tree trunks against a backdrop where smoke is visible rising in the sky, suggesting the recent passage of a wildfire.\n\nA person is at the center of the composition, viewed from the back. They wear a protective yellow hard hat, indicating they might be a firefighter or involved in some form of emergency or forestry management work. This individual is using a chainsaw on a fallen tree trunk, likely clearing the area or managing damaged timber post-fire. Sediment and ash cover the ground, and the light filtering through the smoke-hazed sky casts an eerie, subdued tone over the scene.\n\nThe environment around suggests a coniferous forest, typical of regions susceptible to wildfires, further evidenced by the presence of firefighting equipment and the nature of the task at hand. The atmosphere is one of controlled urgency and environmental management.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora. In post-fire salvage operation, a \"faller\" cuts down a giant tree dangerously weakened by the flames.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553596","553598","553602","553599","553635","553632","542773","542770","553600","542771","542769","542787","553624","553608","553611","553639"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["wildfire","fire","management","trunk","chainsaw","smoke","urgency","emergency","forestry","timber"]}
