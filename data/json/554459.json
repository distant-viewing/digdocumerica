{"path":"554459.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a landscape dominated by a lush, dense forest and a mountain range. The foreground is thick with flourishing green foliage including various types of trees and shrubs. Some brighter green leaves are discernible in the lower part of the image, indicating some closer, possibly younger, foliage.\n\nThe midground shows the thick, dense forest extending towards the mountains. The trees appear mature, suggesting this is a well-established forest area. There are no visible paths or clearings, emphasizing the untouched nature of the terrain.\n\nIn the background, the mountain slopes gently upwards, covered mostly by similar dense forestation. The peak of the mountain is slightly obscured by haze or fog, which adds a sense of depth and mystery to the scene. The sky, visible at the very top of the image, looks overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the entire scene, which suggests the photo might have been taken on a cloudy day.\n\nThere are no human activities or visible structures, emphasizing the natural, pristine environment. This composition provides a sense of solitude and the overwhelming presence of nature.","title":"Summit of mount marcy, highest peak in New York state from main trail to its top (elevation 5,344 feet), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548025","554531","543582","554530","556906","550537","554461","550602","550629","553570","557003","555110","543569","555133","555656","550536"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","forest","flourish","forestation","closer","brighter","foliage","establish","mystery","fog"]}
