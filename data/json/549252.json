{"path":"549252.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image captures an expansive rural landscape. In the foreground, there's a large field partially covered with neat rows of rectangular hay bales. The field demonstrates varying stages of cultivation where patches of uncut green grass contrast sharply with areas of exposed brown earth and harvested hay.\n\nIn the middle distance, the terrain gently rises to form a sweeping hillside. This hill is textured by lush green grass and some darker patches, possibly indicating different types of vegetation or shaded areas. A small cluster of evergreen trees accents the crest of the hill, suggesting a natural tree line or a possibly managed forest area.\n\nThe background of the photograph is marked by a vast, clear sky filled with few large, fluffy clouds suggesting a fair weather day. The overall composition and the lighting conditions indicate that the photo might have been taken either in late spring or early summer, given the state of the fields and the quality of the sky. The photo provides a serene, almost idyllic view of rural countryside, typical of vast farming landscapes.","title":"The John Redding ranch in Sarpy Basin is threatened by plans for massive strip-mining of the area.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549138","549237","549137","549149","545040","549141","544481","549181","549256","549142","549222","557087","551167","549236","554027","554722"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["hay","field","bale","crest","countryside","cultivation","hill","grass","farming","hillside"]}
