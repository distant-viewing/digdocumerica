{"path":"551197.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This aerial photograph captures an expansive industrial scene nestled in a river valley surrounded by forested mountains. The river curves through the valley, while a road runs parallel to it on one side. On one side of the river, a large industrial facility dominates the scene. Multiple buildings with gray roofs and various infrastructures, such as storage tanks and possibly processing units, are visible.\n\nThere are several plumes of white smoke billowing from tall stacks at the facility, indicating active production or processing, contributing to the atmosphere. The smoke stands out against the surrounding natural greenery of the mountains.\n\nAcross the river, the land is densely wooded, contributing to the scenic yet contrasting view between nature and industrial activity. The image also shows several vehicles parked in lots near the facility, and there are visible signs of other infrastructure supporting the industrial complex, such as roads and possibly conveyor systems.\n\nOverall, the composition illustrates a juxtaposition of industrial development within a natural landscape, highlighting the interaction between human activity and the environment.","title":"More smoke is emitted by Union Carbide's ferroAlloy plant in Alloy than by any other factory in the Kanawha Valley.","placename":"Charleston (W.
