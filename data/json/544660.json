{"path":"544660.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph presents a cityscape viewed from a higher vantage point, likely from atop a building. The foreground features the rooftop of a large building, which is relatively simple with several skylights and a flat, dark surface.\n\nIn the middle ground, various commercial and industrial elements are visible, including another building's rooftop carrying signage for a place named “BUCKS,” adorned with a green oval sign and white lettering. Numerous utility wires and poles scatter throughout this area, contributing to a layered urban scene.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dramatic and dense skyline of the city, showcasing a variety of architectural styles. Prominent buildings, possibly including early to mid-20th century high-rises along with modern buildings, create a vibrant, urban mosaic. Some buildings have notable features like spires, stepped tops, and elaborate facades, indicative of an active business district.\n\nThe sky above the city is dynamic, featuring a contrast of ominous dark clouds against lighter patches, suggesting either an impending storm or the clearing of one. This atmospheric condition helps to enhance the overall moody and dramatic aesthetic of the scene, focusing attention on the architectural skyline.","title":"Looking across the bay to the San Francisco skyline","placename":"Oakland (Calif.)","location":"Oakland, California","nn1":["544668","548408","549971","548384","548392","552395","548328","552252","557274","557271","552394","547103","557273","553821","549979","545255"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["rooftop","building","skyline","skylight","spire","city","storm","district","lettering","clearing"]}
