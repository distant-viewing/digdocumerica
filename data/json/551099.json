{"path":"551099.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a local baseball game taking place in a rugged, somewhat industrial setting. In the foreground, a dusty baseball diamond is the main focus, where a game is actively being played. Players, some of whom are running and others in defensive positions, wear white and grey uniforms. Spectators, consisting of both adults and children, are gathered on wooden bleachers to the side of the field, intensely watching the game. The bleachers are under a simplistic metal shelter that provides shade. \n\nOn the left side, near the bleachers, there's a small structure with an open window, likely serving as a concession stand or scorekeeperâ€™s booth, draped with banners or towels.\n\nThe most striking aspect of the background is the stark contrast between the recreational activity and the industrial equipment. There is a large mound of earth and an imposing industrial structure that resembles a crane or conveyor belt, suggesting the presence of mining or heavy industry. Beyond the industrial equipment is a wooded hillside, which fades into a hazy, possibly polluted sky.\n\nThis scene captures a slice of community life, juxtaposed against the backdrop of industrial activity, reflecting both the local culture and the economic reality of the area.","title":"Evening game at Glasgow Little League field.
