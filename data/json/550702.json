{"path":"550702.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This image depicts a large, open dumpsite with numerous scattered and burned items. The foreground features a plethora of discarded objects and refuse, including piles of paper, damaged furniture, fragments of material, and various indistinct debris. This area is heavily littered and shows signs of extensive waste pollution.\n\nEmanating from the dumpsite are substantial plumes of smoke that rise and blend into the sky, filling the upper part of the image with dense smoke clouds in shades of grey and pink. This suggests active burning of the waste materials, contributing to air pollution and possibly indicating unregulated or unsanitary waste management practices.\n\nThe background includes portions of a mountain landscape, albeit mostly obscured by the smoke clouds. Sparse vegetation can be seen, further indicating that the location might be in a rural or less developed area. The overall scene conveys a grim and unhealthy environment, highlighting issues related to waste management and environmental degradation.","title":"Burning trash at the dump at Gorham, on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["551242","550798","550248","550801","543824","551243","551245","546381","552446","543828","544823","549957","557307","550259","551247","549750"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["dumpsite","waste","smoke","management","pollution","burning","fragment","material","furniture","practice"]}
