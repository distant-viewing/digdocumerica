{"path":"548179.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil waterway scene with various boats and a large building under construction. The left part of the image features a large white and red tour boat labeled \"Becky Thatcher\" at the dock, with a man disembarking onto a jetty. Adjacent to this, a smaller, private powerboat is tied up just beginning to move away from the dock, manned by another person.\n\nIn the middle foreground, there are multiple smaller boats, which appear to be houseboats or cabin cruisers, moored in a neat row. These boats are mostly white with red and dark blue trims, a common color scheme that suggests recreational use.\n\nThe background is dominated by an imposing multi-story building under construction. It has numerous floors visible, with scaffolding along one side and what appears to be insulation or initial facade work on the outer walls. Its contemporary design includes a flat roof possibly suited for future development or utilitarian purposes.\n\nThe sky overhead is cloudy, hinting at overcast but calm weather conditions. The overall ambiance of the image suggests a mix of leisure and development, possibly capturing a moment of transition in a riverfront area.","title":"Docks and a new motel under construction on the north shore of lake Coeur d'Alene.
