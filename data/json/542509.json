{"path":"542509.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and scenic outdoor setting, portraying a man standing alone on a flat rock in the middle of a rushing river. The river, appearing powerful and foamy, flows around and through various sized rocks, creating a dynamic water scene with light splashes and swirls. The man, dressed in trousers and a light-colored short-sleeved shirt, seems engaged in the activity of fishing, holding a fishing rod in his hands with a focused demeanor.\n\nThe composition of the photograph includes a foreground that is partially obscured by out-of-focus green foliage, likely leaves, creating a natural frame that gives a sense of peering through a hidden spot. This framing technique enhances the feeling of discovering a secluded and peaceful spot in nature.\n\nThe background consists of rocky, uneven terrain on the far side of the river, complemented by dense greenery, possibly trees and bushes, which add to the wild, untamed character of the setting. The vibrant greenery, rushing water, and the solitary figure combine to convey a sense of solitude and the peacefulness of being alone in nature. The overall mood is serene and contemplative, emphasized by the lush, natural environment and the man's calm activity.","title":"Opening of troutfishing season","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["554520","554519","550217","542522","542529","550666","550313","552976","550317","542744","543628","555576","553070","550665","543659","551024"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["rushe","spot","fishing","river","pee","wild","technique","focused","obscured","rock"]}
