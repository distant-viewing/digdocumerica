{"path":"552583.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene which appears to involve logging or a similar operation. In the foreground, there's a pile of cut logs showing freshly exposed light wood against the darker bark. The logs are scattered around the area, and a vehicle, which seems to be a vintage model, possibly a Jeep, is parked nearby, slightly camouflaged by the dusty, rugged terrain.\n\nIn the middle ground, the dirt path extends into a distant landscape that features gentle, rocky hills and sparse vegetation under a clear, blue sky, suggesting a desert or semi-arid region.\n\nTowards the right, a significant object in the photo is a long, red trailer with the words \"JENSEN FIR\" painted in large, white letters on its side. The trailer has a conveyor system that possibly aids in the movement or processing of the logs. A man stands atop this trailer, wearing casual clothing and looking towards the landscape, lending a human element and a sense of scale to the scene.\n\nThe sharpness of the light and shadows, combined with the vastness of the sky and the expansiveness of the landscape, give the image a vivid, open-air feeling that conveys the essence of outdoor industrial labor.","title":"On oil shale lease sites \"C-B\" a Denver company salvages wood from a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) chain project.
