{"path":"556843.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and bustling scene inside a dimly lit restaurant or dining car. The view is oriented from the back, looking towards a window that provides natural light, giving illumination to part of the scene. In the foreground, a woman is seated at a table with her back towards the camera, partially facing to her left where two other individuals are visible at the same table.\n\nAt the center, a woman with glasses is seen holding a child in her lap. The child, wearing a red top, is attentively looking at the other people or objects around. The woman is engaged in a conversation or interaction, possibly with the child or someone across the table. Her demeanor suggests a calm and nurturing presence.\n\nOther people are visible in the background, including a man wearing glasses, an older woman with a genial smile, and a waitress or server moving around the restaurant, possibly carrying plates. The interior decor includes wood paneling and other details typical of a cozy restaurant or a dining compartment in a train.\n\nThe atmosphere is one of a shared meal time, with individuals of various ages interacting or involved in dining. The ambiance and the group dynamics indicate a casual, sociable setting where people are enjoying their food and each other's company. The layout of the restaurant, combined with the window view and the arrangement of the people, creates a narrative of a typical dining experience in a community or family-like environment.","title":"Passengers in the dining car of Amtrak's Broadway Limited enroute from Chicago to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. At Harrisburg the train was split with one segment heading for New York City and the other to Washington, D.C. For those who continued to the nation's capital and slept late, they missed breakfast. No dining car continued the trip as had been promised. Some 18 million passengers rode on Amtrak in 1974, an increase of 10 percent from 1973.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555980","547184","553186","555997","547779","555993","557664","548439","556835","552612","556094","555982","555998","555994","556611","547813"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["restaurant","dining","table","woman","child","people","back","paneling","glass","compartment"]}
