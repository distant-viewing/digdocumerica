{"path":"544219.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment between two individuals on a porch. The setting is rustic, with the porch belonging to a white building, featuring a wooden floor and exterior walls painted in a worn white hue. There are horizontal wooden planks visible on the porch's back wall, and a window with closed, dark curtains can be seen behind the two individuals.\n\nOn the left, an older man is seated on a small stool or bucket. He wears light-colored casual clothing, consisting of a shirt and pants, and a straw hat. His posture is slightly bent forward as he appears to be engaging in an activity on the ground, possibly inspecting or working with fishing equipment which is scattered around him, including a fishing pole.\n\nOn the right, another man is seated in a rocking chair, leaning back in a relaxed pose with one arm extended along the back of the chair. He also wears casual attire which includes a green t-shirt, black pants, and a straw hat tilted back on his head. This man's demeanor suggests he is either in conversation with the man next to him or absorbed in thought.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of leisure and simplicity, perhaps indicating a moment of rest or preparation for a shared activity such as fishing. The equipment and personal attire suggest a warm, sunny day, likely in a casual, rural setting. The photograph exudes a sense of quiet companionship and the enjoyment of simple pleasures.","title":"Bayou Gauche fisherman relaxes with neighbor","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["553519","546077","546209","556489","557363","555580","557672","551271","556484","545511","556488","552523","546131","547359","557360","543314"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["porch","fishing","straw","chair","stool","man","pleasure","companionship","pant","hat"]}
