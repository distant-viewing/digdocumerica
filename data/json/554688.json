{"path":"554688.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively scene at a ranch, specifically named \"Sit'n Bull Ranch\" as indicated by the bold white lettering on the red facade of the barn. A group of people, likely patrons of the ranch, are standing outside the barn's entrance. The group comprises several adults and children, dressed in casual attire suitable for a day outdoors, with some wearing jackets and jeans, indicative of cool weather.\n\nSeveral horses, each wearing a saddle, are tethered to a metal railing in the foreground, suggesting that they are available for rides or have just been used. The horses appear calm and well-maintained, standing on a dirt surface that covers the ground throughout the scene.\n\nThe background features autumn-touched trees with leaves in shades of green and brown, indicating the photograph was likely taken in the fall. The overall atmosphere is rustic and leisurely, capturing a typical day of outdoor, recreational activities at a horse ranch. The building itself has a classic barn structure, with a white-trimmed black door and windows, emphasizing a traditional country aesthetic.","title":"Horses and ranch guests lined up for a fall morning trail ride at the Sit 'n Bull Ranch in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"Warrensburg (N.Y.)","location":"Warrensburg, New York","nn1":["543779","552562","542805","557988","553104","557936","544362","554689","549198","553114","554885","556586","543841","552563","543634","553109"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ranch","horse","barn","saddle","patron","country","ride","group","lettering","fall"]}
