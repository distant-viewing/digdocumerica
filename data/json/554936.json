{"path":"554936.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial or agricultural setting marked by rustic and functional structures. In the foreground, a large mound of what appears to be grains or agricultural produce dominates much of the space, cast under the shadow of a utility pole. This main pole is centrally located and runs vertically through the image, with wires extending into the sky.\n\nIn the middle ground, several individuals are actively engaged in what seems to be manual labor around a loading or processing area. These workers, who are dressed in light-colored, casual work clothing, are positioned around a dark, opened sluice or chute that extends from a tall, narrow building made of dark, weathered wood and corrugated metal. This building has a distinctive, boxy shape with what appears to be a vent or chimney on top.\n\nThe background is less defined, but includes hints of other industrial or storage facilities constructed similarly with corrugated metal. The sky is bright and clear, indicating a sunny day, which casts shadows and enriches the tonal contrasts in the scene.\n\nThe overall ambiance is one of a working environment, possibly related to agriculture or some form of bulk material handling, characterized by a mix of open outdoor spaces and utilitarian architecture. The photograph seems to capture a moment of everyday labor and interaction within a setting tailored to practical purposes.","title":"Cedar mill near Leakey, which employs workers from mexico near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["542989","556893","544048","555542","543174","556503","543642","545992","545998","556322","547528","549268","548437","552544","546122","555591"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["labor","chute","tailor","pole","vent","dark","loading","produce","grain","enrich"]}
