{"path":"545350.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This is a vibrant street scene showing a typical urban neighborhood setup. This image captures an older, two-story brick building that is showing signs of wear and tear; the paint is peeling, and the bricks are exposed. It features several doorways and windows, with a balcony above that runs the length of the building. The balcony is adorned with various items of laundry hung out to dry.\n\nIn the foreground, to the left side, there are four young women engaging in a conversation. Three of them are seated on the hood of a vintage car, while one stands facing them. They appear to be casually dressed, typical of a relaxed, warm day. The car on which they are sitting has a classic 70s style design, suggesting the era of the photograph.\n\nThe street in front of the building is somewhat deserted except for these individuals and a couple of other distant figures who are less focused. Additionally, there are multiple cars parked along the roadside, consistent with the period style of the visible car, further enhancing the retro feel of the scene.\n\nAbove them, the balcony is partially obscured by the laundry, but its traditional wrought iron railing is visible. There is at least one person on the balcony, contributing to the liveliness of the scene.\n\nThe environment suggests a close-knit community vibe, possibly in a neighborhood that might not be affluent but has a strong sense of local identity and interaction. The setting sun adds a golden hue to the scene, enhancing the warm, end-of-day feeling. This photograph not only captures a moment in the daily lives of these individuals but also presents a snapshot of an era, complete with architectural styles and vehicle designs of the time.","title":"El paso's second ward, a chicano neighborhood, which is losing its ethnic flavor in the wake of urban renewal","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["545326","552965","556167","555905","543471","555944","555940","551084","555942","549296","554691","545331","545353","548441","545333","555906"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["balcony","laundry","car","neighborhood","brick","liveliness","era","identity","style","70"]}
