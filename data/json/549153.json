{"path":"549153.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a charming scene at the entrance to a ranch. The focus is on a white wooden gate adorned with a set of antlers at the top, and a sign reading \"My Ranch\" attached to these antlers, suggesting a personal and rustic charm. The gate is partially open, leading the viewer's eye into the property.\n\nThe gate is constructed of white painted wooden planks and is supported by larger, sturdy white posts. One of these posts, visible to the right of the gate, shows some peeling paint, adding a sense of age and wear that contributes to the rustic feel of the scene.\n\nBeyond the gate, a dirt path leads towards a building that is somewhat obscured by trees and foliage. The building appears modest and is painted a muted yellow, with a darker roof. To the left and right of the path are heavily leafed green trees and shrubs, indicating lush vegetation that is well maintained but retains a natural appearance.\n\nThe setting suggests a peaceful, rural environment, likely a private property given the personalized gate sign. The overall mood is serene, inviting a sense of calm and privacy, characteristic of a personal retreat into nature.","title":"Roy Fly Ranch near Sarpy Basin.
