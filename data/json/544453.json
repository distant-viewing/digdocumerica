{"path":"544453.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph presents a striking landscape with dynamic natural features. The foreground is dominated by uneven, rugged terrain composed of rocks and patches of scrubby vegetation. The earth is dark and appears moist, perhaps indicating recent rainfall. The middle ground reveals a winding body of water, possibly a lake, which stretches into the distance, reflecting the bright sky above and flanked by similar rocky terrain. In the background, there are several large rock formations, distinct in their reddish-brown color, adding a stark contrast to the rest of the landscape. These formations protrude dramatically against the horizon. The sky above is a vivid mix of blue tones and large, fluffy white clouds, suggesting a dynamic and possibly changing weather pattern. The general atmosphere evokes a sense of serene isolation and natural beauty, typical of rugged landscapes possibly found in regions like the American Southwest.","title":"Lake Powell, formed by Glen Canyon","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544393","544155","544429","545783","545804","544745","545639","545800","544950","545790","544376","551520","545593","545792","545748","545636"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","rock","rainfall","protrude","terrain","find","change","flank","compose","landscape"]}
