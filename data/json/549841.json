{"path":"549841.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a practical urban scene from an aerial perspective. In the image, a man is seen working outdoors on a city street. He is Caucasian, wearing a plain white T-shirt and dark pants, and is in the process of opening or adjusting a fire hydrant, from which water forcefully sprays onto the street. The man appears focused on his task, using a tool to either turn on the hydrant or regulate its flow.\n\nThe setting is a typical city environment with visible wear. The street is bordered by yellow-painted curbs and there are traces of debris and litter on the wet asphalt, suggesting recent or ongoing cleaning, perhaps facilitated by the flowing water from the hydrant. Nearby, there's a large, black, dome-shaped metal trash bin, and next to it are a couple of brooms and a small container, possibly holding cleaning supplies or tools.\n\nAmong the elements in the background are wrought iron railings and a small staircase leading to an adjacent building, hinting at an apartment or office entrance. The building itself is not visible, leaving its extent and type to imagination. Small patches of greenery emerge unkempt from the margins of the scene, adding to the sense of an everyday urban setting that is slightly, but not excessively, neglected.\n\nThe photograph evokes themes of city maintenance and the use of public utilities, hinting at perhaps a routine cleaning or emergency response scenario in an urban community. The image is effective in capturing a moment of city life, illustrating the interaction between humans and their constructed environments.","title":"\"super\" flushes litter from 172nd street with fire hydrant water","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549838","549834","556177","543804","549063","551869","544832","549078","543795","549070","549309","552751","544968","549056","554308","551951"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["hydrant","cleaning","city","street","tool","broom","regulate","flow","response","bin"]}
