{"path":"553246.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts a man standing amidst a complex urban construction or installation environment. The man, who appears in the center of the frame, is shirtless, revealing a bare chest, and is wearing sunglasses. He is focused on adjusting or looking through a camera that he holds in front of him. He has curly hair, and his stance and expression denote concentration.\n\nThe setting is dominated by a collection of construction and visual elements. Prominently, there is a large red banner with the word \"PULL\" oriented in reverse suggesting this is reflected from another surface, possibly another glass pane or mirror involved in the composition. Various construction scaffolding components encase the scene, adding a sense of a temporary, changing space. Metal poles, ropes, and other tools clutter the area, highlighting an ongoing project or setup.\n\nUrban elements are noticeable in the background where tall buildings are visible. These structures give a sense of a dense, possibly downtown, city environment. The surface on which the man stands appears to be cobbled, suggesting an older urban area or a specifically styled zone of a cityscape.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of human interaction with complex urban infrastructure, blending elements of construction, reflection, and everyday life within a city.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
