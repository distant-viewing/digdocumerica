{"path":"547611.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a large scrapyard or waste processing facility, highlighted by a vast foreground filled with crushed and compressed scrap metal. The metals, varying in color but mostly featuring shades of rusty browns and metallic grays, are compacted into large, irregular blocks strewn across the muddy ground. The scene captures an array of decommissioned vehicles and parts, possibly including segments of consumer products, all mixed into heaps of dense waste.\n\nIn the middle distance, there's a large structure resembling a barge or a specialized vessel, which is likely used for transporting these metal scraps. This structure appears to be stationed on a water body, indicated by a visible waterline and reflections underneath it. Accompanying the structure on its near side is a significant piece of heavy machinery, possibly a crane, which might be employed to move the large metal pieces.\n\nFurther in the background, one can spot an industrial setting that features buildings with rectangular silhouettes. These structures might serve administrative or further processing functions. The environment suggests active industrial operations, typical of areas designated for recycling or waste management.\n\nThe sky appears overcast, casting a natural, subdued light that enhances the gritty, somber tone of the scene. This photograph captures elements of industrial work, focusing not just on the destruction and disposal of materials but possibly on the recycling process, highlighting environmental management issues such as waste disposal and resource recovery.","title":"Scrap metal yards at Fields Point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547610","547625","547062","545059","554301","554318","557308","546256","550880","554300","546267","546255","542660","554357","550265","549637"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","recycling","scrap","disposal","metal","management","processing","waterline","consumer","recovery"]}
