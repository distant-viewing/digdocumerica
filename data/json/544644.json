The ground is covered with pine needles and various discarded items. Among the trash, there are several recognizable objects including a red Coca-Cola can and other crumpled soda cans with labels that are worn or indiscernible. There is also a red plastic bag and pieces of broken glass scattered around. The surroundings include various small shrubs and trees, which appear somewhat dense and show signs of undergrowth. The setting is neither well-maintained nor clean, highlighting an issue of environmental neglect and improper waste disposal in natural settings.","title":"Litter left by visitors in the Tamiani Canal area beside Everglades National Park.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544652","544640","544648","552100","544298","556942","543616","551247","555228","551440","552089","550352","554538","544651","550687","543589"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["soda","crumple","undergrowth","disposal","needle","can","plastic","issue","trash","litter"]}
