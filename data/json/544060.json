{"path":"544060.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a desolate, polluted landscape featuring two heavily damaged and rusted vehicles. The most prominent objects are the remains of these cars, abandoned and decaying in a field that appears dry and barren. The vehicles show signs of severe degradation, with missing windows, doors, and parts, exposing the hollowed interiors. Around the cars, various debris including old tires, broken parts, and scattered trash litter the ground, contributing to the scene's overall sense of abandonment and neglect.\n\nThe setting is arid, with scant vegetation and a background that includes a rolling hill barren of trees, hinting at a harsh, dry climate. The sky is clear, indicating a sunny day, which casts sharp shadows onto the wreckage, enhancing the textures and the dilapidated state of the scene.\n\nThis forsaken area speaks to environmental damage and neglect, possibly hinting at human impact on natural landscapes and the long-term consequences of pollution or abandonment of industrial materials in a natural setting. The composition and the choice of elements within the frame evoke a mood of desolation and forsakenness.","title":"Abandoned autoMobiles in open dump","placename":"Bisbee (Ariz.)","location":"Bisbee, Arizona","nn1":["553009","542590","555851","553007","543680","545304","555871","547587","555869","549107","547024","546816","554302","544433","546249","553010"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["abandonment","neglect","consequence","remain","wreckage","choice","litter","desolation","damage","degradation"]}
