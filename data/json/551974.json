{"path":"551974.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up view of a young girl holding a small duckling. The girl, who appears to be smiling and looking slightly away from the camera, has dark hair and is wearing a dark jacket or coat. Held carefully in her hands is a light yellow duckling, wrapped in a white towel or cloth with a purple trim. The duckling faces the camera and its expression seems curious or alert. The backdrop is softly blurred with tones of green, likely indicating an outdoor setting. The overall mood is tender and joyful, capturing a moment of gentle interaction between the girl and the duckling.","title":"Girl with duck at Foster Avenue Beach on Lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["549092","553408","544222","545214","557490","555551","548542","544833","551501","551377","543663","558092","552221","556139","556145","552993"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["girl","cloth","towel","camera","trim","coat","jacket","hair","expression","hand"]}
