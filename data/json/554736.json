{"path":"554736.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures the vibrant and colorful canopy of a tree during what appears to be the autumn season. The primary focus is on a tree with a twisting trunk and sprawling branches that are densely covered with leaves showcasing a brilliant palette of fall colors, ranging from bright yellows to deep oranges. The leaves are illuminated by sunlight filtering through, which emphasizes their vivid colors and creates a contrast with the dark, shadowed branches.\n\nThe background of the image is a clear blue sky which enhances the intensity of the autumn colors in the leaves. Small patches of this blue sky can be seen through gaps in the foliage, providing a beautiful backdrop that complements the golden hues. There are also hints of other trees around the edges, slightly blurred but still contributing to the richness of the scene with their darker foliage and branches, adding depth and texture to the composition.\n\nOverall, the image is a celebration of autumn, capturing the natural beauty and color variance of the season, presented in a rich, dynamic display.","title":"Top of sugar maple tree at 2,000 feet","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["554727","554726","554725","554735","554730","554739","554636","558074","547634","552693","550603","546011","554737","554668","557127","554738"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["branch","autumn","season","leave","richness","gap","orang","shadowed","foliage","celebration"]}
