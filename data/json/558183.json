{"path":"558183.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a young child sitting outdoors on grass, likely during a casual event or family gathering. The child appears to be a toddler with light-colored hair and is gazing directly at the camera with a subtle and slightly mischievous expression.\n\nThe child is wearing a vibrant red hat adorned with white polka dots, which suggests a playful and child-friendly atmosphere. The hat also features a small brim that helps shield the child's face from sunlight. The child's clothing includes a loose-fitting light blue and dark blue plaid shirt, which is slightly oversized, and blue denim jeans. \n\nA prominent element in this image is an ice-cream stick, which the child holds with both hands and bites on. This action, combined with the child's focused gaze, forms a central visual focus that conveys the theme of simplicity and childhood joy found in everyday moments.\n\nIn the background slightly out of focus, there is another child dressed in an orange dress and possibly engaged in another activity, enhancing the sense of a playful, outdoor setting.\n\nOverall, the image has a candid and endearing quality, capturing the essence of youthful innocence and the simple pleasure found in eating an ice cream on a sunny day, set within a friendly and informal environment.","title":"Participant in a kiddies parade, an annual event held early in the evening during the summer in New Ulm, Minnesota.
