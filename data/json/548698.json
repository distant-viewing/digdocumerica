{"path":"548698.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene, with emphasis on a specific interaction and a car. The main backdrop is a clear turquoise sea that blends into the blue sky at the horizon, separated by a few distant waves. The beach area is relatively rustic and undeveloped, featuring white sands and scattered rocky patches.\n\nDominating the foreground is a brown car with a surfboard rack atop. The car is slightly dusted with sand, suggesting it's been driven directly onto the beach area. The make and model of the car suggest an era from possibly the 1970s or 1980s, given its vintage design and rectangular headlights.\n\nNear the car, a woman is crouching and appears to be either picking something up from or placing something on the ground. Her activity is focused on a wooden object, possibly a small log or piece of driftwood. She is dressed in a light-colored top and darker pants, her long hair freely hanging down.\n\nThe natural environment, with subtle touches like a few bushes in the lower foreground and the pristine condition of the beach, hints at a quiet, somewhat secluded location. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of laid-back beach day adventure with minimalistic and naturalistic appeal.","title":"Tourists on the public beach","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["546417","545849","546408","543089","548280","543493","547612","547607","547499","545280","548757","550922","547478","543287","544989","545237"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","car","sand","surfboard","rack","crouch","pick","driftwood","headlight","appeal"]}
