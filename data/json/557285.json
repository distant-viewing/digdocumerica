{"path":"557285.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This image features a man and a woman walking together on a sidewalk in an urban environment, presumably a residential area with historical significance given the style of the buildings. The buildings have colorful facades with reds and blues predominating and appear to be well-preserved townhouses, characteristic of certain older city neighborhoods. The man is dressed in a dark blue jacket, gray pants, and dark shoes, standing slightly ahead in the frame giving an impression of casual motion. The woman beside him wears a dark, double-breasted coat with what seems to be a white or light-colored shirt underneath, light-colored pants, and carries a white purse. She has long blonde hair and a friendly expression.\n\nThe street is lined with brick sidewalks and conventional street lamps, adding to the historical feel. They walk under an awning that belongs to one of the buildings, which features a striped pattern in red and white. There are red-blurred elements in the foreground, likely flowers or autumn leaves captured in a blur, which frame the subjects and add a vivid touch to the composition, hinting at the season being either spring or fall due to the presence of the foliage.","title":"South side area, shows a young couple walking in a well-maintained, ethnic neighborhood.
