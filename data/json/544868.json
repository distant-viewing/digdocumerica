{"path":"544868.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural, open landscape under a clear blue sky. Dominating the scene is a traditional metal windmill located on the right side of the image. This windmill, commonly used for water pumping, is active, suggesting a windy day. Attached near the base of the windmill, there is a small metal tank, likely for storing the pumped water.\n\nTo the left, somewhat distanced from the windmill, is a larger circular metal tank, also probably used for water storage. The region around the tanks and windmill is fairly barren with low, scrubby vegetation scattered across it, indicative of an arid environment.\n\nIn the midground, a group of cattle can be seen grazing or resting, adding a sense of scale and purpose to the landscape's use, likely for livestock farming. The terrain is flat, giving way to a vast horizon where the land slowly fades into distant hills.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a typical scene in a rural, arid setting where livestock and manual water pumping methods are a necessary part of daily operations. This setting might be emblematic of ranching areas in regions like the American Southwest.","title":"Power without pollution.
