{"path":"556394.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a small, rural community nestled in a valley, surrounded by forested hills. The scene is largely residential, characterized by a mixture of housing styles including single-family homes, mobile homes, and duplexes. The houses are sited along a network of narrow, mostly paved roads. Some homes have brightly colored exteriors in hues of yellow, red, and blue, while others are neutral.\n\nThe area appears to be an American small town, typical of many that developed in regions supportive of mining or manufacturing industries, suggested by the presence of hilly terrain and dense forests nearby, which are common in parts of Appalachia or similar regions. The community layout is dense, suggesting land use considerations possibly influenced by the surrounding environment, such as hillsides or limited flat land.\n\nForeground details include trees beginning to leaf out, suggesting the season might be early spring. A few small vehicles are visible on the roads, but no pedestrian traffic is apparent. There is no prominent commercial or industrial presence visible in this view, supporting the primarily residential classification.\n\nThe overall image gives a sense of a quiet, modest community, where architecture and land use are adapted to the geographical constraints and possibly the economic circumstances of the area.","title":"Mix of Mobile homes and conventional houses at Richlands Virginia.  Most of the Mobile homes belong to miners who work for the Virginia-pocahontas coal company nearby.  They are popular with the young miners because they do not cost as much as conventional housing and they fit on a smaller piece of level land which is at a premium in the area","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556333","556580","556469","556438","551101","556395","556582","557404","556423","556332","556585","551050","557526","557379","556463","556462"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["home","community","land","consideration","region","begin","adapt","leaf","housing","influence"]}
