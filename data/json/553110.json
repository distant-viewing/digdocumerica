{"path":"553110.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively scene of a cattle roundup in a rugged, outdoor setting. In the foreground, two cowboys, each mounted on a horse, are actively engaging with the cattle. One cowboy is on the left, reaching down to either grab or manipulate a rope, dressed in traditional western attire including a white shirt, dark jeans, a black hat, and leather gloves. His horse is dark, adorned with ornate saddle gear.\n\nThe cowboy on the right is also in traditional attire with a white shirt and hat, guiding his horse as it moves dynamically. A calf is seen running energetically in between the two horses, kicking up dust as it sprints.\n\nIn the background, there are several other cowboys and horses, scattered across the landscape, herding a large group of cattle across a wide, barren field that stretches out under a clear sky. The terrain is arid and covered in sparse vegetation, characteristic of a desert or semidesert region. In the distant background, there is a prominent hill enhancing the depth of the scene.\n\nThe photograph conveys a sense of motion and activity, characteristic of cattle herding tasks, under what appears to be bright, sunny weather conditions, contributing to the vivid and dynamic atmosphere of the roundup.","title":"Spring roundup of Paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.
