{"path":"551408.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene featuring two individuals engaged in activities in a river. The river appears to be flowing gently and the water color is a rich brown, suggesting it might contain silt or be flowing through a forested or earthen area.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is actively participating in what looks like a fishing activity. He is standing in the river, wearing dark waders that cover him nearly to his chest, and a dark green shirt. He seems focused on his task, swinging a large, transparent net attached to a long pole through the water.\n\nIn the background, sitting on a large rock on the riverbank, is another person dressed in a bright red vest over a darker base layer, possibly a sweater. This person is wearing a dark cap and is holding a long stick or pole in their hands. Beside them, there's a bright yellow bucket placed on the rock, possibly used to hold fish or other items related to their river activity.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes rocky banks on either side of the river, scattered with small patches of grass and a few bare trees, indicating it might be late fall or early spring. The overall atmosphere is serene and focused, with both individuals engaged in their respective activities amidst a natural, possibly remote setting.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
