{"path":"553084.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural landscape dominated by dense vegetation, primarily tall grasses and reeds. The scene captures a waterway, possibly a stream or small river, surrounded by thick, overgrown banks. The water itself is barely visible, mostly hidden by the lush greenery that grows close to its edges. On the right side of the image, the grass appears lighter, perhaps dry or sun-bleached, contrasting with the darker, greener grasses on the left.\n\nThe background features a clear sky with sparse clouds, suggesting a sunny day, and a few scattered trees, which are visible beyond the dense foreground of grasses. The horizon is relatively flat, indicating that this environment might be in a plain or a valley.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its emphasis on the rich textures and varying shades of the grasses, along with the natural lighting, suggests a serene, untouched natural setting, potentially in a wetland or riparian area.","title":"Overgrown irrigation ditch near Fallon","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["557111","547924","546205","557191","547488","551370","549218","545069","557499","544515","547532","547540","550345","557498","547487","545008"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["grass","bleach","hide","reed","grow","wetland","emphasis","waterway","stream","valley"]}
