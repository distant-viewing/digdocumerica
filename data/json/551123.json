{"path":"551123.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph displays an outdoor scene in an urban setting, featuring a young boy walking towards the camera while carrying a small dog in his arms. The boy has reddish-blond hair and is wearing a dark, sleeveless top along with dark trousers. He displays a broad smile, suggesting a moment of joy or playfulness.\n\nVisible in the background are two cars parked along the side of a street. The nearest car is a large station wagon with brown and white coloring and a well-defined chrome bumper and hubcaps. Beyond the station wagon, another car is partially visible with a similar profile, indicating a period likely in the mid-20th century based on the automotive design and general ambiance.\n\nThe setting includes a concrete sidewalk where the boy is walking, and an asphalt street adjacent to it. Behind the cars, there is a blocky, unadorned building with sparse details, adding to the urban nature of the setting. On the side of the building, a sign is partially visible, suggesting it might be a location for car wash services.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it might be a bright sunny day, contributing to the overall cheerful demeanor captured in the image. The overall composition captures a slice of everyday urban life, marked by the simplicity and spontaneous activity of a boy playing with his pet outdoors.","title":"Street in Boomer Heights.
