{"path":"549636.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a water treatment facility, displaying an aerial perspective. In the center of the image is a large circular tank filled with dark water, featuring a mechanical structure in its center equipped with several radial arms, likely used for agitating or aerating the water.\n\nA narrow, light grey walkway supported by a metal framework extends across the tank, connecting it with another part of the facility. Along the edge of the facility, additional infrastructure is apparent, including what appear to be smaller tanks and a building with what might be control or maintenance functionalities.\n\nThe surrounding area outside the facility displays grass and a few scattered trees, suggesting a suburban or semi-industrial setting. The reflection of the early morning or late afternoon sunlight highlights the tranquility of the water, contrasting with the industrial nature of the treatment plant. The photograph has a somewhat muted color palette, dominated by blues, greys, and subtle green tones.","title":"Settling ponds of lake tahoe sewage treatment plant","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["543572","543573","548216","548212","547568","543574","548151","542982","545840","547239","548137","553837","547262","546895","543524","542988"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["facility","treatment","tank","grey","water","walkway","scattered","display","center","framework"]}
