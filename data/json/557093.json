{"path":"557093.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a segment of a building, capturing its architectural features under a clear blue sky with modest cloud coverage. Prominent in the image is a large, arched window set in a white wall. The window features intricate stained glass work and is secured with ornate, black metal bars.\n\nAbove the window, the building has a curved architectural detail finished with elegant, white dentil molding. Glimpses of a decorative balustrade or railing are visible at the top of the building. Extending vertically from the structure is a tall chimney or vent stack, starkly contrasting in its dark, possibly reddish-brown hue compared to the primarily white facade.\n\nThe pinnacle of the composition includes a small dome or cupola, topped with a decorative metal cross and adorned with a wrought-iron railing. The overall feel of the photograph is one of historic or religious significance, emphasized by the building's ornamental and somewhat gothic architectural elements. The image captures a portion of the building, focusing on texture, color contrasts, and the play of light and shadow, lending depth and interest to the scene.","title":"One portion of the former home of aviatrix amelia earhart who disappeared on a round the world flight in the late 1930's.
