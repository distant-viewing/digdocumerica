{"path":"549162.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a rural setting with clear skies and natural terrain. In the foreground, there is a prominent informational sign that reads \"CLEAN WATER COLSTRIP\" at the top, followed by \"WATER POLLUTION CONTROL FACILITIES.\" The sign further details the contractor as \"E.H. OFTEDAL & SONS INC\" along with other contributors involved in the engineering and administration of the water control facilities, including the \"ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\" and notes the location in \"ROSEBUD COUNTY, MONT.\"\n\nBehind the sign, the middle ground shows a fenced-in area that appears to be part of the water pollution control facility mentioned on the sign. There is a large pile of earth or industrial material and a flat, bare area, perhaps a containment or treatment pond, enclosed by fencing.\n\nThe background includes stretches of open fields and a tree line in the distance under a broad sky. The overall composition of the image captures a juxtaposition of natural landscapes against the human effort to manage and protect water resources, indicative of environmental reclamation or conservation efforts.","title":"A water pollution control facility is under construction at Colstrip. The four power plants (one already under construction) planned for the area will drastically affect water quality.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["548209","549161","553351","543568","547876","548137","544813","553669","550688","549163","545680","548193","549635","555858","549129","548196"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["control","facility","effort","sign","reclamation","containment","fencing","water","treatment","stretch"]}
