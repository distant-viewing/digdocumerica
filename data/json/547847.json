{"path":"547847.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a serene waterfront scene, likely in a coastal or riverside community. The foreground features a rocky, debris-covered shoreline where a single white duck stands prominently. A dilapidated wooden pier extends into calm water, showing signs of disrepair with missing planks and unstable posts.\n\nTo the right of the pier, a piece of warped and weathered wood forms a crude walkway leading to another small, similar structure. The calm water reflects the structures and items around it, enhancing the quiet, somewhat abandoned feel of the area.\n\nThe background is dominated by various wooden houses and raised platforms, suggesting a residential area. These homes and structures appear aged and closely packed, typical of older waterfront communities. There are boats moored along the docks, indicating that the residents likely engage in fishing or use boats for transportation.\n\nSeveral clotheslines with hanging laundry and additional debris scattered around suggest the daily life and activities of the inhabitants. The overall atmosphere of the image conveys a quiet, lived-in environment, possibly in a fishing village or a small community living closely with its marine surroundings.","title":"Housing at Hunter's Point, Jamaica Bay","placename":"Jamaica (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Jamaica, New York","nn1":["545005","544567","550293","544201","548105","550307","551224","550357","547594","547965","547893","548764","551985","547033","551978","546998"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["pier","community","waterfront","fishing","duck","clothesline","inhabitant","laundry","village","resident"]}
