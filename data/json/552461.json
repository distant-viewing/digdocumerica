{"path":"552461.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, outdoor plaque with extensive lists of names, perhaps representing a memorial or honor roll. The plaque is primarily white, with a large American flag symbol at the top and text in bold black letters. Each section of the plaque is bordered by black panels.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a rural scene featuring a small, white building with windows, possibly a warehouse or workshop. The building has a semi-arched roof and an attached smaller structure. In front of this building, there's a large green lawn with a young tree centrally placed in the image. Additionally, a small \"Standard\" brand gasoline station sign is visible, suggesting the building might have a connection to automotive services.\n\nThe setting appears to be in a small town or rural community, indicated by the architecture of the buildings and the spacious setting. The overall atmosphere is quiet and still, suggesting a moment captured in a less bustling environment.","title":"World War II veterans honor roll in Magnolia","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["557873","549626","552589","546329","554448","542581","546817","558041","550038","543345","554361","544419","544084","543502","544423","549325"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["plaque","roll","building","gasoline","brand","symbol","workshop","warehouse","lawn","connection"]}
