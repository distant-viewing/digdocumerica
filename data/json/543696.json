{"path":"543696.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a series of dark glass bottles, primarily illuminated from behind, creating an aura or halo effect around their silhouettes. The bottles are facing downwards and arrayed in a row, and their necks appear to be aligned closely together, touching or nearly touching. The background is very dark, enhancing the contrast against the lit edges of the bottles. The light creates reddish-orange reflections on what appears to be a metallic surface behind the bottles.\n\nThe bottles themselves are adorned with small, glinting points of light in various colors — green, red, and blue — which might be reflections of light passing through some kind of textured, multi-colored surface or due to the properties of the glass. The overall atmosphere of the image is somewhat moody and abstract, focusing on the play of light and shadow rather than on specific, detailed objects. The image captures an industrial or crafted ambiance, hinting at a setting like a brewery, bar, or a similar environment where glass bottles would be used or displayed.","title":"Recycled beer bottles receive heat treatment prior to final packaging.
