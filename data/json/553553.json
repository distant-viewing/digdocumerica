{"path":"553553.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph features a young boy standing on a stone pathway outside a somewhat dilapidated building. The boy is looking directly at the camera with a somewhat curious or puzzled expression. He wears a striped, short-sleeved, horizontal striped t-shirt in colors such as yellow, orange, and blue, accompanied by light blue pants. In his right hand, he holds a large, empty yellow cup.\n\nThe scene around him is overcast, giving a moody light to the image. The building behind him is old and appears to be in a state of disrepair, with faded and peeling paint on the facade, a shuttered window on the right, and a boarded-up window on the left. An awning above the door and window on the left side looks worn. There are trees visible in the background, contributing to an overall green and somewhat unkempt atmosphere, reflecting an urban environment that might be neglected or past its prime. To the left side of the frame, there is an indistinct glimpse of a vehicle, enhancing the urban setting of the scene.","title":"Mulky square, an isolated, low-income area on the city's west side, is soon to be torn up to make way for a new interstate highway.
