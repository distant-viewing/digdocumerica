{"path":"543239.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor setting featuring a small, rustic building, possibly a kiosk or service station, with a prominent, sloping roof and large windows that enable a glimpse of the interior. It is centrally placed in the frame and situated in a wooded area, surrounded by lush greenery that includes tall trees and dense shrubs, adding a rich, green backdrop to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a patch of vibrant ferns and smaller plants neatly placed along a walking path, and directly in front of the viewer is a memorial plaque mounted on a low stone structure. The plaque is dedicated to the reopening of Point Lobo by \"Governor and Mrs. Ronald Reagan\" in 1967, suggesting that the location is of historical or commemorative significance.\n\nSeveral people are visible in the photograph. On the left of the image, a person appears to be walking towards the building. Another figure, partially obscured, stands at the corner of the building possibly interacting or preparing to interact with those inside. On the far right, a young woman in a light dress appears to be either looking at or walking past the kiosk, distanced slightly from other elements in the scene.\n\nThe atmosphere is serene and somewhat nostalgic, reflecting a moment of daily life in a natural setting, enhanced by strong natural lighting that indicates sunny weather conditions.","title":"California--point lobos state park","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["543580","557985","558033","552396","551265","546460","543223","542593","543365","551116","554699","546463","546457","544811","557943","551114"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["kiosk","plaque","enable","interact","walk","fern","slop","place","significance","prominent"]}
