{"path":"551305.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural landscape characterized by a serene and lush environment. In the foreground, dense greenery partially obscures the view, including various deciduous trees with dense canopies. The middle of the image opens up to a pastoral scene featuring open fields that gently undulate across the terrain. Here, several cows are dispersed, grazing on the grass.\n\nIn the heart of the scene, there are two farmhouses with traditional red and white exteriors, along with peaked roofs, which are typical of rural American architecture. Beside the houses are two large barn structures with similar color schemes and gabled roofs. There appears to be a fenced area enclosing the farmhouses, perhaps to keep livestock managed.\n\nThe background extends into a distant horizon where a dense collection of trees outlines the edge of these rural properties. Beyond this treeline, there's a hint of a flatter, expansive field or plain under a broad sky.\n\nOverall, the composition offers a quintessential snapshot of rural life, focused on agriculture and livestock, enveloped in a tranquil natural setting. The colors in the photo are rich and vivid, enhancing the idyllic quality of the landscape.","title":"Hilltop farm five miles north of eldon","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["555635","549256","555577","557946","557748","554819","547291","547309","556963","554560","542801","549257","551333","549237","549222","554767"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["farmhouse","livestock","treeline","heart","cow","disperse","graze","field","scheme","roof"]}
