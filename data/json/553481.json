{"path":"553481.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph shows an elderly person with a gentle smiling expression, wearing large round glasses and a light-colored shower cap adorned with small print. The individual is dressed in a blue long-sleeved shirt and patterned apron, suggesting a home setting. They hold a small, alert-looking dog with distinctive marking, primarily white with dark patches over its eyes resembling a mask.\n\nThe person is seated and supporting the dog with both hands, ensuring the dog is facing towards the camera. The dog has its front paws dangling and appears curious or slightly wary as it gazes directly at the camera.\n\nThe background, although slightly out of focus, features the dark outlines of a house, providing a domestic and slightly rustic setting. There's a wooden structure, possibly a porch or part of a fence, running across the bottom of the image, further emphasizing the homey, informal atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe colors in the image are vivid, with deep blues contrasting against the lighter hues of the cap and the darker patches of the dogâ€™s coat. The overall mood conveys warmth and the comfort of a candid, everyday moment at home.","title":"Mulky Square is a neighborhood in the west side of Kansas City, an area of low-income dwellings. I-635 will cut right through Mulky Square which is already isolated by railroad yards on the west, I-70 on the north and I-35 plus a 4-lane freeway on the east. This elderly woman, living on Social Security, must find other lodging because her present home is in the path of I-635.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["556421","554951","556549","557637","556529","552611","553089","546990","553485","556171","554126","556576","547148","555929","547413","548224"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["dog","home","cap","dangle","apron","mask","comfort","ensure","print","camera"]}
