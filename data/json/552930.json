{"path":"552930.jpg","date":"March 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The image depicts a scene outside the Louisville Memorial Hospital. Several individuals, presumably military or police personnel wearing green uniforms and helmets, are entering or exiting the building. Their backs are towards the camera, making it difficult to see their faces or distinguish specific features. On the right side of the photograph, there is a hand-drawn sign saying “COMMAND POST” placed atop a stone ledge or wall. The sign suggests a temporary operations center set up in the area. Below this, affixed to the stone is a more permanent-looking sign that reads \"LOUISVILLE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\". The backdrop of the photograph shows the hospital's gray stone facade, indicating an institutional building. The overall mood conveyed by the image suggests a situation requiring coordination and presence of authority, possibly in response to an event or emergency. The specific activities of the individuals are not discernible, but their purposeful movements and attire imply a context of emergency management or a similar operation.","title":"Police and national guardsmen helped maintain law and order.
