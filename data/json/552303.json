{"path":"552303.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features a large, industrial scene centered around a cargo ship, likely in a port setting. The ship is prominent, occupying the majority of the frame with its dark hull and cargo on board, visibly composed of large, neatly stacked logs. The logs fill the deck area, extending from the foreground to the background along the ship's length and suggest the ship's role in the timber trade.\n\nSeveral individuals, presumably workers, are engaged in activities around the ship. On the deck, two people are visible; one appears to be standing and possibly overseeing the operation, while another seems to be walking along the deck amidst the logs. Down by the dock level, three more workers can be seenâ€”one close by the ship and two others further away. These workers add a human element to the scene, emphasizing the scale of the ship and cargo by contrast.\n\nThe ship is equipped with large cranes and rigging, which hint at the mechanism used for loading and unloading cargo. The cranes reach upwards and across the frame, emphasizing the industrial capability of the vessel.\n\nThe backdrop includes a partly cloudy sky, providing a soft, natural light that illuminates the scene. This lighting helps bring out the colors and details in the photograph, such as the texture and patterns of the stacked logs and the worn surfaces of the ship. The overall composition effectively conveys a sense of activity and industry associated with maritime trade, particularly in the logging industry.","title":"Logs being loaded aboard ship for export to Japan","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552148","552149","546914","546901","546917","546881","555270","552244","550910","547474","555797","552200","546828","547572","551577","548127"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","cargo","log","trade","deck","worker","crane","industry","capability","rigging"]}
