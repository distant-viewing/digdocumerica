{"path":"557943.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic outdoor setting centered around a wood-sided building with a sloping metal roof. This building appears to be a central hub where people gather. It looks semi-open, possibly a workshop or a community meeting point, surrounded by stacked lumber and clear signs of wood processing or storage.\n\nSeveral people are in the scene. In the foreground, a group of men and women gather around the building, some looking on as a few men appear to be engaged in a task involving the lumber. The attire of the individuals is casual and varied, suggesting an informal event or a day of community activities.\n\nThe background features open, lush greenery, indicative of a rural or semi-rural area. There's a well-kept garden plot visible and another smaller structure, possibly a barn or storage shed, which reinforces the agricultural or rural community setting. Large trees around provide shade and add to the serene, natural aesthetic of the setting.\n\nPaths or perhaps muddy tracks run through the scene, connecting different areas, and there's a small, rustic wooden fence partially visible. The overall atmosphere is bucolic and active, with people coming together in what seems to be either a communal workday or a local gathering in a natural setting that balances agricultural, residential, and community functions.","title":"Sawmill at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Akron, Ohio. Operated on farm property, it is used for demonstrating how timber was used and for reconstruction of buildings moved to the village. The saw is powered by a 1912 boiler and an 1889 motor. Steam power is generated by burning logs and other wood not suitable for conversion into planking. The historic site is located within the 30,000-acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area between Akron and Cleveland.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["544406","554666","557947","551114","551116","554667","557029","551413","557953","554413","558294","558033","554936","554671","557936","547900"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["lumber","community","gather","workday","storage","wood","meeting","people","plot","workshop"]}
