{"path":"548112.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This is an aerial photograph that captures a suburban area densely packed with houses. The area is organized into a grid pattern with streets running vertically and horizontally throughout the image. The houses mostly have rectangular footprints and are spaced consistently in rows, each surrounded by small plots of land that appear to be lawns or gardens. Most of the roofs of the houses are dark, suggesting they might be made of shingles, and several have pools in their backyards, adding blue patches to the predominantly green and gray color scheme.\n\nIn the lower right corner, there's a large public swimming pool surrounded by a grassy area, distinguishable by its bright blue water. The surrounding streets are lined with lush trees, adding to the greenery visible throughout the community. The composition of the photograph, taken from directly overhead, highlights the neat, orderly layout of the suburb and provides a clear look at residential life in this area, which appears serene and well-maintained.","title":"A residential area of Portland","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548824","549071","546399","547435","551198","553937","553939","545914","556975","553700","544604","544510","553699","553934","556974","558112"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["pool","house","suburb","backyard","footprint","shingle","swimming","plot","street","scheme"]}
