{"path":"546374.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavily polluted beach environment. The foreground is cluttered with a vast array of trash, including broken boxes, plastic bottles, discarded papers, and various other pieces of rubbish scattered across the sand. Intertwined with the debris are natural materials like seaweed and small branches.\n\nIn addition to the litter, there are large, rugged rocks lining the beach, which seem to serve as a barrier between the sandy beach covered in garbage and the shoreline where the ocean waves meet the land. The ocean itself appears somewhat turbulent, with visible waves hitting the shore.\n\nIn the background, the seascape extends towards a horizon with a slightly cloudy blue sky. On the left side of the image, a small piece of land or a distant island can be seen, contributing to the scenic yet contaminated coastal view.\n\nThis beach scene is indicative of environmental neglect and pollution issues affecting natural water bodies, highlighting an urgent need for improved waste management and conservation efforts to protect marine and coastal ecosystems.","title":"Garbage-strewn atlantic beach","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"Puerto Rico","nn1":["548747","548741","550197","550215","550687","543056","550280","550800","546965","555228","551440","547831","550352","547524","547525","550276"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["beach","ocean","wave","seaweed","rubbish","piece","hit","addition","seascape","land"]}
