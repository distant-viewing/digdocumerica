{"path":"554711.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a lush, dense forest in the midst of autumn, showing a magnificent display of fall colors. The forest is predominantly filled with trees showing a palette of colors ranging from green and yellow to orange and red. Amidst this colorful forest canopy, a small, serene lake appears, reflecting the clear sky above and surrounded by trees, some of which lean slightly over the water's edge.\n\nThe lake is kidney-shaped and nestled within the forest, suggesting a natural, secluded environment. The surrounding terrain is hilly, with gentle undulations visible in the forested landscape. The view spans across a broad area, illustrating the expansive reach of the forest, which extends to the horizon where faint hills can be seen under a light haze, adding a sense of depth and vastness to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the tranquility and untouched beauty of a forest in fall, providing a vivid depiction of the seasonal change in a temperate woodland. The perspective offers a comprehensive view that highlights both the density and the variety of colors in the natural setting, inviting the viewer to appreciate the quiet and the aesthetic appeal of such landscapes.","title":"Typical small Adirondack Forest Preserve lake showing an inlet and meadow-bog with a surrounding forest of beech, birch, hemlock, maple, red spruce, and balsam.","placename":"Raquette Lake (N.Y.)","location":"Raquette Lake, New York","nn1":["554649","554712","554714","554757","554758","554648","554751","554737","554738","554715","554730","554636","554761","557127","557821","554651"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["forest","fall","undulation","lake","appreciate","woodland","midst","appeal","depiction","density"]}
