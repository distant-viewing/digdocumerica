{"path":"543002.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic and intense scene, most likely of an industrial or emergency situation taking place at night. The prominent elements include:\n\n1. A strong, glowing red and orange light dominates the scene, suggesting the presence of a large fire or intense light source in the background.\n\n2. The silhouette of a structure can be seen against the light. It appears to be a large building with a dome-like feature on top, possibly part of an industrial complex or a storage facility.\n\n3. In the foreground, there is a silhouette of a vehicle, possibly a truck. The cabin lights of the truck are on, casting a bright glow that cuts through the ambient darkness.\n\n4. There are scattered sparks or small particles of light visible in the air around the vehicle, adding to the intensity of the scene.\n\n5. The general atmosphere is one of urgency or emergency, backed by the vibrant colors and stark contrasts between light and shadow.\n\n6. Trees and possibly other foliage are also visible as dark shapes within the composition, further framing the scene within a possibly rural or semi-industrial environment.\n\nThe overall effect is one of tension and drama, capturing a moment of significant activity or crisis.","title":"Wood chip burner at night","placename":"Scotia (Calif.)","location":"Scotia, California","nn1":["543900","544008","555481","555160","543908","554421","543933","551030","543020","557398","543904","545418","555166","554139","545528","554956"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["emergency","glow","crisis","spark","drama","truck","light","urgency","tension","silhouette"]}
