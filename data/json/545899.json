{"path":"545899.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up of a large, barren hill with distinct geological features. The hill is covered primarily in what appears to be loose, eroded material, possibly soil or soft rock, creating a pale, gray or ash-colored texture throughout. Notably, there are several deep, narrow channels or gullies carved vertically down the face of the hill, suggesting the action of water erosion over time.\n\nAt the top of the hill, the ridge appears slightly more stable and is adorned with a very sparse covering of vegetation, including small bushes or shrubs which are just visible against the skyline. These plants likely contribute to anchoring the topsoil and preventing further erosion.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests that it was taken during a time of day when the sun was bright, casting shadows that enhance the three-dimensional appearance of the gullies and providing a stark contrast between the illuminated parts of the hill and its shaded areas. The background is a clear blue sky, emphasizing the isolation and barren nature of the hill in its environment. This image captures a compelling natural example of erosion and the rugged beauty of a stark, minimally vegetated landscape.","title":"Texas--Big Bend National Park","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["557100","549184","549136","555595","552423","542612","551233","545895","542518","555573","543635","555610","552420","551232","549176","549179"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hill","gully","erosion","ash","example","covering","time","channel","ridge","up"]}
