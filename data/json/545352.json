{"path":"545352.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a busy highway scene at twilight. The image is bathed in the warm, vibrant colors of the sunset, blending oranges and blues in the sky, which provides a striking backdrop. The silhouettes of multiple utility poles line the horizon, adding a linear, graphic element to the composition.\n\nThe highway itself is bustling with activity; multiple lanes of cars are visible, their headlights and taillights creating streaks of light due to the long exposure of the camera. This creates an effect of motion and speed, emphasizing the busy nature of the scene. Some lights are clearer, indicating either slower movement or a momentary pause.\n\nIn the foreground, the edge of the road or a roadside verge is visible, slightly out of focus, suggesting the photographer's position slightly off the main road. Overhead, street lamps illuminate the scene, contributing to the glow and providing light that reflects off the moving vehicles.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of a natural sunset with the dynamic energy of urban transportation, captured in a moment of transition from day to night.","title":"Albuquerque Speedway Park, one of three stock car race tracks in Albuquerque","placename":"New Mexico","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545402","546684","553894","552596","546739","553726","555431","546644","549902","545432","555381","546747","553727","546586","546629","542682"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","sunset","photographer","headlight","pause","streak","roadside","speed","night","road"]}
