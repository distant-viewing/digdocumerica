{"path":"549589.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph features a close-up and low-angle view of part of a large red vessel, possibly a ship or buoy. The focus is on a human figure working or performing maintenance on the mast or some kind of towering structure on the ship. The person is wearing dark clothing that includes a jacket and seems to be handling or adjusting equipment attached to the structural component he is on.\n\nThe red structure has draft markings painted in white, showing numbers '19', '20', and '21', that help indicate the waterline levels of the ship. A white graphical design, possibly a logo or an information panel, shows the letters \"NOVE\" with additional assorted letters and lines forming parts of a larger marking, can be seen just below the numbers.\n\nThe background shows a clear blue sky, indicating optimal weather conditions for outdoor activities. The entire setting communicates a maritime or industrial theme, centered around ship maintenance or operation, and captures a moment of human engagement with mechanical or technical aspects of marine infrastructure.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical, biological and meteorological conditions in Lake Superior.
