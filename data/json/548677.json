{"path":"548677.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts an underwater scene, rich with marine life and coral formations. In the foreground, multiple types of coral with different textures and colors are visible. These range from smooth, mounded formations to rough, branch-like structures covered in tiny organisms, creating a textured, dense appearance. The colors of the coral vary, exhibiting shades of brown, green, and gray.\n\nA group of fish, possibly a school of yellowtail snappers, are actively swimming in the midground. These fish have sleek, streamlined bodies with silvery and yellow hues, and they move in a coordinated manner, suggesting a common direction or purpose.\n\nIn the background, the clarity of the underwater environment gradually decreases, creating a sense of depth. The water is a deep blue, suggestive of the ocean's vastness and depth. There are faint silhouettes of other marine life and coral formations in the distant background, somewhat obscured by the marine environment's natural particulate matter.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests that this scene is illuminated by natural sunlight, possibly filtered through surface water, highlighting different parts of the coral and giving a shimmering effect to the school of fish. The overall composition conveys a peaceful yet dynamic underwater ecosystem, thriving with life and natural beauty.","title":"Coral and sea life in the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park at Key Largo is photographed at a depth of 12 feet.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548719","548682","548678","548717","548679","548711","548722","548712","548713","548721","548723","548676","548681","548718","548710","548680"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["coral","fish","school","formation","organism","matter","life","manner","clarity","depth"]}
