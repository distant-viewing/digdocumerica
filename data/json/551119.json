{"path":"551119.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid, nostalgic scene likely from the mid-20th century, characterized by its vintage elements and natural setting. The main focus is a slightly worn two-story house with faded, peeling paint. The architecture is simple and rectangular, typical of residential houses from earlier decades. There are multiple windows visible, some with shutters, and a porch that can be partially seen.\n\nIn the foreground, there are two large classic cars, both with distinctive designs indicating their production around the 1960s or 1970s. One car is parked on the street; it's a sleek model with a shiny, grey metallic finish. The other car, visible to the left, sports a vibrant orange or red color, indicating the popular styles and preferences of that era.\n\nTo the right side of the house, there are two people: an adult in a yellow top and dark pants, and a young child. They appear to be walking through the grassy area, which lacks manicured landscaping, contributing to a more casual, lived-in atmosphere of the scene. Behind them, dense trees and another house form the background, providing a sense of a close-knit community or suburban setting. \n\nOverall, the photograph exudes a sense of everyday life from a past era, with its focus on residential architecture and classic automotive design, framed by a clear sky and typical neighborhood surroundings.","title":"One of two Union Carbide-owned houses in Alloy.
