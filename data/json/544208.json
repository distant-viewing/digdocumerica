{"path":"544208.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a striking silhouette of a man standing in a small boat on a body of water, likely a lake or a calm sea. The man is poised upright and raises a large fishing net above his head, held by both hands, as if ready to cast or having just lifted it from the water. The predominant element is his silhouette against a soft, light blue sky.\n\nThe boat appears to be rustic, small, and possibly made of wood, just wide enough to accommodate the man. It's partially submerged, suggesting either the weight of the man or the shallowness of the water.\n\nThe man's attire is simple, he seems to be wearing a casual short-sleeve shirt and pants, typical perhaps of a fisherman. His posture and the action suggest he is engaged in fishing, using traditional methods.\n\nThe background is minimalistic, comprising mostly the sky and the shimmering water, with subtle hints of light reflections on the water's surface. The overall mood is serene and captures a moment of daily life, likely at dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and the tranquility of the surroundings. There is no land visible in the background, emphasizing the openness of the water environment.","title":"Louisiana--lake pontchartrain","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["552308","552122","547723","545306","547558","544714","547023","543753","554147","552309","552314","543033","544973","546301","547559","547555"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["man","fishing","water","fisherman","weight","accommodate","method","silhouette","poise","boat"]}
