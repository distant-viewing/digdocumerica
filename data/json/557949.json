{"path":"557949.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint rural scene under an overcast sky. The image features two traditional buildings: on the left, a small white house with a dark roof and visible chimney, which includes extensions and surrounded by several windows; on the right, a two-story white building with a similar dark roof and chimney. Both structures exhibit a classic architectural style that might suggest they are historical or preserved as part of a heritage site. \n\nBetween the houses, a neatly maintained white picket fence is visible, emphasizing the boundary of the property and adding a touch of charming old-world aesthetics. In front of the fence and around the houses, well-kept grass areas provide a lush green contrast to the white of the buildings.\n\nSeveral visitors can be observed within the scene: closer to the house on the left are two individuals dressed casually, appearing engaged in a relaxed visit, walking around the premises. On the right, near the two-story house, a group of three people are informally gathered or walking along the fence. The presence of these visitors adds a lively human element to the serene architectural setting.\n\nThe overall composition is framed on the top by darker foliage, creating a partial natural arch and adding depth, guiding the viewer's eye towards the buildings and activity below. The entire scene conveys a quiet, historical atmosphere, possibly in a rural town or a historical village preserved for educational or touristic purposes.","title":"Jagger House, left, and Salt Box House at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Akron, Ohio. They are part of the 19th-century farm and village that form a living museum to preserve life as it was lived during that era. The Salt Box House was built in Richfield, Ohio, in 1830, and the Jagger House erected in Bath in 1845. The village is being reconstructed by adding original period buildings moved from other sites.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["556959","558109","557952","547658","556423","546439","557947","557948","557946","550704","547920","557953","548295","558110","550311","556433"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","fence","preserve","visitor","chimney","picket","story","extension","village","heritage"]}
