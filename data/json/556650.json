{"path":"556650.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling subway station scene, likely during evening hours given the subdued lighting. A train, motion-blurred and occupying the left side of the image, creates a dynamic atmosphere as it speeds through the station. The shiny reflection on the train’s surface adds to the sense of motion and speed.\n\nSeveral people are visible, standing and waiting near the platform edge, facing away or to the side, which emphasizes their roles as commuters going about their routines. Individuals appear in various postures: some are observing the departing train, others seem engaged in conversation or lost in thought, and at least one person is holding onto a standing pole, suggesting the movement and crowdedness of the environment.\n\nAbove the platform, there are informational signs, one of which reads “EXPRESS TRAINS LEAVE THIS STATION DURING RUSH HOURS ONLY,” along with a schedule listing various times and destinations such as “WOODLAWN - JEROME” and “LEXINGTON AVE.”. These details reinforce the context of a busy city subway, catering to a flux of daily commuters.\n\nThe station itself has a gritty, almost atmospheric quality with dim lighting, tiled walls partially visible in the background, and what seems to be industrial elements like pipes overhead. The entire scene is imbued with a nostalgic or slightly timeless aura, characterized by its rich textures and the snapshot quality of life in motion.","title":"Passengers getting ready to board the New York city transit authority subway on the Lexington avenue line.  The entire subway system has 232 miles of track and is the longest in the world.  In spite of the crucial importance of this system to the city, voters have refused to vote any more funds for improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be increased to cover transit authority costs.  In 1960, the system handled 2.2 million people per day; in 1970, the number had decreased to 2.1 million","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551895","556660","556821","551883","551894","556823","556651","556818","556663","548259","556812","556815","548263","551889","548253","556682"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["station","commuter","train","subway","motion","speed","platform","nostalgic","cate","obserive"]}
