{"path":"558088.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural outdoor scene that seems to be taken in a wild, forested area during daylight. The scene is rich in vegetation and shows a lush, dense forest environment with a variety of plants.\n\nIn the forefront of the image, you can see a dense patch of small, twig-like branches that appear to be from a deciduous shrub or young trees, indicating perhaps a recently disturbed or clear-cut area within prior growth. Beyond this patch of twigs, there's a field of tall, dried grass or reeds, indicating a possibly wetland area or meadow merging with the forest. These tall grasses are dry and brown, suggesting the photo might have been taken in late summer or autumn.\n\nAround these grasses, the background is dominated by mixed deciduous forest. Several trees reach up high, and in various states of foliage densityâ€”one notably distinct tree in the middle distance stands out due to its thin, almost bare branches contrasting against those around it that possess fuller foliage.\n\nThe sky visible in gaps between the treetops is partly cloudy, with some fluffy, white clouds and a clear blue hinting at fair weather conditions. The lighting in the photograph suggests it could be either late morning or early afternoon due to the softness and angle of the light.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is layers of nature, from the raw, tangled twigs at the front, rising to the softer textures of the tall grasses, and then extending into the sturdy, varied texture of the forest, backed by the open sky. This offers a sense of deep, natural stratification and highlights various aspects of a regenerating forest ecosystem. The mood is tranquil and slightly wild, transporting the viewer to a serene, natural setting away from urban influences.","title":"Stumpy basin, a botanical area north of Peninsula, Ohio, near Cleveland, that is owned by kent state university.  Cattails are seen in this marshy area that once was the turnaround for boats plying the Ohio-erie canal.  The canal was heavily used for commerce between the great lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi river systems from 1833 to 1913 when a flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business.
