{"path":"553299.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a young woman deeply engrossed in examining a collection of small silver objects displayed on a table, possibly at an indoor market or bazaar. She leans forward, her right hand supporting her chin, suggesting a thoughtful or discerning attitude. She wears a long-sleeved, plaid, button-up shirt with a predominantly pink and white pattern, layered under what appears to be a light grey or white sweater vest. Her dark hair is long and straight, parted in the middle.\n\nThe table in front of the woman holds trays and box-like displays filled with various items, likely jewelry or small ornaments given their reflective, metallic appearance. The displayed objects are somewhat blurred, but they catch the light, indicating their shiny surfaces.\n\nThe background is dimly lit and populated with other people, suggesting a crowded venue. A person directly behind the woman wears a yellow garment and others are partially visible, indicative of a lively, bustling environment. The overall ambiance suggests a place of commerce and casual exploration, with patrons likely browsing through different stalls or displays.","title":"D'aug Days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, Fountain Square.
