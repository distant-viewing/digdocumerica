{"path":"543479.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor setting featuring two young individuals exploring a forested area. The composition of the image draws attention to a massive tree stump dominating the foreground. The surface of this stump is deeply cracked and weathered, indicating age, and has names and dates carved into it, which suggest it has been a spot for visitors to leave their marks. Specifically, the name \"Kristen\" is clearly visible along with the carved date \"1980.\"\n\nTo the left of the image, a young boy stands in profile, looking upwards at a relatively small, lush coniferous tree growing beside the stump. He is dressed in a casual polo shirt and shorts, indicating a warm weather setting. On the right side of the photograph, slightly elevated on the earth behind the stump, a young girl is partially visible. She looks down, possibly examining something on the stump or the ground, standing amidst light foliage and woodland debris. She wears a purple and white outfit, also appropriate for warm weather.\n\nThe background shows dense forest with a variety of trees and underbrush bathed in sunlight, highlighting a serene, natural environment. This environment suggests a space for exploration and connection with nature, as echoed by the children's involvement and the historical interaction symbolized by the names on the stump. The overall mood is one of curiosity and tranquility within a natural wooded landscape.","title":"Planted redwoods in devastated areas of big basin","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"Redwood National Park, California","nn1":["542724","542767","543441","543446","557589","543466","558078","544332","542732","544739","547045","553376","552453","543791","542768","554423"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["stump","name","carve","date","underbrush","polo","echo","symbolize","involvement","explore"]}
