{"path":"551240.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic roadway flanked by rocky cliffs and lush greenery. The road, which follows a gently curving path, is depicted with a clear double yellow line marking its center, guiding the flow of traffic. The asphalt appears slightly worn, suggesting regular use.\n\nSeveral vehicles from an earlier era are visible; they are caught in motion, driving along the road. The cars exhibit the design styles typical of the mid-20th century, including more angular bodies and noticeable chrome detailing. The colors of the vehicles range from white and light blue to darker tones, which contrast subtly with the natural scenery surrounding them.\n\nThe cliffs on either side of the road add a dramatic natural element to the scene. These rock faces are rugged, jutting out at points, and blanketed with various shrubs and small trees, indicating fairly rough terrain. The vegetation suggests a temperate climate, as the trees are dense and leafy.\n\nAbove the cliffs, the sky is overcast, casting a somber light over the landscape and muting the colors throughout the scene. This lighting enhances the quiet, tranquil feel of the photograph, drawing attention to the interaction between man-made infrastructure and the natural environment. The overall composition gives a sense of remote, natural beauty juxtaposed with routine human activity.","title":"Traffic streams through a cut in porous limestone just north of bagnell dam","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["554566","556579","554130","554031","548100","555679","548144","547659","557528","553630","554805","544598","553774","553785","557010","545367"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["cliff","road","mut","jutt","asphalt","chrome","detailing","drive","blanket","roadway"]}
