{"path":"550846.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph depicts two individuals standing on a dam structure over a flowing body of water. The dam appears to be a small, mechanical dam with two significant metal wheel mechanisms, each operated by one of the individuals. The person on the left is dressed in a dark suit and appears to be observing the water, while the person on the right, wearing casual attire, is actively engaging with or adjusting the wheel mechanism. \n\nThe background features a tranquil river or lake that extends into the distance with lush green trees lining its banks. The water immediately below the dam is turbulent and frothy, indicating the dam's role in controlling water flow. The structure they are on is made up of metal and weathered wood, functional and unadorned, suggesting that this dam serves a utilitarian purpose rather than decorative. \n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of human interaction with a mechanical and natural environment, highlighting a blend of natural beauty and man-made structure.","title":"Fishing from locks on the fox river near montello.
