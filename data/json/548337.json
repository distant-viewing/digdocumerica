{"path":"548337.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph features a moody, atmospheric view of an iconic urban skyline at what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the muted, pinkish hues and light diffusion across the scene. The skyline is dense with a variety of buildings, including some very distinctive and landmark skyscrapers, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building, recognizable by their spires and art deco architectural styles.\n\nThe environment seems to be shrouded in haze or smog, which adds a layer of mystery and softens the usually sharp outlines of the buildings, enhancing the silhouette effect against the sky. The colors are subdued, mostly in tones of grey and bluish-pink, suggesting a serene yet somewhat melancholic mood that could reflect the quiet of early morning or the winding down of the day.\n\nForeground buildings are less distinct, appearing more as shapes and less as structures with detailed attributes. The overall composition centers on the overlapping array of buildings, and the image uses natural light to create contrasts and depth, emphasizing the cityâ€™s verticality and architectural diversity.","title":"Towers of Manhattan.
