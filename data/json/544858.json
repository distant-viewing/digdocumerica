{"path":"544858.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image displays a vibrant and textured scene dominated by a flowing body of red, muddy water. The water has a unique, rippled surface, appearing thick and viscous, which suggests it might be carrying a high load of sediment. The colors are deep red and brown, typical of areas with rich, iron-laden soil or during a high sediment run-off event, possibly after rain.\n\nTo the left of the image, there is a bank or edge that has accumulated a variety of debris including small rocks, branches, and possibly some dead vegetation, indicating recent erosion or movement along the water's edge. The debris is dark and wet, suggesting it has been recently submerged or splashed upon.\n\nThe immediate background only gives more context to the surging muddy water, providing no escape from the robust, earthy tones. The lighting in the image highlights the metallic sheen on the water's surface, giving it a somewhat glossy look that contrasts with the more matte appearance of the mud-caked debris.\n\nThe composition of the photograph focuses on the natural phenomenon of water flow and sediment transport in a vibrant, almost monochromatic scheme, emphasizing the textures and fluid dynamics in a natural environment. There are no visible human activities, structures, or animals in this captured scene.","title":"White Canyon, near Sipapu Bridge","placename":"Natural Bridges National Monument (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546111","553427","552062","554778","552430","543523","553388","552061","545636","553420","555626","552983","545656","544795","550698","547238"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["sediment","debris","laden","water","escape","phenomenon","load","iron","sheen","dynamic"]}
