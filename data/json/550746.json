{"path":"550746.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This image features a tranquil, natural scene that showcases primarily a serene lake viewed through a group of silhouetted trees. The photograph captures the essence of a quiet lakeside environment during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft and diffuse light.\n\nIn the foreground, there are multiple slim tree trunks clustered together, their forms casting shadows and creating a natural frame for the view behind them. These trees have a dark appearance, likely due to the lighting conditions, and they contrast starkly against the lighter background.\n\nBehind the trees, there is a layer of wildflowers and grass, offering a splash of color at the lower part of the image. The flowers are predominantly red and yellow, and they gently intermingle with the green grasses, adding vibrancy to the overall muted color palette of the scene.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by the calm lake, its surface smooth and reflective, suggesting a peaceful, undisturbed natural setting. The lake extends into the horizon, meeting a thin strip of land or a distant shoreline that is barely visible through the mist or haze.\n\nThe background is comprised of a hazy sky, blending seamlessly with the lake, with a soft gradient of color that suggests either the early morning mist or the fading light of evening.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on silhouette trees in the foreground framing the colorful undergrowth and the tranquil lake, creates a serene and contemplative mood, inviting the viewer to appreciate the quiet beauty of a lakeside at twilight.","title":"Pleasant Point on Merrymeeting Bay in the Brunswick area near the confluence of the Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["554752","557493","552319","543590","554760","543577","557021","550735","551207","554749","557569","554405","550389","557570","552336","543611"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["lake","mist","tree","undergrowth","lakeside","grass","vibrancy","wildflower","strip","splash"]}
