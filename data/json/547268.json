{"path":"547268.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph presents a panoramic view of iconic landmarks in Washington, D.C. Dominating the left side of the image is the Jefferson Memorial, notable for its large, round, classical architecture with a prominent dome and white marble columns. In the middle of the frame, the Washington Monument, a tall and slender obelisk, projects into the clear blue sky. To the right of the image, across the Tidal Basin, are large buildings that are part of the downtown area.\n\nThe body of water visible in the photograph is the Tidal Basin, known for its significance during the cherry blossom season. The viewer can see numerous cherry trees around the basin, some of which appear to be in bloom, adding dashes of pink to the landscape. This suggests the photo might have been taken in early spring. The surrounding areas are lush and green, indicating a well-maintained urban park environment. There are paths and roads winding through the areas around the Jefferson Memorial, and a few small boats are visible on the water, enhancing the scene's tranquility.\n\nOverall, the composition is well-balanced between natural beauty and architectural elegance, under a vast, unobstructed sky that suggests a serene, peaceful day. The elevation from which the photo is taken provides a broad, encompassing view of these landmarks and their environment, reflecting both a cultural and natural richness.","title":"Aerial view of the Jefferson Memorial","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546674","546585","546737","546577","546584","546570","547267","546692","546679","546717","547228","546741","546613","546693","547226","551137"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["landmark","marble","richness","blossom","elegance","basin","dome","pink","downtown","bloom"]}
