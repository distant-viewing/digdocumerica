{"path":"557682.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside an office-like environment, possibly at a publication or artistic workspace. In the photo, three individuals are engaged in different activities, seemingly focused on their tasks. The room appears to be well-lit with natural light streaming in from a large window which is adorned with long, light curtains. The window also has flowering plants on the sill, adding a touch of nature and color to the space.\n\nThe first individual, a woman seated on the left, is intricately engaged in what appears to be drawing or sketching onto a large piece of paper. She is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeve blouse and glasses, focusing intently on her work with a pen in hand.\n\nNext to her stands a man, perhaps reviewing or observing something he holds in his hand, which looks like a photograph or small piece of paper. He is in mid-length dark hair, wearing a darker polo shirt and lighter-colored pants. His attention is directed towards the item he is examining.\n\nThe third person, another woman, is seated at the end of the table, absorbed in writing or drawing. She is dressed in a striped, sleeveless top, contributing to an informal, creative feel of the setting. \n\nThe table is cluttered with various papers, files, and possibly magazines or drafts, signaling a busy, productive atmosphere. Beside the table, there are stacks of newspapers or publications bundled near what seems to be a file or storage cabinet.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a moment of creative endeavor or editorial work within a professional yet serene workshop environment.","title":"Office of the Helen Mountain Eagle, a monthly newspaper published in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555290","555233","551899","544318","546486","548864","548237","552387","546552","545083","546479","542690","557038","551897","555351","556754"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["paper","table","streaming","sill","drawing","magazine","writing","polo","cabinet","piece"]}
