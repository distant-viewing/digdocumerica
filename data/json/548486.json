{"path":"548486.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts a dynamic urban scene characterized by a striking juxtaposition between everyday street life and air travel. In the foreground, prominently displayed in the right side, there is a yellow traffic sign with black text reading \"DRIVE SLOW CHILDREN\" with the additional note \"B.I.P.D.\" at the bottom, likely referring to a local police department. The sign post is set against a clear blue sky.\n\nDominating the background, an airplane is captured in mid-flight, descending towards the lower left of the frame, suggesting proximity to an airport. The plane, a commercial airliner with a white and blue livery, adds a dramatic element to the scene, emphasizing the closeness of air traffic to residential areas.\n\nThe setting includes a row of traditional multi-story residential buildings lining a street. These homes feature bay windows, suggesting a neighborhood with older architectural styles. The buildings are densely packed, creating a corridor through which the street runs, further leading the eye towards the descending airplane.\n\nAdditional details such as power lines and a chain-link fence near the foreground signal the everyday nature of this urban landscape, contrasting sharply with the extraordinary closeness of the passing aircraft. Overall, the composition balances elements of routine urban life with the striking visual impact of air travel, framed beneath a serene sky.","title":"Lovell street homes in jet aircraft landing pattern","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553888","548485","548484","548446","548445","548447","548448","550156","548469","550160","546178","548487","544967","550153","547824","550126"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["closeness","airplane","air","descend","travel","street","traffic","refer","corridor","airport"]}
