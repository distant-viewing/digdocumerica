{"path":"543852.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph showcases a close-up view of young, slender green grass blades emerging from soil. The focus is sharply on two grass blades while softly blurred greenery extends in the background, suggesting a lush field or garden setting. Significantly, a human finger, appearing large due to the close perspective, gently touches one of the blades, indicating either a gesture of care or examination. The skin on the finger is detailed, with visible fingerprints and skin textures. The soil around the grass is finely textured and slightly clumpy, with small particles that underscore the delicacy of the new growth. The composition and shallow depth of field emphasize the interaction between human and nature, and the overall lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, providing a warm, illuminative quality to the scene.","title":"New plant growth (due to irrigation from the san miguel river)","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["544884","547312","552485","547287","553853","543622","557104","545069","557499","555184","549232","548060","542687","549251","542573","552688"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["blade","finger","skin","textur","grass","soil","examination","particle","field","underscore"]}
