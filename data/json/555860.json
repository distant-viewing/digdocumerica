{"path":"555860.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a landscape featuring a distinctive water body and its surrounding area. The body of water appears irregularly shaped, bendy and fragmented into several dark blue ponds, all enclosed by earth-toned embankments. The surrounding land displays variations in texture and color, indicating different types of surfaces such as dry, parched earth with patches of sparse vegetation, and traces of salt or mineral deposits that give some areas a whitish appearance.\n\nA prominent, curvy dirt road demarcates the outer boundary on one side, bending around the water body and echoing its shape. The terrain is cut through by tire tracks and paths indicating frequent vehicle movement. This site looks like it might be used for industrial or mining purposes, given the disturbed nature of the landscape and the apparent lack of residential or commercial structures.\n\nThe photograph is captured during daylight with good visibility, highlighting the contrasting natural colors of the earth, water, and sparse greenery. The lack of any human presence in the visible parts of the photograph lends an isolated and utilitarian feel to the scene.","title":"Aerial view of the five acre pond when the cleanup was half finished.  Straw bales and oil booms were used to separate the oil and acid water for pumping, neutralization and trucking to another site.
