{"path":"548541.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a lively beach scene where several people are seen enjoying a sunny day by the seaside. The beach is populated with a mix of individuals and groups, both seated and lying down, predominantly wearing swimsuits which suggests a warm climate suitable for beach activities.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several groups of people seated on beach towels. One woman, distinctively dressed in a white swim top, is seated on a chair facing the camera, engaging in conversation with a person lying on a towel beside her. Another group is engaged in interaction with each other, a blend of people seated and lying down. There are various beach-oriented items scattered around such as towels, bags, and a red inflatable device.\n\nToward the center of the image, the beach becomes slightly more crowded with people. Some individuals are involved in activities like playing or interacting with others in smaller circles.\n\nThe back section of the beach has more people standing and walking around, interspersed between palm trees that provide partial shade. On the far right background, closer to the edge of the beach, there is a vivid display of tropical flora in red and green colors, adding a vibrant contrast to the sandy beach. Behind this greenery, a rustic structure or wall can be observed, suggesting the presence of local architecture just beyond the beach area. \n\nOverall, the setting conveys a relaxed and leisurely atmosphere, characteristic of a beachside holiday destination with people soaking in the sun and enjoying casual conversations and activities in a tropical setting.","title":"Palm-shaded beach at the southernmost point of the united states","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["550931","547491","546794","550932","547503","547628","553685","546942","547482","547507","553683","553686","550919","546874","550936","547680"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","towel","people","lie","seat","group","soak","conversation","enjoy","holiday"]}
