{"path":"554872.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a candid scene involving a group of individuals, likely in a casual outdoor setting during the 1970s, judging from the clothing and hairstyles. Five people are visible, with one partially out of frame in the foreground. \n\nStarting from the left, a young man with shoulder-length wavy blonde hair and a blue denim shirt looks aside, smiling and seemingly in conversation. Next to him, a smaller boy with a cheeky grin sports a white T-shirt emblazoned with \"Boston Red Sox\" and a graphic print, standing next to a motorcycle. Next is another young man with curly mane, adjusting his eyewear, dressed in a red plaid shirt and jeans, also attentive to the conversation.\n\nIn the center-right, the most prominently featured person is a youth leaning on a motorcycle, facing directly towards the camera. He has medium-length curly hair, wears aviator sunglasses and a black \"Harley-Davidson\" T-shirt. He displays a demeanor of confidence and focus, possibly engaging the out-of-frame individual.\n\nIn the blurry foreground, the back and shoulder of another person are visible, suggesting the photo might be taken in a casual, spontaneous setting.\n\nThe background showcases a rural or semi-rural environment with a wooden shed and a classic 1960s sedan (parked car), surrounded by trees and a sparse landscape, which contributes to a serene, laid-back atmosphere typical of a gathering or pause during a road trip.","title":"Motorcyclist loading his possession on a truck with the help of his friends at Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554875","556206","558193","546993","554871","548303","554178","554876","554852","551301","554877","554481","555906","551383","554898","543856"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["motorcycle","shoulder","length","shirt","mane","conversation","youth","hair","start","hairstyle"]}
