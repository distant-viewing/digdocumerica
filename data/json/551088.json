{"path":"551088.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial or post-disaster wreckage. It shows a large pile of rubble, including twisted metal bars, broken wooden planks, and other debris. The scene is smoke-filled, indicating either recent fire activity or ongoing smoldering. The smoke is thick, adding a hazy, almost eerie atmosphere to the image.\n\nIn the foreground, there's an individual wearing what appears to be workwear, including a helmet, standing near an open flame and burning debris. This person is looking away from the camera and seems to be surveying the damage or possibly managing the fire. Around the fire, there are various discarded items, such as barrels and damaged equipment.\n\nThe background features obscured trees and foliage, suggesting that this location might be at the edge of an industrial area or near a forest, potentially increasing the complexity and danger of the situation due to fire risks.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is grim and somber, reflecting the destruction and the possibly arduous task of clean-up or recovery ahead. The color tone, dominated by grays and the red of fire amid the blue-hued smoke, further intensifies the dramatic impact of the scene.","title":"Raleigh Junk Company, a large scrap metal operation on the Kanawha River at Riverside","placename":"Charleston (W.
