{"path":"547310.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows an outdoor scene on a sunny day in a small town setting. In the foreground, dominating the image, is an older man walking towards the camera in the middle of a dusty, gravel-lined street. He wears a military-style cap, a dark buttoned-up jacket, and jeans, giving him a casual yet somewhat official appearance. His shadow is prominently cast on the gravel road, suggesting the sun is high and behind him.\n\nThe background features rural, low-rise buildings that appear somewhat dated and slightly worn, characteristic of a small-town environment. There's a mix of buildings, including what appears to be a commercial establishment with an advertisement or sign, as well as residential houses with trees nearby, making the area look lived-in and established.\n\nThe street is nearly empty except for a few parked cars and a van on the sides, which implies a quiet, possibly slow-paced community. Overhead lines slightly criss-cross the blue, clear sky, adding to the typical small-town Americana vibe of the setting. The light and shadows create a stark contrast, particularly accentuating the textures of the gravel road and the silhouettes cast by the man and other objects.","title":"Charlie Gross, former truck driver, farmer, boxer, dog raiser and salesman, has lived more than half his long life in Nebraska.
