{"path":"546391.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This is a high-angle aerial photograph depicting a coastal industrial and residential scene. On the coast, there is an expansive industrial plant with several large tanks and tall, narrow buildings emitting white smoke into the air, indicating active production. These industrial structures are situated beside a body of water, possibly a river, flowing towards the coast.\n\nAdjacent to the industrial complex, to the right in the photograph, is a densely populated residential area comprising numerous small houses aligned along a narrow road running parallel to the shoreline. This road delineates the residential area from the beach along the ocean. The houses have varying roof colors and are surrounded by abundant greenery, giving a congested yet inhabited feel.\n\nOn the left side of the image, the industrial facility extends with its large tanks and infrastructure. There's a parking lot visible with several cars, suggesting the operation scale and workforce involvement. The geographical setting includes lush green landscapes bordering the industrial site, likely flat lands or fields stretching back towards the horizon.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts industrial development with residential life, juxtaposed against the natural beauty of the coastal and green field surroundings, illustrating the interaction between human habitation, industrial activity, and nature.\n","title":"Industrial area","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["543000","552196","552191","551607","557464","552193","551174","551606","553968","550706","549495","551566","552245","550866","555769","551574"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["coast","tank","delineate","house","involvement","field","production","comprise","habitation","road"]}
