{"path":"545493.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a young man engaged in an outdoor activity, seemingly a hike in a forested area. The man, who appears to be in his 20s, is wearing a white short-sleeved T-shirt and glasses. He has dark, straight, shoulder-length hair and is also wearing a large backpack equipped with external frames, typical of the hiking gear used in past decades.\n\nThe backpack is notable for its striped pattern in shades of green, white, and black, and there are items tied to its exterior, hinting at preparedness for an extended outing. The subject is shown touching a small tree or bush that has clusters of white flowers, possibly observing or studying the plant. His expression and posture suggest a moment of concentration or admiration for the natural surroundings.\n\nBehind the main subject, there is another person visible faintly in the distance. This second individual appears to be walking away and is also outfitted for hiking, contributing to the inference that they are part of a group participating in an outdoor excursion.\n\nThe setting is lush and green, with dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, illuminating spots along the forest floor and on the figures. The dense foliage, composed of numerous shades of green, and the forest floor strewn with leaves and small plants create a serene and isolated atmosphere, emphasizing the beauty of the natural environment they are exploring. This context suggests an immersive experience in nature, likely focused on environmental observation or forest hiking.","title":"GASP (Greater Alliance to Stop Pollution) organized a weekend trip to Bankhead National Forest as part of the campaign to oppose clear-cutting here.
