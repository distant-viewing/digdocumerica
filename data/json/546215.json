{"path":"546215.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a woman sitting in the shade provided by an old van converted into a makeshift living or vending space. The van is parked in a dusty, sunlit area with some trees and greenery in the background, suggesting a somewhat rural or undeveloped setting.\n\nThe van itself is white and appears to be customized or adapted for alternative use. The side door of the van is wide open, with a colorful curtain hanging from the doorway, partially obscuring the interior. Various items, possibly household goods or clothes for sale, including shirts, are hanging on the side of the van. The woman is seated inside the van's open space, wearing a patterned bikini which aligns with a warm, sunny climate.\n\nHer pose is relaxed; she is sitting with her arms loosely resting on her knees, and she looks contemplatively off to the side. Near the van, there are signs of temporary habitation or storage, such as bags and miscellaneous items scattered around the ground. The setting and arrangement hint at a transient lifestyle or an impromptu roadside vendor setup. The presence of what appears to be a walking stick suggests she might use it for mobility or it could be an item for sale or use in the van. \n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of makeshift living and resourcefulness, set in a location that experiences warm weather, possibly near a beach or in a rural area where the van serves multiple purposes of living and commerce.","title":"Campers at garner state park","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["554182","548802","545594","557130","546186","556800","548306","548668","548958","545316","557129","548796","548804","549058","548698","548669"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["van","sale","makeshift","living","item","impromptu","hang","mobility","bikini","good"]}
