{"path":"555258.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This image shows two men interacting in a laboratory environment. The man on the left is dressed in a dark suit and overcoat with a light-colored shirt and darker tie. He appears to be observing the actions of the second man. This other man, who is on the right, is wearing a white lab coat, glasses, and is balding. He is intently looking at some paperwork that he is holding, which appears to contain data or notes.\n\nIn the hands of the man in the lab coat is a large clear plastic bag filled with a liquid substance; the bag looks like it is marked with some type of label or writing. The surrounding area gives the impression of a well-equipped laboratory, with shelves stocked with various bottles and containers, some labeled with hazard symbols. In the foreground, there is a cluttered workspace containing more laboratory material such as bags of chemicals and packets, office supplies like papers and a typewriter.\n\nThe image has a vintage quality, likely indicating an era when darker wood cabinets and metal file cabinets were common in such settings. The attention to detail and presence of multiple chemical labels suggest this could be a chemical or pharmaceutical laboratory. The interaction seems focused and professional, with the central activity being the examination or transfer of chemical substances and associated data.","title":"An environmental protection agency laboratory technician receives pesticides samples from an inspector who gathered the material at the port of Newark, New Jersey.
