{"path":"554409.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph presents a beautiful natural scene of a waterfall surrounded by lush greenery. The waterfall itself cascades over a series of rocky steps, creating two main tiers that are clearly visible. The upper tier is narrower and pours down into a wider ledge before dropping off into the larger, more pronounced second tier.\n\nThe water flows spiritedly over the rocks, generating a lively splash and spray that highlights the dynamic movement of the water through the rugged terrain. The surrounding flora is densely packed around the waterfall, with various shades of green and leaf shapes suggesting a rich biodiversity. The trees and plants are dense and provide a shaded canopy around the waterfall, enhancing the secluded and serene atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe sunlight appears to break through the foliage in places, creating patches of bright light and dark shadows, which adds contrast and depth to the scene. This gives the viewer a sense of the natural texture and complexity of the environment. The rocks at the base of the waterfall are mossy and wet, indicating a moist, cool climate typical of woodland areas with abundant water resources.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the tranquility and pristine beauty of a hidden waterfall within a forest, emphasizing themes of natural beauty and serenity.","title":"Rock falls in macintyre brook near algonquin peak trail","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554408","545878","558087","555073","555210","555220","557820","542594","550979","545874","545839","544456","543578","544340","543869","544348"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","tier","pronounce","biodiversity","drop","pour","cascade","pristine","generate","ledge"]}
