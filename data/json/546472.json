{"path":"546472.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features an architectural structure that is distinctive due to its sharply angled, peaked roof, reminiscent of a chapel or a modern interpretation of a church bell tower. The building is predominantly dark, possibly made of dark wood or cladded in dark material, and has a large triangular form with smaller triangular cutouts, creating an illusion of layered, geometric design.\n\nThe structure is framed by numerous trees in the foreground, which appear to be in early or late spring since the leaves are sparse and small, allowing the architecture to be partially visible through the branches. The trees on either side of the image have a lighter, possibly greenish-yellow foliage.\n\nThe sky in the background is overcast, providing a soft light and a slightly gloomy atmosphere. The composition utilizes natural elements to partially obscure and create a mysterious aura around the architectural structure, drawing attention and curiosity to its design and function. The ground is not distinctly visible, but the general ambiance suggests a tranquil, possibly secluded environment, emphasizing the architecture as the focal point of this setting.","title":"First baptist church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546468","546480","546473","546463","546476","546481","546469","546484","556644","548649","546542","546464","542593","543587","546451","557327"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["interpretation","bell","aura","architecture","curiosity","church","utilize","design","function","spring"]}
