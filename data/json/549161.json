{"path":"549161.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural setting with a prominent sign in the foreground, welcoming visitors to Colstrip. The sign reads \"WELCOME COLSTRIP HELP KEEP OUR TOWN CLEAN\" and has a small additional sign listing \"FOUNTAIN HOURS 2:30 - 9:30 P.M. EXCEPT SATURDAY.\" The sign, painted black with white lettering, shows some signs of weathering and is supported by metal posts. \n\nIn the background, a vast open landscape with rolling hills can be seen. It appears rural and somewhat industrial. Notably, there is a large mining headframe (a structure over a mine shaft) visible, indicating mining activity in the area. This structure is metallic and industrial in appearance, situated among other smaller buildings that look functional and utilitarian, typical of a mining operation setup.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is grassy with wildflowers and there is a fence visible behind the sign, possibly delineating property boundaries. The sky above is mostly clear with a few clouds, suggesting a fair weather day. \n\nOverall, the scene captures a mix of welcoming civic pride with the ruggedness of an industrial mining town.","title":"Strip-mining spoil piles in background.
