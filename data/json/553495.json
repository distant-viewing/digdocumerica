{"path":"553495.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures a young child sitting on a small red and white tricycle in an outdoor setting that appears neglected and littered with debris. The child, who looks to be a young boy with light-colored, messy hair, is wearing a patterned shirt and blue jeans. He appears to be gazing upward, possibly at something out of frame, with a thoughtful or distracted expression.\n\nThe ground surrounding the child is covered in various pieces of trash, including discarded papers, bottles, a large white bucket, and other random debris, suggesting a neglected urban or park environment. In the background, there is a darkened area shaded by trees, and partially visible is a tilted, empty park bench, hinting at a public space that is poorly maintained.\n\nThe lighting in the image casts shadows, indicating that the photograph might have been taken in the late afternoon. The overall mood conveyed by the image is somewhat somber, highlighting a contrast between the innocence of the child and the decrepit state of his surroundings. The color saturation and style suggest that this could be an older photograph.","title":"The Watkins of Mulky Square, a family of eleven, live in the 1600 block of Madison Street, a few blocks from the area being cleared for I-635.
