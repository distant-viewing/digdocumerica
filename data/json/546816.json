{"path":"546816.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph features an industrial or possibly semi-urban landscape dominated by wreckage and derelict vehicles. At the forefront of the image, numerous cars, trucks, and buses in various states of disrepair are scattered across a dirt field, suggesting a junkyard or a similar area designated for vehicle disposal. These vehicles include sedans, pickup trucks, and at least one yellow school bus, all noticeably rusted, and aged, with a mix of faded paint colors.\n\nBehind this collection of vehicles, the scene expands into a more open field bordered by a highway. The highway appears busy, with several cars visible on the road. Framing the top of the photograph are several large billboards, featuring colorful advertising. One prominent billboard includes an illustration of a deer drinking from a clear pond with the text \"Refreshes naturally!\", indicating an advertisement for Salem cigarettes. Other billboard advertisements are visible but less discernible.\n\nIn the background, the skyline reveals a mix of residential and industrial buildings, denoting the outskirts of a city or a heavily developed area. This urban backdrop coupled with the commercial billboards contrasts starkly with the decrepit and abandoned state of the vehicles in the foreground. The overall composition of the image captures a narrative of neglect against a backdrop of bustling city life and consumerism, emphasized by the omnipresent advertising.","title":"Abandoned vehicles alongside the Baltimore-Washington Parkway","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["544060","545295","542590","545365","545340","552073","552999","552043","555492","543166","543680","546268","553009","555869","546249","547152"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["billboard","vehicle","advertising","advertisement","bus","highway","state","truck","illustration","junkyard"]}
