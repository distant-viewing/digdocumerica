{"path":"546279.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a person's hands while they are shucking oysters. The person is wearing dirty, protective gloves and is holding an open oyster shell, showing the oyster inside. The shell is being placed into or taken out of a clear glass jar that already contains some oyster meat. Several other open and closed oyster shells are visible on the wooden surface around the jar, indicating an ongoing process of shucking. The background is blurred but suggests an outdoor setting with natural light, which could possibly be near a body of water. The focus and framing emphasize the action of handling and extracting the oyster, highlighting the texture and detail of the oysters and the rough condition of the gloves.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory personnel aboard the EPA vessel Dolphin have taken these oysters from the waters of East Bay and Escambia Bay.
