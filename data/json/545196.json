{"path":"545196.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a woman standing in a vast desert landscape. The woman is in profile, captured as she looks through a large photography lens, focusing on something in the distance. She has long dark hair that falls loosely around her shoulders, and she wears a sleeveless top and shorts, suited to a warm environment.\n\nThe setting is a desert, characterized by gentle sloping dunes with ripples in the sand indicative of wind action. The sand appears fine and is a rich golden-orange color, suggesting it might be late afternoon or near sunset given the warm tones and soft shadows cast by the dunes.\n\nThe color palette of the image is mostly warm hues of orange and brown, contrasting with the blue of the woman's top. The sky is not clearly visible as the frame focuses primarily on the sand and the woman. The overall atmosphere is serene and isolated, emphasizing the vastness of the desert and the solitude of the setting.","title":"Looking across the dunes","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["544946","544321","549037","547717","545300","545755","545199","545575","545843","545771","550490","548230","552923","545789","548906","552897"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["dune","desert","sand","woman","orange","lens","photography","top","profile","wind"]}
