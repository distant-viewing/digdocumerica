{"path":"545898.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photo captures a serene and picturesque natural scene. The focal point of the image is a deer, positioned in the center. The deer is seen from behind, with its head turned slightly to its right, offering a clear view of its profile. It appears to be alert and curious about its environment.\n\nThe deer is nestled among rocks and scrub brush, typical of a rugged, mountainous terrain. To the right of the photo, there is a prominent yucca plant, its spiky leaves silhouetted against the sky, adding a textural contrast to the softer outlines of the deer and the rocks.\n\nIn the background, a softly focused mountain can be seen, bathed in a blue hue that suggests either early morning or late evening light. The sky is clear, suggesting a serene time of day, probably dawn or dusk, which is known for wildlife being more active.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is one of peacefulness and natural beauty, captured in a moment where human presence seems distant. The composition skillfully uses silhouette and soft focus to emphasize the simplicity and tranquility of the scene.","title":"Mule deer.
