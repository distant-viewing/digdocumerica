{"path":"554860.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures two men, each wearing a cowboy hat, in a moment of conversation or observation. Both men are dressed in button-up shirts and the older man on the left side is wearing a jacket as well. The setting appears to be a rural or farm-like environment, which is further suggested by the presence of a weathered wooden structure and a metal gate in front of which they stand.\n\nThe older man on the left is leaning slightly onto the gate, looking forward with a contemplative expression, while the younger man on the right stands close to him, also looking in the same direction, possibly listening or focusing on what the older man is observing or saying. Behind them, a part of a dusty white truck is visible.\n\nThe background shows a glimpse of rustic life with wooden sheds and partial views of vehicles and wooden fencing, creating a composition that indicates a working environment, likely a farm. The sunlight appears bright and harsh, possibly indicating a warm day, casting shadows and highlighting the textures of their hats and shirts.","title":"Father and son who own one of the ranches in the Leakey Texas, and San Antonio area watch as sheep are sheared","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["557042","544349","546068","557145","557043","552581","554925","554026","543849","549292","549198","554922","553114","547679","554938","549120"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["gate","man","farm","fencing","say","hat","listen","observation","shed","button"]}
