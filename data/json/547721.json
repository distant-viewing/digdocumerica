{"path":"547721.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a silhouette of a person, possibly a pilot or crew member, standing behind a large, cloud-making machine aboard an aircraft. The image is set against a vibrant sky filled with fluffy, dense clouds, likely seen from above. The tones in the sky suggest either early morning or late afternoon, providing a dramatic and almost moody atmosphere. The person's figure is darkened against the light background, with details obscured due to the backlighting, emphasizing their outline rather than specific features or clothing.\n\nThe main focus of the image appears to be the interaction of technology with nature, as the machinery features prominently. This machinery includes metallic structures, visible wires, and parts of the aircraftâ€™s frame. The overall composition, with the foreground dominated by the dark silhouettes of both the person and the equipment, contrasts starkly with the ethereal and lighter cloud formations in the background, creating a powerful and thought-provoking scene.","title":"Crop duster plane over the Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548841","542577","544491","553623","554421","553621","542499","553649","544606","542496","556185","554042","557310","552250","553873","544131"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["aircraft","cloud","person","pilot","silhouette","machinery","backlighting","crew","member","technology"]}
