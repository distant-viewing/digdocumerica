{"path":"546455.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene rural landscape with a unique church in the center. The church is characterized by its dramatic, steeply pitched roof crowned with a tall, slender spire that reaches upward, piercing the sky. The architecture of the church is somewhat modernist, with its sharply angled lines and simple structural elements.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a field lush with greenery and wildflowers, creating a vibrant carpet of yellow and green under the soft light of early evening or late afternoon. This pastoral setting is framed by an assortment of trees that dot the landscape, some with dense foliage and others more sparsely adorned with leaves, suggesting it might be in a transition season such as early spring or late autumn.\n\nThe background is illuminated by a subtly bright sky, hinting at a setting or rising sun, which casts gentle hues across the scene. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of tranquility and natural beauty, enhanced by the absence of any visible human activity or modern distractions. The composition balances elements of nature with the architectural feature of the church, offering a view that is both aesthetically pleasing and contemplative.","title":"North Christian Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["554035","556480","557952","550287","547346","546463","554207","558024","557088","547440","547343","554033","558023","546466","547333","550376"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["church","distraction","carpet","spire","assortment","wildflower","absence","yellow","autumn","transition"]}
