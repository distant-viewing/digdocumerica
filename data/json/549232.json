{"path":"549232.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph displays an expansive view of a natural grassland or meadow, richly populated with a variety of wild grasses and flowering plants. The scene captures a vibrant interplay of colors and textures, predominantly in shades of green interspersed with hints of yellow and brown.\n\nThe focus of the image is on the grassy vegetation, which varies remarkably in height and type. The foreground features clusters of small, delicate flowers grouped tightly together, presenting a soft beige or pale pink color. These are surrounded by taller grass strands, some of which bow under their own weight, creating natural arcs within the composition.\n\nThe grasses are of different species, indicated by their varying stalk structures and leaf shapes. Some have thin, wiry stems while others are broader and flat. The meadow also includes some taller plants with yellow flowers that punctuate the greenery with small bursts of color.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it might be midday, as the sunlight appears to be direct and bright, casting minimal shadows and illuminating the translucent qualities of the grass blades. The overall atmosphere is one of wild, unmanaged growth, typical of a natural meadow environment.\n\nThe background is a continuation of this dense vegetation and further helps in setting a distinct ecological context, perhaps indicative of a temperate climate zone. There is no visible sky, human presence, or artificial structures, emphasizing the pristine and untouched nature of the scene.","title":"Virgin prairie grass near Colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["557191","544884","551370","557098","549251","557189","557104","556990","545069","553084","549158","557499","549229","547924","544581","544439"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["meadow","grass","flower","arc","strand","burst","stalk","weight","continuation","blade"]}
