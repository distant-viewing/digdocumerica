{"path":"549946.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts a landfill scene with a large accumulation of trash spread across the area, surrounded by wooded hills in the background, creating a contrasting natural backdrop to the man-made waste. In the foreground and midground, there are various types of garbage including pieces of paper, plastics, and other discarded materials in a variety of colors and conditions, suggesting a mix of residential and possibly commercial waste.\n\nA large, heavy-duty piece of yellow machinery—a bulldozer or compactor—is actively working on the site. It's equipped with a large front blade and is currently engaged in moving or compressing the garbage, illustrating an ongoing process of waste management. The machine is soiled, indicating frequent use in such an environment.\n\nAdditionally, there are several seagulls flying above and wandering around the garbage, scavenging for food. This highlights the landfill as an ecosystem where certain wildlife has adapted to thrive on human waste.\n\nThe overall scene portrays the environmental impact of human consumption and the ongoing efforts required to manage waste effectively, set against the natural beauty of the forested hills, which starkly contrasts with the pollution and degradation in the foreground. This composition may evoke thoughts on sustainability, pollution, and the intersecting processes of nature and civilization.","title":"Covering garbage with one foot of earth at Westchester County's croton landfill operation","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549745","543828","549936","549737","546246","549741","546238","549754","548210","550256","549943","546235","543821","549953","550252","543832"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","garbage","landfill","compactor","pollution","civilization","sustainability","consumption","piece","seagull"]}
