{"path":"552514.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene featuring two buildings and a sign. On the left, a dark brown or black building displays two noticeable signboards. The larger sign, attached to the side of the building, promotes the \"Joy In Christ Jesus Center\" with a schedule noting meetings on Monday and Wednesday. Below this, there is a smaller poster featuring a group of men in uniform, perhaps a promotional or recruitment poster, that emphasizes unity, teamwork, and professionalism.\n\nAdjacent to this building is the \"Swansea Village Hall,\" which is a brick structure painted in a light cream or white color. It features simple, classic architectural details with a small entrance portico supported by brackets and a modest overhang. The sign above the entrance clearly identifies the building.\n\nBetween these two buildings at the foreground, there's a sizable, rectangular object that appears to be an electrical box or a utility service of some sort. The ground shows some scattered greenery and blooming small flowers, suggesting this photo was taken in spring or summer.\n\nThe vibe of the photograph is a mix of municipal and community life, showcasing local governance and community activities side-by-side in a small-town setting. The overall ambiance is quiet and orderly, typical of a residential neighborhood.","title":"Church and town hall in Swansea","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["552460","552469","557156","554781","556564","558032","544882","558030","558099","558029","552963","550031","548245","556182","556047","552509"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["poster","entrance","building","signboard","unity","professionalism","bracket","schedule","overhang","sign"]}
