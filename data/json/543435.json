{"path":"543435.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning aerial view of a coastal landscape. The scene is marked by the striking interaction between the rugged coastline and the ocean. On the left, the coastline has sharply jagged cliffs that meet the deep blue of the ocean. The waves are visibly crashing against these rocks, creating a dynamic interaction between land and water.\n\nThe terrain is undulating, with varying elevations. Hills and mountains, covered with a mix of green vegetation, dominate the landscape. These hills seem to roll down towards the sea, suggesting a natural flow that leads from the land to the water.\n\nA winding road, likely a coastal highway, traverses the landscape. This road hugs the contours of the coastline and the hills, offering scenic views of the ocean. The road is visible as a thin, snaking line cutting across the terrain, showcasing human presence and accessibility in this otherwise natural setting.\n\nIn terms of lighting, the photograph appears to be taken during the day with ample sunlight illuminating the scene. The lighting accentuates the topography's textures and colors, from the lush greens of the vegetation to the rocky browns and the ocean's varying blue tones.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph provides a panoramic view that highlights the dramatic and natural beauty of a heavily indented shoreline, enhanced by human infrastructure.\n\n\n","title":"Road runs along coast","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543328","543424","543300","543430","553910","545934","543297","543427","543434","545226","543085","553774","543433","543289","557453","543184"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["ocean","coastline","hill","road","accessibility","land","topography","term","elevation","interaction"]}
