{"path":"543954.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This is a vibrant and bustling photograph set on a river dock. The image captures a scene featuring two large riverboats, which are main focal points of the composition. The boat on the left is named \"Delta Queen,\" evidenced by the bold lettering across its side, and it appears to be packed with passengers. The second boat, similar in style with multiple decks, is filled with people as well, and it is docking at the pier.\n\nOn the dock, there is a considerable number of people, both passengers potentially waiting to board and others just milling around or watching the boats. Some people are descending the gangplank of the nearer boat. The attire of the individuals suggests a casual, possibly touristic environment.\n\nIn the background, a large bridge spans the river, featuring a complex network of steel trusses, adding an industrial feel to the scene. The sky above is partially cloudy, casting a dynamic and somewhat dramatic lighting over the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere captured in this photograph is one of lively activity and leisure, typical of a busy river port catering to passenger boats.","title":"Paddle wheel steamboats, docked at the new Louisville waterfront on the Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543972","543964","543960","545917","543966","549509","549910","543935","545921","550825","547838","554657","549541","548179","551147","546839"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","passenger","dock","riverboat","river","cate","descend","bold","truss","people"]}
