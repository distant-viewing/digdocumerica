{"path":"552127.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures a water body, likely a river or estuarine area, with visible pollution. The foreground prominently features dark water strewn with debris, including branches, leaves, and miscellaneous trash such as pieces of plastic and small unidentified objects. The water's edge is cluttered with litter and organic material, giving it a neglected and polluted appearance.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a thick growth of green vegetation descending towards the water, which seems to be overgrown, indicating a lack of maintenance. In the same area, partially submerged and tilted, there is wreckage that appears to be parts of small boats or docks, decaying and covered with algae and filth.\n\nThe background of the scene shows a contrasting scenario with industrial activities. Visible are docked ships and cranes, suggesting this area might be near a port or industrial sector. The presence of large industrial structures emphasizes the interaction between natural waterways and human industrial activity, possibly highlighting environmental impact concerns.\n","title":"Debris in Duwamish River and along its bank","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["550812","552046","547524","544810","551560","547626","547907","552811","550352","548741","547897","547537","546116","547493","544175","555784"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["sector","wreckage","algae","litter","port","scenario","concern","water","plastic","lack"]}
