{"path":"555061.jpg","date":"July 1971","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up shot of a single daisy. The flower has a bright yellow center surrounded by white petals, several of which are slightly wilted or bent. Set against a stark, black background, the daisyâ€™s vivid colors are highlighted, making the flower pop visually in the image. The focus is sharp on the flower, especially on the central disc of the flower and the base of the petals, promoting a detailed view of its texture and form. The absence of distractions in the background places all visual emphasis on the daisy itself.","title":"Spider on a daisy in a meadow edged by forest in a private forest preserve on Green Mountain in Kitsap County, Washington near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545699","557487","547815","542969","543197","555189","543596","554840","544579","557167","554586","543623","555033","544875","549230","554580"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["daisy","flower","petal","distraction","pop","emphasis","absence","shot","base","place"]}
