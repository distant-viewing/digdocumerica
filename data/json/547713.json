{"path":"547713.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a silhouette of a person shown in profile, engaged in the activity of handling a net. The figure appears to be bending or stooping over while examining or manipulating the net, which is delicately held by the hands. The net itself is detailed, with intricate mesh patterns highlighted by tiny flecks of light that seem to glimmer against the darker background.\n\nThe background is minimally detailed due to the focus and lighting, predominantly characterized by a deep blue or black color, with an illuminated backdrop possibly signifying a dusk or dawn sky. This soft light from behind creates a bright halo effect around the figure, emphasizing the outline and form of the person against the darker environment.\n\nOverall, the composition uses backlighting effectively to create a dramatic and artistic silhouette, emphasizing the contours and actions of the person, while the specifics of the individual and the surrounding environment remain obscured, creating an atmosphere of mystery and focus on the task at hand.","title":"California fish and game biologist checks gill nets placed in the Colorado river.
