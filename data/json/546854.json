{"path":"546854.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban decay and pollution, likely near a body of water. The foreground prominently displays an array of garbage and debris soaked and scattered on what looks like a paved surface. Among the debris, there are crumpled and waterlogged cardboard boxes including one clearly marked \"DEFECTIVE\", suggesting discarded industrial materials. Furthermore, there's an old, black metal sewing machine set on the ground adding an unexpected and out-of-context element to the scene.\n\nIn the background, a long, wooden building stretches horizontally across the image. This structure, which has a dark, weathered appearance and vertical siding, is built directly adjacent to water, appearing as though it is a pier or dockside warehouse. Some graffiti is visible on its side reaffirming the neglected condition of the area.\n\nA simple, white railing runs parallel to the building, separating the walking area from the water, enhancing the sense of location next to a river or lake. The entire scene is under an overcast sky, contributing to the gloomy and abandoned atmosphere of the setting. There's also a visible accumulation of small water puddles, indicating recent rain or an ongoing issue with water drainage in the area. This photograph evokes a strong sense of neglect and environmental concern.","title":"Street trash near Baltimore harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["549307","547907","547582","547622","547626","546913","546785","551985","551559","551562","550352","546822","549786","548357","544810","547897"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["neglect","waterlog","soak","drainage","separa","crumple","water","gloomy","paved","graffito"]}
