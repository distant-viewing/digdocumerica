{"path":"550212.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat neglected landscape, which includes both natural and human elements. In the foreground, there is a sign mounted on a post that reads: \"THIS LAGOON, KNOWN POPULARLY AS THE WHITE CITY LAGOON, HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS A BIRD AND WILDLIFE SANCTUARY. YOUR COOPERATION IN PROTECTING THE WILDLIFE FOUND HERE, AS ELSEWHERE, IS SINCERELY REQUESTED. THE CLEVELAND AUDUBON SOCIETY APRIL, 1964\". This sign is slightly worn, suggesting it has been exposed to weather elements for some time.\n\nBehind the sign, the ground appears somewhat barren and muddy, with patches of grass and a few puddles reflecting the lack of maintenance. There are scattered pieces of debris and rubbish around, which juxtaposes the sign's plea for protection and preservation of the environment.\n\nIn the middle ground, two people can be seen standing near what looks like a shoreline. They appear to be engaged in a conversation or possibly observing the area.\n\nThe background of the photo reveals a body of water, presumably part of the lagoon mentioned on the sign. There are more trees and greenery in the distance across the water, and some industrial or residential structures can be seen further away, adding layers to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a moment that reflects human interaction with a natural, yet somewhat urban environment. The image conveys a sense of neglect or oversight despite the intentions for wildlife and environmental preservation, indicated by the sign.","title":"Unauthorized use as a dump has turned this lake erie lagoon a designated sanctuary since 1964, into a breeding ground for rodents","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544813","550276","550258","558000","547520","547865","555382","554534","547893","558003","550280","547512","547925","547992","545517","544621"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["preservation","sign","neglected","lagoon","cooperation","rubbish","mention","protection","puddle","protect"]}
