{"path":"548473.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, tree-lined urban street viewed from an elevated vantage point. The scene captures a residential area characterized by two rows of lush, green trees that provide a soothing canopy over the street. The road gently curves around, flanked on both sides by rows of parked cars from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s based on their design.\n\nThe area is moderately busy with a few people visible: one individual is crossing the street, while another appears to be walking along the sidewalk. The architecture along the street features older, well-maintained row houses with visible stoops and large windows, suggestive of a neighborhood with historical significance or preservation.\n\nThe foreground presents a small park or green space, adding a sense of community and open space to the urban environment. The warm sunlight filtering through the trees casts dappled shadows on the cars and street, enhancing the peaceful, almost idyllic quality of the urban setting. There is a direct sense of lived-in calmness, with the environment well-integrated between natural and man-made elements.","title":"Once neptune road led to wood island park and the sea.
