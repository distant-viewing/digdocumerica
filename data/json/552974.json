{"path":"552974.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a serene lakeside scene dominated by a calm expanse of water and a backdrop of majestic snow-capped mountains. In the foreground, there is a wooden pier featuring a small, quaint hut with a sloped roof at the end. The pier is built with rows of wooden poles and planks, and it extends into the lake from the left side of the frame creating a peaceful, isolated feeling.\n\nThe lake is vast, with its surface reflecting a muted blue tone, possibly due to the early morning or late afternoon light. Beyond the pier, the lake stretches toward the horizon, meeting a series of layered mountain ranges that rise dramatically in the background. The mountains are covered in snow, suggesting a cold climate or a high altitude location.\n\nFurther in the distance, another similar pier can be seen protruding into the lake, and it appears to be accompanied by a few smaller docks or structures related to water-related activities such as boating or fishing.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its tranquil water, the solitary hut on the pier, and the towering, snow-capped mountains, conveys a sense of tranquility and the grandeur of nature. It is likely taken during a time of day when the light is soft, adding to the peaceful and almost ethereal quality of the scene.","title":"The trouble with lake tahoe, on the ca-nv border, is that most everyone who has ever seen it wants to live there.
