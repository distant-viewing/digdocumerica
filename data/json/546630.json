{"path":"546630.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene featuring two men and vehicles, highlighted by a prominent red siren light in the foreground which is slightly out of focus. One of the men is wearing a dark uniform, resembling that of a police officer, with a cap and glasses, and is engaging with the other man dressed in a casual dark jacket and hat. They appear to be in the middle of a conversation or interaction, possibly near a parked police vehicle indicated by the siren light.\n\nIn the background, a city bus and several vintage cars indicate an urban setting. The vehicles suggest the era could be around the 1960s or 1970s. The street is lined with trees, and there are traffic lights and street lamps visible. The overall lighting is somewhat dim, possibly indicating overcast weather or early evening time.\n\nThe depth of field used in this photograph brings attention to the two men and the siren, while the background and foreground remain slightly blurred, emphasizing the interaction between the figures and their immediate environment. This scene offers a glimpse into a routine yet distinctive moment on a city street.","title":"Blocked intersection calls down officer's wrath","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546661","557854","549932","554293","546743","545351","551941","555461","547706","554309","555782","549851","549853","546635","548369","548388"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["police","street","vehicle","man","officer","lamps","city","parked","bring","interaction"]}
