{"path":"544401.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged desert landscape under a clear blue sky. The foreground features textured, cracked dry earth and scattered fragments of rock. Among these, a prominent, jagged piece of wood lies close to the camera, drawing the viewer's eye. Moving towards the middle ground, the terrain rises slightly and becomes rockier.\n\nIn the center and slightly to the back of the composition, the photograph showcases distinctive geological formations composed of layered sedimentary rocks. These formations have flat tops and appear to stack in a way that resembles large stone mushrooms or rounded caps. The formations are distinct against the vast, open sky, and they stand out prominently due to their darker color against the lighter earthy tones of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe overall impression is of a remote, arid environment typical of a desert region, possibly in a location known for its geological and erosional features. There is a stark absence of vegetation and water, emphasizing the aridity and the harsh climate of the area.","title":"Arizona","placename":"Arizona","location":"Arizona","nn1":["544027","545804","545789","555573","545754","555642","544016","545800","545843","555885","544397","544745","545771","545593","545583","543838"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","desert","become","rock","fragment","crack","know","absence","way","climate"]}
