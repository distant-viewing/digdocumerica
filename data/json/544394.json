{"path":"544394.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a worker engaged in a construction or maintenance activity, likely part of a larger infrastructure project. The setting is outdoor, with sandy ground visible below, textured by tire tracks and footprints, hinting at the frequent movement of people and machinery in this area.\n\nThe worker is climbing up a massive metal structure, which casts sharp, angular shadows onto the sandy soil below, creating a striking contrast between light and dark areas within the image. The structure appears to be a framework of girders or beams, suggesting it could be part of a bridge, tower, or building under construction.\n\nThe person is equipped with safety gear including a helmet and a harness connected to ropes, indicating adherence to safety protocols. Several ropes and slack cables hanging by the worker's side imply that there might be more equipment or materials that need to be hoisted or secured.\n\nThe photograph is taken from a perspective that looks slightly upwards towards the worker, highlighting the verticality and the scale of the structure compared to the human figure. There is a sense of motion and effort as the individual climbs, holding onto a girder with one hand while seemingly adjusting or holding something with the other.\n\nOverall, the image not only documents a moment of human industry but also emphasizes themes of construction, the interplay of light and shadow, and the scale of human endeavor in juxtaposition with the enormity of man-made structures.","title":"Navajo worker on Salt River Project","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["546911","544159","546929","556185","547218","556893","556447","557731","546837","553923","549529","544167","546536","555373","556186","553618"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["worker","girder","climb","rope","construction","safety","enormity","protocol","verticality","harness"]}
