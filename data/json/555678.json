{"path":"555678.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque aerial view of a rugged, mountainous landscape. The terrain is a mix of bare rock faces and patches of verdant green vegetation. Meandering through the valley are several winding rivers and streams, characterized by their silvery-blue water, which beautifully contrasts with the dark tones of the surrounding landscape. The rivers create intricate patterns as they snake through the valley floors.\n\nScattered across the slopes of the mountains are patches of snow and ice, indicating that this area experiences colder temperatures. The mountains themselves rise steeply from the valleys, with their peaks appearing rugged and partly covered in snow, suggesting alpine conditions.\n\nIn the background, a chain of taller, snow-capped mountains stretches across the horizon, indicating that this location is part of a larger mountainous region. The sky above is partly cloudy, with hints of blue peeking through, suggesting a dynamic and possibly changing weather pattern at the time the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the remote and unspoiled nature of this wilderness area, showcasing the stunning natural beauty and geological diversity of the region.","title":"View east showing thompson pass, the gently curved notch in the upper left of the picture, the site of the sheep creek camp at the lowe river, the richardson highway and keystone canyon.
