{"path":"550479.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged outdoor scene, with a striking focus on both alpine terrain and vivid flora. In the foreground, a cluster of rocks covered with bright red plants, possibly autumn foliage or a type of red-leafed ground cover, grabs the viewer's attention. These red plants create a sharp contrast with the earthy tones of the ground and the rocks. The ground appears to be scattered with patches of grass, other vegetation, and possibly fallen leaves, hinting at an autumn season.\n\nBeyond the vivid foreground, the midground stretches out slightly before rising steeply to form a mountainous landscape. The mountain featured in the center of the photograph dominates the view. It is rugged with sharp peaks, and barren of vegetation, suggesting a high altitude where fewer plants are capable of thriving. The color palette of the mountain is a mixture of gray and slight hints of earth tones, typical of bare rock surfaces.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests overcast or subdued sunlight, imputing a moody atmosphere to the scene. The sky, visible at the top of the frame, is a muted blue-gray, consistent with overcast weather, enhancing the somewhat stark yet vibrant appearance of the landscape.\n\nOverall, this image captures the raw beauty of a high-altitude, mountainous environment, contrasting dramatically with the striking red vegetation in the foreground, indicative of nature's vibrant palette even in more barren landscapes.","title":"Vegetation, typical of alpine environments along route below Peak 5308, four miles east of pipeline crossing in the gorge.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550439","550478","550477","555666","545724","552442","550455","550536","544881","550459","550441","554642","544852","544887","546090","549225"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["altitude","autumn","rock","plant","palette","vegetation","mountain","ground","flora","midground"]}
