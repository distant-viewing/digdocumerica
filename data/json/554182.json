{"path":"554182.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a white and yellow camper truck parked in a natural setting, casting a strong shadow indicative of bright sunlight. Mounted atop the flatbed of the truck is a large camper housing, equipped with sliding windows and vents, emphasizing its mobility and temporary residence capabilities.\n\nAdjacent to the truck, a woman with short, curly blond hair is seated on a metal folding chair, her body relaxed in a reclining posture. She is wearing a sleeveless top and shorts, suitable for warm weather, and is either resting or in deep thought. Her casual pose and attire suggest a leisurely day outdoors.\n\nIn the foreground, several more metal folding chairs are scattered, their vibrant green and orange colors adding a lively touch to the setting. These chairs are positioned on a gravel surface, further suggesting an outdoor or rustic location. The natural light and shadow, combined with the scattered chairs and the camper setup, create a scene of temporary, mobile living intertwined with leisure and relaxation in a natural environment.","title":"Near the town of Wisconsin Dells the Wisconsin River channels through deep, soft sandstone cliffs, cutting the rock into fantastic shapes. These natural splendors have given rise to a booming tourist industry. People come in droves, often in campers and trailers. Boat trips, shops, bars, and diversions of every kind vie for patronage in an amusement complex extending 2 or 3 miles beyond the town.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546215","548668","545590","548802","545594","554681","557514","548795","554478","554479","548796","544449","544387","548306","548748","547340"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["camper","chair","folding","truck","capability","flatbed","mobility","recline","slide","residence"]}
