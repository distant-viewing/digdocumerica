{"path":"554767.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph captures a rural landscape with a serene and quiet ambiance. In the center, a small farmhouse and an adjacent building, perhaps a barn, stand on a slightly elevated grassy area. The buildings are traditional in style, with the farmhouse painted white and the barn appearing to be made of wood.\n\nSurrounding the buildings are rolling hills, predominantly covered in grass, showcasing shades of green, with some areas looking slightly barren or muddy, particularly at the forefront of the image where a significant patch of soil is exposed, indicating possible erosion or recent agricultural activity.\n\nAt the top of the image, beyond the farmhouse, additional grassy fields can be seen, along with a line of barren trees, suggesting that the season might be either late fall or early spring. There are no visible leaves on the trees, and the overall color palette of the landscape is subdued, consisting mainly of earth tones.\n\nThere are no people or animals visible in the scene, enhancing the sense of tranquility and isolation. The photograph likely aims to convey the peacefulness of rural life or highlight the natural beauty of the landscape. The soft lighting, possibly from an overcast sky, contributes to the overall moody and calm effect of the scene.","title":"This land was stripped 20 years ago (note scar in foreground).
