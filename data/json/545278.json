{"path":"545278.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a majestic and ancient tree set in a lush forest scene. The focal point is the large tree trunk which appears rugged and weathered, with deep furrows and a wide base, suggesting its old age and resilience. The tree is covered in green moss, hanging like a beard from its branches, adding to its mystical and ancient appearance.\n\nSurrounding the base of the tree, there are multiple ferns with dense, green leaves, indicating a moist and fertile environment. The ground seems rich in organic material, possibly covered in fallen leaves, moss, and other decomposing forest elements, typical of a temperate rainforest setup.\n\nThe background is softly illuminated by natural light, perhaps filtering through the canopy above, giving a serene and somewhat ethereal quality to the scene. It also includes other trees, mostly obscured by shadows, contributing to the sense of depth and the densely wooded nature of the environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the texture and grandeur of the ancient tree amidst a verdant forest, evokes a sense of tranquility and the enduring beauty of natural wilderness. The image could be seen as a celebration of nature's complexity and a call to preserve these ancient natural environments.","title":"The hoh rain forest, where spruce, cedar, and fir trees grow to great size","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554999","554977","550792","555057","554995","554966","545271","542958","555000","548687","557616","557623","557621","554967","554992","554961"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","forest","tree","decompose","furrow","rainforest","call","base","endure","fern"]}
