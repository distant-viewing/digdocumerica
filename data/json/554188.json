{"path":"554188.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene outside \"Tommy Bartlett's\" restaurant, known for its pancakes and extensive meal offerings including breakfast, spaghetti, sandwiches, pizza, and dinner menu as advertised on its signs. The prominent signage in bold, block lettering indicates the restaurant opens at 6 AM.\n\nForegrounded in the image are two vintage cars, one a vibrant yellow and the other dark colored, possibly black or deep blue, parked outside the dining establishment. The yellow car is a classic Chevrolet, clearly from the 1970s era, as indicated by its distinctive body shape and design features like the rear taillights and the broad trunk. Its license plate, visible in the image, is from Iowa.\n\nThe architecture of the restaurant building appears to be typical of mid-20th-century commercial design with a flat roof and large, broad windows. The entire facade covered by the windows displays a glimpse into the interior, featuring what seems to be booths lining the windowed wall. Outside the restaurant, the \"OPEN\" sign indicates the business is operative. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet day, perhaps in the morning judging by the quality of light and the dampness visible on the pavement, indicating recent rain.\n\nThe environment has a distinctly nostalgic feel, enhanced by the color and style of the automobiles and the old-fashioned appearance of the restaurant's signage and architectural design. This scene likely captures an everyday moment that blends the mundane with a subtle hint of bygone Americana.","title":"Near the town of Wisconsin Dells the Wisconsin River channels through deep, soft sandstone cliffs, cutting the rock into fantastic shapes. These natural splendors have given rise to a booming tourist industry. People come in droves, often in campers and trailers. Boat trips, shops, bars, and diversions of every kind vie for patronage in an amusement complex extending 2 or 3 miles beyond the town.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547855","547862","555422","546183","555438","555506","554709","554482","547073","550093","557661","557655","552614","545618","551085","554617"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["restaurant","signage","dampness","menu","sandwich","offering","design","judging","dining","booth"]}
