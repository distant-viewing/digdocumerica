{"path":"557438.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic landscape where nature meets suburban life. In the foreground, there is a pasture with several cows grazing on dry, golden grass. This rural setting gently transitions into a suburban area featuring a variety of modern single-family homes. The houses are closely spaced with small yards, featuring a mix of designs but generally presenting one or two stories, some with visible solar panels on their roofs. A paved street weaves its way through the neighborhood.\n\nBeyond the residential area, the scene extends to rolling hills that provide a striking natural backdrop. The hills are mostly covered with sparse vegetation, adding a contrast of lush green against the rocky formations scattered across them. The sky above is clear, suggesting a bright, sunny day.\n\nThe entire composition creates a juxtaposition between the rural, pastoral life marked by the grazing cows and the developed, residential life of the suburban neighborhood, underscoring themes of development and the interaction between human habitation and natural landscapes.","title":"Residential development in the Irvine Ranch area near Newport Beach. This development is part of a new town of high-value planned units in contrast to uncontrolled private sub-divisions. Some 84 percent of the residents in the state live within 30 miles of the coast. This density results in many clashes between developers and conservationists who want to retain the beauty of the land.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["557436","553129","557439","543106","557435","557530","542627","551305","553938","555645","557437","555635","553704","557440","545205","557427"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["cow","neighborhood","pasture","life","hill","habitation","yard","family","panel","transition"]}
