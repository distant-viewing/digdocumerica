{"path":"550067.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"In the photograph, you can see an urban park setting that exudes a sense of tranquility and historic significance. At the front and center of the image is a young woman sitting on a dark, low stone bench. She is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeve top and a skirt, and appears engaged in reading a book, with her legs crossed and a relaxed, focused demeanor.\n\nDominating the background is a grand neoclassical building with strong architectural features, including towering pillars and ornate stonework around its windows and entryways. To the left of the center, prominently placed, is a statue of a historical figure in full armor, possibly a knight or military leader, standing on a large pedestal. This statue adds a classical and commemorative element to the scene.\n\nThe park itself is lush and well-maintained, with neatly trimmed grass and lines of bushes. There are other benches and structured pathways, suggesting it's a place designed for public enjoyment and relaxation. Sparse trees dot the surrounding area, providing a patchy shade over parts of the green space.\n\nIn the far background, beyond the greenery of the park, the hint of a cityscape is visible, suggesting the park is likely situated in a busy urban area. This location provides a peaceful retreat from the city buzz, centered around historic and cultural elements exemplified by the statue and the architecture of the building in the backdrop.","title":"Park in front of city hall, one of the public buildings on the mall, Cleveland's civic center","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550046","557257","552736","550051","544808","551793","555599","547784","546535","552722","549911","550075","546555","551970","550752","553222"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["statue","park","bench","patchy","exemplify","entryway","pedestal","stonework","det","retreat"]}
