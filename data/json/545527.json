{"path":"545527.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph illustrates an outdoor scene where two individuals are standing under a cave or a large rock overhang in a densely wooded area. One person is holding a map or document, seemingly discussing or planning something with the other person. The setting gives a feel of seclusion and exploration, likely a part of a hiking or camping activity.\n\nThe area they are in is covered with a thick carpet of fallen leaves, signifying either early autumn or a densely shaded area that inhibits the growth of underbrush. Several large trees are visible in the immediate vicinity, their trunks showing maturity and sturdiness. Beyond the secluded nook, the forest can be seen filled with green foliage, indicating the photo was taken during a time when the trees were full of leaves.\n\nOn the ground near the individuals, there's a pile of backpacks and possibly other hiking gear, suggesting that these are travelers or explorers taking a break or consulting their map for navigation. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility mixed with adventure, typical of a forest hike setting. The natural overhead rock formation provides a sheltered spot, offering a practical place for a pause during their journey.","title":"Campers at Bankhead National Forest are supporters of battle against clear-cutting here.
