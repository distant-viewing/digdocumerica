{"path":"553315.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This is a captivating image depicting a group of seven young children, both boys and girls, crowded around and partially inside an orange-red vintage vehicle. The group exhibits a range of expressions from joyful smiles to more subdued, curious looks.\n\nStarting from the left, a girl with a ponytail smiles broadly while standing on the sidewalk. Next, a series of boys peek through the open driver's side door, with the front-most boy leaning on the door frame, another behind him with his body halfway through the window, and a third further inside the vehicle. All three boys are shirtless and display lively, cheerful expressions.\n\nMoving right, a girl inside the vehicle, towards the middle, is slightly obscured by the others, though her face is framed between two of the boys as she looks directly at the camera. Another boy, who is inside the car and further back, peers out with a placid expression.\n\nNear the right end of the image, partially outside the front passenger side, is another boy who gazes at the camera with a serious expression, resting his arm along the open window.\n\nIn the background, the environment suggests an urban street setting with brick buildings, some visible signs, and a relatively dim atmosphere suggesting late day or subdued street lighting, giving a cozy, nostalgic feeling to the scene. The joyful, carefree ambiance conveyed by the children contrastingly blends with the urban backdrop, enhancing the liveliness and spontaneity of childhood.","title":"Youngsters in \"over the rhine\" residential neighborhood north of the business district.
