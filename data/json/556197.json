{"path":"556197.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph exhibits a vast, sprawling parking lot filled with neatly arranged cars of various colors, capturing a typical energetic daytime scene. The location appears to be on the periphery of an urban area as evidenced by the skyline featuring tall buildings visible in the distant background on the right. The sky is clear and brightly blue, indicating that it is probably midday or early afternoon. The sheer number of cars, alongside the shadows they cast, suggests a busy day, possibly during a special event or peak business hours. Moreover, a few trees are visible, mainly at the edges of this photograph, which adds a slight touch of greenery to the otherwise concrete-filled scene.","title":"Monroe Street parking lot in Chicago holds 2,700 cars for commuters at Lake Shore Drive. New construction is underway for 900 additional vehicles to bring the total spaces to 3,600. A new park also will be created during construction. The tall building in the background is the new 87-story Standard Oil building.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["549875","547686","550100","548432","553303","556790","546900","542635","554349","556773","546879","556721","556722","548496","556204","546813"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["periphery","midday","daytime","concrete","hour","car","lot","peak","business","parking"]}
