{"path":"545024.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal landscape divided by a series of narrow structures or barriers that extend across the frame. These may be roads, causeways, or possibly breakwaters, constructed to manage or restrict the flow of water between different sections of the water body. The image captures varied terrains; land that is partly arid or barren and other parts covered in grass or low vegetation. On the right side of the image, you see a larger body of water (which may be a sea or a lake), reflecting a deep blue color, scattered with several small boats or floating objects.\n\nTo the left of these structures, the water body appears calmer and is a darker shade, indicating it might be deeper or less affected by currents. Several islands or patches of land surface intermittently across the water body. Notably, the far part of the scene shows rugged, mountainous terrain under a clear sky, suggesting that this location might be part of a larger coastal or lakeside area near mountains.\n\nThis landscape might serve multiple purposes, which could include transportation, aquaculture, or protection against water-related erosion or flooding. The use of the ground and water areas is not immediately clear, but there's a sense of structured interaction between land and water. The photograph exhibits a natural yet managed environment where human intervention has shaped the interchange between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.","title":"Wildlife refuge","placename":"Columbia River","location":"Columbia River","nn1":["549504","554022","548777","544635","548628","552192","547508","552922","548640","548779","548638","549520","544650","548635","555684","550638"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["water","land","manage","body","aquaculture","breakwater","interchange","restrict","flooding","protection"]}
