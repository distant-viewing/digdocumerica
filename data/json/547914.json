{"path":"547914.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a landscape dominated by two large, unfinished high-rise buildings. The structures appear skeletal, composed only of concrete frames with multiple stories, showing no signs of external walls or windows. The buildings are spaced slightly apart, both exhibiting a similar modular, grid-like architectural style, possibly indicative of a housing or office development in mid-construction.\n\nThe foreground of the image features an overgrown field with patches of dry, tall grasses and sporadic debris, suggesting a somewhat neglected or underdeveloped area. A dirt patch is visible, likely used as a temporary road or pathway during the construction process.\n\nLining the right side of the photo are several utility poles, complete with power lines running parallel to the frame of the image. These poles stretch into the distance, following the perspective toward the horizon, and contribute to a sense of rural or semi-rural setting for the construction site.\n\nThe sky above is overcast, casting a dull, uniform light across the scene, which adds to the stark, barren aesthetic evoked by the unfinished buildings and the wild landscape. The overall mood is one of abandonment or paused activity, and the image might be capturing a point in time where construction has halted or is progressing slowly.","title":"One of several highrise apartments whose construction was stopped by city ordinance to preserve the Breezy Point Peninsula for public recreational use.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556619","547652","548552","546422","547664","549766","547921","547829","544523","546400","548551","546411","547863","558107","550737","555746"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","pole","progress","housing","patch","follow","grid","office","pathway","abandonment"]}
