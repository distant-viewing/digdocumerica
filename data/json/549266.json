{"path":"549266.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This is a photograph of a large watercraft, which appears to be a research or utility vessel, sailing in a body of water. The boat, named \"VILA VELEBITA II PULA\", is painted mostly in a dark hue, likely blue or black, with a lighter superstructure. There are several individuals visible on the boat; at least four people can be seen standing on the stern. The crew members are wearing casual attire; three of them appear to be wearing orange tops while another is in a darker shirt.\n\nThe vessel is equipped with various pieces of equipment, signaling its likely use in marine activities that could range from research to transportation. There is a mast with multiple attachments, along with two large reels (possibly cable or hose reels) visible on the rear upper deck. A national flag is hoisted on the mast, but the specific details of the flag are not clear from this image.\n\nThe vessel's backdrop is an expanse of water and an overcast sky, creating a tranquil marine setting. The sea appears calm with minimal wave activity. Overall, the image captures a working scenario emphasizing maritime endeavors under possibly gray weather conditions.","title":"The vila velebite ii, the hydrobiological research ship of the ruder boskovic institute, conducts several scientific projects for epa","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["549371","549383","549263","544234","549264","557815","547548","549613","549616","548882","552050","549619","555832","549618","545057","555828"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["reel","vessel","mast","research","flag","marine","attachment","watercraft","superstructure","hoist"]}
