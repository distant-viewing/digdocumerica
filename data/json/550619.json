{"path":"550619.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial perspective of a densely forested landscape experiencing early autumn, showing a mix of evergreen and deciduous trees transitioning in color. In the middle of this vast wooded area, there's a distinct, almost perfectly circular, bare patch of land. Within this clearing, there is a small body of water that appears somewhat kidney-shaped. This central plain surrounded by a thicker ring of trees gives it an eye-like appearance. The forest displays a variety of colors including dark greens, lighter greens, yellows, and some orange hues, indicating the change of seasons. The overall feel is remote and undisturbed, suggesting a natural wilderness area possibly in a northern or mountainous region.","title":"Marshy land and taiga forest are home to brown bears black bears, moose and, occasionally, caribou","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["554711","550626","550643","556931","554712","554728","550603","553564","553567","555728","550644","554715","556906","555698","554714","554651"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["greens","evergreen","ring","plain","yellow","transitione","clearing","experience","autumn","change"]}
