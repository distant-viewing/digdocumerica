{"path":"548323.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph provides a sweeping aerial view of New York City, showing a significant section of midtown Manhattan and central parts extending towards uptown. One of the city’s major thoroughfares, possibly a sun-dappled Fifth Avenue or Broadway, runs vertically through the center of the image, lined with numerous high-rise buildings that create a dense urban forest of varied architecture.\n\nIn the distance, the skyscraper skyline features some well-known buildings that outline the city's iconic profile. The image captures the contrast between the vast urban development and the greener, more open spaces such as the large park visible on the right, which is Central Park. The park offers a stark natural contrast to the surrounding dense metropolis with its large, lush green area.\n\nFurther back, the city fades into a haze, giving a sense of the sprawling scale of New York. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, with shadows casting over the buildings and streets, highlighting the voluminous contours of the cityscape. The photo’s overall tone is slightly grainy, adding a nostalgic or historical quality.","title":"Manhattan skyline seen from the north.
