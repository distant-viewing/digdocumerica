{"path":"553995.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers a scenic panoramic view of a coastal landscape. The foreground features a large expanse of dry, scrubby terrain characterized by various shades of brown and patches of green vegetation, suggesting a semi-arid environment. The vegetation is sparsely distributed across rolling hills which have a gentle slope towards a wide shoreline.\n\nThe middle-ground of the image reveals part of the coastline, where gentle waves can be observed lapping against the shore. Beyond the coastline, the vast ocean spreads out, its surface reflecting a deep shade of blue under the effects of sunlight.\n\nThe background is dominated by an impressive mountain range partially shrouded in mist or low clouds, creating an atmospheric and dramatic backdrop. The mountains across the water appear to be significantly large, giving a sense of distance and the expanse of nature in this region.\n\nThe top section of the photo displays a partly cloudy sky with hues of purple and blue, indicating possibly early morning or late afternoon light conditions. The overall mood of the image is serene, highlighting the tranquil and rugged beauty of a natural coastal landscape.","title":"In May, 1973, in a controversial decision now in the courts, the Land Use Commission agreed to reclassify 22,340 acres of the island of Lanai for urban use. Land on the eastern side (shown here) is too dry for prime agriculture. Much of the proposed expansion (houses accommodations) would be in this area. In background is Maui Island.","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["543328","543434","543432","543430","543300","543051","543424","543090","543184","545222","543049","543374","543429","553805","545230","553994"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["coastline","expanse","mountain","shade","purple","mist","slope","vegetation","shoreline","ocean"]}
