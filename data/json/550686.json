{"path":"550686.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil scene featuring a body of water, possibly a lake or river, set against a lush, forested landscape. In the foreground, the water surface is distinctive with numerous floating white particles or foam, noticeably clustered more densely in some areas. One large piece of foam or pollution is prominently visible, and it has a somewhat irregular, organic shape with textured patterns suggesting its lightweight or frothy nature. \n\nThe water reflects a muted sky peppered with light clouds, creating a serene and slightly moody atmosphere. In the background, the scene is framed by rolling hills or mountains covered in dense green forest extending to the horizon. The left side of the image shows the base of a large hill that slopes gently into the water. Towards the mid-right part of the image, a bridge or a similar structure is visible, partially obscured by the natural landscape, suggesting some human presence or activity in the area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on natural elements and subtle human touch, invokes a sense of tranquility interspersed with the concern of environmental impact visible on the water surface.","title":"Outfall from Berlin's industries produces islands of foam in the Androscoggin River","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["554527","550745","545008","543611","545923","552141","551352","549641","546963","548030","556928","550656","557239","554623","545866","550700"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["foam","pepper","water","particle","invoke","forest","hill","concern","roll","float"]}
