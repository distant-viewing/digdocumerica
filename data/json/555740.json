{"path":"555740.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph features a distant view of the Statue of Liberty, centered in the frame, set against a clear blue sky. The statue stands prominently on a tiered pedestal which is situated on a larger stone platform, both being stout and squared in design. The statue itself is depicted in a typical pose, holding a raised torch in her right hand and carrying a tablet in her left arm. Her posture is upright, with her gaze directed forward, projecting a symbolic presence of welcome and freedom.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, the silhouette of a city skyline is visible, with the notable presence of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, which characterizes the image as taken before the events of September 11, 2001. The water surrounding the statueâ€™s pedestal reflects a glimpse of the bright sunlight, enriching the sea with shimmering light.\n\nThe image evokes a sense of serenity and historical significance, capturing a quintessential symbol of the United States and its ideals of liberty and democracy. The color saturation and grain of the image suggest it might be taken on film, adding a vintage feel to the visual representation.","title":"Statue of Liberty and the Manhattan, New York, skyline.
