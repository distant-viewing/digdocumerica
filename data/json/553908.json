{"path":"553908.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features an artistic, motion-blurred image of a person riding a bicycle, creating a sense of speed and movement. The composition is dynamic, with the cyclist positioned slightly off-center to the left. The cyclist, who appears to be a woman, is wearing a sleeveless top and shorts, suggesting a casual, perhaps warm setting.\n\nThe background is a smear of greens and darker colors, indicating a lush, natural environment that is likely a park or a wooded area. The motion blur effect stretches across the entire image, with horizontal streaks of colors that blend the figure of the cyclist with the surroundings, enhancing the feeling of rapid movement.\n\nThe technique used to capture this image emphasizes the speed of the bicycle and the fluidity of the ride, rather than focusing on sharp details. This lends an almost painterly quality to the photo, making it visually appealing and evocative of the exhilaration associated with cycling fast through a verdant landscape.","title":"Keeping the air clean in the Rocky River Reservation of the Metropolitan Park System.
