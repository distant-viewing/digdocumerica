{"path":"555115.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph offers a dense view of a conifer forest. The trees, mainly tall and slender, display varying shades of dark to light green, indicating possibly different species or age groups. The forest appears extensive, stretching across the entire view without any visible breaks or interruptions by clearings or non-woodland elements. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with some parts of the trees shimmering slightly, perhaps due to sunlight hitting dew or moisture on their needles. The perspective is somewhat elevated, giving an overview-like impression, emphasizing the vastness and density of the forest. There are no signs of human activity or man-made structures visible; it is a pure natural wilderness scene.","title":"Monocultured Douglas fir trees on the humptulips river in olympic national timberland, Washington.
