{"path":"553547.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photo captures two young girls standing in front of a weathered white brick wall that has the words \"America's Premium\" written in large black letters. The sun creates shadows and highlights across the scene, giving it a vivid, textured appearance. The wall also features the text \"FLYNN SIGN CO\" in smaller print, suggesting the location might be near or part of a business related to sign production.\n\nThe girl on the left is wearing a striped tank top and has a pained expression, possibly due to squinting in the bright sunlight. The girl on the right is holding a large bucket filled with glass soda bottles, and she has a neutral, somewhat serious expression. Her dress is patterned with a textured, possibly layered fabric design.\n\nThey both appear to be standing in an outdoor setting, as indicated by the harsh shadows and bright areas, which contrast sharply with each other, typical in photographs taken in direct sunlight. No specific activities are occurring, other than the posing for the photo. Their expressions and stances evoke a sense of daily life and youth during a time that the style of clothing and classic design of soda bottles suggest might be several decades ago.","title":"Going to exchange empties for more soda pop in Mulky Square, a low-income neighborhood on the city's west side.
