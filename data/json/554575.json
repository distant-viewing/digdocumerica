{"path":"554575.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph showcases a group of plants predominantly featuring white flowers and broad green leaves. Each flower, composed of four large white petals surrounding a cluster of small, brownish center speckles, contrasts sharply against the dark green, slightly veined leaves beneath them. The leaves themselves have a smooth texture and an elliptical shape, with a subtle shine that suggests healthiness and vigor. The image captures these botanical elements in natural sunlight, enhancing the vibrancy of the green and the purity of the white petals. The composition has a dense, lush look, with the flowers and leaves layered closely together, filling the frame without any noticeable gaps, indicating a thriving, dense patch of flora. There's no visible background beyond the immediate coverage of the leaves and flowers, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the botanical elements.","title":"Bunchberry (cornus canadensis), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["554576","554587","555037","553368","544875","549230","553361","555040","545695","544876","555106","545726","553366","545720","543197","547642"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","leave","petal","thriving","gaps","shine","vein","green","coverage","speckle"]}
