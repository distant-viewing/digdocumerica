{"path":"552023.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This image captures a small, muddy stream bordered by dense, lush greenery. The creek meanders through a scene filled with rocks, scattered debris, and a few wooden logs partially submerged in the water, suggesting a form of pollution or neglect. In the background, there's a large, plain white building that stands in stark contrast to the natural surroundings. It has a box-like architecture with no visible windows and resembles an industrial or storage facility. Above the building, the sky is partly cloudy, indicating a bright day. The overall composition of the photograph juxtaposes the natural environment with the man-made structure, highlighting perhaps an environmental narrative or the encroachment of urban development into natural landscapes.","title":"Exposed and corroded pipe in a creek in woodbridge, adjacent to a high school and public health center.
