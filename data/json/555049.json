{"path":"555049.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a dense and vibrant array of fern leaves, predominantly oriented horizontally across the frame. The ferns exhibit a rich green color with each leaflet delicately and symmetrically arranged on either side of a darker central stem. The unique visual texture of the ferns is further highlighted by the natural variations in their shades of green, ranging from darker hues near the stems to lighter at the edges of the leaflets.\n\nOf particular interest is a twisted vine with a spiral form that adds an element of dynamic contrast to the composition, intertwining among the fern leaves. The background shows additional foliage that is mostly obscured by the ferns, with hints of other plants and possibly small flowers in subtle shades of red or pink peeping through.\n\nThe overall composition of the image is densely packed, offering very little negative space, which accentuates the lush, verdant environment typically found in a rainforest or a similarly dense, natural setting. This portrayal of dense greenery evokes a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, focusing entirely on the flora with no visible human interference or artifacts.","title":"Spring deer ferns on an ocean strip in the Pacific Coast area of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554996","555192","555050","555191","554993","555093","553589","545285","554957","553590","555054","555368","555043","553358","543542","545271"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fern","stem","interference","rainforest","vine","artifact","leave","portrayal","flora","shade"]}
