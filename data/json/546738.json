{"path":"546738.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a rainy, overcast day on a crowded highway. Vehicles of various types, including cars, a truck, and a van, are visible, all moving slowly in what appears to be heavy traffic. The scene is set with a slight blur, suggesting either movement or the conditions affecting the cameraâ€™s focus.\n\nThe foreground shows a wet road that reflects the vehicles and the dim light. A dominant feature in this photograph is a large overpass that stretches across the frame, appearing sturdy with its concrete structure. Affixed to this overpass, a sign for \"Crowder's Transfer & Storage Co.\" is visible, partially informing the observer about possibly local businesses or advertisements prevalent during the time the photo was taken.\n\nIn the background, beyond the overpass, the environment fades into a misty haze, and distant structures or hills can barely be made out. This adds a sense of depth and also underscores the inclement weather conditions, filling the scene with a grey tone that covers the landscape.\n\nThis photograph may evoke feelings of dampness and the typical slowdowns associated with rain, hinting at the everyday experiences of drivers facing weather-related challenges on the road. The mixture of vehicle types and the visible traffic infrastructure also potentially place this photograph in an urban or suburban setting where such sights are common.","title":"Evening rush hour traffic","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["545451","549861","556681","545875","546747","549902","556194","542764","549879","546660","542682","549878","556727","547569","553726","549890"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["overpass","dampness","traffic","vehicle","type","observer","sight","weather","blur","van"]}
