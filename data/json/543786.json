{"path":"543786.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a somber scene of a deceased deer lying beside a road. The setting is likely in a rural or semi-rural area, distinguished by a clear road that sweeps horizontally across the frame. In the foreground, the deer rests on a rough surface composed mostly of small rocks and scattered dirt, indicative of soil erosion or insufficient road maintenance.\n\nThe deer is captured in full form, displaying a lifeless posture with its body contorted slightly and evidence of blood near its head, suggesting it was hit by a vehicle. Its fur appears to be matted and patches of dry blood are visible, adding a tragic tone to the scene. The animal's calm, inert face contrasts sharply with the violence implied by its injuries.\n\nIn the middle ground, a blurred vehicle passes by on the road, captured in motion blur that conveys speed. This passing vehicle is defined by a streaking blur, hinting at the ongoing and unforgiving traffic on this road, possibly alluding to the hazards that wildlife face in such areas.\n\nThe background beyond the road is not clearly detailed but suggests a natural environment, likely with scattered vegetation or scrubland typical of highways cutting through less urbanized zones.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the stark, stationary tragedy of the deer in contrast with the swift, blurred motion of modern vehicle travel, visually emphasizing themes of wildlife vulnerability and human-made hazards.","title":"Deer lies on roadside after being hit by autoMobile.","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["552699","557015","558368","544623","544571","554676","545898","545816","543279","545902","552697","554621","542954","551122","546163","550386"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","road","hazard","pass","vehicle","wildlife","allude","mat","vulnerability","sweep"]}
