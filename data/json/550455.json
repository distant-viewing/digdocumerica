{"path":"550455.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents a rugged natural landscape, focusing on a steep, rocky mountain slope. The mountainside is predominantly dark and jagged, suggesting the presence of hardened lava or sedimentary layers, which might indicate ancient volcanic activity or significant geological shifts. Scattered across the rocky surface are several white dots, which upon closer inspection, appear to be mountain goats or similar wild animals. Their presence signifies a habitat that supports wildlife adapted to steep and rough terrains.\n\nThe mid-ground of the image shows a narrow, winding river or stream, reflecting the typical formation of water bodies in such mountainous regions, where water from higher elevations finds its way down through the valleys formed between slopes. Alongside the river, the terrain shows patches of vegetation contrasting with the stark rock faces, indicating hardy plant species that can survive in this challenging environment.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a field with reddish-brown vegetationâ€”possibly a type of grass or shrub turning color with the seasons. This colorful vegetation could suggest autumnal changes or a particular type of endemic flora.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its vertical orientation and natural gradation from rugged peaks to gentler-filled valleys, highlights the harsh yet beautiful nature of mountainous landscapes. The image encapsulates themes of resilience and adaptation, both in terms of the flora and the fauna that inhabit such daunting terrains.","title":"These three young sheep have just swum across the atigun river.
