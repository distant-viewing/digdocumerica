{"path":"545828.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil rural landscape, likely capturing a scene in a semi-arid or arid region. The composition features a sprawling pasture with a gentle upward slope. Scattered across the hillside and the plain in the foreground are numerous small, bushy trees and shrubs, suggesting a relatively dry environment. The vegetation is mostly green, indicating that the photo was possibly taken during a wetter period or season.\n\nIn the middle to upper third of the image, centered and slightly to the right, stands a solitary windmill, a typical structure used for pumping water, hinting at agricultural activities in the area. This windmill adds a focal point to the landscape and suggests human presence and use of the land, although no humans or animals are visible.\n\nThe foreground is marked by a barbed wire fence running horizontally, which adds depth to the scene and emphasizes the vastness of the area. The presence of this fence further supports the idea of managed or privately owned land.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is peaceful and quiet, with no dynamic elements such as moving animals or people. The lighting appears to be natural and somewhat muted, possibly due to overcast skies or the time of day, which could be either early morning or late afternoon. The palette is rich in greens and earth tones, enhancing the naturalistic feel of the scene.","title":"A fence divides cleared land from tree-covered land.","placename":"Odessa (Tex.)","location":"Odessa, Texas","nn1":["549156","545040","549142","557087","549217","546102","549210","546154","544868","549216","554801","549236","557439","549146","549182","549211"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["windmill","animal","fence","idea","pasture","land","pump","third","sprawl","hillside"]}
