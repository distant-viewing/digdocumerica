The main building in the image has a modern architectural style, characterized by a series of tall, narrow, rectangular windows set in white concrete or stone panels.\n\nIn the foreground, a small group of young people is engaged in various activities: one individual carrying a guitar walks alongside others who appear to be involved in a discussion or casual conversation. Their attire, which includes tops, trousers, and skirts primarily in subtle tones, suggests a casual, educational environment.\n\nThe background shows more people, some walking and others sitting on the pavement or lush green grass. A couple of students are handling sports equipment, possibly preparing for a physical activity.
