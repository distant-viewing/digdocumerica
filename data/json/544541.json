{"path":"544541.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image captures a wetland area dense with water-loving plants, specifically featuring a large cluster of broad-leafed plants, possibly water cabbage (Pistia stratiotes), dominating the foreground. The leaves of these plants are thick and waxy, mainly green but with some showing signs of yellowing or browning, possibly due to water conditions or seasonal changes.\n\nThe water surface, visible around and beneath the plants, reflects the surrounding vegetation and sky, creating a glassy texture interrupted by plant stalks and submerged leaves. Some singular, blade-like plants rise straight out of the water, suggesting a variety of aquatic plant life in this ecosystem.\n\nIn the background, a dense collection of slim tree trunks, possibly belonging to a swamp or wetland forest, reaches upward. The trees are closely packed, each trunk slender and vertical, hinting at a struggle for sunlight in this lush environment. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, casting gentle light that accentuates the green hues and provides a soft contrast between water, plant life, and the forest background.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its focus on aquatic flora and a densely wooded backdrop, showcases a typical wetland habitat known for high biodiversity and ecological importance.","title":"TaMiami canal area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544593","550783","544585","544589","550670","550785","547532","547509","545033","550786","557498","542554","558009","547639","543561","547488"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["plant","trunk","water","around","swamp","struggle","biodiversity","interrupt","stalk","blade"]}
