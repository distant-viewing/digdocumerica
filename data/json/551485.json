{"path":"551485.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively night-time scene at an outdoor snack kiosk. The kiosk features a classic design, with a striped awning in red and white and warm lighting that creates a welcoming ambiance. The vendor, standing inside the kiosk, is engaging with two customers. The male vendor, who wears glasses and a dark shirt, smiles as he interacts with the customers.\n\nIn the foreground, a man with his back to the camera is ordering food. He is wearing blue jeans and a light yellow sweater. Facing the vendor, a woman with dark hair neatly styled, appears slightly blurred as she leans towards the counter, indicating motion or laughter during the conversation.\n\nThe surrounding environment has the ambiance of a festive or market-like setting, with other food options and possibly additional vendors out of frame. There is a small tree illuminated by ambient lighting that contributes to the overall cozy and social night-time atmosphere. The scene conveys a sense of casual interaction and enjoyment, typical of a food market or fair.","title":"Old fashioned popcorn wagon is a favorite stop on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["545457","554217","551888","542894","554495","551419","546979","554708","554215","556215","551690","549315","551513","554187","551844","547779"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["vendor","kiosk","food","customer","market","night","laughter","option","snack","awning"]}
