{"path":"544708.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene at sunset. The sky is deep orange to red gradient, creating a dramatic backdrop. In the foreground, there is an industrial facility with multiple structures including towers and piping. The most noticeable features are the thick plumes of dark smoke billowing from two large stacks. These stacks are emitting the smoke that appears dense and heavy, suggesting pollution.\n\nThe sun is visible as a fiery orange circle, partially obscured near the bottom center of the image by the silhouette of the industrial machinery and installations, which are dark and only outlined against the brilliant backlight of the sun. The atmosphere created is somewhat somber and thought-provoking, emphasizing themes such as industry versus nature and environmental impact. The setting sun adds a natural and aesthetic contrast to the man-made structures and the smoke emitted, highlighting the intersection of natural beauty and industrial activity.","title":"Setting sun and smokestacks","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["545425","545414","545438","545421","553847","545410","544684","544688","546384","548851","544696","552156","545418","548886","544173","545446"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["sun","smoke","stack","orange","backlight","circle","piping","installation","intersection","thought"]}
