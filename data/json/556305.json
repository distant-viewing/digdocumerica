{"path":"556305.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph features a focused image of a man playing electric bass at what appears to be an outdoor event, judging from the natural light and shadow play in the image. The man is dressed in a salmon-pink short-sleeve shirt and a light pink, wide-brimmed hat, fashioning a cohesive and striking look. His expression is one of concentration, hinting at his immersion in the music.\n\nHe is holding a bass guitar, resting it comfortably against his body, and his fingers are positioned as if he's playing. The bass itself is light-colored with a gleaming, reflective surface, indicative of a well-maintained instrument.\n\nIn the softly blurred background, another man is partially visible, wearing a white t-shirt with the word \"MILLER\" printed in black across the front. His face is turned away from the camera, directing attention back to the main subject of the photograph.\n\nThe lighting in the image subtly highlights the contours of the main subject's face and hat, adding depth to his features against the darker, indistinct background. The overall composition and use of focus effectively centralize the visual story on the man and his connection to his instrument, portraying a moment of artistic expression.","title":"A black guitarist performs at the Lake Meadows Shopping Center in Chicago.
