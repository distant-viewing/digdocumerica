{"path":"548665.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a striking architectural detail of a vintage house, characterized by a prominent corner turret with a conical roof finished in blue shingles. The turret has tall, rectangular windows that suggest it may serve as a small viewing room or a cozy nook. Below the turret is an ornate balcony that wraps around the exterior, detailed with intricate wooden railing designs that exhibit typical Victorian style, including decorative spindles and lace-like trims.\n\nThe visible exterior walls below the balcony are clad in horizontal siding, and there's another section of the house adjacent to the turret with a gabled roof that includes a small vent. The craftsmanship is detailed, emphasizing the aesthetics typical of the late 19th century American architecture.\n\nThe turret's base, a slightly extended second floor or raised first floor, hosts double-hung sash windows bordered by shutters, contributing to the houseâ€™s classic feel. There's no visible activity inside the house; it appears serene and possibly uninhabited at the moment of capture.\n\nThe color palette is quite natural with blues and whites predominating, casting a calm and somewhat nostalgic atmosphere. Light seems to be falling from the right, suggesting a time either in early morning or late afternoon, lending the image a soft shadow and highlights on the architectural features. On the upper right, part of a palm-like tree's foliage intrudes into the frame, indicating the house is likely situated in a region with warm climates. No people are visible in the frame, focusing all attention on the architectural beauty and the serene environment.","title":"A typical Bahamian-style residence of Key West. Many of the older houses were built by ship's carpenters using the wood of the region: cedar, cypress, and mahogany. These fine old buildings are carefully preserved.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548666","557072","548663","558148","555578","542816","542967","557069","558150","558156","548662","542818","555579","548661","557073","557076"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["turret","house","balcony","floor","lace","craftsmanship","vent","shutter","shingle","capture"]}
