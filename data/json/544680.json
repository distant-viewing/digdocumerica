{"path":"544680.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet striking sunset scene, likely from the 1970s based on the aesthetic and film quality. The image is dominated by a warm, dark ambient lighting, typical of twilight. Two young boys are seen riding bicycles along a dirt path. The path runs alongside a traditional wire fence casting long shadows on the ground. The boy in the foreground is closer to the camera and is pedaling towards the viewer, offering a clearer view of his facial features and clothing. Both are dressed in casual attire suitable for outdoor activities.\n\nThe background features an industrial setting that contrasts with the pastoral foreground. There are several large structures emitting plumes of smoke or steam into the early evening sky, suggesting factories or processing plants. These facilities are juxtaposed against a vast, open sky, tinted with hues of orange and purple due to the setting sun. The overall mood conveys a slice of life from a time when industrial expansion was common in rural landscapes.\n\nUtility poles line the road, receding into the distance and enhancing the depth of the photograph, while cables crisscross subtly in the sky. The dynamic between the natural landscape, the industrial elements, and the leisurely activity of the boys on bicycles creates a nostalgic sense of time and place, reflective of the era's environmental and social contexts.","title":"Nearby is a water sewage processing plant and a garbage dump.","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["543715","543719","544432","551105","545404","551030","551032","552596","543044","558140","547714","548851","549096","547711","549191","545425"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["boy","bicycle","pedal","path","expansion","dynamic","time","recede","crisscross","tint"]}
