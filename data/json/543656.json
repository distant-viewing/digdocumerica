{"path":"543656.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking winter scene dominated by icy and snowy elements within a rugged landscape. In the foreground, a stream or small river, partially obscured by snow, flows over dark, jagged rocks. The water appears quite dynamic, swirling around the rocks, indicating the stream is not fully frozen.\n\nCentral in the image stands a striking ice formation. This massive structure, resembling a frozen waterfall or an icicle cluster, reaches upward, connecting the snowy ground to the darker cliffs behind it. The ice is thick and textured, with various elongated icicles hanging downwards, adding to the dramatic impact of the scene.\n\nThe background features towering, dark rock cliffs that cup the ice formation and the stream. They loom over the scene, enhancing the feeling of a secluded, cold environment. The cliffs have patches of snow and ice clinging to them, merging almost seamlessly with the overcast sky above, which adds a moody, overcast tone to the overall ambiance of the photograph.\n\nThe overall mood is stark and awe-inspiring, emphasizing nature's power and the quiet beauty of winter landscapes.","title":"Rainbow falls","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["543770","543766","543619","550410","550418","543550","550416","550592","544901","550500","550503","550415","543755","550635","550413","552213"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["ice","stream","cliff","winter","rock","snow","icy","elongated","formation","freeze"]}
