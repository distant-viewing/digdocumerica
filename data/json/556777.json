{"path":"556777.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a young woman using a public phone booth. The setting appears to be a rather urban environment, given the architectural style seen in the faint reflections and the design of the phone booth itself.\n\nThe phone booth is traditional and rectangular, made of glass panels with aluminum or steel frames, providing a somewhat clear view inside. It is labeled prominently with the word \"PHONE\" on top, alongside a simple icon of a telephone both above the door. Inside the booth, the woman stands with her back partially towards the viewer, engaged in a conversation using the payphone.\n\nThe woman has dark hair pulled back away from her face, and wears a striped, sleeveless crop top and denim shorts, typical of a casual, warm-weather outfit. She also wears platform sandals, adding a touch of trendy style indicative of the time period when the photo might have been taken. Next to her, on the booth's floor, rests a dark blue backpack, possibly containing her belongings.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is somewhat muted with a bluish-grey tone, suggesting it might be late in the day or in an area shaded from direct sunlight. The photograph, capturing a seemingly mundane moment, provides a glimpse into everyday life and technology use in past decades, before the ubiquity of mobile phones.","title":"One of two phones is in use at one of the southeastern Pennsylvania transportation authority (septa) train stations in the Philadelphia suburbs.
