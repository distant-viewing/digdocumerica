{"path":"544175.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a polluted water scene. In the foreground, there is a mix of oily sludge, discarded items such as a bottle and a pencil, and natural debris accumulating along the water's edge, suggesting environmental neglect or contamination.\n\nThe water surface is quite reflective, showing a mirror-like image of objects above. In the reflection, you can see the outlines of white silos or towers, implying an industrial setting nearby. The sky appears clear as suggested by the bright and vivid reflection of the blue sky and white structures in the calm water.\n\nThe edges of the water are blurred with what looks like algae growth and floating pollutants, indicating poor water quality. Overall, the composition juxtaposes the serene reflection with the harsh reality of industrial pollution, creating a striking but somber visual commentary on environmental issues.","title":"Petroleum installation relected in polluted pond","placename":"Grand Isle (La.)","location":"Grand Isle, Louisiana","nn1":["550812","547614","552811","551560","555784","552127","547617","551559","544580","551561","547493","546944","546116","551562","555848","544804"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["reflection","pencil","water","contamination","accumulate","pollutant","reality","algae","commentary","silo"]}
