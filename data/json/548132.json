{"path":"548132.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures three men on a fishing trip, positioned on two boats on a body of water. In the forefront, two men are in a silver Klamath brand boat. The man on the left, wearing a red cap and sunglasses, holds a fishing rod and appears to be adjusting it or preparing to cast a line. He wears a blue puffed jacket and a lighter blue vest underneath. The second man, sitting behind the first, wears a multi-colored hat and a brown jacket, and seems to be observing his companion.\n\nIn the background, in a second boat, there is another man who stands smiling with a slightly puzzled expression, as if having just finished a task or in the middle of figuring something out. He is holding a net with one hand and touching his head with the other. He wears a green sweater and beige pants.\n\nThe setting suggests a daylight outing, probably in a lake or river setting given the calm water, which is a common backdrop for recreational fishing. The environment has a tranquil, leisurely air about it, and all individuals show engagement in their respective activities, reflecting a moment likely of enjoyment and relaxation.","title":"Sports fisherman on the willamette river near Oregon city","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548164","546053","546001","546079","548160","552325","549935","552282","551410","548738","554198","552323","550848","552324","552317","542564"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","man","first","companion","jacket","boat","wear","finish","out","trip"]}
