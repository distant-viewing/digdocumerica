{"path":"545764.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a stunning, expansive natural landscape, most likely in a desert-like environment characterized by red rock formations and sparse vegetation. The terrain makes a dramatic impression with its layers of deeply eroded rock which create a canyon view. What's most prominent in the image is a sinuous dirt road that snakes dramatically through the canyon, hugging the side of a steep cliff and descending into the valley below. This road provides a sense of scale amidst the vast geological structures.\n\nThe colors in the photograph are rich, dominated by deep reds and oranges of the rocky terrain, complemented by the muted greens of the sparse vegetation, probably small shrubs or bushes, scattered throughout the area. The sky above is partially clouded, suggesting an overcast weather condition, which adds a moody tone to the scene.\n\nThe topography and erosion patterns suggest that this could be a location somewhere in the American Southwest, a region known for such distinctive and picturesque geological formations. The fisheye lens or wide-angle view used in capturing the photograph distorts the perspective slightly, enhancing the curvature of the Earth and emphasizing the breadth of the canyonâ€™s expanse.\n\nOverall, there is no visible human activity in the image; it is a pure, raw representation of natural beauty and geological grandeur. The photograph may serve as an inviting scene for those interested in geology, nature, or outdoor adventure.","title":"Looking down on Island in the Sky and the famous Schaefer Trail, which winds its way steeply from the mesa top to the Colorado River below.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545760","545800","545799","544950","544745","545690","545761","545749","544917","545787","545805","545750","545798","544429","545765","545796"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["canyon","geology","formation","breadth","curvature","lens","representation","rock","topography","road"]}
