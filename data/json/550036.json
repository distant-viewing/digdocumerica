{"path":"550036.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling outdoor market scene, set against an urban backdrop. The foreground is filled with various market stalls under large, red-striped tents. Stalls are extensively stocked with fresh produce, predominantly fruits arranged in pyramid shapes and cardboard boxes. The scene is lively, with numerous shoppers of various ages and attire browsing the goods. The market appears slightly disorganized, with litter scattered around the ground and boxes piled somewhat haphazardly.\n\nBehind the market, a line of low-rise brick buildings is visible, showcasing signs such as \"UNION OYSTER HOUSE.\" The skyline suggests a small-to-mid-sized city environment, indicated by the presence of taller buildings, including a modern skyscraper, in the background. The photo also displays political ads for \"SERRA Senator\" attached to the exposed sides of buildings, indicating a period of active local campaigning.\n\nThe color palette is dominated by the vivid reds of the market tents and dark tones of the urban architecture, contrasted by the bright daylight illuminating the scene. This photograph offers a glimpse into urban life, capturing the vibrancy and dynamic atmosphere of a public market environment.","title":"Outdoor food market at Haymarket Square.
