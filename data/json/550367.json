{"path":"550367.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph features a wide and turbulent river captured during what appears to be either an overcast day or at dusk, given the subdued lighting and moody atmosphere. The river dominates the scene, filled with rough, swirling waters that indicate either recent heavy rains or possibly the melting of upstream snow. It flows vigorously from the upper reaches of the image toward the bottom.\n\nThe river is lined with lush trees on either side, suggesting a natural, possibly secluded area. These trees, which are dense and mostly leafy, lean slightly toward the river, perhaps due to the erosion of the soil around their roots, intensified by the strong current.\n\nIn the background, partially hidden by the trees and just visible through a gap, is a small settlement. Visible structures include a house and a couple of other small buildings, their details somewhat obscured by the distance and the surrounding foliage. Their presence suggests this river runs near or through a small community.\n\nThe colors in the image are primarily muted tones of blue and green, with the white of the foamy water contrasting sharply against the darker river water and the surrounding landscape. The sky, barely visible at the top of the frame, seems overcast, contributing to the overall gloomy and dramatic effect of the setting.","title":"Foam, a sign of pollution, floats on the St. Croix River at Calais, down river from the Georgia Pacific paper mill.","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["550698","550742","550366","550658","549550","552137","553003","549482","555214","553420","542743","553855","550682","550560","557485","553416"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","reach","root","gap","current","settlement","rain","white","erosion","couple"]}
