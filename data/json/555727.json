{"path":"555727.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a panoramic view of a wide river seen from an elevated perspective, possibly from another bridge or a high vantage point nearby. The river curves gently around thickly forested, cliff-like shorelines which are predominantly green in color, suggesting a lush, densely vegetated area. In the foreground, a long suspension bridge spans across the river, characterized by its prominent cables and towers that suggest a significant feat of engineering.\n\nThe bridge is busy with several vehicles visible, implying a major transportation route. The water itself is calm, with a few small boats visible, hinting at recreational or possibly commercial activity on the river. The water has a varying color palette of blues and browns, possibly due to reflections and the depth of the river.\n\nThe light conditions appear to be either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft, diffused light and the pinkish hue in the sky which contains a few scattered clouds. The far side of the river fades into a distance under a hazy sky, providing a sense of the vast scale and serene atmosphere of the location.","title":"The George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River connecting New York City with New Jersey. Lands adjacent to the bight, rivers flowing into it, and bays and estuaries edging it have a direct impact upon the environment of the coastal waters. The bight includes 15,000 square miles of ocean waters and the continental shelf off the coasts of New York and New Jersey.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548415","552107","547669","546625","549469","548010","558051","551527","547703","557096","542804","548941","552598","548098","557106","543087"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["river","bridge","suspension","engineering","route","cable","vantage","cliff","shoreline","tower"]}
