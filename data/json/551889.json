{"path":"551889.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in a subway station. The perspective is from platform level, showing a train that has just arrived or is ready to depart. The train, occupying the right side of the frame, appears modern with large windows and clearly marked with destination information and carriage numbers, including \"2nd class\" indicators. It is painted in a muted, pale color, possibly grey or light beige, with dark window frames and text detailing like \"DB München\" and \"München,\" suggesting it is part of the German railway system, specifically from Munich.\n\nOn the left, the platform extends into the distance, receding under a gently curving, white ceiling that's lined with what appear to be fluorescent lights casting a soft glow. The floor is paved with rectangular tiles, contributing to the clean and orderly appearance of the station.\n\nThere is one visible person, standing by the center doors of the train, creating a focal point of human presence. This person, possibly a man, wears a wide-brimmed hat and a coat, suggesting a cool climate or season. His posture and location suggest he might be either entering or exiting the train, interacting with a bag placed on the ground beside him—likely preparing to board the train or having just alighted.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is somewhat quiet and calm, highlighted by the lack of crowd and the soft, artificial lighting. The composition uses lines—the edge of the platform, train, and ceiling—to draw the eye towards the vanishing point in the distance, enhancing the depth and perspective of the subway station environment.","title":"At this station, trains are entered from one side, while departures are made from the opposite side.
