{"path":"545798.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a breathtaking landscape, presumably of a canyon area, possibly in the American Southwest. The focal point of the image is a winding river, which snakes through a rugged canyon. The river appears luminous and reflective, indicating either sunrise or sunset, which casts dramatic shadows and highlights across the scene. The canyon walls exhibit a variety of red, orange, and brown hues, suggesting layers of sedimentary rock.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left side of the image, there's a sharply defined peak or rock formation that appears dark against the lighter backlit sky. This rock formation stands prominently, casting a shadow on the canyon floor.\n\nThe horizon is marked by a relatively clear sky with sparse cloud cover, which adds depth to the panoramic vista. The clouds are softly illuminated from above, which indicates an evening or morning light scenario.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on the vastness and dramatic natural beauty of the canyon landscape, emphasized by the contrast between the sunlit high points and the deeper, shadowed valleys formed by the river's course through the terrain. No human activity or presence is visible in the scene, enhancing the sense of remote, untouched wilderness.","title":"Deadhorse Point State Park with view of the Colorado River Gorge","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545765","545301","545787","545796","544748","545794","545750","544950","545799","545761","545800","545764","545633","544745","544929","545802"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["canyon","rock","river","formation","vista","course","point","cloud","sunrise","highlight"]}
