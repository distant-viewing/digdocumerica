{"path":"544502.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an elevated view of an industrial area leading into a dense residential landscape extending towards a distant horizon where land meets sky. The foreground prominently features what appears to be a large mining or excavation site, characterized by large patches of exposed white earth and multiple water-filled pits; one particularly large pit in the foreground has a distinct turquoise color. Nested near this pit is a crane, possibly utilized for mining operations, emphasized by its contrasting dark silhouette against the pale substrate.\n\nSweeping, curved paths of white possibly suggest vehicular movement around the site or demarcate different sections of the operation. Just beyond the industrial scene, a broad, lush green vegetated area serves as a buffer before transitioning into the densely packed urban environment. The urban area, densely filled with buildings, streets, and patches of greenery, fans out across the mid to far section of the image, showing a typical suburban sprawl with clusters of closely set homes and other structures.\n\nIn the distance, the urban landscape blends into a body of water, creating a natural edge to the human settlement visible. Along the horizon, the sky is fairly clear with patches of clouds dotting above, suggesting a bright, possibly sunny day. The photograph hints at the juxtaposition of heavy industrial activity directly adjacent to residential life, encapsulating themes of development, land use, and environmental management in urban fringe areas.","title":"Saga development","placename":"Perrine (Fla.)","location":"Perrine, Florida","nn1":["544059","551174","554808","552004","542935","555812","556467","549523","547225","545354","555755","545013","550573","554763","544498","551612"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["pit","mining","fringe","buffer","fan","sprawl","patch","site","section","land"]}
