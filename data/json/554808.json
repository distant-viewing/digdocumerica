{"path":"554808.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged landscape that has signs of both residential living and industrial operations. It features a vast open pit area with visible layers of earth and mining activities. We can see several areas where the earth has been heavily dug into, creating an uneven, disrupted ground texture.\n\nIn the midst of this somewhat barren mining zone, there is a residential area with houses that appear to be typical of mid-20th century American architecture, painted in various light shades, and each with their own distinct yards. These homes are scattered across the hills, following the curvilinear patterns of the roads that snake through the landscape. \n\nThe scene also includes sparse vegetation, mostly low shrubs and a few trees, which are leafless, suggesting that the season might be fall or winter. A bridge, likely a part of the infrastructure to support mining activities, is noticeable and spans a section of the pit. \n\nIn the background, the terrain rises gently into rolling hills that stretch out under a sky filled with large, fluffy clouds, suggesting variability in the weather, possibly a mix of sun and cloud. This juxtaposition of industrial activity with residential life and natural elements creates a dynamic and complex tableau that speaks to the human impact on natural landscapes.","title":"This area was stripped twenty years ago and has been unproductive since, off route 9","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["544059","544418","554816","550568","556467","544502","549167","554763","549242","554768","549148","543848","543758","554765","543857","554811"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","pit","variability","dug","earth","tableau","hill","cloud","midst","hom"]}
