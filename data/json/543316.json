{"path":"543316.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural setting along a coastal hike. It shows two individuals on a narrow dirt trail surrounded by lush vegetation, including a proliferation of wildflowers with pops of orange and green foliage. The people, both of whom appear to be women, are engaged in observing or interacting with the environment. The woman in the foreground wears a dark cap, a black top, a brown jacket tied around her waist, and is carrying a yellow backpack. She is slightly bending forward, looking towards the other woman, who is further up the trail. This second woman, wearing a gray top and pink pants, is bent over, closely examining or handling some of the flora.\n\nThe background of the photograph features a stunning coastal view with rugged cliffs that descend to a shoreline where waves can be seen breaking against the rocks. The ocean extends to the horizon under a partially cloudy sky. The landscape conveys a remote and peaceful ambiance, enhancing the sense of being immersed in nature. The scene suggests a moment of exploration or hiking, with a focus on botanical interest and the enjoyment of a beautiful, natural environment.","title":"California--Shell Beach Point","placename":"Shell Beach (Pismo Beach, Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543248","543416","545768","553364","543389","543373","551942","543492","553755","545512","543203","545721","553373","543199","545772","543204"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["woman","trail","hike","pop","waist","backpack","hiking","wildflower","flora","enjoyment"]}
