{"path":"544508.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an expansive natural landscape dominated by tire tracks crisscrossing a flat, grassy terrain. The image captures a broad view of the land, which stretches out to the horizon. The patterns created by the numerous tire tracks are dense and complex, forming intertwining lines that cover the entire visible field. These track patterns suggest significant vehicular movement over the grass.\n\nIn the middle distance, there are a few isolated trees and patches of shrubbery scattered across the landscape, emphasizing the vastness and relatively undisturbed nature of the area. The distant horizon is flat and featureless, accentuating the openness of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, taken from a high vantage point, provides a sense of scale and depicts the impact of human activity on a natural landscape. The photograph likely aims to showcase either land-use, environmental impact, or patterns of movement in a remote area. The top-left corner of the image has a very faded appearance, possibly due to sun glare or a reflection affecting the camera lens at the time of capture.","title":"Swamp buggy tracks in Big Cypress Swamp","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555882","549180","549179","555812","555883","545604","555873","549170","549181","555887","543112","555861","555881","550397","547523","550598"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["track","tire","glare","pattern","movement","lens","impact","land","intertwine","shrubbery"]}
