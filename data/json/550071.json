{"path":"550071.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a lively urban park scene under a clear blue sky. The view is comprised of a well-maintained lawn scattered with numerous people who are either sitting or lying down, enjoying the pleasant sunny day. Various groups and solitary individuals can be observed; some are engaged in conversation, while others are reading or simply soaking up the sun.\n\nIn the center of the image is an abstract modern sculpture, which is a blend of white and deep orange-red colors, highlighted against the greenery of the grass. This sculptural piece adds a touch of artistic flair to the urban setting.\n\nSurrounding the park are towering office buildings. The architecture is typical of mid-20th-century commercial design, characterised by clean, straight lines and large windows. One of these buildings has a banner on its facade announcing \"MODEL OFFICE OPEN - 777-1500\", suggesting that this picture might be taken in a newly developed or commercialized area aiming to attract business tenants.\n\nPeople in the scene are dressed in casual, light attire suitable for a warm day, indicating that the season is probably spring or summer. The overall atmosphere is relaxed and cheerful, depicting a common urban scene where people escape to patches of nature to find respite from their indoor routines.","title":"Lunch break at Chester Commons, popular mini-park in busy downtown area","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550075","557257","556296","550074","550302","544808","549926","551713","551733","557262","549516","557263","551772","550752","550751","551771"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["respite","flair","park","sculpture","banner","routine","lawn","office","spring","summer"]}
