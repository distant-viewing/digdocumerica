{"path":"543732.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph portrays a wintry rural scene featuring a herd of cattle against a backdrop of a snowy landscape. In the foreground, several black cattle, possibly of a beef breed, slowly traverse from left to right across the snow-covered ground. The focus on the cattle is sharp, highlighting their black and white coloring against the predominantly white ground.\n\nIn the background, a larger herd of cattle can be seen in a more linear formation moving across the field parallel to a fence line. The terrain is slightly rolling, and the snow cover gives the landscape a muted, uniform look. Several leafless trees and low hills dot the distant horizons, contributing to the image's sense of depth and openness.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the scene and enhancing the chilly, quiet atmosphere typical of a snowy day in a pastoral setting. The overall composition evokes a sense of calm and the routine nature of farm life even in the depth of winter.","title":"Cattle","placename":"Middle Park (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552557","548984","542626","557022","545153","555538","557012","550833","554560","552676","557193","552465","553100","544535","543318","552566"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cattle","herd","snow","breed","traverse","coloring","openness","depth","calm","farm"]}
