{"path":"546801.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photo depicts an industrial or water treatment setting, characterized by several large, rectangular pools filled with water. These pools are interconnected through a network of overhead pipes and structures that are possibly facilitating the movement or treatment of water. Spraying devices seem to be present in the pools, perhaps to aerate the water.\n\nIn the background, there is a single-story building with a classical architectural design featuring a symmetric façade with several windows and a central entrance, topped by a tiled roof. The building’s position suggests it could be an administration or control center for the facility.\n\nThere is a parking area adjacent to the building, where several cars are parked, indicating the presence of workers or visitors. Beyond the facility, a line of trees can be seen, which might suggest a boundary or provide a screen from the surrounding area.\n\nThe setting here is typical of a water treatment plant or a similar utility facility, where large volumes of liquid are processed or managed. The infrastructure and technology shown are indicative of methods used in such facilities to ensure efficient processing and control of water. The environment appears cold as evident from what seems like snow on the ground and the vehicles.","title":"Trickling filters at the Back River Sewage Treatment Plant this is the primary treatment facility for the Baltimore area.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["545840","548212","543568","548151","543571","543574","545836","546895","547262","543572","553837","542988","548137","543570","547239","547568"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["treatment","pool","facility","control","water","screen","interconnect","method","volume","ensure"]}
