{"path":"544873.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a striking landscape composed of several contrasting natural elements. In the foreground, there is a vast, flat grassland terrain, presenting a dry and rugged appearance, primarily composed of brown and tan hues with patches of grass distributed throughout.\n\nThe middle portion of the photo showcases an exquisite series of sand dunes. These dunes are smooth and have a soft, velvety texture evident from their gentle curves and ridges. The color of the sand shifts subtly between shades of light pink and beige, contrasting beautifully with the darker shades surrounding them.\n\nCapturing the backdrop is a majestic range of mountains. These mountains display rugged, sharp peaks, some of which are capped with snow, suggesting higher altitudes and colder temperatures. The stark white of the snow stands out against the dark, rocky textures of the mountain surfaces below.\n\nOverall, the composition layers these distinct elements—grassland, sand dunes, and snow-capped mountains—creating a diverse and dynamic landscape that highlights the natural beauty and variety of the region. The photograph has a serene yet awe-inspiring quality, showcasing the quiet majesty of untouched natural environments.","title":"Great Sand Dunes National Monument","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550490","553994","544874","545895","544745","547717","545843","552442","545199","550441","550592","544878","555666","550415","544027","545771"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["dune","sand","grassland","snow","mountain","majesty","temperature","shift","awe","pink"]}
