{"path":"548250.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph depicts two men working on a large boat named \"WALTER JR,\" which is prominently painted in white letters on the side of the boat's bow. The boat is painted light green with a red strip and a vertical red line near the bow. It is propped up on dry land, suggesting it is possibly in a shipyard or a boat repair area.\n\nOne man is standing on a makeshift scaffold made of wooden planks, working on the hull near the waterline. He appears to be painting or performing some kind of maintenance. The other man is on top of the boat, at the edge of the roof of the cabin; he is bent over as if inspecting or fixing something near the roof or possibly cleaning.\n\nThe surroundings are slightly blurred and indistinct, but there appears to be a body of water and possibly hills or a wooded area in the background, suggesting a coastal or riverside setting. The day seems overcast, providing soft and diffused lighting, which casts gentle shadows on the boat and the surrounding area.","title":"Rockport fishermen repair their lobster boat","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["546852","546818","546802","551986","549590","552863","547246","546858","551228","551046","546758","549591","552115","552120","552149","547941"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","bow","paint","scaffold","waterline","shipyard","prop","fix","clean","riverside"]}
