{"path":"555383.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a stark and striking natural landscape. In the foreground, an exposed lakebed is visible, dotted with numerous tree stumps and scattered rocks. The stumps, weathered and eroded, are remnants of trees that once stood there, now appearing as ghostly sentinels of a submerged forest. The terrain is rugged and uneven with various sizes of stones and pebbles scattered throughout the dried mud.\n\nThe middle ground gives way to a large body of water, reflecting a deep blue color that contrasts sharply with the earthy tones of the lakebed. This body of water is nestled in a valley surrounded by steep hills.\n\nIn the background, the hills rise steeply to form a mountainous landscape, densely forested with evergreen trees. The mountains create an impressive backdrop, displaying varying shades of green and brown, and suggesting a rich, untouched wilderness. The sky above is a clear, vibrant blue, indicating either an early morning or late afternoon setting, given the gentle lighting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a sense of serene desolation and the stark beauty of nature, where water and land dramatically meet, emphasized by the remnants of a forest flooded long ago.","title":"Detroit lake shown at an alltime low in the fall of 1973 due to sparse snowfall and rain the year before.
