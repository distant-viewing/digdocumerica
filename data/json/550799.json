{"path":"550799.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in a waste disposal area or dump. In the foreground, a large, prominent white refrigerator lies on its side, with its door ajar and facing upwards, revealing a dark interior. Slightly behind and to the right of it stands a rusty black metal cabinet, upright but with its door open revealing an empty, dilapidated interior.\n\nScattered around the base of these appliances are various forms of rubbish and smaller discarded items, including what appears to be a small television or monitor, several plastic containers, pieces of paper, and other miscellaneous debris. These items litter the ground and contribute to the overall impression of neglect and disarray.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate area of the dump, a dense forest of green trees is visible, providing a natural backdrop to the scene of human-generated waste. This juxtaposition highlights the contrast between the natural environment and the environmental impact of waste disposal practices.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a neglected, untidy state of waste management, sitting starkly against the more serene, natural forest environment, which underscores themes of environmental concern and the impact of human activities on natural surroundings.","title":"Town of enterprize dump, in oneida county--on banks of Wisconsin river","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["543589","550798","546822","557307","551247","550801","551245","544823","554541","552102","549750","552089","553869","544640","547983","549936"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","disposal","dump","interior","refrigerator","television","appliance","door","reveal","rubbish"]}
