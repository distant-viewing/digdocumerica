{"path":"552045.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene by a body of water, likely a river or large lake. On the left side of the image, two women are seen engaged in a fishing activity. The woman closest to the camera is seated on a bench, wearing a white top, black sunglasses, and a straw hat, smiling as she looks up. Beside her, standing on a small stone ledge by the water's edge, is another woman dressed in a patterned shirt, khaki pants, and white slip-on shoes. She is wearing a white bucket hat and is actively casting a fishing line into the water, seemingly focused on her task.\n\nTo the right of the image, a sleek white motorboat with a black trim is cruising along the water. It is equipped with closed windows and there seems to be at least one person visible inside, piloting the boat. \n\nThe background features a clear blue sky with minimal clouds and further back there is a view of a landscape that includes trees and industrial structures. Notably, there is a metal bridge in the distance, possibly a railway or highway bridge, spanning across the water. This setting suggests a popular recreational area designed for various water-related activities, offering both leisure and picturesque scenery.","title":"Boating and fishing are popular sports on the Niagara River.","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["553081","552317","551350","552026","544260","550851","544216","548743","546972","548499","546079","546976","546001","549935","552308","546053"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","slip","water","woman","pilot","cruise","khaki","motorboat","hat","ledge"]}
