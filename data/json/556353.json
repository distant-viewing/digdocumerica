{"path":"556353.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a cluttered, dimly lit setting with various old and worn-out mechanical parts and tools in a state of disarray. On the left side of the image, there is a dirty, rusty, irregularly shaped metal part with visible holes that might have been part of some machinery. Next to it lies a pile consisting of smaller mechanical components, scraps, bolts, and possibly broken pieces of metal and wood.\n\nIn the center and right side of the photo, there are parts of what appears to be wooden flooring or slatted base, showing signs of age and wear. A metal dustpan filled with debris can be seen at the centre-bottom of the image. Against the right wall stands a vertical, rusty, metal object which could be part of some tool or structural component.\n\nFurther details enhancing the scene include a metal hinge or securing bracket mounted on the surface towards the right, adding to the sense of an industrial or workshop environment. The overall darkness and the unorganized state of the items contribute to a neglected or abandoned atmosphere in the imagery. No people are visible in the scene, which focuses entirely on the objects and their state of decay and disuse.","title":"Abandoned tool shop at a now closed mine near Richlands Virginia, in the southwestern tip of the state.
