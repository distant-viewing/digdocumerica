{"path":"550091.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph features two men engaged in a conversation in a wet, outdoor setting. The ground is mostly paved, and scattered puddles reflect the overcast sky, indicating recent rain. On the left, a man is seen from the back; he's dressed in simple dark suspenders over a light shirt, a pair of trousers, and wears a straw hat. Facing him on the right, another man is partially visible; he is wearing a dark uniform, possibly denoting some official role, and a white brimmed hat.\n\nBehind the men, a lineup of horse-drawn carriages is visible, parked along a fence. These carriages have traditional spoke wheels and are hitched to horses ready for riding. Each carriage is equipped with a dark canopy, and horses appear calm and secured to the carriages.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment likely at a place where these carriages are used for transport or touring, reflecting a rustic or historical ambiance. The environment suggests a setting that preserves older modes of transportation, possibly for the sake of tourism or cultural heritage.","title":"Amish horse and wagons in Middlefield","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550098","549682","550087","550095","557050","551872","554860","557854","553114","547382","549292","551717","551933","542562","549667","555563"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["carriage","horse","tourism","lineup","riding","mode","suspender","denote","man","heritage"]}
