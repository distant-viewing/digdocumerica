{"path":"555054.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dense, lush forest scene rich with a variety of flora. The picture mainly focuses on the forest undergrowth and the base of towering trees. The foreground showcases several types of vegetation, predominantly featuring ferns, which exhibit their classic feather-like fronds, and a dense cover of small-leaved shrubs.\n\nOne notable aspect is a large tree trunk positioned to the right of the frame, showing a rough bark partially covered in moss, highlighting the moisture-rich environment of the forest. To the left and middle ground of the image, there are numerous other trees, largely obscured by the thick underbrush but suggesting a forest of considerable depth due to the fading visibility of the trees in the distance.\n\nThe color palette is dominated by dark and earthy greens, with patches of brown from the tree trunks and the soil, showing a natural environment with minimal human interference. The lighting seems to be dim, possibly due to an overcast sky or the density of the forest canopy barring much of the sunlight. The overall mood conveyed is serene and somewhat mystic, as often associated with dense wooded areas. The composition successfully gives a viewer the sense of being enveloped by nature, offering a glimpse into the serene and intricate ecosystem of a forest environment.","title":"Salal growing in a climax Sitka spruce forest in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555043","545285","555057","555000","554957","554961","555028","554978","554425","545271","554975","554976","555058","554958","554980","542958"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","trunk","interference","frond","underbrush","tree","feather","fern","undergrowth","bar"]}
