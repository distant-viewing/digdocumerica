{"path":"551952.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a city street scene possibly during road construction or roadway improvement activities. The central focus of the image is an urban road filled with vehicles and lined with imposing buildings barely visible in the shadowy backdrop. The lighting suggests it might be early morning or late afternoon, contributing to the shadows lengthening across the tarmac.\n\nThe foreground prominently displays a road sign with bold black lettering on a white background, stating \"KEEP LEFT,\" with a black left-pointing arrow beneath the text. This sign is angled towards the viewer, placed next to a conical mound of dirt perhaps excavated from the roadside, indicating ongoing construction work. \n\nBehind this mound, partially lined up in the middle of the road, are a series of vehicles, mostly cars in various shadesâ€”silver, black, and a hint of color possibly from reflections. Noteworthy is an orange truck positioned on the far right lane of the road, parallel to a second, similar colored truck seen further down, creating a visual alignment in the composition. The trucks, possibly involved in the construction activities, are heavy-duty types common to urban construction projects.\n\nThe composition leverages the depth of the road stretching forward, guiding the viewer's eye through the vehicles lined horizontally. This arrangement, together with the positioning of the sign, effectively channels the viewer's attention towards the navigational aid amidst a busy street scene. The presence of mature trees and traffic lights intermittently intersperses the buildings in the background, hinting at an established urban setting. The image subtly conveys themes of regulation, urban maintenance, and daily commuting rush in a metropolitan environment.","title":"Work crew installs new water main on Sheridan Road in Rogers Park, slowing early morning traffic toward the Loop.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["553681","549902","549886","556195","556732","547776","552710","549879","553886","554309","545451","555450","552711","548342","546716","546370"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["road","construction","truck","mound","viewer","tarmac","commuting","vehicle","aid","rush"]}
