{"path":"545480.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man in a clinical or laboratory setting. He stands next to a large piece of scientific equipment, actively engaged in an activity involving the equipment. The man is bespectacled with short grey hair, donning a blue and white patterned short-sleeve shirt and dark pants. He is depicted using a mouthpiece connected to a flexible silver tube, which in turn is connected to the main apparatus.\n\nThe equipment he is engaged with includes two main sections. On the left there is a larger blue cylindrical tank with another silver cylindrical unit on the top from which the tube extends. To the right of the first tank, there is a pale blue structure supporting a vertical paper chart recorder, which consists of a cylindrical white drum upon which graph paper is mounted, likely recording data from the tests being conducted.\n\nIn the background, there are basic elements of an indoor setting, like a beige wall and a visible doorway. The room seems functional and is minimally furnished, directing the focus towards the man and the apparatus. On the edge of the image and slightly out of focus, one can perceive additional objects which could be other equipment or bottles, hinting at a scientific or medical research environment.","title":"After a lifetime of working in a cotton factory, mr.
