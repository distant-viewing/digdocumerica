{"path":"555002.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph presents a mystic and eerie forest scene dominated by a dramatic image of dead or dying trees. Central to the image is a large, weathered tree trunk with jagged, broken edges that expose its inner textures. This main trunk has multiple thick, twisted branches stemming out from it, elongated and snaking through the composition like tendrils. Some branches seem to reach outwards as if grasping, while others curl inward, adding to the overall haunted appearance.\n\nThe color palette is quite somber, dominated by deep hues of blue and gray which enhance the melancholy and surreal atmosphere. The foliage appears thick and tangled in the background, comprising darker shaded leaves and branches which blur together, providing a dense backdrop that emphasizes the stark forms of the dead trees.\n\nThe trees and branches are cloaked in what might be moss or lichen, suggesting a damp environment that is possibly deep within a forest. The lighting is subdued, perhaps indicative of an overcast day or a shady area, casting soft yet distinct shadows that add depth and texture to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition and the elements within this photograph evoke a sense of desolation, with a haunting beauty rendered through the intricate details and textures of the deadwood against the dark, lush background. There is a stillness to the image, echoing a quiet and remote wildness.","title":"Typical wind blown coastal spruce forest with Random western cedars throughout on an ocean strip in the Pacific coast area of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554973","543843","555122","553579","553578","544241","552551","554976","557622","546065","555151","557601","546121","553574","543487","553625"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["branch","trunk","wildness","lichen","texture","forest","tree","desolation","moss","stillness"]}
