{"path":"545437.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a sweeping view of a residential and industrial landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, judging by the soft lighting. In the foreground, there is a dense array of trees which provide a frame at the bottom and left side of the image, partially obscuring the view but giving a natural border to the scene.\n\nThe middle ground features a row of closely packed houses, characterized by peaked roofs and visible front porches. These houses seem to be part of a tightly knit community, likely a working-class neighborhood given their uniform appearance and compact placement. There is a street visible in front of these houses, dotted with a few cars that appear to be from the mid-20th century, suggesting the photo's vintage nature. The street is quiet and devoid of any visible activity, adding a serene quality to the scene.\n\nFurther back, dominating the center and right portion of the background, is a large industrial area. Notably, there is a tall smokestack emitting a significant amount of smoke, contributing to a somewhat grimy atmosphere that contrasts with the natural and residential parts of the image. The industrial facilities are large, with structures that suggest heavy manufacturing, possibly a steel mill, characteristic of mid-20th century American industrial zones.\n\nThe landscape extends to a hilly horizon, shrouded slightly by haze, possibly due to the industrial activity or the time of day. This backdrop provides depth and a sense of scale, contrasting the man-made and natural environments captured in the photograph. The scene overall captures a moment in time in an American town where residential life and heavy industry coexist, enclosed by natural elements.","title":"Smog blacks out houses near industrial plants","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["557303","557213","551146","551074","557225","557224","551050","545388","551049","551145","550728","557378","551174","551075","545268","546705"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["house","class","century","knit","coexist","placement","street","mill","time","shroud"]}
