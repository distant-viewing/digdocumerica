{"path":"548409.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph features an aerial view of one of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City during its construction phase. It captures the top portion of the tower, showing its flat roof with a partially constructed section that includes cranes and other construction equipment. The external structure of the building appears almost complete, covered in numerous window panels that exhibit a reddish hue, distinct against the urban backdrop.\n\nBelow the towering structure, various other smaller buildings can be seen surrounding the area, part of the dense urban landscape of Lower Manhattan. The tower casts a long shadow over these adjacent structures, emphasizing its immense size. Additionally, the image showcases an extensive panoramic view of the city stretching towards the north, showing the densely packed streets and buildings of Manhattan. Major avenues can be recognized, leading the viewer's eye through the cityscape up to the distant horizon where the city meets the sky.\n\nVisible in the background to the left is the Hudson River, which runs parallel to the extensive grid of city streets. The opposite shore of the river is also visible, along with scattered clouds hanging over the river and parts of the city, adding a slightly overcast feel to the atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"Lower Manhattan and the Hudson River.
