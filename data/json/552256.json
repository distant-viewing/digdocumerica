{"path":"552256.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape juxtaposed with a natural water scene. In the foreground, there is a large body of water, which appears calm, with gentle ripples. On the water, there is a duck followed by several ducklings swimming in a line, which adds a peaceful, serene element to the scene.\n\nIn the middle ground, on the opposite shore of the river or lake, is an array of electrical infrastructure. There are multiple electrical towers and transmission lines prominently stretching across the image. These structures are large and metallic, with a complex array of wires and electrical components visible. They stand stark against a backdrop of trees and vegetation, hinting at a boundary where industrial activity meets natural landscapes.\n\nIn the distant background, further trees and maybe additional elements of the industrial or semi-urban landscape can be seen. The overall composition features a contrast between the industrial equipment and the natural elements, presenting a scene that blends both man-made and natural environments. The color palette is muted with blues, grays, and greens dominating, suggesting it might be either early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Mallard ducks on the Duwamish River, which flows into Puget Sound at Seattle","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["544695","545996","552040","546974","544673","545862","550753","546395","545167","545854","544675","543903","556504","550684","546054","544289"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["array","dominating","duck","transmission","line","boundary","wire","component","ripple","gray"]}
