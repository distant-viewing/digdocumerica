{"path":"555559.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The image shows a muddy landscape, possibly a construction or excavation site near a small body of water. There's a narrow, muddy water canal at the forefront, surrounded by heaps of freshly dug earth piled up along the sides of the canal, giving the scene a rugged, disrupted appearance. The water in the canal appears muddy and stagnant, likely influenced by the adjacent soil disturbance.\n\nGrass and wild vegetation border the excavation area, with sporadic white flowers visible among the greenery, suggesting a somewhat rural or semi-wild environment. Notably, a rusty red pipe runs alongside the canal, partially buried under the mounds of soil, indicating some form of industrial or agricultural activity. \n\nThe setting is overcast, with a dull light that saturates the colors, casting a muted tone over the scene. There are no visible buildings or people; the focus is entirely on the environmental and man-made changes in the terrain.","title":"EPA authorities were called upon to supervise cleanup when a Pennwalt Corporation chemical storage building was desTroyed by fire June 20, 1974.
