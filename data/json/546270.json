{"path":"546270.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a man engaged in an activity that involves handling marine or aquatic life, specifically shellfish. He is standing over several wooden tanks that contain what appear to be oysters. The tanks are fitted with glass and metal fixtures likely designed to regulate water flow or maintain specific environmental conditions, which suggests this setting could be a research facility or an aquaculture operation.\n\nThe man is bald and sports a beard. He wears a red t-shirt, a gray apron, and holds an oyster in one hand, examining it closely, perhaps checking its health or development. His focused expression and careful handling indicate a hands-on approach and attention to detail in his work.\n\nThe tanks are neatly arranged in a row, each filled with numerous oysters, and the water in the tanks is visibly aerated, likely to keep it oxygenated. The facility has nondescript green walls and a technical ambience, emphasized by visible tubes, gauges, and other equipment, which might control or monitor the environmental parameters within the tanks.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a moment of scientific or commercial care and assessment of marine life, combining elements of marine biology and aquaculture in a meticulously maintained facility setting.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory: the bioassay wet lab.
