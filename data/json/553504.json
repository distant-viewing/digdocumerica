{"path":"553504.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph features a young man standing outdoors with a slightly introspective or distant expression. He is shirtless, revealing multiple tattoos on his arms and torso. One prominent tattoo on his upper arm reads \"HARVEST\" and there are other markings that resemble signatures or handwritten words.\n\nThe young man has curly, tousled hair and is smoking a cigarette, which he holds to his lips with his right hand. His gaze is directed downward and away from the camera, suggesting a moment of reflection or pause.\n\nHe is wearing dark pants and a chain bracelet on his left wrist, which also has tattoos. The background is softly blurred but hints at a leafy, green environment with trees. Overall, there is a casual, perhaps contemplative atmosphere captured in the image, with the focus primarily on the expression and body art of the young man. The moody lighting and the subdued color palette enhance the introspective quality of the photograph.","title":"Harold, a mulky square boy who says that he spent a year at the Missouri boys' reformatory in boonville, shows off his smoking style and his tattoos.
