{"path":"552669.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a moment at what appears to be a farm. In the foreground, a large, predominantly white cow with brown patches is standing on the left side, facing slightly towards the camera. The cow has a rope halter around its head. On the right, a person, appearing to be a woman, is actively engaged in handling the cow. She wears a cowboy hat, a striped, long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, and boots, suggesting a rugged, outdoor activity-style outfit typical of a ranch or farm setting.\n\nThe woman is adjusting or holding a hose, which loops around on the muddy ground, likely used for washing or drinking purposes for the cow. A brush is also visible on the ground near the cow's front hoof, indicating that grooming may be part of the activity being performed.\n\nThe background of the image shows an overcast sky and a flat, open landscape with sparse vegetation, which is typical of rural, possibly arid regions. There's a mood of practical engagement and care in the scene, centered around the routine of farm work involving livestock. The photo emits a sense of rural life and the intimate, hands-on interaction between a farmer and her animal.","title":"Garfield County Fair.
