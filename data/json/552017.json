{"path":"552017.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph depicts a peaceful and shady cemetery, likely taken on a sunny day due to the patches of sunlight filtering through the abundance of tall dense trees. The setting features a variety of gravestones, which vary in shape and size â€“ some appear as traditional upright headstones while others are more elaborate, including a few tall obelisks.\n\nThere are several individuals visible in the scene, dispersed around different parts of the cemetery, seemingly engaged in different activities, such as looking at the gravestones or possibly tending to graves. The people seem to be of varied ages, including what may be a family with younger individuals.\n\nIn the background, there is a view of a large reddish-brown brick building, possibly a church or mausoleum, with a white arched entry. The surrounding area is lush with grass and shaded areas cast by the trees, enhancing the serene and contemplative atmosphere typical of a cemetery. The overall composition of the photograph combines elements of nature, architecture, and human presence, interweaving themes of memory, respect, and tranquility.","title":"St. Peter's Episcopal Church and graveyard in Perth Amboy during the Revolutionary War this historic church, originally built in 1702, was bombarded by the British from Staten Island","placename":"New Jersey","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552451","554792","557942","552016","550364","548239","557184","554790","546147","552487","547420","547417","557089","550731","550365","554824"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cemetery","gravestone","headstone","respect","grave","memory","entry","abundance","church","family"]}
