{"path":"548128.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph features an industrial setting, possibly a paper mill, located near a body of water and surrounded by forested hills. On the left side of the image, there is a large circular water treatment or sedimentation tank with what appears to be a revolving mechanical structure in its center. Adjacent to this tank is a grey building that forms part of the larger industrial facility.\n\nTowards the middle and right part of the image, several interconnected buildings can be seen. These structures come in different shapes and sizes, some with flat roofs and others with slanted ones, and they are predominantly white and beige with sections comprising metal siding. Smokestacks protrude from a couple of these buildings, emitting white and gray smoke into the sky.\n\nA small boat is docked along the edge of the wall that borders the water, near the foreground. In the water, logs are scattered and floating, indicating log handling or processing activities typical in paper mills.\n\nThe background is characterized by lush, green hills partially covered in trees, under a partly cloudy sky. The overall scene presents a busy industrial operation, nestled within a natural environment, illustrating a juxtaposition of industrial activity with the surrounding natural landscape.","title":"Publisher's paper company at Oregon city, on the willamette river.
