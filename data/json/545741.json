{"path":"545741.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic river rafting scene. There are four individuals on a large inflatable raft navigating a turbulent, muddy river. The water is a rich brown color, likely indicating either a high silt content or recent rainfall that has stirred the riverbed.\n\nThe raft is light gray and appears well-equipped for the journey, with numerous ropes, bags, and possibly camping gear stored on board. The people on the raft are wearing safety gear suitable for water activities. Specifically, three of them have orange life vests, and all are wearing hats, likely for sun protection. One individual, who seems to be steering the raft with a paddle, is wearing a hat with a wide brim, possibly a cowboy hat.\n\nTheir expressions are focused and they seem to be working together to navigate through the river's currents and perhaps some unseen obstacles. Their attire and gear suggest preparation and experience with outdoor water activities.\n\nThe background is purely the river and the far riverbanks are not visible, focusing all attention on the action and teamwork taking place on the raft. The setting is isolated and purely natural, emphasizing the adventure aspect of their activity.","title":"A river trip into Canyonlands National Park conducted by Tag-Along-Tours of Moab.
