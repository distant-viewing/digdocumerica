{"path":"545730.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts an adventurous scene of river rafting. A person, appearing to be a man, is handling a small, motorized raft on a turbulent and muddy river. The individual is semi-nude, wearing only shorts, and is equipped with a life jacket. They are managing the raft with a great deal of concentration, navigating through the white-capped waves, suggesting rapid and somewhat dangerous waters.\n\nThe raft is equipped with several large barrels, likely containing supplies or gear for the journey, secured at various points on the craft. Behind the man, an outboard motor with a propeller can be seen, indicating that the raft has a motorized aid to help maneuver through the river's strong currents.\n\nThe background of the photograph features rocky banks and barren landscapes, presumably characteristic of a rugged, remote area. The rocky formations are predominantly brownish-red and provide a stark contrast to the foamy brown water of the river. The overall composition captures a moment full of action and nature's challenging conditions, emphasized by the wilderness context and the evident concentration of the rafter.","title":"Shooting the rapids on the Colorado River south of Moab","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545741","545733","545737","549437","545729","549463","549439","549462","549440","549465","549441","549447","554462","544925","553336","549464"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["raft","river","concentration","propeller","rafting","aid","motor","craft","journey","supply"]}
