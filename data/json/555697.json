{"path":"555697.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures three salmon in shallow water over a pebble-covered riverbed. The image shows the fish submerged in clear water that allows visibility of the multicolored rocks below, ranging in hues from dark greens and browns to some hints of blue. The salmon appear to be dead or dying as they float at different angles, partially atop the rocks. Their condition is indicated by their partially tattered and lifeless bodies. The scene is likely a natural setting, possibly during the salmon spawning season, where the fish commonly swim upstream to their birthplaces to spawn, often resulting in natural exhaustion or death afterward. The image conveys a somber look at a cycle of life in nature, capturing a moment of stillness and quiet in the water's gentle flow.","title":"Salmon spawn in the streams that drain salt marshes such as this one outside Valdez.  Anadromous fish that begin their lives in clear freshwater mature during two to four years at sea, and then return to the streams in which they were born.  They constitute one of Alaska's richest renewable resources.  Sockeye salmon shown here will die after spawning.
