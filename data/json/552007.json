{"path":"552007.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial area located alongside a body of water. The image captures several distinct elements:\n\n1. **Water and Docks**: In the foreground, there is a muddy-colored waterway, surrounded by a number of wooden docks in various states of disrepair. The docks contain stacked timber and other materials, indicative of shipping or storage purposes.\n\n2. **Storage Tanks**: On the left side of the image, adjacent to the water, there are three large circular storage tanks on a concrete platform encircled by a fence. The tanks are metallic and likely used for storing oil, chemicals, or other industrial liquids.\n\n3. **Industrial Infrastructure**: Behind the storage tanks stretches a large industrial complex with multiple buildings, smokestacks, and other infrastructural elements. The presence of smokestacks suggests that the facilities might be involved in manufacturing or energy production.\n\n4. **Railway and Overpass**: A prominent raised railway or road overpass runs parallel to the waterway. This structure appears to provide a key transportation route that cuts through the industrial area, likely facilitating the movement of goods and raw materials.\n\n5. **Background**: The distant background shows a densely packed urban or industrial area with numerous buildings and additional infrastructure, possibly indicating a larger city context surrounding this industrial site.\n\nThe overall impression given by the photograph is that of a heavy industrial zone, characterized by manufacturing, storage, and transportation facilities, situated near a water body to facilitate logistics operations. The area appears somewhat worn and aged, suggesting long-term industrial use.","title":"Petroleum shipping terminal at Perth Amboy on the Arthur Kill, showing oil slick from spill.
