{"path":"553887.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a street scene, capturing a moment involving two individuals engaged in different activities. \n\nTo the right of the frame, a male construction worker, wearing rugged, slightly torn blue jeans and a light blue T-shirt, is operating a large pneumatic drill or jackhammer on a city sidewalk. He wears a white hard hat, which indicates his role in a construction or maintenance job. The drill is connected by a hose, likely providing either air or hydraulic power.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a woman clad in a floral printed blouse and dark pants is seen walking past the construction area. She is covering her ears with her hands, a reaction possibly due to the loud noise produced by the jackhammer. The distress or discomfort caused by the noise is evident in her body language.\n\nThe background includes the fa√ßade of a building labeled \"AMERICAN SECURITY AND TRUST COMPANY 18th AND EYE STREETS OFFICE\" with the building number 1739 clearly displayed above the doorway. This provides a clue about the location of the photograph.\n\nThe scene is cordoned off with a barrier tape featuring alternating black and white stripes, adding a layer of safety and division between the construction work and the pedestrian pathway.\n\nThe overall atmosphere captured reflects a typical urban environment where construction and daily life intersect, marked by the interaction between the noise and activity of construction and the passing city dwellers. The color palette is vivid, bringing out the stark contrasts between the worker's attire and activity versus the ordinary flow of city life around him.","title":"Subway construction in downtown Washington.
