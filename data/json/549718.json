{"path":"549718.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"The photograph depicts a young woman seated on what appears to be a large silver-colored curved metal slide or sculpture that has wave-like structures, with each ridge sharply defined, creating a pattern that repeats uniformly across the frame. The slide is reflective, mirroring the gray overcast sky above.\n\nThe woman is dressed in a casual, snug light-gray turtleneck shirt and dark trousers, suggesting a cool environment. She is holding onto what looks like a large, rough-textured beige or light brown sack or jacket, preparing possibly to slide or just sitting and holding it. Her expression is joyful and vivacious, with a broad smile on her face, enhancing the playful, carefree atmosphere of the image.\n\nHer hair is styled in an afro, each side symmetrically fluffed out, which complements the overall joyful, youthful theme of the photograph. The background, owing to the perspective of the shot, focuses almost entirely on the slide, emphasizing its form and the repeated patterns, thereby drawing attention to both the subject and the structure she interacts with. No distinct horizon or other objects are visible in the background, which focuses the viewer's attention solely on the woman and her immediate setting.","title":"Super-slide at amusement park on Bob-Lo Island","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["547192","556143","553156","551448","556139","548291","544742","553223","544747","556142","553191","553499","552700","556134","549674","546223"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["slide","repeat","woman","afro","turtleneck","sack","sculpture","beige","silver","attention"]}
