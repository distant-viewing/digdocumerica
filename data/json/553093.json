{"path":"553093.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals engaged in activities on a vast expanse of sandy farmland, with a mountainous backdrop under a partly cloudy sky. The image captures a moment of rural life, possibly implying agricultural work.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, a man stands prominently in the foreground. He is of stocky build, wears a plaid button-up shirt with short sleeves, light blue jeans, and casual shoes. His expression shows slight concern or focus as he holds a shovel with both hands, resting it upright in front of him, leaning slightly on it. His gaze appears directed towards the viewer, suggesting an interrupted moment.\n\nTo the right and slightly to the back, another individual, with their back to the viewer, stands at the rim of a hole in the ground. This person seems to be inspecting something inside the hole. The person is dressed in a long-sleeved black top, gray pants, and shoes suitable for rough terrain. Their hair is long, and it flows down their back, indicating movement and activity.\n\nThe scene is set in an arid region as indicated by the sandy soil and distant mountains with minimal vegetation. The field itself is flat and expansive, with tire tracks suggesting recent vehicle movementâ€”possibly related to farming activities. There are a few scattered patches of greenery, but the dominant color theme is earthy tones under a vast sky that occupies the top third of the image, conveying openness and a remote setting.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the activities and the environment, highlighting rural, agricultural life and possibly the challenges associated with it in arid conditions. The presence of the mountain range adds a dramatic natural border and enhances the sense of isolation of the setting.","title":"Buddy vidovich planting an alfalfa field.
