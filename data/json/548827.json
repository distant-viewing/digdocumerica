{"path":"548827.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a multi-lane highway as it extends vertically through the frame. The highway appears surrounded by a variety of agricultural fields showing different stages or types of cultivation; some fields are lush and green, while others are brown or bare earth. Notably, there are adjacent parcels of land with varied uses and crops that produce a quilt-like pattern of geometric shapes in shades of green, brown, and beige.\n\nOn the left side of the highway, there is a large, rectangular body of water, its surface reflecting light. To the right of the highway, it is possible to see rows that suggest a plantation or organized farming structure. Underneath the main highway, there is a smaller road or overpass that crosses perpendicularly, creating a clear intersection.\n\nThe image captures quite a few vehicles on the highway, indicating a moment of regular traffic flow. The clarity and wide scope of the view suggest it might have been taken from a significant altitude, offering a comprehensive overview of this intersecting infrastructure and its impact on the landscape. The surrounding environment largely consists of flat terrain, utilized extensively for farming purposes.","title":"Irrigated fields of the imperial valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["553944","553947","558055","546603","552719","546612","548391","546607","546714","557471","546686","546709","549098","546733","546587","547770"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","parcel","scope","overpass","overview","cultivation","produce","field","reflec","farming"]}
