{"path":"543039.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a moody, introspective scene inside what appears to be a bar or diner. The main subject of the image is a person seated at the counter. The person is seen from the side and is silhouetted, making their features indistinct. They wear a wide-brimmed hat and are in the process of lighting or holding a cigarette, with a thin wisp of smoke visible.\n\nThe counter stretches across the foreground, with its shiny surface reflecting some light and objects upon it. There appear to be a few glass tumblers, some of which are set on ashtrays, suggesting the presence of other patrons or at least the use of the space by others. The interior has a wooden aesthetic, with paneled walls and a reflective, presumably polished counter top.\n\nLooking past the sitter and through the windows of the establishment, one can see the exterior, which shows a view of a quiet street typical of a small town. Across the street, other storefronts can be glimpsed, featuring wide windows and what seem to be signs, although the details are not clear enough to be readable.\n\nThe ambiance is nostalgic, possibly evoking a mid-20th century vibe, underscored by the natural lighting coming through the large windows and the absence of modern technology in the scene. The mood is contemplative, enhanced by the single human figure in a classic pose of thoughtfulness or solitude.","title":"California--Bodega Bay","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["553518","556441","552647","552622","548072","545974","553517","555532","547794","554866","547789","553217","556676","544437","556613","547809"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["counter","indistinct","wisp","patron","diner","window","storefront","cigarette","street","bar"]}
