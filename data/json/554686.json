{"path":"554686.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures two men engaged in an outdoor cooking scene set against a backdrop of a camping area. One of the men, seated on the tailgate of a red pickup truck, wears a matching red jacket and hat, which complements the truck's color. He seems focused on something in his hands, possibly preparing or holding a food item. Next to him, set on the tailgate, is a green camping stove with a pot on it, indicating that cooking is underway. Various kitchen utensils and a red cup are also visible on the tailgate, emphasizing a makeshift outdoor kitchen setup.\n\nThe other man, standing to the right, sports a casual jacket over a red shirt and a red knit hat, holding a red cup, suggesting a relaxed, informal atmosphere. His facial expression is cheerful as he engages in conversation, looking towards the seated man, possibly commenting or joking about the cooking process.\n\nBehind them, the scene is dotted with vehicles and a camper trailer, set in a grassy area with sparse trees. The vehicles are vintage in style, indicating the photograph might be from a few decades ago. This setting gives the impression of a communal or family camping site. The overall mood of the scene is friendly and leisurely, capturing a moment of outdoor life and camaraderie among the participants.","title":"Hunters warm up with a cup of hot coffee at a stillwater road public campsite in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
