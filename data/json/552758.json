{"path":"552758.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat somber urban scene viewed through a black metal fence in the foreground. The fence has vertical bars and appears slightly worn, focusing the viewer's attention beyond it. The asphalt lot is expansive and mostly empty, adding a sense of desolation to the image.\n\nThe central figure in the image is a child, likely a young girl, seen from a back and side view. She is walking across the lot and wears a vibrant red coat that stands out vividly against the muted surroundings. Her black pants and dark shoes contrast with her bright coat, and she carries what appears to be a bottle in one hand.\n\nIn the background, there are dilapidated buildings with exposed interiors and boarded-up windows, suggesting urban decay or abandonment. The buildings are mostly brick, and their worn and damaged state amplifies the feeling of neglect in the area. The sky is overcast, and the overall lighting is dim, reinforcing the melancholic atmosphere of the setting.\n\nThere is no visible vegetation or nature, just the stark, man-made structures and the paved lot. The scene is evocative of themes such as urban decline, loneliness, and possibly poverty, highlighted by the isolation of the small figure in this large, barren environment. The image may provoke thoughts about the social and economic conditions of the area depicted.","title":"Playground","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552747","551924","552763","556164","547182","552757","552756","556166","553506","557345","551964","552750","547786","553552","553476","545542"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["lot","coat","fence","provoke","amplify","decline","figure","asphalt","bar","desolation"]}
