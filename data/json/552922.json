{"path":"552922.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a coastline with a variety of natural terrains and water bodies. On the right, there is an area dominated by what appears to be exposed sediment or shallow sandy ground with circular patterns, possibly caused by water movement or human activities. This area is surrounded by darker land, potentially vegetation, forming a crescent shape around the sandy sediment.\n\nTo the left, a body of water extends laterally across the image, showcasing a range of colors from dark green to lighter, murky blue, indicating variations in water depth and the presence of algae or sediment. The colors fade into each other, creating a natural gradient. The interface where the water meets the land is irregular, composed mainly of what seems to be marshy shores with vegetation protruding into the water, offering a rich habitat for wildlife.\n\nFurthermore, the photograph captures a moment where the water seems still, reflecting light and creating a slightly glittery surface, adding a dynamic yet serene mood to the scene. The overall composition encapsulates a tranquil and aloof natural scene, likely taken from a significant altitude given the broad scope and perspective displayed.","title":"Aerial view of a beach on the eastern shore of Pyramid Lake shows two streams flowing into the lake.
