{"path":"547901.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial or waste disposal scene characterized by debris and neglect. In the foreground, there's a sizable puddle reflecting light, surrounded by broken, jagged pieces of concrete and small rocks, suggesting recent demolition or construction activity. These scattered debris partly cover a muddy ground, contributing to a scene of disarray.\n\nBeyond this immediate area, there's a prominent pile of various discarded items, possibly metal scraps and other waste materials, visible over a green metal fence that seems to encircle the site. This pile includes objects of different shapes and sizes, creating a chaotic accumulation typical of a scrapyard.\n\nIn the background, industrial elements such as machinery, including a crane, and structures like smokestacks are visible, indicating the photo was taken in an industrial zone or near a factory-like setting. The overall mood of the picture is desolate and somewhat neglected, suggesting the area might be used for industrial processes or as a landfill site. Trees and vegetation in the peripheral areas provide a slight contrast to the predominantly metal and concrete environment.","title":"Gravesend Bay's blackened shoreline is result of oil seePage from tankers.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549307","550265","547611","555544","552154","556324","545059","547610","554346","546913","547625","554318","552102","556640","542585","547062"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","metal","neglect","pile","demolition","scrapyard","site","encircle","disarray","landfill"]}
