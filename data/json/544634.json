{"path":"544634.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of a complex, multi-level freeway interchange bending through an urban landscape. Characterized by sweeping curves and expansive cement structures, the freeway dominates the foreground with its several layers of roads that loop and intersect at various heights.\n\nBelow the interchange, the surrounding area is populated with a mix of residential and commercial buildings, giving insight into a bustling urban setting. The architecture varies, signaling a combination of older, more traditional buildings next to modern developments.\n\nTo the left side of the photograph, there's a body of water, likely a river, alongside which there are parked boats, hinting at a nearby dock or port facility. This area also features some industrial elements like cranes and storage tanks, suggesting the presence of a working waterfront.\n\nThe horizon stretches far into the background filled with a dense collection of similar buildings, fading into the haze, and hints at a sprawling city landscape. The overall mood of the photo is somewhat muted, captured with slightly washed-out colors that give a sense of the time and atmosphere when the photo was taken. It provides a significant overview of the intertwined relationship between infrastructure and urban development in this particular city.","title":"Traffic interchange cuts through the heart of downtown Miami","placename":"Miami (Fla.)","location":"Miami, Florida","nn1":["555745","548358","553015","546578","548333","546581","546709","546573","553846","544642","549478","553838","551205","547762","548332","553475"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["freeway","interchange","cement","development","insight","loop","overview","relationship","wash","city"]}
