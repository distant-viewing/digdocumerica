{"path":"555191.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a variety of ferns and small plants from a top-down perspective, highlighting the natural flora on a forest floor or a similar natural setting. The image shows multiple fern leaves with varying colors from pale green to deep bluish-green and burgundy, radiating outwards in different directions, creating a visually captivating pattern. \n\nThe ferns have varying textures and stages of health; some leaves look robust and lively while others appear somewhat discolored or decayed. Among the ferns, there are patches of moss or lichen that contribute to the image's range of textures, adding spots of pale cream and white to the predominantly green and earth-toned scene. The ground underneath is dark, likely covered in moist soil or decomposed organic material, which contrasts highly with the vibrant colors of the ferns and moss.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is diffuse, suggesting an overcast sky or a canopy-covered setting that evenly illuminates the scene without harsh shadows, preserving the details of the delicate plant structures. The composition focuses fully on the natural elements, with no visible human-made objects or indications of human presence, emphasizing a pure and untouched natural environment.","title":"Ferns growing in 70-year-old age class timberland on Green Mountain in Kitsap County, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554996","555192","555049","554743","553358","554993","553590","555093","553589","554991","555050","554729","555054","555040","545285","555026"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fern","moss","burgundy","lichen","leave","indication","health","cream","plant","flora"]}
