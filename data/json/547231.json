{"path":"547231.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic moment as an airplane is descending for a landing, its large body and wing silhouettes dominating the upper portion of the image. Below, four individuals are observing the plane's descent. It appears to be a diverse group â€“ three young women and one young man. The women are standing, and one is standing with a bicycle. They are dressed in casual, somewhat retro-style clothing, which suggests the photo might be from an earlier decade. The man is shielding his eyes to get a better view of the airplane. The group is silhouetted against a clear sky, emphasizing their engagement in the aviation activity above them. The setting suggests an airport vicinity or a viewing area specifically used for watching planes. The overall composition of the photograph, with the plane overhead and observers below, creates a sense of scale and spectacle, capturing the intersection of human curiosity and the marvel of flight.","title":"One of the bicyclists holds her ears against the roar of the jet, taking off from national airport","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547678","547247","548485","547237","548447","554092","548448","544967","542499","544963","548487","542577","548484","542720","546178","548881"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["plane","airplane","marvel","aviation","descent","landing","spectacle","get","airport","observer"]}
