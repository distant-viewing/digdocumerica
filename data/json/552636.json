{"path":"552636.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an older woman holding a pair of goggles in her hands. She is examining or cleaning them with a white cloth. The woman has dark hair styled in a bouffant manner and is wearing large, dark, rounded sunglasses. Her attire includes a light yellow or cream-colored top. The background is somewhat dark and indistinct, possibly an indoor setting with subdued lighting, emphasizing the subject. The expression on the woman's face shows focus and perhaps a bit of curiosity or scrutiny as she looks at the goggles. The image exudes a sense of careful attention and perhaps preparation for an activity requiring the use of these goggles.","title":"Antonelli Industries, Rifle, a ski goggles factory, employs fourteen workers most of whom are farm wives.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["556414","558319","548891","544311","549354","558327","556498","556594","543864","558378","553610","548561","558372","546288","555530","558320"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["goggle","woman","clean","cloth","cream","require","preparation","curiosity","manner","exude"]}
