{"path":"551588.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This image portrays a scene inside a facility, possibly a laboratory or a plant growth chamber area. A man can be seen working on large, industrial shelving units that are filled with numerous transparent boxes, each containing a number of small, clear bottles with black caps. These bottles likely contain samples or substances for scientific research or experiments.\n\nThe shelving unit is metal and extensive, equipped with lighting fixtures above each shelf, enhancing the visibility of the contents. The man, dressed in a checkered shirt and dark pants, is engaged in examining or adjusting the apparatus or samples on the higher shelves. He stretches his arm to reach or manipulate the setup.\n\nThe environment suggests meticulous organization and a controlled setting, likely critical for the research or experiments being conducted. The presence of what appears to be a large white jug and other miscellaneous items on a lower shelf indicates that various tools and materials are needed for the processes taking place here. The lighting overall is subtle, likely optimized for the requirements of the content inside the boxes rather than general illumination.","title":"National water quality laboratory: aquatic biologist wesley smith, removes a substrate from the bank of aquarium tanks to study effect of industrial waste on fish egg count.
