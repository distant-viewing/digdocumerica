{"path":"550804.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a young fawn, likely a white-tailed deer due to its distinctive spotted coat pattern, standing in a grassy setting with a dense backdrop of dark green shrubbery and trees with leaves in various shades of green. The fawn's coat is reddish-brown adorned with multiple white spots, which help with camouflage in the wild. It is eating, with green vegetation hanging from its mouth, demonstrating foraging behavior typical of deer.\n\nThe fawn stands slightly off-center to the right, and attention is drawn to its alert expression and upright ears, indicating keen awareness of its surroundings. It appears to be mid-stride, as one of its front legs is captured in a forward motion. The light is soft and diffused, possibly filtered through the trees, casting subtle shadows and highlighting the fawn's fur and the surrounding vegetation. The overall feel of the image is serene and naturalistic, typical of wildlife photography aimed at capturing creatures in their natural habitat.","title":"Alongside Highway 107, south of TOmahawk, a deer watches for danger as he chews some grass.
