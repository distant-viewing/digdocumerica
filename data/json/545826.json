{"path":"545826.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic, arid landscape that could be located in a desert region. The foreground features a prominent stone and mortar structure, possibly a well, surrounded by multiple rock piles. The structure is cylindrical, about a meter high, capped with a flat wooden cover or lid. Adjacent to this structure is a simple wooden cross embedded in the ground, casting a long shadow that stretches across the terrain, suggesting the photo was taken when the sun was low in the sky.\n\nThe ground is rocky and barren, with sparse vegetation, consisting of small shrubs and grounded foliage. Beyond the main scene, the area extends into a wider desert-like field scattered with similar rocks and dry plants.\n\nThe background shows distant mountains with a rugged silhouette providing a stark contrast to a clear, bright sky. This mountainous backdrop suggests a remote location, possibly indicative of a natural park or a preserved area.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photo conveys a sense of desolation and historical or cultural significance, possibly a memorial or a historical site in a desert area. The presence of the cross suggests a grave or a memorial site, reflecting a poignant human element within the vast, uninhabited landscape.","title":"Old graveyard near Lajitas, a town on the Rio GRande River","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["545811","545322","545817","544137","549041","545809","544401","545593","545341","543658","545604","544019","543345","545813","544751","547522"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["desert","cross","grave","lid","site","meter","rock","desolation","significance","cover"]}
