{"path":"550894.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene with a focus on industrial and shipping activities. On the right side of the image, there is a large tugboat featuring bright red and white colors. The tugboat appears to be in motion, heading towards the left of the frame, and it is equipped with various antennas, railings, and a small crane-like structure near the rear.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there is an oil derrick or similar industrial structure situated on a body of water. It is characterized by a tall, metallic tower and a base that supports various equipment, possibly for drilling or related activities.\n\nThe background is slightly obscured by haze or pollution but reveals additional industrial infrastructure, including large buildings and possibly a factory or power plant, as evidenced by a plume of dark smoke rising into the sky. The sky itself is overcast with clouds, contributing to the grey tone of the scenery.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a moment of industrial activity, emphasizing the contrasts between the mechanical elements and the natural water surroundings. The presence of birds flying near the derrick adds a touch of nature to the industrial setting.","title":"Tugboat in the Houston Ship Channel chugs past off-shore oil derricks.
