{"path":"548277.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of five men gathered around a table in an outdoor, industrial-like setting beside a body of water. Each person appears engaged in conversation or examination of papers and maps spread out on the table.\n\n- The leftmost individual, standing and leaning on a metal support, is wearing a dark shirt, overalls, and a cap. His posture suggests active involvement in the discussion.\n- Next is a man wearing a pale yellow shirt and his back is to the camera. He is seated and appears to be in discussion or explaining something, possibly pointing at a document on the table.\n- To his right, there is an older man with a beard. He's wearing a light-colored, long-sleeve shirt and work trousers. He seems alert and intently focused on the materials on the table.\n- Another man wearing a light shirt and a dark cap is positioned beside him; this man also seems engrossed in the discussion or the documents.\n- On the far right, another participant is in a white tank top and darker pants. His body language suggests he is listening or possibly waiting for his turn to speak.\n\nThe background shows an environment cluttered with industrial or construction materials, such as metal bars and wooden planks. A boat is partially visible at the top right corner. The setting suggests that the men might be involved in some form of manual labor, possibly related to marine or construction activities. The natural light and informal attire suggest the photo was taken in a casual, yet busy work context. The overall atmosphere is one of collaborative effort and engagement.","title":"U.S. Interior Department official meets with oyster boat captains at Pointe a la Hache to map new navigational charts of the area.
