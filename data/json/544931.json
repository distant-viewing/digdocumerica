{"path":"544931.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a striking natural landscape featuring large, imposing rock formations with a deep reddish hue. The environment is a canyon, where the towering rock walls curve dramatically, creating a large, shaded alcove. The rock surfaces exhibit sharply defined layers and textures, emphasizing their monumental scale and sculptural qualities.\n\nIn the foreground, a shallow riverbed stretches across the image. This area is composed of damp sand interspersed with numerous small rocks and pebbles. There is a hint of water in the bed, reflecting the lighting and contributing to a sense of the riverâ€™s dwindling presence.\n\nOn the right side, at an intermediate distance, a cluster of green vegetation is visible, suggesting a riparian habitat that contrasts with the arid surroundings. This gives a glimpse of how life adapts in such stark conditions.\n\nAt a distance within the alcove, there are two individuals. One is positioned at an elevated point on the rock face, seemingly engaged in a climbing activity, using a rope that is anchored higher up in the rock. This person appears small against the giant canvas of the rock wall. The second person is further down near the base of the alcove, possibly observing or assisting the climber.\n\nThis setting creates a narrative of adventure and exploration within a powerful and somewhat austere natural realm, illustrating both the human interaction with massive geological formations and the serene beauty of untouched natural environments.","title":"Escalante Canyon","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["544917","545697","544903","544341","544899","545305","544898","545758","545571","545782","545550","545750","545693","545759","544895","545690"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["rock","climbing","formation","canvas","riverbed","adapt","pebble","wall","anchor","canyon"]}
