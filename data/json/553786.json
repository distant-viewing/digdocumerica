{"path":"553786.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photo shows a first-person perspective from inside the cockpit of a helicopter, with the viewer looking over the shoulder of the pilot. The pilot, who appears to be male based on his body and hairstyle, is focusing on operating the helicopter. He wears a headset used for communication and noise reduction. The interior of the helicopter is compact and predominantly beige, with various controls and the pilot's hand grasping a control stick visible.\n\nThrough the cockpit's bubble canopy, there is a view of an urban area from above. The area is densely packed with buildings, roads, and a freeway teeming with vehicular traffic. The freeway curves through the scene, marked by a packed line of cars suggesting heavy traffic conditions. The surrounding landscape includes more urban structures with a background of mountains under a partly cloudy sky. The overall scene suggests a bustling city atmosphere from a vantage point in the sky.","title":"Helicopter pilot irwin malzman reports on rush hour traffic for radio station kgmb","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553787","545645","548899","548815","546687","546688","556657","552373","552374","555825","546675","545642","552365","547272","556798","547533"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["pilot","helicopter","freeway","cockpit","control","noise","traffic","grasp","teem","bubble"]}
