{"path":"558029.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph portrays a quaint, residential-style building with elements suggestive of both home and business use. The building is two-storied, made of weathered wood siding, and features a sharp gabled roof. A porch spans the width of the front, supported by four white columns under which two signboards hang, each advertising what appears to be a business (\"S. Shaw, Real Estate,\" \"Kitty Shaw\").\n\nThe front yard is neatly bordered by a low hedge, displaying a structured yet welcoming entrance. On the left of the primary structure, there is an additional building or annex having a distinctly large window and a flat roof, covered by a white trellis or pergola. This portion of the building includes detailed elements, like a pedestal urn, hinting at decorative attention.\n\nThe street in front of the building is visible, lined with a curb but no visible vehicles, suggesting a peaceful neighborhood ambiance. Above, utility lines stretch across the scene, tying in the residential feel of the setting. The photograph captures the essence of a small-town business establishment incorporated into a residential architecture, reflecting a functional blend of living space and commercial use, possibly dating back to the mid-20th century given the style and color saturation of the photo.","title":"Looking at Main Street in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron showing buildings that have been Renovated since they were photographed about 1900.
