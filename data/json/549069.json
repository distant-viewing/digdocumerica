{"path":"549069.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a picturesque golf course scene set against a scenic backdrop. The golf course features a vivid green landscape contrasted beautifully against a distant mountain range that creates a natural horizon. In the foreground are several white golf carts parked below white sun umbrellas, providing shade and clearly marking the starting area of the golf path.\n\nA golfer walking mid-stride can be seen centrally in the composition, wearing a yellow shirt, beige pants, and carrying a red golf bag, likely moving towards the next hole. The golf course is meticulously maintained with vibrant grass and several trees and shrubs dotting the landscape. Visible in the middle distance are sprinklers actively watering the grass, creating arcs of water that glisten under what appears to be bright sunlight.\n\nBeyond the course, there is a large body of water, enhancing the serene and leisurely ambiance of the location. The environment is calm, with no signs of wind as the water, vegetation, and umbrellas appear static. Behind the body of water, the rolling mountains stretch across the width of the image under a light blue sky scattered with a few wispy clouds, adding depth and breadth to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a tranquil and luxurious setting, ideal for golf enthusiasts and those enjoying the beauty of a well-manicured outdoor environment.","title":"Golf course on the lake at lake havasu city","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["543633","546959","554149","554148","548821","552608","554492","546513","554167","557512","553980","558098","547286","545249","548823","546509"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["golf","course","umbrella","breadth","arc","enthusiast","water","hole","stride","cart"]}
