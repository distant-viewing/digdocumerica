{"path":"553425.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph shows a scene with a powerful rustic and historical feel, capturing a moment in time that seems both tranquil and bustling with a subtle hint of activity. The dominant structure in the image is a large building, likely a hotel or an establishment of significant size, labeled \"Fitchburg Hotel\" prominently displayed at the top. The architecture of the building is classic, with a wide porch spanning the front and neatly aligned windows that indicate multiple floorsâ€”three visible levels in total.\n\nIn front of the building, a parking area with several vintage cars parked can be seen, suggesting a timeframe likely around the 1950s to 1960s given the body styles of the vehicles. These cars give an antique charm to the image, aligning with the age and style of the building.\n\nThe foreground of the photograph features a dried-up or shallow body of water, possibly a river, exposing sandy and possibly muddy terrain which is smooth and expansive. This environmental feature adds a natural touch to the scene, juxtaposing the man-made construction and parked cars.\n\nVegetation is sparse but evident, with a few trees and shrubs in the foreground, and rich, dense trees surrounding the hotel, providing a backdrop of greenery. The presence of these trees also suggests a rural or semi-rural setting, contributing to a peaceful atmosphere surrounding the establishment.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the hotel in the background and the exposed riverbed in the foreground, framed by foliage, effectively conveys a sense of place and time that is distinctly historical and somewhat idyllic, reflecting an era and a lifestyle that speaks volumes about the local culture and environment during that period.","title":"Fitchburg paper mill on the Nashua river","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["557660","554699","556766","557661","558037","556330","557691","557155","553461","551119","556331","557684","552681","550949","550948","557156"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["hotel","establishment","align","expose","timeframe","1950","riverbed","volume","front","spann"]}
