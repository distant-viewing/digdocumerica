{"path":"542913.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic seaside town viewed from a slightly elevated angle, looking across a bay or harbor. The foreground features a wooden pier, off which several boats are docked, with masts notably visible against the skyline. The town itself consists of tightly grouped single and two-story buildings, many of which appear to be residential homes with typical pitched roofs. The colors of the buildings range from dark hues to white, red, and pale blue, adding a quaint, diverse visual appeal to the scene.\n\nBeyond the town, the landscape opens up to a large, barren hill or mountain range that seems devoid of heavy vegetation, giving it a stark, open feel. The background is dominated by these rolling hills which provide a sharp contrast to the densely packed, human-made structures of the town.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph suggests a quiet, possibly remote coastal community, typical of those found in rugged, sea-facing parts of the country. The lighting indicates either early morning or late afternoon, as the light casts long shadows and gives a warm tint to the scene. There is no visible activity in the photograph, suggesting a moment of calm or a day of light activity in the town. The composition effectively frames the bustling life of the town against the serene and imposing natural landscape that surrounds it.","title":"The hills overlooking Bodega Bay are to be developed for vacation homes.","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542878","542910","550318","550322","542907","550314","543361","549362","550307","543362","542876","554102","543423","542877","547984","542918"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["town","seaside","country","tint","mast","harbor","appeal","hill","bay","calm"]}
