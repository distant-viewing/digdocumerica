{"path":"554611.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a lakeside setting. In the foreground, four people are enjoying themselves in the water. One person is jumping into the water, making a splash with an excited expression, wearing a red two-piece swimsuit. To the right, a woman and a girl are swimming, both partially submerged. Standing on the rightmost part of the frame, another person, possibly a young woman, is hesitantly stepping into the water, wearing a light blue one-piece swimsuit and a smile. \n\nOn the left side of the image, a wooden boat named \"Irish Lady\" is docked, adding a touch of nautical charm to the scene. The boat is well-kept, with visible details like a white cover and some belongings inside it.\n\nIn the background, a mix of cars and campers can be seen parked among tall, dense pine trees, suggesting that this is a popular spot for day trips or possibly a camping area. The overall setting projects a warm, sunny day, ideal for outdoor water activities, which complements the joyful mood of the photograph.","title":"Young girls swimming at the state department of environmental conservation at stillwater reservoir, public boat landing in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544442","558233","543944","556295","551543","544002","550236","548066","553447","551310","544006","543943","546856","550227","550838","548054"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["swimsuit","jump","camper","piece","belonging","boat","camping","lakeside","trip","ideal"]}
