{"path":"544854.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures the dynamic and turbulent flow of a river or stream. The water is in motion, with foamy white and swirling currents dominating the image. The image provides a close-up view of waterfall-like formations where the water is descending rapidly, producing a blend of white froth and darker water below, exemplifying energetic water movement.\n\nThe rapid movement of water creates various patterns and textures in the flow, highlighted by the white foam against the darker patches of water. The photograph does not contain any visible background beyond the immediate vicinity of the water, focusing solely on the raw power and natural beauty of the moving water. There are no people or other distinct objects visible; the image is purely a natural water landscape, emphasizing the force and chaos of moving water.","title":"South Fork of Rio GRande River near Wolf Creek Pass","placename":"Rio Grande (Colo.-Mexico and Tex.)","location":"Rio Grande, Colorado","nn1":["550651","542742","543563","544856","553388","544867","544862","553416","557252","552061","550817","547650","542743","550742","550370","549442"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["water","flow","froth","chaos","movement","current","waterfall","foam","force","vicinity"]}
