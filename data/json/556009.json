{"path":"556009.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a broad, elevated view of a rural landscape featuring a passing train. The train, which seems to be a long passenger or commuter model, is colorful with red and white markings on the locomotive leading several white carriages. It travels along a narrow track that carves through a lush, dense stretch of green trees which vividly contrast against the surrounding golden-yellow fields.\n\nThe terrain is gently rolling with varying shades of brown, indicating fields that might be used for agriculture, some of which appear recently harvested or plowed. This rural setting is expansive, stretching back to a horizon dotted with more trees and what appears to be a flat expanse, suggesting vast open land typical of many rural areas.\n\nNo buildings or people are evident in the image, emphasizing the isolation and tranquility of the location. The photo seems to be taken from a significant height, giving an aerial or birdâ€™s-eye perspective, enhancing the breadth and quiet beauty of this natural scene. The lighting is bright and sunny, suggesting the photograph was taken on a clear day, further highlighting the vivid colors of the landscape and train.","title":"The southwest limited (train #3) shown from the air between Dodge City and garden city, Kansas.
