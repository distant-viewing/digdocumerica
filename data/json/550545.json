{"path":"550545.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large, sinuous river winding through a landscape. The river features numerous wide meanders and large deposits of sediment, creating numerous small sand bars and islands. The water appears silty and muddy, indicating a heavy carrying load of sediment. The banks of the river are mostly undeveloped and lined with dark vegetation, suggesting a remote or natural setting.\n\nThe surroundings are predominantly lush and green, suggesting either a temperate or sub-arctic region. The photograph is likely taken during a time of day when the light is diffused, possibly due to cloud cover, as indicated by the overall muted tones and the lack of harsh shadows. \n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the dramatic bends and intricate patterns created by the riverâ€™s path through the terrain. Such scenes might be indicative of geological processes like erosion and deposition driven by the river's flow dynamics.","title":"The Tanana River, view southwest from a point near mile 455 the pipeline route parallels the river for about 70 miles south from Fairbanks to Delta Junction.
