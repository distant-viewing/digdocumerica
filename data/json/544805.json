{"path":"544805.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures two young boys engaged in an outdoor activity on a makeshift raft. The raft is constructed from large, cylindrical barrels tied together, supporting a flat platform on which the boys stand. Both are shirtless and wear dark swim trunks. One boy is slightly bent forward, gripping a long, thin pole that touches the water, possibly using it to navigate or propel the raft. The other boy stands behind him, holding a similar pole but it is raised and not in contact with the water.\n\nThe setting is a calm body of water with a lush, green backdrop. The vegetation includes tall grasses and bushes, suggesting a natural, possibly rural environment. In the background, beyond the vegetation, faint outlines of industrial structures, possibly power lines, can be seen, adding a contrasting element to the otherwise natural scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of leisure and adventure, likely a warm, sunny day given the lighting and the boys' attire. The image evokes a sense of freedom and the simplicity of summer days spent exploring and enjoying nature.","title":"Barrel raft on the South Platte River","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["544221","544218","553430","544204","551225","553448","544270","553431","544229","543677","553435","551160","546940","552828","551165","544200"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["boy","raft","pole","contact","swim","freedom","barrel","adventure","simplicity","outline"]}
