{"path":"554727.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures the rich and vibrant colors of autumn foliage in a sunlit setting. The composition focuses primarily on a variety of maple leaves in full autumn hues. In the foreground, crimson and burnt orange leaves are prominently displayed on thin, delicate branches that intricately weave through the scene. These vibrant red leaves contrast sharply with the golden-yellow leaves that fill the background, creating a depth of color that is both warm and inviting.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights the translucency of the leaves, enhancing their brilliant colors against the backdrop of a clear blue sky. The variation in leaf color from deep reds to bright yellows, along with the play of light and shadow, suggests it is a crisp, sunny day in the fall season. The leaves appear slightly wet or glossy, possibly indicating recent rain or morning dew, which adds a fresh, lively quality to the scene.\n\nThere are no human figures or man-made objects visible; the focus is purely on the natural beauty of the autumn leaves. The setting is likely a forested area or a park, where the changing season brings about this picturesque transformation. Overall, the photograph beautifully captures the essence of fall with its focus on the changing colors of nature.","title":"Sugar maple framed against yellow birch trees in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554726","554725","554736","554730","554735","554737","558074","554751","546011","554637","554738","554758","554715","554636","552693","557127"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["leave","autumn","change","season","yellows","fall","dew","transformation","weave","sunlit"]}
