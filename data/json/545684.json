{"path":"545684.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a natural, rugged outdoor scene. Three people are standing near the edge of a wide, muddy river. They are dressed in casual, warm clothing, suggesting the weather might be cool. One person is wearing a red jacket, another a dark coat, and the third a light-colored jacket and jeans. Nearby, there's a multitude of scattered objects, which include a camping stove, cooler boxes, and various other supplies, indicating that they might be on a camping trip or involved in some outdoor activities.\n\nThe river appears calm and reflects the cloudy sky above. In the background, dominating the scene, is a prominent cliff or mesa, which gives a sense of a vast, open landscape. The ground they are standing on is rocky and uneven, with puddles of water gathered in small pockets.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, which includes the reflective river, the rocky terrain, the casual gathering of people, and the imposing natural backdrop, presents a moment of outdoor exploration or a camping adventure in a rugged, scenic environment.","title":"EPA men inspecting oil leakage along boom site: part of the clean-up of the San Juan River oil spill.
