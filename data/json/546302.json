{"path":"546302.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts three men engaging in an outdoor activity in a shallow water body, possibly a lake or a wide river. The setting includes a clear sky and a reed-filled background, suggesting a natural, outdoor space.\n\nThe first man, on the left, wears red-striped shorts and a striped shirt, with sunglasses and a cap with flaps; he seems older than the other two. He is bending over slightly towards a wooden boat or container in the water, holding a paddle or similar tool.\n\nThe second man, in the middle, is shirtless and wearing blue shorts. He is physically engaged in pushing or stabilizing the boat, using a tool that looks like a wooden pole or oar.\n\nThe third man, on the right, also shirtless with blue shorts and a striped short-sleeved shirt, appears to be reaching out to support or maneuver the boat. His gesture seems focused and helpful in the activity the group is involved in.\n\nTogether, they seem to be either preparing to set the small boat in deeper water, possibly examining something within it, or engaging in some form of water-related maintenance or exploration. The scene is casual, with a focus on teamwork and outdoor recreation.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory biologists on a field trip to a salt marsh.
