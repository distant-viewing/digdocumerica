{"path":"543514.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene punctuated with multiple features that contribute to its tranquil ambiance. The central focus of the image is a quaint, solitary wooden house constructed on a pier extending into the lake. This house is surrounded by empty boat slips, indicating a quiet time of day or season.\n\nThe backdrop showcases a stunning panoramic view of distant mountains covered with snow, emphasizing the cold climate and the vast, untouched nature surrounding the lake. The smooth surface of the lake reflects the soft hues of the sky, enhancing the calmness of the scenery. The colors used in the photograph are understated and gentle, with blues, whites, and earth tones dominating, creating a peaceful and almost melancholic atmosphere.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph—with the pier and house positioned slightly off-center and leading into the expansive view of the lake and mountains—draws the viewer's eye across the scene, inviting one to absorb the quiet beauty of this tranquil setting.","title":"Lake tahoe shore near kings beach","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552974","557562","543547","548034","547127","543531","550324","543546","543618","543527","550778","551207","548030","550493","552987","543816"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["lake","pier","house","absorb","whites","mountains","stunning","quaint","calmness","lakeside"]}
