{"path":"545959.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features two young boys sitting on what appears to be a dock or a part of a ship, surrounded by large coiled ropes, likely used for mooring. Both boys have medium-length shaggy hair and wear casual clothing appropriate for cooler weather. The boy on the left is dressed in a tan jacket over a shirt, gazing intently towards the camera with a serious expression. His companion, on the right, sports a dark plaid shirt and has a softer, contemplative expression as he looks away from the camera, possibly towards something off-frame.\n\nThe background of the image suggests a natural, outdoor setting near water. Behind the boys, the landscape includes water, grassy areas, and a glimpse of a rural or semi-rural environment. There is a column or post partially visible on the right side, possibly part of the structure on which they are sitting. The setting provides a serene atmosphere, with the focus being on the boys and their subtle interaction or moment of thought. The lighting indicates it could be either late afternoon or early morning, providing soft illumination to the scene.","title":"Children of fishermen","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["553147","544229","544221","543612","545953","546077","544194","549299","546565","553448","545961","543461","544211","544805","556163","544270"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["boy","appropriate","mooring","coil","companion","sit","camera","expression","illumination","thought"]}
