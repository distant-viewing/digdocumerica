{"path":"548661.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts a classic two-story house featuring distinctive tropical or Victorian architectural elements. The structure has a pale facade, possibly white, with contrasting trim around the roof and windows. The house notably features an expansive curved balcony adorned with intricate railing designs and an elegant patterned valance. Beneath the curved balcony, there is another balcony which spans the width of the house, equipped with similar decorative railings and offering ample space, suggesting it might be a practical area for relaxation or social gatherings.\n\nThe facade of the house includes several windows, each fitted with traditional wooden shutters that are partially closed. These details suggest that the home is designed to provide ample shade and airflow, typical in warmer climates. The siding of the house appears to be horizontal paneling, a common choice for durability and style in many historic or coastal homes.\n\nIn the foreground, glimpses of lush greenery are visible, hinting at a garden or landscaped area surrounding the house. This adds to the tropical or warm-climate setting implied by the architectural style. The sky above is bright and clear, reflecting good weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph centers on showcasing the architectural beauty and charm of the house, focusing on details that convey a sense of the heritage and environmental adaptation of the design.","title":"A typical bahamian-style residence of Key West.
