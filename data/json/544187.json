{"path":"544187.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and dynamic scene of three children playing by the water at sunset. The image is taken from a low angle and the setting sun creates a striking backlight that silhouettes the children against the shimmering water. The children appear to be engaged in joyful play; two of the kids are standing while the third one is sitting in the water.\n\nThe child on the left is stepping into the water, reaching out with one hand, possibly balancing or interacting with the middle child. The middle child is bent forward, touching the water, as if they are either splashing it or picking something up. The child on the right is seated in the water, facing away from the camera, and appears relaxed as they look out over the water.\n\nThe background is dominated by the glittering surface of the water, which reflects the sunlight, creating a textured pattern of light and shadow. There are no discernible landmarks or objects in the background, emphasizing the focus on the children and their interaction with the natural environment. The overall mood conveyed is one of freedom, innocence, and the simple pleasures of childhood.","title":"Lake Pontchartrain","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544183","552220","551159","547692","553429","551160","552341","550241","550233","553431","544200","549105","543473","543397","552539","554499"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","water","glitter","kid","backlight","play","innocence","pleasure","freedom","pick"]}
