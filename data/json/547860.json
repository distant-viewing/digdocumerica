{"path":"547860.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image features a large, colorful advertisement sign for the Rockaway Boat Lines. The sign is divided into several sections, each with its own background and text style, promoting different attractions and services. The top section of the sign has text in a simple, bold font stating \"Rockaway Boat Lines Inc.,\" followed by destinations \"Breezy Point & Rockaway Point\" in a larger and slightly more decorative font. Below this, another section advertises \"SIGHTSEEING\" in large, bold letters with an illustration of a sightseeing boat next to it. The boat is depicted carrying passengers, and a small flag is shown waving in the background, suggesting movement and a breezy environment.\n\nOn the bottom part of the sign, there is a banner that says \"1 Hour SIGHTSEEING\" and points out features like \"Lectured CRUISES.\" Another part of the sign promotes \"2Â½ Hour SIGHTSEEING Moonlight.\" The overall color scheme is a mixture of red, blue, white, and black, conveying a classic yet vibrant look typical of mid-20th-century travel advertisements. The style and design of the sign suggest it might be from the 1950s or 1960s. The background of the image is a clear blue sky, highlighting the sign and making the white and bright colors pop.","title":"Ferry cruises leaving from sheepshead bay","placename":"Brooklyn (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Brooklyn, New York","nn1":["547838","544551","545154","549561","549313","543972","554658","549509","546788","554484","549889","554175","554176","554550","543963","543945"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["sightseeing","sign","font","promote","advertisement","section","text","1950","illustration","cruise"]}
