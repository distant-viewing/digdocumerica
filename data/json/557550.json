{"path":"557550.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a widescreen landscape view of a hilly suburban area under development. In the foreground, there are several large new residential constructions in progress. These buildings are at various stages of framing, with exposed wooden beams and skeletal structures prominently visible. A few construction vehicles and scattered construction materials can be seen around the buildings, indicating ongoing work.\n\nSurrounding these constructions is a developed neighborhood with numerous houses, nestled among rolling hills and lush greenery. The houses vary in design and size but generally feature suburban residential styling. The roads winding through the area are narrow and follow the natural contours of the terrain.\n\nIn the background, the landscape extends into a haze, likely due to atmospheric conditions or distance, with more densely packed houses and vegetation visible. The sky above is clear with a soft gradient, likely captured during daytime.\n\nOverall, the image showcases the expansion of suburban residential areas into previously undeveloped hilly regions, blending new construction with established communities in a scenic setting.","title":"New housing under construction off mulholland drive in the santa monica mountains on the western edge of Los Angeles.
