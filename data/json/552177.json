{"path":"552177.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive open-pit mining operation under a clear sky. The scene captures an environment heavily molded by industrial activity, with large mounds of earth and gravel, and deep gouges cut into the landscape forming terraces and inclines. The terrain demonstrates a gradient of natural earth tones, from dark browns to grayish blues. Visible in the pit are multiple pieces of heavy machinery, including bulldozers and excavators, which are engaged in the excavation and movement of earth materials.\n\nA network of dirt roads crisscrosses the site, used by the trucks and other vehicles to navigate the area. In the distance and partially visible through a haze, there are water bodies, possibly a river or lake, accompanied by flatter, more vegetated land that stands in stark contrast to the barrenness of the mining zone. The background shows more industrial activity with various structures possibly pertaining to the mining operation. This image showcases the scale and impact of industrial mining on a natural landscape.\n","title":"Gravel pit near chambers creek","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["549172","544112","544100","555621","549242","544110","549241","549177","554631","543758","544111","553049","544789","544785","549167","549171"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","pit","earth","flatter","incline","grayish","terrace","excavator","navigate","mounds"]}
