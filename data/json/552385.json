{"path":"552385.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a laboratory or medical room, featuring a man seemingly engaged in a scientific or medical task. He is partly shown, with the photograph highlighting his profile and hands.\n\nThe man appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s and has long sideburns typical of a past era, suggesting this photo might be from the 1970s or early 1980s. He is wearing a striped shirt with vertical lines varying in shades of gray and dark green, and he appears focused on the task at hand.\n\nIn his hands, he holds a syringe, apparently injecting or extracting a fluid to or from a large transparent plastic bag filled with a substance that could be air or another gas, as indicated by its puffy appearance. His actions suggest precision and attentiveness.\n\nThe room has a somewhat cluttered and utilitarian appearance with dim lighting. In the background, there are scientific or medical equipment and supplies, including tanks (possibly containing gases) and other devices, which reinforce the setting's functional nature.\n\nThe walls of the room are painted in a muted orange and cream color scheme, which along with the narrow view into the next room, gives a sense of limited space typical in workplace environments.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a snapshot of a moment within a scientific or medical environment, highlighting the individual's focused interaction with specialized tools and materials.","title":"Los angeles reactive pollutant program (larpp), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["549608","542737","546278","546287","546284","551594","546285","549605","546327","549604","546328","542666","543834","542664","552386","549333"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["room","gas","30","inject","hand","attentiveness","task","extract","fluid","precision"]}
