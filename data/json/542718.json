{"path":"542718.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an airplane ascending steeply into the sky, leaving behind a thick trail of dark smoke. The airplane, which appears to be a commercial jet, is angled upwards as it climbs, emphasizing a dynamic and forceful departure. The background consists mainly of a muted sky with a mix of light and slightly darker hues, possibly indicating either early morning or late afternoon. The overall composition of the image, with the stark contrast between the aircraft and the soft background, gives a sense of motion and power. The edges of the slide frame are visible, highlighting the vintage quality of the photograph.","title":"Fumes from jet takeoff","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542717","542719","542793","542500","542720","542501","547824","548883","542496","548215","548841","553832","544606","548884","547810","549072"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","departure","climb","jet","ascend","upwards","aircraft","trail","muted","power"]}
