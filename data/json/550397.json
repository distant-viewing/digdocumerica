{"path":"550397.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures an expansive aerial view of a barren landscape, which appears to be a desert or a dry, arid area. The terrain is textured with patterns that look like dry, cracked earth, suggesting a lack of recent rainfall. In the vast field, there are several distinct patches where water has collected forming small lakes or ponds, which stand out due to their reflective surfaces contrasting against the dull brown and tan colors of the dry ground.\n\nThe topography is mostly flat, stretching towards the horizon under a broad sky that suggests it might be dusk or dawn, given the soft light. There are no visible structures, trees, or signs of human activity, which lends a wild, untouched air to the scene. The color tones are mostly muted browns, tans, and hints of dull green, typical of a largely vegetative area that receives little moisture.\n\nIn the background, the flatness of the terrain continues until it meets a slightly raised horizon, where a faint outline of distant hills or low mountains can be seen under the sky, which shows gradations of blue, possibly tinged with the light of a setting or rising sun. The overall feeling evoked by the image is one of isolation and the rugged beauty of nature untouched by human hands.","title":"The bleak panorama of dying Arctic tundra marks the approach of winter. Typical in a general way of all the terrain between the Brooks Range and the Beaufort Sea, this view looks southeast toward the Brooks Range across the route of the pipeline.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543644","552902","550598","548703","555885","550395","555863","552420","552426","549183","550399","548673","548974","545895","543665","552923"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["tan","gradation","rainfall","topography","moisture","horizon","pond","terrain","lack","outline"]}
