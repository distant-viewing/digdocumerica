{"path":"547111.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a wintry, somewhat desolate coastal scene with a road closure. A \"Road Closed\" sign is prominently displayed in the foreground, slightly weathered and rusted, set on a backdrop of a snow-dusted road. Beyond the sign, a series of barriers, including a striped barricade with a round, reflective amber light on top, block the road.\n\nThe road extends into the distance, flanked on the left by a frozen body of water and on the right by a dirt slope with bare trees and utility poles. The landscape is scattered with debris, including what appears to be broken up pieces of concrete or stone, highlighting a sense of neglect or aftermath of a weather event.\n\nIn the distance, two figures are visible, walking away from the viewer, beside a vintage green car parked on the side of the road. The mood is quiet and stark, evoking a sense of isolation or abandonment influenced by the cold and harsh weather conditions. The overcast sky and the muted colors of the scene underline the chilly, bleak atmosphere of this winter setting.","title":"Severe Lake Michigan storm caused wash-out of the road.","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547095","547081","555582","544245","547904","554789","556943","555628","547653","545624","555647","545620","548248","554805","555435","545078"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["road","weather","barricade","aftermath","underline","influence","concrete","dust","block","barrier"]}
