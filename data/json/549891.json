{"path":"549891.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a busy street scene, highlighting urban transit. The central focus of the image is a public bus, prominently featuring the number 843 and labeled as an express service on the route to \"6th Avenue.\" The bus is a traditional model from around the mid-20th century, painted in a reddish color with a cream upper body.\n\nThe bus is framed by several cars, blurred in the foreground and background, suggesting the hustle and bustle typical of a busy city street. The cars appear to be models from around the 1960s or 1970s, judging from their design. These vehicles give the photograph a somewhat vintage feel.\n\nThe image is slightly unfocused, contributing to a sense of motion and activity. The lighting and shadows suggest it may be either early morning or late afternoon, adding to the atmosphere of a typical urban commute.\n\nThere are no clear views of people, but the presence of a bus driver is implied behind the windshield of the bus. The overall composition conveys a sense of daily life and public transportation in an urban environment during a past era.","title":"Express bus on Queens Boulevard, Queens","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556791","547814","551445","556802","553719","546668","556203","549921","555782","546735","556742","556786","556806","556792","546605","547195"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["bus","model","commute","bustle","windshield","hustle","cream","street","transit","route"]}
