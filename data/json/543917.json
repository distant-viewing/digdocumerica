{"path":"543917.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from what appears to be an event or conference with an environmental focus. The setting includes a large hall with wooden stairs and railings, suggesting it is hosted in an institutional or educational venue.\n\nIn the foreground, two men are engaged in a formal interaction on a stage area, exchanging a document or folder, which suggests an award ceremony or a formal recognition. The man on the right is older and is possibly a keynote speaker or a figure of authority. The younger man on the left is dressed in a suit and appears to be receiving or presenting the document.\n\nSurrounding these central figures, various banners and posters are displayed prominently. These posters feature slogans and artwork related to environmental and population issues, indicating the theme of the event. Examples include phrases like \"TRUTH: People are Satisfied with their Environment,\" \"POPULATION? A PROBLEM?,\" \"I AM... I THINK?\", and a brightly colored poster stating \"Green is Beautiful.\" These messages reflect the concerns and advocacy topics likely discussed or promoted at this event.\n\nThe audience, slightly visible in the bottom of the frame, seems engaged, with some attendees taking photographs, further emphasizing the significance of the event. Additionally, there are flower arrangements on the stage, adding a decorative touch to the setting.\n\nIn the back and to the sides, more attendees and possible journalists or photographers are focused on the proceedings, capturing the moment on their cameras. This attention underscores the event's public or newsworthy nature.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a moment of exchange and recognition within a larger context of environmental discussion and advocacy, capturing a blend of formal interaction, community engagement, and expression through visual art.","title":"Environmental awards dinner","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["543921","543925","543924","556694","545384","543932","554338","551852","556451","557703","554333","550086","547320","557704","554322","556247"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Commercial Activities"],"terms":["poster","event","population","document","attendee","stage","proceeding","folder","topic","ceremony"]}
