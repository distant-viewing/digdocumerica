{"path":"555285.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene at a shipping port. In the foreground, a prominent part of a large crane structure dominates the frame. The crane is colored in a deep, azure blue and is seen from an upward angle, highlighting its massive scale.\n\nThe main feature is the crane's boom, which extends horizontally across the photograph. Attached to the boom is a large, white lifting mechanism that is currently hoisting a container. The container itself is deep red with 'ACL' logos on its side, indicating it might be property of the Atlantic Container Line.\n\nIn the lower portion of the frame, we get a view of the top of the red container. Several individuals can be seen near the container, appearing quite small compared to the enormous scale of the crane and container. They are likely dock workers engaged in managing the loading or unloading process.\n\nIn the background, the sky is a clear, vibrant blue, suggesting the photo was taken on a clear day. No other significant objects are visible in the sky, emphasizing the openness of the area and the primary focus on the industrial activity at hand.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a dynamic industrial operation, showcasing the scale and machinery involved in maritime shipping operations. The angle and lighting emphasize the enormity and technical complexity of the crane and its functions.","title":"Machinery at the port of Newark, New Jersey, is used to load containers aboard ships for transport to various destinations","placename":"New Jersey","location":"New Jersey","nn1":["555269","555284","555273","555283","555261","546915","555270","547615","546881","547223","546917","550910","546934","549308","546910","547113"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["container","crane","boom","shipping","scale","enormity","lifting","angle","get","unloading"]}
