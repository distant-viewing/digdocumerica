{"path":"548380.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph presents a panoramic view of a hazy cityscape, possibly captured during an overcast or smoggy day. The skyline is dominated by tall buildings, including a pair of prominent twin towers, which form a significant focal point. In the foreground, a river is visible, acting as a natural barrier between the viewer's side and the urban landscape. On the river, a small boat is seen moving, possibly a tugboat or ferry.\n\nThe left side of the image shows industrial structures with visible smokestacks releasing some emissions. This hints at either a factory or power plant. There are also piers jutting into the river, and several buildings can be seen closer to the water's edge, which look residential or commercial. In the far distance, beyond the industrial area, a bridge is faintly discernible, adding another layer of depth to the city's infrastructure.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image, accentuated by the muted and monochrome color palette due to the haze, evokes a feeling of quietness or stillness over the bustling city. Despite the industrial and dense urban environment, there's a serene quality to the way the city is shrouded in this foggy veil. The photograph likely dates from the late 20th century based on the architectural styles and quality of the image.","title":"Looking across the East River to Lower Manhattan.
