{"path":"551512.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a visually interesting scene of both leisure and labor against an urban backdrop. In the foreground, two construction workers are actively engaged in work on a scaffold. They are both dressed in light-colored work pants and helmets, one wearing a striped shirt. The scaffold is equipped with various construction tools and materials. They appear focused on their task, applying finishing touches to the underside of an overhang on a building.\n\nAbove the workers, on an elevated platform or balcony, two women are standing. They seem relaxed, possibly taking a break or engaged in a casual interaction. One woman is wearing a light blue shirt with jeans, and holding either a bag or clothing, while the other is in a beige outfit, holding some papers. The setting suggests a commercial or public building, with large windows and strong geometric architectural features, such as the row of round, protruding lights lining the balcony.\n\nThe juxtaposition in the snapshot between the workers and the women provides a layered perspective of routine activities in a city environment. The background hints at a complex structure possibly part of a larger institutional or commercial complex with reflective glass windows and metal details.","title":"Completing work on enclosed corridor of Nicollet Mall skyway","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["544159","546837","553924","546929","544968","543594","557063","555373","547218","544959","547989","553887","549309","553471","546503","550116"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["scaffold","worker","balcony","woman","underside","overhang","construction","work","break","window"]}
