{"path":"548780.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a coastal area featuring a series of man-made islands and waterways. In the central portion of the image, there are islands connected by roads, each surrounded by water. The islands appear to have housing developments and various structures, including what look like residential homes with boats docked near them, hinting at a wealthy, planned community layout.\n\nThe surrounding waters are a mix of clear and murky shades, suggesting variations in depth or water quality. To the top left, the mainland is visible with more dense housing and road infrastructure leading into busier, more urban areas. There's a bridge connecting this mainland to the islands directly.\n\nAt the forefront and towards the right, there are undeveloped lands and what seems to be construction activity, with areas cleared of vegetation, possibly for further development or extraction of materials. Tracks and roads are faintly visible in these construction zones, and some construction equipment can be seen.\n\nTowards the horizon, the water body opens up into a larger waterway or bay area, and there are few small landforms or islands scattered in the water. The overall setting suggests a coastal development focused on providing waterfront living, with recreational boating likely being a popular activity in the community.","title":"Ocean reef club at north key largo","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548636","548781","557422","548779","548638","548784","557451","544635","548632","557462","548643","547636","549484","548628","544441","549528"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["island","housing","development","construction","waterway","connect","road","water","landform","community"]}
