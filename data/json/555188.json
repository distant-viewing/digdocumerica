{"path":"555188.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up scene of nature, focusing primarily on a section of a large tree trunk and a delicate floral plant growing nearby. The tree trunk, occupying a significant portion of the frame, is textured heavily with rough bark, highlighted by a collection of moss or lichen, which gives it a speckled and somewhat shimmering appearance under natural light.\n\nIn striking contrast to the dark, rugged trunk, there is a plant with vivid green leaves and several pink flowers, possibly a type of wildflower, growing adjacent to the tree. The plant has thin stems and the leaves are dissected, fern-like in their shape and arrangement, adding a soft, organic feel to the image.\n\nThe background is subdued and dark, focusing all attention on the tree trunk and the plant. The lighting suggests either a dimly lit environment or a focus on shadow play which enhances the textures and colors of the scene. The overall composition emphasizes a theme of resilience and beauty in nature, showcasing the persistent growth of delicate flora against the enduring, rough texture of the tree bark.","title":"Bleeding heart flowers in 80-year-old age class of timberland on Green Mountain, Kitsap County, Washington.
