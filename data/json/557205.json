{"path":"557205.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph depicts a wooden sign prominently displayed in a natural setting. The sign is crafted from polished wood and features engraved lettering that reads \"Lillian Annette Rowe Bird Sanctuary National Audubon Society.\" A stylized depiction of a bird is also engraved to the left of the text, adding a thematic element to the sign.\n\nThe background consists of a somewhat barren natural landscape with leafless trees and dried grass, suggesting the photograph was taken in autumn or winter. The trees are mostly bare, and the grass has a dormant, brownish hue. Behind the sign, on the ground, lies fallen foliage and branches.\n\nOverall, the image gives the impression of a quiet, serene area dedicated to bird preservation, situated in a wooded or rural environment during the colder months of the year. It successfully conveys the purpose of the area as a sanctuary for birdlife, managed or affiliated with the National Audubon Society.","title":"Sign proclaims the lillian annette rowe bird sanctuary of the national audubon society at gRand island, Nebraska.
