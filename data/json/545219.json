{"path":"545219.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a young man standing on what appears to be a part of a boat deck, near large industrial or fishing machinery which includes metal parts and possibly reels and hooks. The young man is moderately focused into the camera and has a candid expression. He has short, sandy-blond hair and is wearing a button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up, suggesting physical activity or manual labor.\n\nHis shirt, in shades of faded blue, complements the hint of ocean visible in the blurry background, which renders a serene blue haze divided by a distant horizon. The lighting is bright, indicating that the photo was taken during the day under clear skies, and there's a natural, outdoor quality to the light that enhances the textures in the shirt and his sunlit face.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photo, such as the sea background and the fishing equipment, suggest that he could be involved in maritime or fishing activities. The image conveys a sense of youthful labor and a moment captured during a day of physical work at sea.","title":"Young salmon fisherman at Cape Kiwanda, where dories fly through the surf.
