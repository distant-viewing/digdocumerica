{"path":"544308.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene in which a person is riding a horse along a sandy path. The rider, wearing a helmet and a uniform suggesting they might be a park ranger or a similar role, is seated on a black and white horse. The lighting suggests it could be early morning or late evening, adding a serene and slightly shadowy quality to the image.\n\nThe background features a row of tall trees lining the sandy path, creating a tunnel effect that draws the viewer's eye towards the rider and horse. There is a rustic wooden building close to the path, possibly a stable or storage shed, partially obscured by a fence.\n\nTo the right, a high, rugged cliff face looms over the scene, providing a dramatic and natural backdrop. The composition of the photograph, with its path leading along the trees and past the building to the distant cliff, gives a sense of depth and encourages the viewer to ponder the peacefulness and isolation of the setting. The overall mood is calm and introspective, enhanced by the soft, natural light and the solitary figure on horseback moving through this tranquil landscape.","title":"HavaSupai indian village","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["544414","544362","544420","542966","557988","543366","543726","553118","554010","557186","557051","542810","554689","552562","542885","553116"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["horse","path","rider","cliff","ranger","encourage","horseback","tunnel","loom","peacefulness"]}
