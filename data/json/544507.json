{"path":"544507.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a rural or semi-rural community that features several distinct elements. The scene is set against a vast, flat, and open landscape, likely a wetland or plain, which extends into the distance. \n\nAt the forefront, there's a straight road running left to right with vehicles parked along both sides, suggesting this might be a main road or highway through the area. A series of commercial or community buildings lines one side of the road, prominently featuring rustic fa√ßades with large signage that includes text such as \"INDIAN VILLAGE\" and possibly offers cultural or tourist attractions. Structures appear typical of rural touristic sites, possibly souvenirs or local crafts shops.\n\nAdjacent to these buildings, there's an enclosure that houses smaller traditional thatched structures. These are likely representations of native or indigenous dwellings and are organized around a central yard, enhancing the community or cultural village feel of the place. The layout and the style of the thatched roofs suggest a designed space for cultural presentation or living heritage demonstrations.\n\nThe environment is lush with scattered vegetation, including small trees and shrubs, suggesting a maintained yet natural landscape that's typical for a visitor-centric location. Notably, a couple of small water bodies or wet areas are visible near the thatched structures, possibly for aesthetic or practical purposes related to the site's activities. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its combination of natural landscape, road infrastructure, and culturally themed buildings, indicates a location developed for either educational or touristic purposes focused on local or indigenous culture, situated in a relatively remote or rural area.","title":"Indian village","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544607","555844","553694","558063","550583","544503","556971","556994","558061","550587","557726","556915","545141","547316","553981","553943"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["village","road","community","centric","purpose","dwelling","demonstration","heritage","site","attraction"]}
