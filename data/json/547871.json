{"path":"547871.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at what appears to be a public recreational area, likely near a beach, as indicated by the presence of sand and the distant horizon line where the sky meets the land or sea in the background. The scene is viewed through a chain-link fence, to which a blue sign is attached prominently in the foreground. The sign reads: \"This Recreation Area Was Developed by the Playlots Project - Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Government and Department of Highways - John V. Lindsay, Mayor - Vincent J. Gibney, Commissioner of Highways.\"\n\nBeyond the fence, there is a sandy area speckled with grass tufts. Several groups of people, including children, are present. There are various play structures, including swings and climbing frames, actively being used by the children. To the left, there is a large garbage receptacle, and to the far right, just beyond the fence, another informational or warning sign is mounted on a post.\n\nThe background expands into a clear sky with very few clouds, suggesting a sunny day, ideal for outdoor activities. The overall composition uses the fence to create a sense of separation between the viewer and the activities occurring, perhaps reflecting a theme of observation or boundary.","title":"Sheepshead bay in south Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547875","555901","555946","549275","553512","552470","555931","546562","557474","547046","548488","551725","556161","556290","547836","556166"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fence","tuft","expand","climbing","separation","child","sign","viewed","swing","warning"]}
