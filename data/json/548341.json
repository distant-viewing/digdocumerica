{"path":"548341.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of a busy toll bridge over a wide river. The bridge curves gracefully to the right, leading viewers' eyes through the photograph. On the bridge, a six-lane highway is filled with cars. Two lanes are dedicated to traffic moving towards the left of the image, and four lanes handle traffic moving to the right. These lanes on the right are considerably congested compared to those on the left.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a toll plaza with several toll booths. Many vehicles are lined up, waiting to pass through, but the booth lanes merge into fewer lanes as they approach the bridge, likely contributing to the congestion. Adjacent to this toll plaza is a large parking area with numerous cars, suggesting perhaps a commuter lot or a maintenance facility.\n\nOn the lower edges of the image, there are patches of greenery, and the river water has a silty, muddy appearance which suggests a significant body of water, likely a major river. The photo has a slightly grainy quality, possibly due to the age of the film or the method of capture. This image effectively communicates the scale of infrastructure needed to support heavy traffic and the daily routine of many commuters crossing the river.\n","title":"Entrance to the tappan zee bridge over the Hudson River between tarrytown and nyack","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548401","552709","546724","548389","548413","546588","546689","549861","549878","552708","548338","550986","549469","546569","546722","546704"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["lane","bridge","commuter","booth","plaza","traffic","river","method","congestion","right"]}
