{"path":"551190.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image shows an aerial view of a large dam structure spanning across a river. The dam consists of multiple lock chambers which appear to regulate water flow and traffic across the river. On the left side of the dam, there's a control building with a large, distinct white radar or communication dish on top, positioned on a protruding pier into the river.\n\nSurrounding the dam are various facilities: buildings that are likely used for operations related to the dam's functions, paved areas that likely serve as paths or roads for vehicles, and smaller structures that might be used for storage or smaller operations. On the peripheries of the dam, you can see residential or small town structures which abut closely to the dam facilities. \n\nThe river itself is calm, and there is no visible traffic on the water or the dam at the moment of the photograph. On the other bank of the river, there are residential areas with houses separated by green spaces. The overall landscape is marked by both technological infrastructure and residential development, contrasting with the natural flowing body of water. The colors in the image are vivid with the blues of the water striking against the greens of the grassy areas and the varied colors of the rooftops.","title":"Marmet Dam and the middle lock of three on the Kanawha River","placename":"Charleston (W.
