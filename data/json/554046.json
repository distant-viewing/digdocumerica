{"path":"554046.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a large agricultural field with deep furrows already plowed. The texture of the soil is rough and looks moist, possibly freshly tilled. The furrows run from the foreground to the middle ground, drawing the viewer's eye towards the horizon. Small white flags, possibly marking specific points in the field for agricultural purposes, can be seen attached to sticks placed sporadically along the rows. The background features a flat landscape with a few scattered bushes and trees under a cloudy sky. The overall mood of the image appears somber and overcast, emphasizing the expanse and solitude typical of farm lands. The absence of any visible farming equipment or workers suggests either a pause in activity or the automated process of plowing.","title":"Field ploughed for sugarcane, this island's chief crop sugarcane production has not yet been threatened by developers the sugarcane grows mainly in the central valley, where there is plenty of fresh water.
