{"path":"556588.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a young boy standing by railway tracks, with a moving freight train in the background. He appears preoccupied or thoughtful, and is exhaling a cloud of white smoke. The boy wears a horizontally striped black and white t-shirt, blue jeans, and his blonde hair is parted to the side. His posture indicates he might be walking slowly or has just paused to look at something off-camera.\n\nThe freight train behind him is dark, consisting of brown and black railcars with visible wheelsets and undercarriage components. There is a fading light that possibly indicates this photo being taken either around twilight or under overcast conditions, contributing to the overall moody and introspective ambiance of the scene.\n\nVegetation in various shades of green surrounds the railroad area, indicating an unkempt or natural railside environment. There might be some gravel or small stones among the tracks, typical of railway lines. On the left foreground, a partial view of an industrial object or infrastructure is visible, focusing the viewer's attention more on the boy and the moving train.\n\nOverall, the photograph is a compelling blend of industrial elements and a human figure, possibly intended to evoke themes of nostalgia, growth, or introspection.","title":"The cool morning air condenses a boy's breath as he walks along a coal car on his way to school in Cumberland, Kentucky, in harlan county.
