{"path":"551424.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of a large metal culvert pipe from which water is flowing out. The pipe is positioned at an angle, and the view highlights the end of the culvert, which is cut cleanly, yet shows signs of wear such as minor corrosion and some dirt on the inner surface.\n\nThe water emerges from the pipe with force, creating a clear, smooth stream before it splashes at a point that isn’t visible in the frame. There appears to be a slight buildup of sediment or rust at the point where the water exits the pipe which alters the color of the pipe’s edge to a rusty tone, contrasting with its otherwise metallic gray appearance.\n\nThe background is blurry but suggests a natural environment with earthy and brown tones, possibly a ditch or a similarly eroded area caused by regular water flow. The overall setting seems rural or semi-rural, focusing solely on the function of the culvert – channeling water, likely from drainage or runoff systems.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City. In mid-April thousands of fishermen gather at Whitney Drain, a manmade canal on Lake Huron, to dipnet for these small fish. Culvert pipe protrudes from river bank and emits ill-smelling vapors in area of the smelt run.","placename":"Saginaw (Mich.)","location":"Saginaw, Michigan","nn1":["555550","547121","552134","550218","543759","549065","553467","552136","543170","552022","549064","552062","546793","550715","546829","543830"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["pipe","ditch","corrosion","runoff","drainage","water","point","force","sediment","function"]}
