{"path":"544058.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a large industrial site and its surroundings. At the center, there's a complex that includes several large buildings surrounded by numerous smokestacks emitting a significant amount of white smoke, contributing to air pollution. Adjacent to this industrial setup are large, man-made water bodies — possibly settling or cooling ponds — reflecting the sky. These ponds are situated amidst large areas of barren, terraced land that appear to have been altered by industrial activity, such as mining or the construction of the facility itself.\n\nTo the left of the industrial complex, there is a large expanse of exposed earth in shades of orange and brown, indicative of soil disturbances caused by such activities. Roads and tracks crisscross the site and the wider area, suggesting frequent vehicular activity.\n\nThe landscape in which this industrial operation sits features rolling hills in the background, blending into a mountain range far in the distance, partially obscured by haze. This could underscore the wide-reaching impact of pollution from the site. Nearby, developed areas with roads and smaller buildings can be seen, suggesting proximity to communities.\n\nThe overall image captures a blend of heavy industrial activity and its significant environmental footprint within a broader natural and semi-developed setting.","title":"Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co.'s mines and smelter","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["550862","551567","550866","550706","544062","544067","551585","544788","551192","544059","543001","551053","544495","553968","552246","550329"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["site","pond","complex","pollution","footprint","disturbance","amount","road","proximity","mining"]}
