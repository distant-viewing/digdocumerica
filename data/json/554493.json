{"path":"554493.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene lakeside setting. In the foreground, a portion of a person is visible, seated on a wicker chair while reading a newspaper. The individual is wearing a dark-colored sweater and trousers, paired with white shoes. Only the back and partial side profile of the chair and the person's lower body are seen, suggesting a peaceful, private moment.\n\nThe surrounding environment plays a significant role in creating a tranquil atmosphere. To the left of the scene, foliage partially veils the view, adding a sense of intimacy and seclusion. The lake is visible behind the subject, its surface calm with gentle ripples, extending to meet a mostly clear sky on the horizon.\n\nOn the sandy shore of the lake, right next to the water, lies a large, weathered log, bleached and textured, contributing to the rustic, natural setting. The overall composition of the image, with its lush greens, bright blues of the water, and the sandy tones of the beach, all under natural sunlight, enhances the peaceful, leisurely vibe of a quiet lakeside retreat.","title":"Reading a newspaper in the shade at the edge of Fourth Lake New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557562","543579","545229","543601","543535","546293","543527","553082","554635","551207","550324","548034","554486","553396","550493","543547"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["chair","veil","lake","intimacy","retreat","seclusion","lakeside","newspaper","person","profile"]}
