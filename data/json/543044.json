{"path":"543044.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural or semi-rural scene captured during what appears to be the golden hours of sunset, which casts a warm, atmospheric glow, enhancing the feeling of tranquility. The main focus of the image is on a group of individuals on a road that cuts through the scene horizontally.\n\nOn the left side, there's a person riding a horse, accompanied by another individual who seems to be jogging or running alongside the horse. The rider wears a cowboy hat, suggesting a rural or western setting.\n\nTo the right, two other figures are walking away from the camera along the road's edge. The figures are rendered in silhouette due to the lighting, making specific details about their appearance indistinct.\n\nIn the background, the road is lined with wooden utility poles that hold multiple lines, leading the eyes further into the misty distance where the road disappears. Sparse foliage and a few structures, including what looks like a small, simple building (possibly a house), are visible.\n\nAdditionally, a vintage car is parked beside the building, adding to the sense of a bygone era or a less urbanized locale.\n\nThe overall composition, lighting, and subjects in the photograph provide a sense of peaceful rural life, with elements suggesting community and simple daily activities in a country setting.","title":"Children ride pony down Main Street","placename":"Orick (Calif.)","location":"Orick, California","nn1":["545349","552562","547354","546376","557186","556960","547300","549257","547316","556957","555635","549002","544395","557119","552521","542895"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["horse","road","country","figure","rider","cowboy","locale","hour","glow","sunset"]}
