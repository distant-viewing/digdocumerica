{"path":"558051.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a large, elevated highway bridge crossing over a lush, wooded area. The bridge is a long, narrow structure supported by multiple columns, and it extends across the picture from the bottom right corner to the upper left side. Beneath the bridge, a river meanders through the thick forest. The landscape around the river is dense with green trees, showing variations in color that suggest it might be early autumn.\n\nOn the left side of the image, you can see a highway curving around the landscape, connecting to the bridge. This highway is bordered by more trees and a few open fields. Further in the distance, beyond the immediate vicinity of the bridge and highway, the landscape opens up to reveal more forested areas and a few patches of cleared land.\n\nThe overall view presents a mix of natural landscape interspersed with infrastructure, showcasing a blend of human architecture and natural environment. The colors in the photo, predominated by greens and blues, suggest a serene setting, possibly in a rural or semi-rural region. There appears to be no visible human activity or vehicles, emphasizing the tranquility and possibly the lesser-traveled nature of this area.","title":"Aerial of the Ohio turnpike, foreground, and the interstate as they cross the cuyahoga valley and river.
