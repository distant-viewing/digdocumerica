{"path":"544358.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and dynamic scene in a rural setting, characterized by its natural and rustic atmosphere. The setting is a dusty path lined with green trees, with a backdrop of imposing rocky cliffs.\n\nIn the foreground, three children are running joyously alongside a horse. One child appears to be leading, while two others, including one who appears to be a girl in a yellow top, are slightly behind. All of them are in mid-motion, capturing their playful energy.\n\nTo the left side of the frame, another child, a boy, is seen riding a horse. He is dressed in casual attire, looking forward and seeming to enjoy the ride. The horse is tan with a calm demeanor, walking along the path with confidence.\n\nThe background features a wooden fence that runs parallel to the path, separating the sandy track from an area with more vegetation and trees. Beyond the fence, one can see additional horses, possibly hinting at a rural or farm setting where horses are kept.\n\nIn terms of color and lighting, the image is suffused with the warm hues of early evening or late afternoon sunlight, casting long shadows and enriching the tones of the natural landscape. The rugged texture of the cliffs and the lushness of the trees add a contrasting backdrop to the earthy colors of the path and the playful activity of the children and the horse. \n\nThis photo captures a moment of rural life, emphasizing movement, the bond between children and animals, and a serene yet lively environment.","title":"Village of Supai - part of the GRand Canyon national park","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["543043","544362","553116","543841","549108","543788","543366","553078","543678","557992","543783","544309","557781","553102","556562","552562"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["horse","child","path","ride","cliff","suffuse","fence","bond","lushness","separa"]}
