{"path":"555634.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape, likely of a mining or excavation site. The foreground shows a desolate area covered in dark, loose soil and scattered rocks, possibly the result of recent excavation activity. Toward the center and right of the image, large piles of earthen material create uneven terrain, hinting at extensive digging and moving of earth.\n\nIn the middle distance, a tall drilling rig dominates the scene, supported by other heavy machinery nearby, which suggests ongoing mining or drilling operations. This rig, characterized by its vertical structure and a framework surrounding it, is a focal point in the landscape and indicates the industrial nature of the area.\n\nThe background features hills and a relatively flat horizon, under a clear sky, indicating this site is likely in a spacious, rural or semi-rural setting. Sparse vegetation, including a few small trees or shrubs, appears in the foreground and on the hills, reinforcing the rugged and possibly recently altered landscape.\n\nThe image overall conveys a sense of industrial activity within a natural but significantly modified environment, typical of mining operations disrupting and transforming the land.","title":"Coal company machine drills test holes as it searches for coal prior to digging by a strip mining power shovel.
