{"path":"551966.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a large construction site, possibly for a highway or major roadway, viewed during the daytime under clear skies. The scene is dominated by heavy construction machinery and infrastructure components. At the forefront, multiple construction vehicles, including yellow trucks and a crane, are either parked or engaged in work amidst piles of rubble and debris scattered across the ground.\n\nIn the middle of the image, a partially constructed highway overpass spans across the entire frame. The overpass is incomplete, with concrete pillars supporting sections of the roadway deck. Workers are visible beneath the overpass, indicating ongoing construction activities. The intensity of activity suggests a major infrastructure project in progress.\n\nThe background is relatively clear but shows more construction elements and machinery in action. Above the overpass, several billboards are visible, advertising products like J&B and Beefeater Gin, providing a commercial contrast to the industrial foreground. These signs, positioned along an existing road visible in the upper part of the image, suggest that the area is within or near an urban environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of intense industrial activity, with a focus on the construction of significant transport infrastructure. The presence of workers and operating machinery highlights the scale and importance of the project.","title":"Construction trucks on 115th Street below new expressway overpass","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["550274","546252","553886","547235","553391","548431","544167","546243","553394","549913","553378","553383","544812","553382","546833","547236"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["overpass","construction","machinery","roadway","project","infrastructure","highway","worker","exist","billboard"]}
