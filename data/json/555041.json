{"path":"555041.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up view of a dense grouping of large, dark green leaves. The leaves, likely from a plant such as hosta, have a broad, oval shape with distinct, prominent veins running parallel from the stem to the outer edge. The texture is slightly glossy, and each leaf displays a series of small, reddish or orange speckles scattered across its surface.\n\nThe leaves overlap each other, creating a lush, layered appearance. Light and shadows play across the leaves, highlighting their curved contours and the slight gloss of their surfaces. The background is obscured by the closeness and thickness of the leaves, making it completely dark and ensuring the focus remains intensely on the greenery.\n\nOverall, the composition is tightly focused and fills the frame entirely with the plant, emphasizing the natural beauty and intricate details of the foliage.","title":"Bead ruby plants growing in the Queets River Valley of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551356","557539","542688","543620","554744","557593","542686","554993","555050","555049","555038","555040","554575","551372","555037","555192"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leave","thickness","grouping","closeness","vein","overlap","speckle","ensure","leaf","stem"]}
