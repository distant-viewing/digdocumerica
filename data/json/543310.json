{"path":"543310.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a coastal scene filled with natural and human elements, combining a dynamic landscape with leisurely human activities. It depicts a secluded beach area surrounded by rugged, rocky formations. The texture of the rocks is rough with various shades of brown and reddish hues, contrasting sharply with the sandy patches. In the background, frothy ocean waves crash against the rocks, suggesting a somewhat vigorous sea, under a clear blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, two children wearing swim vests and shorts are walking along the sand. They appear to be enjoying a casual stroll or perhaps exploring the area. Beside them, there's a small pool of water formed by the rocks, indicative of tidal activity.\n\nTo the right of the photograph, on a sandy patch framed by rocks, a woman reclines on a red towel. She seems to be sunbathing or relaxing, adding a tranquil human element to the scene. Various towels and possibly beach gear are strewn around her, suggesting a family or group outing.\n\nOverall, the scene encapsulates a serene beach day where natureâ€™s rugged beauty meets the leisurely activities of beach goers, creating a picturesque and peaceful setting.","title":"California--Big Sur coastline","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["543072","543047","551554","553952","557458","543287","543322","552341","543493","547009","543089","557507","543389","553765","544377","555402"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","towel","rock","stroll","goer","swim","vest","outing","pool","patch"]}
