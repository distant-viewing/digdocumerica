{"path":"558261.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a man in a moment of intense expression, possibly while singing or speaking loudly. The man appears middle-aged and has curly, light brown or blond hair. His face is partially shadowed and lit dramatically, highlighting his features which are in mid-expression with his mouth open wide.\n\nHe is dressed in a formal attire that includes what looks like a dark suit with a light-colored shirt and a striped tie. On his tie, there is a visible tie clip, and on his suit lapel, there is a badge or ornamental pin, suggesting a formal or ceremonial occasion.\n\nThe background of the image is dark and indistinct, focusing all attention on the manâ€™s expressive face and upper body. His posture and the upward angle of the shot give a sense of dynamism and intensity to the scene. It seems to be an indoor setting based on the lack of natural light and the shadows playing around him. The overall composition and lighting create a dramatic and vivid portrayal of the moment.","title":"Closeup of a member of the Concord Singers, a group in New Ulm, Minnesota, who specialize in German songs. The group is made up of men of varying occupations, and includes newcomers who work in the manufacturing plants as well as lifelong residents. The singers are trying to keep the heritage from Germany alive. Twenty years ago many of the townspeople could speak some German, but the tradition is dying.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["542784","556252","557035","556310","552872","549114","556443","557144","557648","556540","548571","556452","554340","557034","556563","548616"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["tie","suit","clip","singe","dynamism","pin","occasion","badge","portrayal","expression"]}
