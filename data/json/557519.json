{"path":"557519.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape at what appears to be either dawn or dusk, based on the soft lighting and long shadows. The scene is a vast expanse of rolling hills or mountain ridges, layered successively into the distance. The colors are muted and monochromatic, mainly in shades of blue and grey, evoking a sense of calm and tranquility.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent hill is topped with several trees and a small building, possibly a house or a small chapel, which stands out as a solitary silhouette against the lighter sky behind it. The layers of mountains recede into the background under a hazy sky, creating a misty effect that gives the landscape a dreamlike quality. The highest peaks catch the last or first light of the day, which highlights their contours against the sky. \n\nThe photograph's composition utilizes the natural lines and curves of the landscape, leading the viewerâ€™s eye through the image from the foreground to the farthest ridges. The picture is framed in a way that emphasizes depth and the vast scale of the natural scenery. The atmosphere conveyed is peaceful and somewhat introspective, typical of landscapes captured in the softer light of the golden hour.","title":"Morning fog clearing over Oxnard Plain, a prime agricultural area now being developed for housing near Oxnard, California, north of Los Angeles. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressures. Restrictions on coastal development within 1,000 yards of the shoreline were tightened with the passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November, 1972.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555131","554402","552336","556587","544070","557000","557558","542681","557182","549249","554634","554398","554647","543023","557575","555536"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["ridge","mountain","hill","landscape","calm","hour","contour","grey","curve","scenery"]}
