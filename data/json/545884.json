{"path":"545884.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavily congested multi-lane highway, likely during rush hour. There are several lanes of traffic, with vehicles mostly appearing to be from the 1960s and 1970s, based on their designs. The traffic is dense and includes a variety of cars, such as sedans and station wagons, showcasing a range of colors and styles typical for the era.\n\nIn the foreground, a red car is prominently visible with its back towards the viewer. In the lane to its right, a white car with its front visible faces the viewer. Both cars have chrome details and are characteristic of mid-20th century American automobile design.\n\nThe setting is urban, as indicated by the multiple layers of concrete overpasses and bridges that criss-cross above and around the highway. These structures suggest a complex transportation network typical of large cities. In the distant background, tall buildings, possibly office blocks or residential complexes, affirm the urban environment. The vegetation is limited to small grassy areas beside the roads.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph indicates it might be late afternoon, given the softness of the light and how it illuminates the cars and the sides of the overpasses. This time of day, combined with the heavy traffic, suggests the scene captures a typical weekday rush hour.","title":"Traffic congestion at southwest freeway and loop 610 intersection","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["549903","553019","553726","553018","542764","548084","542684","557229","546370","557230","555437","556194","555505","553727","556729","550089"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["overpass","car","traffic","hour","lane","highway","complex","congested","rush","softness"]}
