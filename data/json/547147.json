{"path":"547147.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and somewhat somber seascape at what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the warm and muted light. In the foreground, the choppy waters of the sea shimmer with highlights created by the low sunlight. Toward the left, the silhouette of a large, industrial building or structure adds a solid, dark shape that contrasts sharply with the softer textures of the water.\n\nOn the horizon, the outlines of three tall buildings are faintly visible, suggesting a distant cityscape. These skyscrapers are reduced to mere shadows due to the distance and misty atmospheric conditions, creating a sense of vast open space between the viewer and the urban structures.\n\nThe lighting in the scene casts a warm, orange hue across the entire image, contributing to a tranquil yet poignant mood. The composition balances the heavy presence of the industrial building on the left with the expansive view of the sea and distant cityscape on the right, offering a narrative of natural and human-made environments coexisting. The surface of the sea is lively and textured, contrasting with the stillness of the structures both near and far.","title":"Lighthouse and breakwater at dusk","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["553788","545030","550291","557510","547112","544707","550034","552265","546864","552263","555731","555716","548383","552192","548241","545022"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sea","cityscape","reduce","toward","seascape","atmospheric","softer","misty","shimmer","sunrise"]}
