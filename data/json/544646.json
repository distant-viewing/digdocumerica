{"path":"544646.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The image depicts an aerial view of a water body, likely a river or a bay. At the center of the photograph, a flatboat equipped with a cabin and an outdoor working area is involved in operations connected to a series of large, cylindrical objects, possibly logs or industrial pipes, which extend perpendicularly into the water and are arranged to form a branching structure resembling the letter Y. These objects are submerged to varying extents and appear to be either assembled into or disassembled from a structured formation.\n\nThe boat itself is in motion, as evidenced by the ripples and waves in the water surrounding it, and there are indications of human activity on the boat, with people visible performing tasks. The wake behind the boat is tinged lighter, suggesting churn or disturbance in the water, potentially from sediment or another substance.\n\nThe overall atmosphere gives an industrial or construction-related impression, likely indicating efforts to build, repair, or dismantle an aquatic structure. The water is a murky green color, and the lack of other visible vessels or landscapes gives the scene an isolated feel. The photograph captures both the complexity and the scale of human enterprises that interact with natural water environments.","title":"'Reclaiming land'","placename":"Marco Island (Fla. : Island)","location":"Marco Island, Florida","nn1":["551179","544643","551993","550901","546836","544636","552206","551565","544758","551991","550951","544753","548187","551599","546019","548201"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["boat","disassemble","water","dismantle","enterprise","churn","assemble","extent","indication","tinge"]}
