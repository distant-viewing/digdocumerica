{"path":"543939.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph depicts a police boat labeled \"POLICE JEFFERSON COUNTY\" with the number 360 prominently displayed on its stern. The scene is set on a body of water, possibly a river or lake. Two individuals are visible on the rear part of the boat; they are standing and facing forward, giving the impression that they are either patrolling or observing the surroundings. The police boat is equipped with at least two antennas and some lights or possibly small radar equipment on top of the cabin.\n\nThe background features a hazy skyline with a tall bridge and a couple of buildings, suggesting an urban setting near the water. The bridge is a metallic truss structure typical of those used for both rail and road transport. The photograph has a somewhat grainy and muted tone, indicating it might have been taken during the early evening or possibly through a filter that reduces the brightness and contrast of the scene. This adds a tranquil yet somewhat somber atmosphere to the image.","title":"State and county police patrol the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["549313","546798","554445","551254","549509","548525","547961","557815","545921","543971","546976","543972","551237","547685","545917","549418"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["police","boat","bridge","reduce","truss","antenna","brightness","cabin","rail","couple"]}
