{"path":"554213.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photo captures a winter scene centered on a series of large multistory buildings that appear to be a resort or lodges typically found in ski areas. These buildings have a rustic architectural design featuring dark wood and stone materials, which blend with the environment. Covered in snow, the rooftops add to the wintry feel, complemented by the large mountain range in the background showing a natural forest snowy landscape.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows a snow-covered road or clearing where a few cars are parked, though largely obscured by snow banks. Two people can be seen: one individual is on the left side walking, and another person to the right, who appears to be either walking away or standing. Their winter attire suggests they are residents or visitors engaged in seasonal activities, likely related to skiing or snowboarding given the context of the location.\n\nThe sky is clear and intensely blue, indicating a crisp, clear day, and only a few leafless trees are sparsely situated around the buildings, adding to the chilly, winter aesthetic of the scene. This photo presents a tranquil view of a popular winter destination, capturing both the architecture designed for cold climates and the recreational allure of such a place.","title":"Condominiums at Spring and Hyman streets","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554281","554249","554284","554255","554279","554236","554214","552607","554235","554233","554275","554291","543755","554253","554288","554234"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["winter","snow","allure","lodge","walking","skiing","ski","resort","resident","destination"]}
