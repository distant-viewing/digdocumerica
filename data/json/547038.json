{"path":"547038.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a small, single-story building that appears to be in a state of disrepair, situated very close to a body of water, likely a lake or sea, given the presence of waves breaking against its foundation. The building is constructed with what looks like cinder block walls, part of which are crudely covered with plywood panels, and it features a simple gabled roof with red roofing material.\n\nMost notably, the structure is surrounded by a large amount of debris and broken concrete pieces, suggesting erosion or damage from the water. The building has wooden planks serving as a makeshift walkway leading up to and around it. One side of the building, facing the water, has a wooden deck, which is also in a deteriorating state, with several planks missing or askew, posing a potential hazard.\n\nThe background is mostly a clear, blue sky with no clouds visible, indicating a sunny day. The water appears calm except where it meets the land, where small waves are visible splashing against the remnants of a barrier or the building's foundation.\n\nThere are no people or animals visible in the scene, emphasizing a sense of abandonment and neglect. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of isolation and decay, highlighting the impacts of natural forces on man-made structures.","title":"Lake Michigan storm has ripped siding from house and torn up the yard in zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547040","546871","544445","543171","554788","547085","543339","554707","543242","543344","547622","551115","544698","551330","544465","548044"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["foundation","plank","wave","break","cinder","state","missing","hazard","building","roofing"]}
