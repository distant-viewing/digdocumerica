{"path":"545968.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features a tranquil scene focusing on a person engaged in fishing on a calm river. Seen from a rear viewpoint, the individual is wearing a large, rounded straw hat and a red jacket, suggesting a cool or temperate climate. They are holding a fishing rod, extending it towards the still, reflective water.\n\nThe river itself is bordered by dense, leafless trees and a variety of vegetation, draped with Spanish moss that lends an eerie, serene quality typical of a southern swamp or bayou environment. The reflections of the trees are clear in the water, creating a mirror-like effect that enhances the calmness of the scene.\n\nIn the middle distance and on the right side of the riverbank, there are more trees and some visible homes or structures that appear rustic and blend into the natural environment. Some recreational items, possibly belonging to other visitors or residents, can be seen by the waterâ€™s edge.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its natural tones, reflective water, and focus on the solitary figure of the fisher against a broadly natural backdrop, evokes a peaceful and somewhat introspective mood.","title":"Fishing in man-made canal off Bayou Gauche.
