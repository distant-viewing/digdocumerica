{"path":"544523.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a view across a vast field of tall grasses and wildflowers, under a partly cloudy sky. In the foreground, the landscape is dominated by dense, wild vegetation, primarily grasses, interspersed with patches of yellow flowers and other greenery. The natural, untamed state of the field suggests it might be a natural or rural area.\n\nIn the background, contrasting sharply with the natural foreground, there are modern structures. Two large buildings dominate the mid-ground and background. The building on the left appears to be a large, somewhat austere modernist structure with a flat facade and a central entrance, possibly constructed of concrete or stone. The structure on the right is more complex, featuring multiple levels with visible scaffolding and construction elements, indicating it may be under construction or undergoing renovation. This building has numerous windows and a layered appearance, with signs and billboards that are not clearly legible from the distance but imply commercial use.\n\nThe overall composition lays a stark contrast between the wild, natural environment in the foreground and the human-made architectural developments in the background. This juxtaposition might suggest themes of nature versus urbanization or the encroachment of human constructions into natural landscapes. The cloudy sky and the clear visibility of the buildings give the image a vivid but slightly dramatic ambiance.","title":"Florida International University on U.S. 41, TaMiami Trail","placename":"Dade County (Fla.)","location":"Dade County, Florida","nn1":["544519","544676","546463","545971","552515","549229","551134","557530","555609","546170","553743","549134","553698","555542","549227","554807"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["construction","urbanization","renovation","encroachment","scaffolding","billboard","field","building","grass","wildflower"]}
