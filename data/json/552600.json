{"path":"552600.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic and tranquil landscape characterized by a blend of natural elements and autumn colors. In the foreground, a flowing river with clear blue waters is partially lined by bright, dry grasses and small shrubs, possibly indicating a change in seasons. Beyond the river lies a dense forest of deciduous trees that display a range of autumnal hues, from golden yellow to deeper oranges, with some still retaining their green shades, suggesting early fall.\n\nThe background is dominated by a majestic mountain with flat, plateau-like topography. The mountain, featured under a clear, blue sky, has distinct layers, with the lower part appearing as a steep, sheer cliff of darker rocks. Above the cliff, the upper sections of the mountain are smoother and more expansive, showcasing lighter colors that may indicate different rock formations or sediments.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of water, dense forest foliage, and a dramatic mountain backdrop, presenting a serene and beautifully balanced natural setting. The absence of human presence or man-made structures enhances the untamed and pristine feel of the landscape.","title":"Rifle, the major town of the piceance basin is located on the Colorado river.
