{"path":"548218.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man from a side perspective, providing a candid and intimate glimpse into a moment in his life. The man wears a dark-colored flat cap and a denim jacket, suggesting a casual or work-related setting. His facial features are weathered, with distinct lines and wrinkles which suggest age and experience. His expression is thoughtful and introspective, looking downward in a manner that suggests deep thought or perhaps melancholy.\n\nThe image is taken in a dimly lit environment, possibly indoors, with a soft focus that obscures specific details of the surroundings and emphasizes the subject. The background is blurry, with indistinct forms and colors that hint at other objects or people nearby, but they are not the focus of the image. The overall mood conveys a sense of solitude or quiet reflection. The framing and composition direct the viewer's attention solely to the elderly man, making his expression and demeanor the central elements of the photograph.","title":"The local CIL delivery man having coffee at Poole's Rexall Drugstore in Rockport","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["552103","548224","547282","556084","556563","554857","543701","556443","547179","548236","548251","552871","554915","548616","556452","548226"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["indoor","wrinkle","expression","framing","manner","thought","denim","man","demeanor","experience"]}
