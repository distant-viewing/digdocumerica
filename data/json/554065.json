{"path":"554065.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning coastal scene dominated by lively marine and mountainous elements. In the foreground, the dark blue and choppy waters of the ocean are highlighted, featuring waves breaking and creating white foam. A lone surfer is visible, skillfully riding one of these waves, adding a sense of action and human interest to the seascape.\n\nIn the middle ground, the coastline is partially visible, adorned with what appears to be a mix of natural landscapes and possibly sparse human settlement. The clarity isn't perfect, but the presence of land forms a distinct geographical boundary.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dramatic mountain range, soaring into the sky and partially enshrouded by thick, fluffy clouds that rest atop the peaks like a soft cap. The clouds and mountains bask in a muted light, possibly of early morning or late afternoon, which adds a moody, almost ethereal quality to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition uses natural layers—ocean, land, and sky—to create a deeply textured and vibrant panoramic view that conveys both the beauty and dynamic forces of nature at play.","title":"Maui County's Hookipa Park, where surfing is a popular sport; towns of Kahului and Wailuku in background.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["554064","543433","543250","553910","543300","543432","553805","543309","543092","543328","545122","543289","553995","543430","543060","553775"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","soar","wave","seascape","land","mountain","settlement","foam","cloud","force"]}
