{"path":"549640.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This image captures a bustling industrial construction site under a clear blue sky with some sparse clouds. The main focus is on a large structure being erected, surrounded by scaffolding and aided by cranes. To the left of the frame stands a tall, cylindrical tower, possibly a smokestack, capped and partially constructed, with visible stairs wrapping around the outside.\n\nIn the center and right of the frame, there is a complex framework of steel girders, suggesting the skeleton of a large industrial building or facility under construction. Two cranes, one of which is planted adjacent to this central structure, are visible, indicating ongoing heavy lifting and assembly work.\n\nThe foreground features rough, uneven terrain with patches of earth and small debris, typical of active construction zones. Various construction materials, like beams and sheets, are scattered around the area. A few workers are visible around the site, wearing hard hats and engaged in the construction activities, emphasizing the scale and human element of the industrial project.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a sense of dynamic industrial progress and architectural development in a somewhat arid environment.","title":"Navajo generating plant under construction.
