{"path":"556389.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph portrays an industrial setting with a vintage and somewhat neglected appearance. The focus is on a large, cylindrical industrial machine or tank, which is prominently labeled \"Unit 853A REB VAC FILTER.\" The label, showing signs of wear and discoloration, is affixed to the curved, metallic surface of the machine, which is somewhat rusted and dirty.\n\nThe environment around the machine is dark and shadowy, with only parts of the structure and surrounding equipment faintly illuminated. There are various metal pipes and beams visible, intertwined in a complex pattern that suggests a labyrinth of machinery typical of an old factory or industrial plant. The flooring appears sturdy, possibly made of metal grating, contributing to the utilitarian look of the scene.\n\nThe background and upper sections of the space are obscured by darkness, with only the silhouettes of further industrial components discernible. The overall ambiance is one of a long-standing industrial operation, marked by years of use and minimal upkeep. The photographâ€™s lighting enhances the textures and age of the materials, giving it a somber and mysterious feel.","title":"Cleaning trays and screens in the cleaning plant of the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia.
