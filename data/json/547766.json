{"path":"547766.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a bustling suburban area intersected by a major highway. The image captures a large, curved multi-lane highway bustling with traffic, visible in the foreground. Numerous vehicles can be seen traveling along the highway, suggesting a typical busy day.\n\nBeyond the highway, the focus shifts to an expansive residential neighborhood characterized by rows of tightly packed houses, primarily single-story with similar architectural designs and uniformly arranged. The housing area is vast, covering most of the image, illustrating a typical suburban sprawl. Each house appears to have a small yard, and the streets between houses are organized in a grid-like pattern.\n\nIn the background, beyond the residential zone, the horizon stretches far with what appears to be more urban development, slightly hazy perhaps due to the distance or atmospheric conditions. The sky is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day, which casts sharp shadows adding depth to the buildings and enhances the contours of the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition, captured with a wide-angle or fisheye lens given the curved edges of the frame, offers a comprehensive view of the interplay between urban infrastructure and residential living, emphasizing the structure and layout typical of suburban developments adjacent to major transportation routes.","title":"Expressway","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["558112","548092","549071","545914","547435","553937","553699","553936","547211","558057","546399","548825","553934","548411","553700","546612"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["highway","house","development","bustle","lens","shift","sprawl","housing","route","living"]}
