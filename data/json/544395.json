{"path":"544395.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene on a street that captures a blend of rustic and vintage vibes. In the foreground, a man rides a horse, moving away from the camera. The horse is light colored with dark patches, and the rider is casually dressed in a light blue shirt, jeans, and a belt, suggesting a relaxed or everyday outing scenario. He is not wearing any visible safety gear like a helmet.\n\nIn the background, there are two vintage pickup trucks parked roadside—a yellow one and a white one, indicative of models from around the 1960s or 70s based on their style and design. These vehicles add a quaint, historical feel to the scene.\n\nBeside the road and behind the vehicles stands a two-story building made of stone, which appears to be a business establishment, potentially a motel as suggested by the yellow sign saying “HOTEL” with the words “VACANCY” underneath it in red, clearly visible against a background of ample greenery including trees and shrubs. This setting suggests a small town, perhaps in a rural or semi-rural area, where life moves at a slower, more scenic pace.\n\nThere's a person, partially visible, dressed in light-colored clothing sitting by the roadside near the horse and trucks, contributing to the casual, laid-back atmosphere of the scene. The overall ambiance communicates a synthesis of everyday life activities in a locale where modes of transportation from different eras coexist harmoniously.","title":"Arizona--Moenkopi","placename":"Moenkopi (Ariz.)","location":"Moenkopi, Arizona","nn1":["544362","553114","544425","543044","557051","543787","544420","553118","550005","552562","550098","544308","556548","543776","549198","554689"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["horse","roadside","one","motel","mode","truck","70","hotel","pace","say"]}
