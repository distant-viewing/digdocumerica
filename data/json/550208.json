{"path":"550208.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene featuring a wide, slightly muddy river with a gentle current. In the foreground, two individuals are seen maneuvering a small, metal rowboat just off the shore, slightly angled toward the viewer. Both individuals appear engaged in either entering or stabilizing the boat, wearing casual outdoor attire.\n\nThe riverbank curves gently from the left foreground to the distant right, lined with a sandy beach littered with some debris and small logs. A sparse line of small waves laps at the shore. Beyond the beach, a lush green forest extends along the bank, marking a stark contrast with the sandy shoreline.\n\nIn the background, under a vast, partly cloudy sky with fluffy clouds, the opposite side of the riverbank is not visible, implying the river's breadth. Far in the distance, faint industrial structures or city buildings can be glimpsed, suggesting the proximity of a developed area, though it appears quite distant and faint, possibly obscured by atmospheric haze.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is calm and somewhat solitary, with the focus predominantly on the interaction between the humans and their small boat in the vast natural landscape.","title":"In an attempt to make the water usable for swimming, city employees pour chlorine into lake erie at white city beach","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550988","550989","550000","557972","551350","551281","543444","545654","550835","551217","546352","550773","550831","553411","552330","546976"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["riverbank","beach","shore","breadth","rowboat","stabilize","boat","maneuver","current","enter"]}
