{"path":"546477.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The image depicts an architectural detail, focusing on a corner of a building partially obscured by foliage. The building has vertically oriented panels in bright red and white colors. The red panel dominates the left side of the image, while the white panel is seen on the right, contrasted by a shadow or a darker panel placed next to it. There is a subtle presence of a balcony or an architectural overhang visible on the upper right corner where the white panel meets the shadowed area.\n\nThe building's base appears to be constructed of a smooth, tan-colored material, possibly concrete, which spans across the bottom of the image. The upper part of the photograph is shaded by tree leaves that intrude into the frame from both sides, overlaying a part of the structure and adding a dimension of natural green tones to the predominantly artificial colors of the building.\n\nThe entire image is imbued with a soft light, indicative of either early morning or late afternoon, which casts diffused shadows across the building and creates a contrast of light and dark areas. This gentle illumination accentuates the vertical lines and smooth textures of the building's façade, while the leaves add a textural contrast with their natural, irregular forms.","title":"L.
