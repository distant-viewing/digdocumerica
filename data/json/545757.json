{"path":"545757.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features two children sitting in a shallow natural rock cave or alcove. The person to the left appears to be a girl with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a blue jacket over a lighter blue shirt. She is wearing jeans, white socks, and dark sneakers with white laces. The girl is gazing upward, possibly at something out of the frame. Beside her, to the right, is probably a younger boy with shorter brown hair, also dressed in a similar blue jacket, jeans, and similar sneakers. He is sitting with his legs crossed and seems to be looking towards the left side of the frame, possibly at the girl.\n\nThe background and environment surrounding the children is rugged and natural, characterized by earthy, reddish-brown tones of rock. The textures on the rock surface are rough, with natural pitting and a mottled appearance suggesting erosion or weathering effects. The cave's shadows enhance its depth and create a feeling of seclusion or refuge.\n\nThe lighting is soft and indirect, illuminating the faces of the children gently and emphasizing the matte texture of the stone around them. This setup evokes a sense of adventure or exploration, typical of youthful outdoor activities, possibly during a hike or a camping trip in a rocky, desert-like environment.","title":"Hikers rest at Fiery Furnace in Arches National Park.
