{"path":"543064.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal sunset. The viewpoint overlooks a body of water that gleams under the golden light of the setting sun. The composition includes several jagged rocks and islets protruding from the water, which contribute to creating a rugged coastal landscape. These rock formations are scattered throughout the frame, with varying sizes and shapes, adding texture and depth to the seascape.\n\nThe sunlight diffuses gracefully across the water, creating shimmering reflections and gentle gradients of light and shadow. The horizon is visible in the distance, marked by the soft, glowing orb of the sun setting behind a larger island or landmass. This gives a sense of calm vastness to the scene.\n\nThe waves softly lap against the shore and rocks, suggesting a peaceful, although dynamic marine environment. The overall color palette is dominated by warm golden and amber tones, reinforcing the serene and tranquil mood of a sunset at the coast. There are no visible human figures or man-made objects, which emphasizes the natural beauty and solitude of the location. The sky above is not very prominent, but it complements the scene with a gradient fading from a deeper blue to the warmer tones near the horizon.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554075","553989","542808","543144","554074","545030","547479","545238","547483","545000","544711","543140","545019","550296","547731","552294"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["gradient","rock","sunset","islet","orb","sun","landmass","seascape","coast","island"]}
