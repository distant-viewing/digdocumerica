{"path":"554393.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric scene set in a dense forest. Sunlight filters through the canopy, creating dappled patches of light and long shadows on the forest floor. The composition predominantly features tall, straight trunks of trees, presumably pines or similar conifers, arranged densely yet evenly, emphasizing vertical lines and a sense of height. Underneath these towering trees, the ground is covered with a lush carpet of ferns, which appear light green and are illuminated by the sunlight, highlighting their delicate frond patterns.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is quiet and secluded, enhanced by the play of light and shadow. The effect of the light suggests either early morning or late afternoon, times when the sun is low enough to cast long shadows and enrich the colors of the forest. There is a hint of mystique, as the deeper parts of the forest fade into shadow, possibly leading the viewer's eye to imagine what lies beyond. No human presence or artificial elements can be seen, reinforcing the natural purity and tranquility of this wooded scene.","title":"Early morning sunlight filters through balsam firs and ferns at Twitchell Lake.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554394","555118","554965","542931","550791","558082","555051","554425","542849","555028","555120","542725","554959","546947","554998","543021"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","shadow","mystique","frond","carpet","fern","conifer","sunlight","play","light"]}
