{"path":"543783.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene featuring a young boy leading a white horse by a rein down a dirt path. The boy is wearing a straw hat, a striped shirt, and tall dark boots. His expression seems focused and serious as he walks ahead of the horse. The horse, equipped with a saddle, appears calm and cooperative.\n\nThe setting includes a deep blue sky and a dusty, unpaved road flanked by wooden fences and sparse vegetation. Toward the horizon, there are small, rounded hills and a few scattered buildings, possibly barns or rural homes. The lighting in the image seems to be from midday sun, casting clear shadows on the dirt road.\n\nThe composition's depth is accentuated by the road that leads into the distant landscape, directing the viewer's eye from the foreground activities toward the expansive background. The overall atmosphere evokes a sense of pastoral life and the companionship between the boy and his horse.","title":"Child with horse on ranch","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553064","543678","552562","553116","553118","554689","543787","552564","544362","544308","546996","549198","557186","543779","554011","556548"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["horse","boy","rein","saddle","road","dirt","companionship","straw","midday","barn"]}
