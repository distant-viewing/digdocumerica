{"path":"546777.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a busy shipyard, where a large ship, named \"ΕΛΕΝΗΚ Μ\", registered in Piraeus, is docked and undergoing maintenance or repair. The ship is large and metallic, predominantly gray, with features such as lifeboats and various deck structures visible. \n\nThe foreground of the photo shows part of the shipyard with a complex scaffold structure surrounding the hull of the ship. Workers can be seen on the scaffold, engaged in their tasks, contributing to the overall industrial vibe of the scene. The scaffold is constructed from metal, with multiple levels giving access to different parts of the ship’s exterior.\n\nThere are other shipyard elements visible, like cranes and lifting equipment, indicative of ongoing heavy-duty work. The water surrounding the ship reflects elements of the ship and the scaffold, suggesting that the shipyard is likely beside a river or coast.\n\nThe photo encapsulates a typical industrial maritime environment, characterized by large structures, heavy machinery, and active workers, all under clear blue skies.","title":"Drydock","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546016","546802","548125","547474","546843","546766","545147","552149","555797","552148","549590","546012","546755","555806","550910","551997"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["scaffold","shipyard","ship","worker","register","undergo","coast","maritime","repair","duty"]}
