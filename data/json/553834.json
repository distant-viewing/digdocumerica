{"path":"553834.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a well-manicured residential area displaying a row of identical two-story townhouses. Each house is white, and most feature a combination of paint and rock cladding on their facades, as well as prominent front columns supporting small overhangs above the entrance doors. The houses are arranged in a long, straight line, and the symmetry of the architecture is a notable feature.\n\nIn the foreground of the image is a meticulously landscaped yard. It features a striking white statue that appears to depict a figure (possibly cherubic) pouring a jug, which is part of an ornamental fountain. Surrounding the base of the fountain are carefully arranged white stones, and the garden itself is dotted with small bushes and vibrant red flowers.\n\nThe pathways and driveways are also notable; they are bordered with red bricks, creating clean, geometric lines that add to the overall orderly aesthetic. The lawns are lush and green, indicating well-maintained grounds. The sky is bright and clear, suggesting a sunny day without clouds, adding vibrancy to the verdant and white hues dominating the scene.","title":"Great Kills Park, Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546435","556436","547981","547945","557065","547335","558149","557094","551164","546442","556433","548470","556950","555889","551629","550121"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["fountain","jug","arrange","townhouse","symmetry","pour","driveway","house","statue","overhang"]}
