{"path":"550888.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph presents a serene and picturesque scene of the sky at what appears to be either dawn or dusk. The sky is permeated with a rosy pink hue, suggestive of the colors typical at sunrise or sunset. This pink coloration fills the entire backdrop, creating a soft and tranquil atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, a line of birds is captured in mid-flight, arranged in a slight diagonal that ascends from the lower left to the upper right portion of the image. The birds, likely a species of larger birds perhaps geese or similar migratory birds, are silhouetted against the lighter sky, emphasizing their motion and the gracefulness of their formation.\n\nSignificantly contrasting with the gentle pink of the sky are robust and dark cloud formations at the bottom of the image. These clouds appear thick and dense, their dark gray tones providing a dramatic base for the composition of the image. They add a sense of depth and a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—with the gradient of the sky, the silhouette of the birds, and the robust clouds—coalesces into an image that is both dynamic and peaceful, capturing a fleeting moment of natural beauty in the sky.","title":"Clouds and pelicans above the Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550887","553875","544609","550382","557203","544605","544597","554646","544601","549772","544834","557208","542992","553776","557209","547744"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","cloud","permeate","formation","ascend","pink","coloration","sky","sunrise","species"]}
