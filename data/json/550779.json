{"path":"550779.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape highlighted by a small, calm pond, which beautifully reflects the blue sky and surrounding greenery. A red, small rowboat is partially visible on the left side of the pond, nestled among dense aquatic vegetation and partially obscured by tall grasses and reeds. It appears slightly tilted, suggesting stillness or a gentle mooring.\n\nThe background is dominated by a lush, grassy embankment rising steeply from the pond. The vegetation is dense, featuring various shades of green and hints of other wildflowers or plants. Atop the hill, slightly offset to the right, is a small wooden structure with a sloping roof, possibly an old shed or storage building which appears rustic and weathered. The overall atmosphere of the scene conveys a quiet and untouched slice of nature, evoking a sense of peace and remoteness. The light suggests it might be early morning or late afternoon, given the gentle, soft quality casting over the scene.","title":"Moen Lake--one of the many connected lakes of the 11,815 square mile Wisconsin River drainage basin","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550780","557783","554776","550778","558094","550324","554623","547536","543611","557562","545008","554591","547017","557255","546963","548030"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["pond","mooring","rowboat","remoteness","embankment","peace","reed","shed","wildflower","stillness"]}
