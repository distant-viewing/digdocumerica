{"path":"555500.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph presents a group of nine people of various ages bicycling together on a paved road, seemingly on a chilly day given their winter attire. They are widely spaced across the road, casually cycling towards the camera. The people are dressed warmly with many wearing gloves and hats; their winter clothes suggest a cool weather environment. The bicycles appear to be standard road bikes.\n\nThe environment around the cyclists is rural and muted in color, featuring leafless trees and a gloomy, overcast sky. The background includes a stark, leafless tree and power lines, enhancing the sense of a desolate, chilly day. The road they are on is bordered by grassy edges, and there's a hint of moisture on the road, suggesting recent rain or early morning dew.\n\nThis image captures a sense of leisurely movement and communal activity, possibly a family or friends group enjoying an outdoor exercise despite the cold weather. The setting and attire of the cyclists convey a quiet, possibly early morning, outing in a rural locale, offering a glimpse into a moment of shared activity and enjoyment of the outdoors.","title":"School children were forced to use their bicycles on field trips during the fuel crisis in the winter of 1974. There was not enough gasoline for school buses to be used for extracurricular activities, even during dark and rainy weather.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555499","548574","552340","543719","548572","543715","547241","548573","555433","550069","545287","551545","547209","554690","557181","558193"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["cyclist","road","bicycle","winter","exercise","dew","cycle","bike","morning","friend"]}
