{"path":"551006.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene featuring a busy railroad yard. In the foreground, a series of tanker railcars, which appear to be used for transporting liquids, are prominently displayed. These tankers are dark and cylindrical, with visible hardware and railings on the top.\n\nIn the midground, two men are seen engaged in what looks like a signaling or communication activity. The man closer to the foreground is dressed in a light-colored shirt and dark pants, and he is energetically waving a white cloth, possibly a towel or a flag, over his head â€” a common signal method in railway operations. His posture suggests movement and urgency. The second man, positioned further back and to the left, is turned slightly away from the camera, walking and focused on his path or task.\n\nThe background shows a more expansive view of the industrial setting with multiple smokestacks emitting smoke, suggesting an active industrial plant, possibly a refinery or a manufacturing facility. These structures hint at the industrial might and operational focus of the area. The landscape is moderately hilly, and there is a faint presence of vegetation.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its focus on the industrial elements and the active workers, portrays a scene of labor and industry, typical of mid-20th-century American industrial landscapes. The lighting and color saturation give a muted, somewhat somber tone to the photograph, emphasizing the gritty reality of industrial work environments.","title":"Railroad yard at Nitro with smokestacks of the fmc chemical corporation in background","placename":"Charleston (W.
