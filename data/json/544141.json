{"path":"544141.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph presents a striking view of a large dam, captured from a narrow canyon leading up to it. The dam, probably a concrete gravity dam, is seen holding back a large body of water. The canyon walls, steep and rugged, are composed of reddish-brown rock, likely sandstone, which indicates a desert or semi-arid environment.\n\nIn the top section of the dam, there are multiple structures, likely including control towers, gates, and possibly facilities for dam operation. Above the dam, a bridge spans the canyon, suggesting a transportation route that crosses at this strategic point. There appear to be high-voltage power lines visible, extending from the upper structures of the dam, highlighting its dual role in water storage and likely hydroelectric power generation.\n\nThe dam casts a significant shadow over the canyon and the water below, emphasizing the sun's high position at the time of shooting. The water below the dam appears calm and reflects the canyon walls and dam's architectural features. \n\nThere are no visible people or moving objects, giving the image a serene, yet imposing quality. The focus and composition of the image draw attention to the architectural and natural elements, providing a sense of scale and the engineering achievement of the dam within the rugged landscape.","title":"Glen canyon dam","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544166","553828","544140","548947","544151","548927","548013","548012","548920","548003","548016","548938","549024","549004","544150","548925"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","canyon","gravity","power","voltage","achievement","generation","gate","engineering","route"]}
