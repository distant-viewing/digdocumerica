{"path":"542875.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a marina packed with various boats. At the forefront is a man, dressed in black pants, a black trench coat, and wearing a black bucket-style hat. He seems engaged in boating activities, possibly maintenance or preparation for sailing, as he holds onto what appears to be a rope or cable with one hand and a large white bucket or canister in his other hand, elevated as if he is moving or using its contents.\n\nHe stands on the dock next to a boat named \"MAGGIE-O,\" which is clearly visible on the stern of the boat, along with its registration marks \"CAL 18325 FG.\" The boat features a dark wood exterior with a notable cabin structure equipped with windows. The deck area is tidy and well-maintained, lined with various maritime equipment.\n\nIn the background, numerous other sailboats of various sizes and designs are docked in close proximity to each other. These boats have masts that reach upward and intricate rigging systems. Although it's a cloudy day and the setting appears somewhat overcast, giving the image a slight chill ambiance, the marina is calm and serene.\n\nOverall, the photograph gives a glimpse into a day at the marina, focusing on a moment of ordinary boat maintenance or setup by an individual amongst a community of boat owners.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["544244","543035","542912","552028","546877","548235","545155","546807","542902","544130","543247","551228","548528","542871","548075","548078"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","marina","bucket","canister","chill","maintenance","dock","forefro","owner","trench"]}
