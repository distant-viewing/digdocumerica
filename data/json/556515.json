{"path":"556515.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a worker, probably a miner, inside a dark, rock-covered environment that suggests an underground setting such as a mine. The worker is a man wearing a light gray shirt, dark pants, and a mining helmet equipped with a headlamp. He is kneeling on one knee on a rough, black ground which appears to be covered in mineral or coal dust.\n\nThe man is intensely focused on his task, using both hands to operate a hand-held drilling tool which has a metallic, vertical structure ending in a drill or bore that is penetrating the ground. The tool is being held steady and appears to be in the action of drilling down into the rock. \n\nTo his left, there is a part of a large, heavy machinery, possibly related to mining or excavation. This machinery section is noticeable by its bulky form and a recognizable hydraulic piston and part of its framework, painted in faded red and white colors, indicating wear and the rugged conditions of the environment.\n\nThe surroundings are minimally illuminated except for the area directly around the worker, emphasizing the depth and darkness of the setting. The ceiling of the cave or mine is rugged and uneven, with visible rock formations that reflect minimal light, emphasizing the depths and potentially hazardous nature of the environment in which the worker is situated.","title":"Roof bolter lee caldwell with a bolt used to brace ceilings in a mine of the Tennessee consolidated coal company near jasper and Chattanooga, Tennessee.  He operates a self-propelled machine with a drill that bores holes in the ceiling and automatically screws four to five foot bolts into the ceiling.  This method cuts down on the number of wooden posts needed as bracing.  This is the most dangerous job in the mines","placename":"Tennessee","location":"Tennessee","nn1":["556357","556358","556364","556396","543775","556397","556363","556367","556510","556511","556319","556360","556517","556359","556513","556366"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Miner"],"terms":["worker","mine","mining","rock","tool","cave","headlamp","miner","penetrate","machinery"]}
