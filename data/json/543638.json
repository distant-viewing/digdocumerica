{"path":"543638.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a striking landscape that includes a majestic snow-capped mountain as the focal point in the background. The mountain, sharply peaked and partially covered in snow, rises above the horizon, dominating the view. Its slopes have patches of snow and bare rock visible, suggesting it might be late spring or early summer.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a gathering of vehicles and a few small structures that align horizontally across the image. This includes several cars and what appear to be mobile campers or small trailers. It seems like an organized event or a large group outing in a rural or wilderness area.\n\nBetween the snow-capped mountains and the foreground activity, there's a sprawling layer of dense forest or woodland. This band of greenery carries through the middle of the photo, providing a rich contrast to the lighter, more transparent sky above and the detailed activity below.\n\nThe overall composition of the image suggests a blend of natural beauty and human activity, possibly depicting a common interest group enjoying the outdoors in a spectacular mountain setting. The setting appears peaceful and somewhat isolated, conducive to nature-centric activities like camping or hiking.","title":"Junked autoMobiles deface landscape.","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542751","555656","555681","555657","544936","548094","543376","543827","550415","550501","552144","542519","552173","550423","544866","550500"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["snow","mountain","centric","camper","camping","hiking","woodland","group","band","trailer"]}
