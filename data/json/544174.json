{"path":"544174.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene with various elements that define both human habitation and natural landscape. In the foreground, there are two distinct piles of red earth, possibly the result of excavation or erosion. Between these mounds, a significant amount of refuse, including pieces of metal and other debris, can be seen scattered across an area that dips towards the middle, suggesting a makeshift landfill or dumpsite.\n\nFurther back, a single-story structure, possibly a small house or shed, with a flat roof and light brown walls is visible. Adjacent to this building, there are several vehicles, including a white car, a van, and at least one other car, suggesting the presence of residents or visitors. \n\nThe background is dominated by a landscape of rolling hills covered in a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees under a bright blue sky, indicating a dry, sunny environment typical of a semi-arid region. The area between the foreground and the background is patched with grassy areas and sporadic trees, showing some signs of natural vegetation amidst the human impacts evident closer to the viewer.\n\nOverall, the image presents a balance between the natural environment and the impacts of human activities, showcasing both the beauty of the landscape and the challenges posed by waste disposal in rural settings.","title":"'House between hill and dump'","placename":"Fort Defiance (Ariz.)","location":"Fort Defiance, Arizona","nn1":["553454","543832","558084","550353","549255","553038","543828","549957","557726","555629","543600","549944","545735","548210","553039","555609"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["dumpsite","coniferous","dip","resident","impact","landfill","disposal","refuse","van","result"]}
