{"path":"544154.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a man engaged in manual labor, specifically digging or shoveling in a setting that appears to be a clay or soil extraction site. The man is dressed in a light blue and white checked shirt and wears a wide-brimmed straw hat, suggesting the need for protection from the sun, indicative of outdoor work possibly in a warm climate. The focal point is the man who is in the process of swinging a shovel, captured in mid-motion with the shovel blurred indicating movement.\n\nThe background is dominated by a deep red, almost terracotta-colored earth, creating a stark contrast against the blue sky barely visible at the top of the frame. The texture of the soil is rugged and loosely compacted, indicative of an excavation site. The composition uses a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the man and somewhat blurring the foreground and background, which emphasizes him and the action of shoveling while subtly muting the details of the environment.\n\nLighting in the scene is natural, with the intense color of the soil possibly enhanced by the warm hues of either a setting or rising sun. The image conveys a sense of hard work in a harsh, possibly arid environment.","title":"Archaeological dig - a project of the Museum of Northern Arizona.
