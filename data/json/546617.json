{"path":"546617.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a bustling urban area characterized by dense traffic and a variety of buildings. At the center, a large highway runs vertically through the frame, densely packed with numerous vehicles suggesting heavy traffic conditions. To the left of the highway, there is a curved road that loops and connects back with the highway. The surrounding area is filled with a mix of residential and commercial buildings, tightly packed into blocks. The buildings are mostly low-rise structures and vary in design and color, adding variety to the urban landscape.\n\nThe sides of the highway and the streets show lined parked cars, indicating busy commercial activities. The rooftops of the buildings offer a patchwork of hues, ranging from red and brown to light gray, which provide a contrasting texture to the smoother, darker surface of the roads. Toward the top left corner, there is a noticeable presence of green spaces, perhaps small parks or grassy areas beside the roads, giving a slight break from the dense urban environment.\n\nThere are no visible people due to the aerial perspective and the height at which the photo is taken. This perspective emphasizes the layout and infrastructure of the city rather than individual activities. The photograph gives an overall impression of a busy urban life, with a focus on transportation and dense urban planning.","title":"Southeast Washington","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546726","547765","546707","555781","555743","546678","547764","546616","553001","553838","549476","546608","546713","548363","546574","549478"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","roads","loop","traffic","patchwork","perspective","variety","rooftop","planning","dense"]}
