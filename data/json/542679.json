{"path":"542679.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image is of a dramatic sunset with the sun captured in a low position in the frame. The sun appears as a distinct, fiery red orb, centrally located and partially obscured by what seems to be a low-lying cloud, which adds a layered effect to the scene. The background is a gradient of warm colors, shifting from a deep, dusky reddish-orange near the sun, blending into a softer orange and eventually leading to a brighter yellowish tint at the top of the image.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo evokes a serene and peaceful mood. The colors suggest that the photo was likely taken during late evening, capturing the quiet tranquility of a sunset. The frame has rounded corners and an apparent texture, characteristic of old photographs, which adds a vintage feel to the scene. The simplicity of the composition focuses the viewerâ€™s attention on the colors and the spherical shape of the sun, making it the dominant element in the image.","title":"Sunset seen through heavy smog","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["552337","542678","553844","542680","557629","549847","555070","557957","549106","555164","554396","543410","543144","547719","552896","557447"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","orange","sunset","orb","distinct","softer","tint","shift","low","gradient"]}
