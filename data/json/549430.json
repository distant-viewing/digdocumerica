{"path":"549430.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures an intense moment of a yacht race on a rough sea. The main focus is a large sailing yacht dramatically tilted to one side as it cuts through the waves, which suggests strong winds and challenging sailing conditions. The yacht, named \"La Forza del Destino\" registered in Sunapee, New Hampshire, is densely packed with crew members who are actively engaged in handling the boat.\n\nSeveral crew members are positioned on the high side of the yacht, using their weight to balance it against the heeling caused by the wind in the sails. They appear focused and committed, dressed in practical sailing gear suitable for the wet and windy conditions. The yacht's sails are fully deployed and filled with wind, emphasizing the speed and movement through the water.\n\nIn the background, other yachts are visible, also competing in the race. They too are heeling and battling through similar rough conditions, which creates a dynamic and somewhat tense atmosphere typical of competitive sailing events.\n\nThe tumultuous ocean and overcast sky complement the overall intense and action-packed scene of the yacht race. The image conveys a sense of adventure, teamwork, and the thrill of competitive sports sailing.","title":"Stiff breeze on chesapeake bay in the early hours of the Annapolis-Newport race.
