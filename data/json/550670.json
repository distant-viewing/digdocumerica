{"path":"550670.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph beautifully captures a natural wetland scene with vivid, lush vegetation. The foreground is dominated by a cluster of bright red-orange flowers with yellow centers, possibly wildflowers native to a wetland area. They are surrounded by tall green grasses and various fern-like plants, indicating a rich, biodiverse habitat.\n\nTo the left of the image, there is a body of calm water that reflects the greyish-blue sky above. This body of water is partially obscured by the dense vegetation, which suggests that the photo was taken from the edge of the wetland, looking out over the water. The intricate details of the plant life, including various shades of green and the textured leaves of the ferns, add depth and interest to the scene.\n\nThe composition of the photograph emphasizes the tranquility and untouched beauty of the wetland environment. The overall lighting seems to be soft, possibly due to overcast weather, which enhances the saturation of the plant colors and adds a serene mood to the image. Overall, the scene is a striking depiction of a wetland ecosystem in its natural state.","title":"Pontook Reservoir area on the Androscoggin River between Lake Umbagog and Berlin","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["547488","550783","544475","557498","550786","545033","553856","547500","542554","547589","546205","550787","550785","544593","558009","547639"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["wetland","fern","plant","saturation","depiction","habitat","ecosystem","interest","orange","vegetation"]}
