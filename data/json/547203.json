{"path":"547203.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint and serene suburban scene, featuring two religious statues in a well-kept garden in front of a residential home. The garden, positioned in the foreground, has carefully arranged white stones outlining its perimeter and features two statues: one of the Virgin Mary, colored predominantly in blue and white, and a smaller statue, possibly of a saint, dressed in red and white. The lawn around the garden is lush green, suggesting that the photo was taken in a season conducive to robust lawn growth.\n\nThe house in the background displays typical suburban architecture, possibly dating from the mid-20th century. It has wood siding, painted in a faded, dark blue, and white trim around the windows. The house has at least two visible windows and a small white wooden staircase leading to a side door. The property appears mature, with some trees and shrubs that are not yet in full leaf, also indicating that it might be early spring.\n\nThe ambience of the scene is peaceful, possibly situated in a quiet neighborhood. The clarity and composition of the image, along with the vibrant colors, suggest it was taken during a sunny day, which casts soft shadows and enhances the tranquility and simple beauty of the suburban setting.","title":"Garden of a working class neighborhood","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["546441","546435","549279","557094","553834","550125","556433","550121","558164","558021","546035","558157","557668","556426","547938","556448"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["statue","garden","lawn","perimeter","house","staircase","ambience","leaf","clarity","property"]}
