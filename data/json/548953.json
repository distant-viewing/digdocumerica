{"path":"548953.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural irrigation scene where multiple sprinklers are actively spraying water over a vast field of crops. The field slopes gently upwards, and the water being sprayed is highlighted by what appears to be the bright, perhaps midday sunlight, creating a vivid display of water streams in the air.\n\nThe sprinkler system consists of several units placed at regular intervals, each emitting a forceful jet of water that creates an arc defined by fine water droplets. The water particles dispersed by these sprinklers catch the light, resulting in a misty and somewhat ethereal visual effect, emitting a slightly bluish hue. \n\nYou can see the contrast of the dark green crops against the bright water sprays, accentuating the lushness of the vegetation being irrigated. The sky is not distinctly visible suggesting either a close-up angle focusing more on the action of the sprinklers or possible overexposure. The overall effect is that of a lively and dynamic agricultural practice, essential for the growth and maintenance of these crops, set against a bright, possibly sunny day that enhances the droplets of water caught in motion. The upper portion of the image is darker, further accentuating the spray of water jets as they meet the atmosphere.","title":"Irrigation on experimental farm operated by epa's Las Vegas national research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["546949","546825","543650","553432","548875","554014","548877","548950","548991","548869","543777","549178","546829","548901","553652","546404"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["spray","crop","jet","droplet","water","accentuat","catch","interval","spraie","lushness"]}
