{"path":"544512.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of an oil drilling rig situated in a remote, forested area. The rig, which is the central focus of the image, towers above the surrounding landscape with a complex structure composed of vertical steel beams and several working platforms at different levels. It appears to be a large-scale industrial site designed for deep drilling operations.\n\nSurrounding the base of the rig, several auxiliary structures and equipment can be seen. These include long horizontal storage tanks in silver and blue, likely for storing drilling fluids or fuel. Buildings that may serve as operational control rooms, storage areas, or worker accommodations are visible. These structures are relatively modest and rectangular, primarily white or light-colored.\n\nVarious pieces of machinery and equipment are scattered around the site, including heavy trucks, possibly used for transportation of materials and machinery to and from the site. Cranes and other lifting devices are evident as well, aiding in assembling and maintaining the rig structure and its components.\n\nThe surrounding area is densely wooded, emphasizing that this drilling operation is taking place in a secluded or possibly environmentally sensitive zone. The trees appear uniform in height and densely packed, indicating a mature, undisturbed forest environment surrounding the facility, which starkly contrasts with the industrial activity occurring at the rig site.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures the intrusion of industrial technology into a natural landscape, reflecting both the reach of human industrial activities and the environmental considerations such locations might entail.","title":"New oil rig, north of gum slough, in big cypress swamp","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544511","544272","555634","545834","545838","545827","546064","550563","550565","552686","552990","553453","545011","545963","549169","544179"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["rig","site","accommodation","consideration","working","storage","fluid","surround","assemble","machinery"]}
