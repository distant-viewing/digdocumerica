{"path":"558106.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene showing a vast field with rows of crops on a cloudy day. A single individual, wearing a coat, is standing in the field, observing the plants or perhaps walking through them. The crops vary in color and type, including leafy greens and possibly cabbages, which add a touch of diversity to the shades of green dominating the scene.\n\nThe background is lined with a variety of mature trees displaying hints of autumnal coloring, suggesting the season might be fall. These trees form a dense border around the field, enhancing a feeling of seclusion and rustic charm. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the entire scene, which contributes to the tranquil and slightly somber mood of the image. \n\nOverall, the composition suggests a moment of solitary connection with nature, possibly during a routine check of the crops or a reflective walk. The expanse and quietude of the environment seem to be significant elements in the setting, highlighting themes of agriculture, nature, and solitude.","title":"Farm located on private property near Tinker's Creek at Valley View, Ohio, near Cleveland. Fort Ancient was an Indian site along the creek seen at a point where the tall trees in the background are located. A scientist from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History picked up several flint heads on his short trek across the field. The people who farm the land have not disturbed it looking for artifacts. This area is located within the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["552541","547649","548997","554056","544552","544481","545040","549181","555541","543845","544246","552466","548296","557023","553698","558243"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["crop","field","check","green","coloring","walk","quietude","seclusion","agriculture","border"]}
