{"path":"544468.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of destruction in a wooded area. In the foreground, there is a pile of debris consisting primarily of large, broken concrete sections from a structure like a wall or steps. These concrete pieces are stacked unevenly on top of each other, and some are covered in moss, suggesting they have been there for some time. They appear to be remnants of a once-stable structure, now shattered and spread across the ground.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows more debris and damaged structures. Notably, a small building or shed with a black roof is severely damaged; part of its structure is collapsed, tiltling precariously. Several other structures or parts of structures are visible in various states of collapse or disrepair, hinting at a significant destructive event such as a storm or abandonment.\n\nThe background is filled with dense trees, providing a green canopy that partially shades the scene. The light filtering through the trees creates patterns of light and shadow on the debris-filled landscape, enhancing the sense of neglect and decay. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet desolation, a place forgotten or left to the forces of nature. The setting does not have any visible people, suggesting abandonment or a moment captured away from human presence.","title":"Part of widespread damage caused by flooding of Guadalupe River","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["554437","545254","557993","548742","553556","544583","555086","544467","553470","547527","544587","555089","543165","547130","555230","555207"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["debris","abandonment","collapse","structure","destruction","storm","desolation","force","disrepair","moss"]}
