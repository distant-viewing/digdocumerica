{"path":"553172.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of five men leaning on a wooden railing, focused intently on something out of frame. The setting appears to be urban, with dark, high-rise buildings visible in the softly blurred background. The lighting suggests it might be sunny.\n\nThe men show a range of expressions and attentiveness, one of them resting his chin on his hand, looking somewhat contemplative or bored. The others are engaged, gazing forward. Their ages vary; some appear to be in their twenties, while at least one is older, possibly in his forties. The attire is casual and varies distinctly: one wears a cap; others have on jackets and either sweaters or shirts. The style of clothing suggests the photograph might be from a few decades ago, given the designs and the fit of their clothes.\n\nThe atmosphere is that of a casual gathering, perhaps watching a sports event or some activity taking place below them, given their concentration and the way they are lined up along the railing. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on expressions and the candid capture of the moment, provides a snapshot into a day in the lives of these individuals.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: enjoying a performance of the Elder High School band, a Catholic school from the \"Speaker's Landing.\"","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551853","552753","558393","557856","552973","545358","557145","557727","549908","557054","545450","547443","556554","552752","553148","555966"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["railing","twenty","attentiveness","chin","other","vary","fit","expression","sweater","decade"]}
