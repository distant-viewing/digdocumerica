{"path":"543370.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures an ocean beach scene with a dune buggy driving along the shore. The scenery includes a wide, sandy beach adjacent to a turbulent ocean with waves breaking and white foam visible. The sky above the ocean appears clear.\n\nThe dune buggy, which is positioned on the left side of the image, features an open frame with visible mechanical parts, including an engine mounted behind the seating area. It is moving on the compact wet sand near the water, suggesting the surface is firm enough for driving. There is a safety flag mounted on a pole at the rear of the buggy, which is waving in what appears to be a light breeze. Inside the buggy, there are at least two passengers wearing casual clothing and possibly sunglasses, which corresponds with a sunny beach setting.\n\nOn the right, framing the buggy, there is beach vegetation that looks like typical dune grass, projecting an image of a natural and slightly wild beach environment. The overall composition utilizes natural sunlight and portrays a leisure activity that is typical in coastal regions, blending elements of adventure and relaxation within a natural landscape.","title":"Southern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543208","548986","545098","543207","544038","553056","543211","545102","550935","543209","550922","547478","545252","548698","557475","547499"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dune","beach","ocean","seating","breeze","rear","engine","foam","relaxation","adventure"]}
