{"path":"547846.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph reveals a scene of environmental neglect by the water's edge, featuring a dirt and sand pathway beset with multiple discarded tires. The tires are variously sized and are arranged in a curving line leading away from the foreground toward the background. They are spread out over a sandy ground littered with small rocks and debris.\n\nIn the background, along the shoreline, there is noticeable rubble and trash including a severely damaged and abandoned car. The car is overturned, suggesting it has been discarded rather than accidentally arrived in that position. Debris such as pieces of wood, metal, and other unidentifiable objects are scattered around it.\n\nThe far background stretches out to a tranquil water body, likely a lake or slow river, mirroring a clear sky. On the opposite side of the water, faint outlines of a developed land area can be seen, possibly a distant town or cityscape. The stark contrast between the natural beauty of the water and the polluted, cluttered beach forefront underscores the impact of human waste on natural environments.","title":"This land along Jamaica bay is owned by the jfk airport","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547517","546838","546878","547590","551440","549944","555851","557973","551441","546913","546820","547689","543559","551497","548741","550352"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["tire","damaged","arrive","developed","curving","rubble","discard","pollute","water","car"]}
