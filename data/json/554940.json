{"path":"554940.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a man engaged in activities outside what appears to be a small white building with a garage-like opening. The man, wearing a long white coat and a red hat, is in the process of pouring a liquid from a white jug onto a large animal hide laid out on the grass. The environment suggests a rural or semi-agricultural setting, evident from the open field and a glimpse of a tractor in the distant background, under an overcast sky. The man's actions and the setting indicate he might be in the process of cleaning or preserving the hide. The composition of the photo, with its focus on the man and the hide, underscores a moment of activity that is both ordinary and specific to rural life.","title":"Fur skins being salted at a buying shed in Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["548959","554944","554943","548952","554934","552677","554675","554939","546380","547326","554950","543781","553107","552575","547409","552571"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["hide","jug","cleaning","man","pour","process","tractor","preserve","garage","liquid"]}
