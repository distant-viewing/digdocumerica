{"path":"545792.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive view of a rugged and dramatic landscape. The terrain is marked by deep red rocky cliffs and large formations with varied stratification, showcasing multiple layers of geological history. In the center of the image is a striking area with pale, almost white sedimentary formations, contrasting starkly with the surrounding darker red and brown hues. The formations appear eroded, creating sharp peaks and troughs, indicating significant natural weathering processes.\n\nThe sky above the landscape is overcast with a mix of dark and lighter clouds, suggesting an impending or recent storm which adds a moody atmosphere to the scene. This lighting conditions under the somber sky enhance the vividness of the terrain's colors and shadows, adding a dramatic effect to the overall composition.\n\nNo people or man-made structures are discernible in this wide, uninhabited vista. The focus is entirely on the natural geological features and the vast, open wilderness. The photograph gives a sense of solitude and the timeless force of natural elements shaping the earth's surface.","title":"Upheaval Dome, one of the most remarkable geological phenomena in the Canyonlands. It consists of a mile-wide crater containing a dome of multi-layeRed Rock. All the rock formations of the area are exposed here. The origin is thought to have been the thrusting-up of a salt dome from beneath the Earth's surface.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545805","544745","545800","545790","544429","543838","544363","544392","545783","552690","545799","544376","545791","545802","545696","550428"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","trough","stratification","vista","storm","weathering","vividness","history","force","terrain"]}
