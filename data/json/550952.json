{"path":"550952.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial river scene featuring a person on a large metal barge. The barge consists of two prominent angular structures in the foreground, converging inward and framing the water beneath. The surface of the barge shows signs of wear and rust, indicating utilitarian usage and exposure to elements. On the deck, several cylindrical and box-shaped objects are scattered, which could be equipment or storage containers.\n\nThe person, dressed in a long-sleeve green shirt and darker pants, appears to be moving away from the viewpoint, walking towards the right side of the frame along the barge deck. The individual's posture suggests motion, and they are possibly engaged in work or inspection activities on the barge.\n\nThe background behind the barge presents a natural, slightly overgrown bank, leading up to an area with bare trees and shrubs, suggesting it could be either autumn or winter. A hilly terrain rises from the riverbank, with more industrial elements visible at the top, including parts of vehicles, which hint at a nearby road or industrial park. The sky is overcast or hazily sunny, diffusing the natural light and lending a muted tone to the overall colors in the scene.","title":"Barges on the Kanawha River near South Charleston","placename":"Charleston (W.
