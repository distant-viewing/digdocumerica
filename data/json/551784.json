{"path":"551784.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene in a rose garden where a prominent peach-pink rose in the foreground draws the viewer's attention. The rose, sharply focused, stands out against a more softly focused background, creating a striking contrast.\n\nIn the background, a few people are scattered around the garden, engaged in what looks like quiet contemplation or conversation, admiring the roses or possibly engaged in a tour. One individual stands slightly more isolated on the right side of the frame, while a small group of three people can be seen on the left side. They appear to be casually dressed, suggesting a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nFurther in the distance, beyond the garden, is a view of a river, bordered by a fence and complemented by an urban skyline that includes a few indistinguishable buildings, portraying a blend of natural and urban elements. An overcast sky suggests it might be a cool or cloudy day. This entire setting conveys a sense of peaceful coexistence between the natural beauty of the garden and the surrounding urban environment. The composition of the photo, with the sharp rose in the foreground and the blurred background, emphasizes the beauty of the natural environment amidst the urban setting.","title":"Late-blooming roses in the garden of the United Nations Headquarters between East 42nd and East 48th streets on the East River.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551746","551785","551756","551702","551743","551703","556168","551747","551781","549516","552400","552409","552396","551705","551755","547540"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","rose","tour","pink","coexistence","contemplation","beauty","skyline","people","blend"]}
