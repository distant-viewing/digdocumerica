{"path":"553960.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an airplane with a distinctive, vibrant design on its tail fin, which prominently displays a pattern of bright orange and yellow flowers against a red background. The section of the airplane visible is limited to the tail and partial rear fuselage, with the word \"Boeing 737\" visible, indicating the model of the aircraft.\n\nIn the foreground, there is an airport environment where passengers are embarking on the aircraft using a mobile stairway. Several passengers can be seen: one ascending the stairs and another just about to board the plane. There are parked cars and a sign that reads \"PARALLEL PARKING\" visible below the airplane, suggesting that this area might be close to a parking lot. Additionally, there is a glimpse of lush greenery and distant, low-lying structures observable beyond the tarmac, giving a hint of a relatively serene airport setting, possibly in a tropical location given the vegetation and design motif on the plane. \n\nThe sky in the background is a clear blue, indicating fair weather, which complements the brightly colored scene at the airport.","title":"Aloha airlines in one of the two major airlines connecting the islands.
