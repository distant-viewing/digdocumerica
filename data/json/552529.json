{"path":"552529.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph displays an outdoor scene with a collection of soda bottles and crates. On the left, there is a parked red and white bicycle standing on its kickstand on a grassy area. Beside the bicycle, a large open metal cooler is visible, containing various bottles of sodas and drinks. The cooler appears aged, with rust and wear on its structure.\n\nThe central and right parts of the photo show numerous clusters of empty glass soda bottles, meticulously arranged in rows and formations. These bottles include brands such as RC Cola, Pepsi, and Coke. The bottles are placed both directly on the ground and atop stacked crates, which are also used to hold filled soda bottles. A few wooden crates are stacked, serving as makeshift shelves.\n\nThe background features a red brick structure, possibly a building's exterior wall, partially covered with green ivy. It adds a contrasting texture to the scene which is otherwise dominated by manufactured objects.\n\nThe overall atmosphere suggests a location used for storing or selling beverages, possibly in a rural or semi-urban setting given the grassy ground and the casual arrangement of items. The image captures a moment of everyday life, focused on commercial or recycling activities involving popular soft drink brands.","title":"Grocery store in la fayette","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552512","544830","557174","547506","556616","548755","557134","555377","543616","552099","543711","547805","544831","548758","556640","543698"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bottle","soda","crates","cooler","brand","bicycle","drink","stack","arran","crate"]}
