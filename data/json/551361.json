{"path":"551361.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of the glowing flames from a combustion process, possibly from a gas burner or a similar source. The main focus of the image shows three prominent flame tips that are bright and pointed, emitting a warm, yellow-orange light. These flame tips have rounded bases that merge into a less distinct, hotter, and brighter area below them, where the combustion is more intense. The flames appear translucent and ethereal, with the tips cooling into darker, more defined shapes against a very dark, nearly black background. The absence of any additional objects or distractions emphasizes the flamesâ€™ vivid details and the dynamic nature of fire.","title":"Two \"soda straw\" stalactites hang from the ceiling in bridal cave.
