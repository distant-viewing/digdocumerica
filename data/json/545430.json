{"path":"545430.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features a sunset scene with a dramatic sky, captured in a silhouette-style exposure. There's a river or canal in the foreground, reflecting the fading light of the sky, which is tinged in deep orange hues, transitioning into purplish and dusky tones toward the top. The river's surface shows subtle ripples and sparkles with reflections of light, adding a serene quality to the image.\n\nDominating the middle ground and background are silhouetted industrial structures, possibly a power plant or factory, characterized by tall smokestacks and complex framework of buildings and possibly conveyor belts. The structures are outlined sharply against the sky, showcasing structural and architectural details as dark shapes. Overhead lines, likely electrical, cut across the sky, further emphasizing the industrial theme.\n\nOverall, the composition balances natural beauty with industrial elements, creating a visual juxtaposition between the serenity of the water and the implied activity of the plant. The photograph captures an evocative moment, hinting at themes of industrialization and nature, and the interplay of light and shadow enhances the mood of the scene.","title":"U.S. steel plant","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545418","551956","548851","546384","547102","558140","550820","550819","544707","545438","546114","544684","547090","545100","552156","547200"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["silhouette","industrialization","tinge","theme","sparkle","serenity","canal","conveyor","plant","river"]}
