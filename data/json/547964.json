{"path":"547964.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside an industrial setting, possibly a power plant or a machinery workshop. The main focus is on a large, intricate mechanical device, which appears to be a turbine or a large engine, that is in motion, as indicated by the blurred spinning section.\n\nIn the foreground, the device includes several components: a motor with a visible protective mesh cover on the front, possibly an electric motor, connected by a shaft to a larger cylindrical component that is rotating at high speed. The housing of the rotating section has a radial fin design, which is typical for components designed to dissipate heat. Metal railings, perhaps for safety, surround the setup.\n\nThe background hints at a vast, dimly lit space with high ceilings, indicated by large windows allowing natural light to partially illuminate the room. The presence of other heavy machinery or equipment suggests an industrial or manufacturing environment. The subdued lighting and the hints of metal structures and equipment in the shadows give the space an austere and functional feel.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the machinery in motion surrounded by the darkness of the environment, creates a dramatic contrast, emphasizing the industrial activity and energy within the facility.","title":"Inside outmoded sewage treatment facility in the spring creek area of Queens","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["558365","556388","543997","546757","546923","544045","543158","555330","542545","544822","544001","556386","557397","557387","555352","558371"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["component","motor","machinery","device","shaft","motion","fin","section","heat","mesh"]}
