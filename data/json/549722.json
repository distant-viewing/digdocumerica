{"path":"549722.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph depicts two men working together on a mechanical assembly, likely in a manufacturing or automotive workshop setting. The men are focused on assembling or repairing a large metal framework, which seems to be a part of a vehicle's chassis, perhaps the undercarriage. The visible components include a large wheel hub and suspension arms.\n\nThe man on the left is African-American and is wearing a light brown long-sleeve shirt. He has a beard and is wearing safety glasses. He appears to be holding some sort of manual or instructions. The man on the right is Caucasian and is wearing a dark t-shirt, also with safety glasses. He is pointing towards a part of the assembly, perhaps explaining something or directing the procedure.\n\nThe background shows an industrial setting with various tools and machinery. Overhead, there are hanging components and parts, possibly for mechanical use. The lighting is artificial, likely from fluorescents, giving the workshop a stark, functional look. There are shelves and perhaps other workstations in the distant background, suggesting a large, well-equipped facility.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of teamwork and skill in a technical or mechanical environment, emphasizing collaboration and expertise in industrial labor.","title":"On the Cadillac assembly line--attaching axle to frame","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549723","549719","557372","557911","554930","549720","546628","549728","553330","544826","546036","549684","544022","546023","557897","557852"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["assembly","workshop","component","safety","workstation","chassis","collaboration","expertise","procedure","suspension"]}
