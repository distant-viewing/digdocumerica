{"path":"546867.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a ship launching ceremony. In the foreground, a large ship dominates the upper portion of the image, its hull curving dramatically, marked with numbers indicating its draft scale. The focal point of the scene is a group of people standing on a raised platform beneath the bow of the ship. This group, possibly dignitaries or shipyard officials, is surrounded by framed flags, likely representing various nations or perhaps the affiliations of the shipyard or ship's intended service.\n\nOne individual, possibly a woman based on the attire, seems to be engaged in a ceremonial activity, possibly preparing to christen the ship by breaking a champagne bottle against the hull, a traditional act at such events. The others around her appear to be observing or assisting in the ceremony. Below this platform, another person, wearing a hard hat, can be seen adjusting or holding the draped flags, contributing to the celebratory atmosphere.\n\nThe setting suggests a shipyard, indicated by industrial structures and navigational equipment visible around the edges of the scene. The sky above is slightly overcast, casting a diffuse light on the proceedings, which adds to the solemnity and importance of the event. The photograph effectively conveys the anticipation and celebratory nature of a maritime tradition involving the launch of a new vessel.","title":"Marina on Back River","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546766","552149","545728","544657","550897","546012","548125","549590","552303","546008","545147","552148","546040","550910","555799","544234"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","shipyard","ceremony","hull","flag","platform","proceeding","official","affiliation","solemnity"]}
