{"path":"550261.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial accident scene involving multiple vehicles and personnel. In the foreground, there is a large overturned cylindrical tank, labeled as hazardous material with text that includes \"OWX 3342\" and warning labels for flammability. The tank appears to have detached from its chassis, with parts of the chassis and wheels exposed and partially buried in mud.\n\nA red crane, marked “FALCON” on its side, is positioned next to the overturned tank, suggesting an ongoing recovery or cleanup operation. The crane is equipped with stabilizers extended to support its weight as it possibly prepares to lift or move the tank.\n\nBehind the crane, several workers, all wearing hard hats and dark work uniforms, are actively engaged in assessing the situation or managing the incident. They are spread out across the scene, some in groups discussing the situation, and others moving around possibly coordinating the response effort.\n\nA red pickup truck with an open door and a “WIDE LOAD” sign attached to its back is parked on the right side of the image, indicating the presence of oversized transport which might be related to the accident.\n\nThe setting is an industrial area, with remnants of old brick buildings and lush greenery visible in the background beyond a stonework barrier. The ground is muddy, with pooled water and debris, suggesting recent heavy activity or rainfall that has contributed to the chaotic environment.\n\nThis image effectively conveys the urgency and scale of an industrial emergency response involving hazardous materials.","title":"Dow chemical tanks transporting plastic granules derailed and overturned on penn central railroad tracks above scranton road.
