{"path":"549297.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"In this photograph, a man stands in a narrow alleyway between two traditional structures, possibly older residential buildings. The buildings are characterized by their dark wooden sidings, punctuated by windows with white trim. The alley floor is concrete, with patches of natural debris and occasional sprouts of vegetation, possibly suggesting a setting in a historic neighborhood or an older urban area.\n\nThe man appears to be middle-aged or older, wearing a light-colored cap, a dark jacket over a white shirt, brown trousers, and sturdy dark shoes. He carries a paper bag in his right hand, suggesting he may have been shopping or running errands. His posture is gentle, slightly leaning forward, and he appears to be gazing directly at the photographer with a reserved expression.\n\nBehind the man, the alley leads towards a sunlit area where trees are visible, hinting at either a courtyard or a neighboring street lined with greenery, contributing to a sense of depth and escapism from the enclosed urban environment. The ambiance of the scene is both quaint and serene, capturing a moment of everyday life in a setting that mixes elements of nature with traditional architecture.","title":"Roy le blanc tends a garden behind his house on neptune road, the residential section closest to Logan airport.
