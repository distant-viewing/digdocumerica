{"path":"543600.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a natural landscape setting with a foreground of scattered debris and a backdrop of dense conifer forest and towering mountain ridges. The debris consists of various discarded items, including what appears to be parts of machinery or vehicles, sheets of metal, barrels, and other unidentifiable objects, creating a sense of clutter and abandonment in an otherwise serene environment.\n\nThe trees are tall and densely packed, predominantly conifers, indicating this scene might be in a mountainous or temperate region. The trees are dark green, suggesting this image was taken during a time of the year when they are lush and healthy.\n\nIn the background, the mountain ridge rises up, showing a rugged profile against the sky. The mountains are partially covered in trees and exhibit rocky outcroppings, hinting at harsh geological features. The top of the mountains appears to be slightly lighter, possibly indicating a slight dusting of snow or lighter vegetation, adding a contrast to the darker foliage below.\n\nThe lighting in the image is soft, with the sun possibly setting or rising, casting gentle light across the scene which highlights the natural beauty of the area despite the presence of litter. The overall mood is a mix of natural beauty and the unfortunate impact of human activity left behind.","title":"Trash dumped in field.","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["555103","544648","543769","557008","555150","555138","555147","542604","555199","544848","555135","555207","543552","545254","554459","548025"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["mountain","dusting","outcropping","clutter","sheet","conifer","debris","litter","barrel","year"]}
