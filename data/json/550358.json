{"path":"550358.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal area featuring several islands surrounded by a large body of water. The islands are heavily forested with dense green trees and the terrain appears rugged with some undulating hills. Closest to the foreground, there's a small island with a distinctive building, possibly a lighthouse, near its edge along with few other smaller constructions, which suggests some human habitation or use. This building has a red roof, which contrasts with the natural green colors of the surroundings.\n\nThe water around the islands shows various shades of blue and some areas have a slightly rough texture, indicating currents or winds affecting the surface. There are no visible boats or people, which gives the landscape a serene and untouched feel. The overall atmosphere appears quiet and isolated.\n\nFurther in the distance, similar islands continue to dot the seascape, gradually fading into a misty horizon that blends with the sky. The sky itself is overcast with a bland, whitish-grey color, contributing to a sense of tranquility and seclusion in this coastal region. The scene captures a natural, rugged beauty typical of remote maritime environments, emphasizing a sense of peacefulness away from urban settings.","title":"Campobello island with its lighthouse.
