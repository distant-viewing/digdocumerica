{"path":"557398.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image portrays an industrial scene at night with a sense of intense activity and atmosphere. The setting includes large mechanical structures and industrial equipment with lots of vertical and horizontal lines adding complexity to the scene. These elements possibly suggest a factory or a similar industrial facility, characterized by metal frameworks and piping.\n\nThe dominate colors in the photo are dark shades, punctuated by vibrant blue and reddish-orange hues that likely result from the lighting within the scene, emitting a feeling of heat or some intense industrial process taking place. Smoke or steam is seen billowing from the upper part of the structures, illuminated by the lighting to create an eerie glow which contrasts starkly against the darker parts of the image.\n\nThere are no visible people in the photo, focusing entirely on the machinery, the glowing lights, and the gritty details of the industrial process. The low lighting conditions contribute to the overall moody and mysterious atmosphere of the setting.\n\nThe background reveals some blurred structural features of the facility, and in some parts possibly the night sky, enhancing the industrial feel with a sense of isolation and ruggedness. Small glimpses of light fittings and reflections offer some brightness but also add to the somber, nocturnal quality of the photograph.","title":"During some furnace operations \"fugitive smoke\" escapes and is not caught by duct work at the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant.
