{"path":"547341.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a visually striking and dramatic scene focused on a weather vane silhouetted against a vibrant and richly colored sky at sunset. The weather vane, which appears in a crisp, dark silhouette, is complex and ornate, featuring multiple arrows and possibly a figurative design, along with elongated, intricate detailing that suggests a combination of functional and decorative elements.\n\nThe background sky behind the weather vane displays a gradient of deep reds, oranges, and darker tones, suggesting the moment just after the sun has dipped below the horizon. The colors are intense and saturated, creating a warm and glowing atmosphere. The weather vane stands out starkly against this painted-like backdrop, where the shades blend smoothly and the clouds are softly rendered in elongated forms that enhance the sky's dramatic and fiery appearance.\n\nThis composition is evocative and atmospheric, with the weather vane adding a sense of timelessness and human connection to the natural spectacle of the sunset. The image emphasizes contrast and the interplay between man-made artistry and the organic beauty of the natural world.","title":"Farm windmill outlined against setting sun near Seward","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547345","557310","552896","545848","549826","554396","547283","542680","545852","551956","552337","547356","545418","552335","548123","555164"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["weather","sunset","artistry","timelessness","spectacle","arrow","detailing","world","combination","gradient"]}
