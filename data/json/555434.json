{"path":"555434.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a moment at a gasoline station featuring two young men. On the right, one man is prominently displayed holding a fuel pump nozzle with a relaxed but somber expression. He wears a dark blue jacket. Attached to the fuel pump, prominently in the foreground, is a large hand-written sign reading \"SORRY NO GASOLINE,\" suggesting a scenario possibly during a fuel shortage.\n\nThe man on the left appears slightly blurred and is placed partially behind the fuel pump. He sports a dark jacket and blue cap, also looking directly at the camera with a serious expression.\n\nBoth men are standing in front of a gas station, as evident from the fuel pump labeled \"Chevron Supreme\" and a visual glimpse of gas station branding elements and architecture in the background. The background features the gas station's storefront which includes large windows and the entrance. There are hints of overcast or dim lighting, contributing to the somewhat somber and serious tone of the photograph. The pump displays a price of 0.640 presumably per gallon, indicating the time period could be in the past when fuel prices were significantly lower than today. The overall composition conveys a narrative of inconvenience and disruption, possibly during an economic or logistic crisis affecting fuel availability.","title":"Gas station attendants peer over their \"out of gas\" sign in Portland, on day before the state's requested Saturday closure of gasoline stations.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555486","548171","548053","548173","555489","555465","548047","548169","548049","557834","555455","555502","548170","550092","555498","555414"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["fuel","pump","station","gas","price","gallon","nozzle","availability","crisis","shortage"]}
