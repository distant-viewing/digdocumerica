{"path":"552205.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of an industrial waterway area likely involving maritime activities. Visible are dark blue waters with a noticeable spill or discharge showing up as darker and lighter irregular patches floating on the surface. To the left, a dock extends into the water with some riprap (broken stones) along the shoreline. A small boat is moored alongside the dock.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is another structure akin to a pier or loading dock jutting into the water, displaying large, stacked shipping containers in varied colors such as red and blue, indicating the presence of a freight handling or storage area. A crane, likely used for loading and unloading goods, is also visible.\n\nThe overall setting seems industrial, focused on transportation or storage, and the photograph may highlight environmental issues such as water pollution given the visible water discolorations. The surrounding water and structures suggest a significant human impact on this natural body, primarily for industrial and logistical purposes.","title":"PulPage waste water from Georgia Pacific sulphite pulp mill causes discoloration of waters of Bellingham Bay","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["552219","552209","552206","550890","547618","549524","552007","548423","551599","552181","551609","549495","552244","551976","555769","552215"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["dock","load","water","storage","discharge","discoloration","spill","unloading","freight","jut"]}
