{"path":"542688.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is an image highlighting two prominent leaves of a plant, each exhibiting a beautifully mottled pattern of pale green and darker green speckles, suggestive of variegation or a pattern typical of certain types of ornamental vegetation. The edges of the leaves are smooth with gentle undulations, and the leaves themselves are heart-shaped. A thin stem can be seen rising between the two leaves, revealing the early stages of a newly sprouting leaf which is much smaller and also shows the same patterned coloration.\n\nThe background is very soft and out of focus, with dark tonalities that allow the vivid detail and color of the leaves to stand out sharply. The lighting is soft, seemingly natural and diffused, as it gently illuminates the surface textures of the leaves; you can see the intricate network of veins that traverse each leaf. There is no discernable context or additional objects in the immediate vicinity that are visible due to the tight focus on the leaves, placing all attention on the plantâ€™s details. The photograph has an overall organic and tranquil feel.","title":"Smog-damaged plant at the statewide air pollution research center, university of California.
