{"path":"548386.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive view of a dense urban skyline, dominated by numerous high-rise buildings. In the heart of the city, skyscrapers stand prominently with a variety of architectural styles, creating a layered mosaic of modern urban development. The perspective suggests that it is taken from an elevated position, providing a broad overview of the cityscape.\n\nThe skyline includes one particularly notable building, the Empire State Building, which stands out due to its iconic design and height, indicating that this city is likely New York. The atmospheric condition suggests haze or slight smog, lending a soft, almost muted quality to the distant buildings. This condition diffuses the sunlight, softening shadows and details of the individual buildings.\n\nThe colors in the photograph are subdued, with a palette that includes grays, blues, and slight earth tones, capturing the essence of an early morning or late afternoon ambiance. There is no sign of people or moving vehicles visible from this distance, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on the architectural elements and overall urban environment.","title":"Buildings of Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548319","548408","548345","548360","548337","548378","555741","555735","552395","552394","549971","552363","545499","548421","548385","548417"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["skyline","smog","mosaic","heart","overview","city","building","soften","condition","elevated"]}
