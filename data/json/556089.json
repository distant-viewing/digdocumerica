{"path":"556089.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a train station where a few people are interacting near the side of a passenger train. \n\nThe image features three individuals prominently. A young man in the foreground, likely a traveler, is dressed in casual summer attire consisting of a t-shirt, denim shorts, and hiking boots, with a large blue backpack and a rolled-up mat attached to it. He appears to be engaged in conversation or perhaps seeking directions or assistance, as he is looking downwards toward something held by the young woman next to him.\n\nThe young woman, possibly accompanying the traveler, is leaning towards him slightly and holding a red object that might be a wallet, showing something from it to the young man. Her outfit includes a simple red top and she has shoulder-length hair.\n\nEngaging with them, there is a man dressed in a formal red conductor's jacket adorned with black stripes and a matching cap, suggesting he is a train worker, perhaps a conductor. He is holding papers or tickets, which he seems to be checking or presenting to the travelers.\n\nThe background of the photograph includes another part of the train station with more passengers in the distance. The setting has a clear sky, indicating good weather, and it's daylight contributing to a bustling, yet orderly atmosphere typical of a train station. The architecture visible in the background is simple and functional, likely part of the train station's infrastructure, including a distant pedestrian bridge.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a moment of interaction between travelers and train staff, capturing the dynamics and environment of traveling via train.","title":"Passenger car attendant answers questions for passengers of the Empire Builder at a stop at LaCrosse, Wisconsin, as the train is enroute from Chicago to East Glacier Park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington.
