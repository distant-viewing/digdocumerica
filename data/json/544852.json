{"path":"544852.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and rugged mountain landscape under a clear blue sky. At the forefront, a prominent tree stump anchors the composition, drawing the viewer's eye to the details of its exposed wood surface, where it appears freshly cut, suggesting recent timber activity.\n\nThe immediate surrounding area is dense with lush green vegetation, including various small plants and grass, interspersed with wildflowers. Scattered fallen logs and standing dead trees, presumably the result of natural forest decay or logging, add to the wild, untamed feel of the scene.\n\nThe middle ground transitions to a thick tree line composed of tall conifers, providing a deep green contrast to the lighter green of the foreground. This layer serves as a transitional space, leading the eye towards the spectacular mountain range in the background.\n\nThe mountains themselves dominate the background with their steep, jagged peaks covered sporadically in snow. Their rugged texture and dark rocky faces stand sharply against the sky, emphasizing the wilderness aspect of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph is a striking portrayal of mountainous terrain, showcasing the natural beauty and ongoing ecological dynamics of a forested landscape transitioning into alpine heights.","title":"Logging scars","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["554531","555657","544848","543582","542842","555105","552143","550516","555660","544936","552144","555656","555662","542830","542604","550439"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","transition","eye","stump","conifer","dynamic","anchor","timber","portrayal","logging"]}
