{"path":"547642.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of several small, delicate white flowers with yellow centers, possibly a type of wildflower, sprouting amidst a natural setting. The flowers are featured prominently in the foreground, each bloom supported by thin, slender stems that tilt at various angles, giving a natural, unstructured appearance.\n\nThe plants grow from a patch of dark, rich soil that also contains some fallen debris, such as small twigs and bits of organic material, indicating a forested or natural wild area. The background is softly out of focus, predominantly dark with some hints of brown and black, which helps in highlighting the whiteness and the delicate details of the flowers.\n\nThe lighting in the image casts gentle shadows and creates an interplay of light and dark, which adds depth and a serene mood to the scene. This might suggest that the photo was taken during a bright day when light filtered through a canopy above. The overall composition focuses on the beauty and delicate nature of the flowers in their natural environment.","title":"\"Bluets\"","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["549230","544875","544876","554574","543596","555106","554576","553074","553368","554745","545695","555186","550781","545291","557167","545726"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","twig","bloom","wildflower","bit","canopy","interplay","angle","soil","type"]}
