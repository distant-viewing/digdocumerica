{"path":"551180.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of an industrial facility along a body of water, likely a river. The river has a dam equipped with several spillways that are releasing water, causing white, frothy waves below. \n\nThe main structure pictured in the center is a large industrial building connected to several cylindrical tanks and smaller buildings, which appear to be part of a complex operational setup. There are multiple walkways and piping networks visible between these components. The facility seems heavily mechanical, indicating its possible function in manufacturing, energy production, or waste management.\n\nOn the water, floating barriers or booms are positioned close to the construction, probably to contain or control the water flow or to prevent debris from entering specific areas. The color palette of the scene includes shades of gray, blue, and rusty brown, typical for industrial equipment and structures. Overall, the scene encapsulates a moment of everyday functionality within an industrial context by a river.","title":"Effluent pours from the south Charleston union carbide plant into the kanawha river.
