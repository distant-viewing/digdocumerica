{"path":"553948.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph centers upon a vibrant red hibiscus flower, presented in a close-up view. The flower is fully bloomed, emphasizing its wide, delicate petals and the prominent yellow stamens in the middle, which are covered in small pollen particles. The image is captured with a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the flower's center and letting the petals softly blur towards the edges. Surrounding the hibiscus is a soft bokeh effect, creating a dreamy, out-of-focus background that enhances the vividness of the flower's red color. This background appears to be comprised of darker shades, possibly greenery, which provides a contrasting backdrop that highlights the flower's bright hue. The lighting in the photograph is subtly dramatic, illuminating parts of the flower while keeping other areas in gentle shadow, contributing to an overall mood of natural elegance.","title":"Hibiscus flowers thrive on all the islands","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["554116","553949","554117","554840","543623","557586","547815","544891","550464","543597","555055","545699","557545","554843","554574","555035"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","stamen","let","elegance","particle","vividness","comprise","bloom","keep"]}
