{"path":"545820.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image presents a compelling and somewhat eerie desert landscape scene. In the foreground, a large animal skull, likely that of a bovine or similar large mammal, dominates the composition with its empty eye sockets directed towards the viewer; nearby lie the bleached bones of what appears to be an articulated vertebral column, possibly from the same animal.\n\nThe scene contains scattered vegetation typical of arid environmentsâ€”sparse, dry grass and small bushes that are dwarfed by the surrounding geography. The soil is a reddish-brown color, indicative of iron-rich minerals, common in desert soils, and the ground is littered with smaller rocks.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is an abandoned car, half-buried and tilted in the sand, giving a sense of desolation and abandonment. The car appears to be an older model, coated in dust and showing signs of exposure to the elements. Behind the car stretch more desert and sandy terrain, leading up to dramatically rolling hills that are characterized by their smooth, rounded surfaces and warm, red color. These hills under a clear blue sky occupy the background, emphasizing the isolation and harsh environment depicted in the photograph.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of the passage of time and the harshness of nature, underscored by the presence of the skeletal remains and the derelict car, all under the expansive desert sky.","title":"Bony remains of dead cattle outside the Moab city dump.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["552998","553009","553010","553007","545808","544019","552420","547535","544401","544060","545575","545304","545739","555883","544027","543354"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["desert","car","animal","soil","geography","harshness","remain","iron","hill","mineral"]}
