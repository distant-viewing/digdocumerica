{"path":"546852.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph portrays two individuals on a small boat painting the hull of a large ship, on which the word \"SILVA\" is visible in bold, black lettering. The ship’s hull is primarily white but shows some signs of rust and wear, particularly near the waterline. The two individuals, both appearing to be men, are actively engaged in painting the hull. One man, wearing a horizontally striped shirt and trousers, is using a long-handled roller to apply white paint. The other, in a dark shirt and trousers, is assisting, either by stabilizing the boat or preparing additional paint.\n\nThe small boat they are standing on appears to be a basic, flat vessel, possibly a pontoon or a raft, as it is quite close to the water’s surface and seems simply constructed. The water around the boat is calm and appears dark, reflecting some of the sunlight. The overall scene captures the ongoing maintenance work required to keep the ship’s exterior in good condition, demonstrating a snapshot of regular maritime upkeep in a vivid and detailed manner.","title":"The \"Silva\" gets a coat of paint while tied up at Port Covington terminal.
