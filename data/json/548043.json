{"path":"548043.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a large industrial setting. The prominent features in the image are two large cooling towers, one of which is partially visible on the left side, and the other dominates the central portion of the image with its immense, curved structure. The towers, typical of nuclear plants, exhibit a light color possibly due to concrete construction, and feature vertical ribbing that adds texture to their surface.\n\nIn front of the larger tower, a construction crane can be seen, indicating ongoing work or maintenance. Its long, horizontal arm and vertical structure contrast with the smooth, curved lines of the cooling towers.\n\nThe foreground of the image is filled with lush greenery, suggesting that the plant is located in a heavily wooded area. Various shades of green from trees and shrubs indicate a vibrant, natural environment that surrounds the industrial structures.\n\nThe top of the image shows a glimpse of a clear sky, reinforcing a serene backdrop contrasting the industrial activity. The photograph has a vintage feel, given the color saturation and the border of the slide, hinting at a setting several decades ago. It captures a blend of technology and nature, highlighting the human effort to harness energy while embedded in a natural landscape.\n","title":"The trojan nuclear plant on the banks of the Columbia River is under construction by Portland general electric environmentalists strongly oppose the project","placename":"Rainier (Or.)","location":"Rainier, Oregon","nn1":["548039","553885","551184","551175","548211","545131","551155","545127","545171","548208","548035","553829","544966","551928","542705","545841"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["towers","curve","cooling","harness","slide","embed","construction","shrubs","saturation","plant"]}
