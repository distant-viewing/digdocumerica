{"path":"545849.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This image captures a serene and somewhat nostalgic scene at a sandy beach location, possibly at dusk given the soft, warm lighting. In the foreground, focus is drawn to an elaborately constructed sand castle, surrounded by a few scattered items: plastic cups and a glinting can suggesting recent human activity. There's an impression of neglect or abandonment due to left-behind items and the lone castle in the sandy terrain.\n\nThe midground features a classic Chevrolet car, prominent and in strong visual condition, parked on the compacted sand of the beach. The car, likely from the 60s or 70s given its design, pointedly contrasts with the natural environment, emphasizing human presence and perhaps recreation or leisure activities typical at the location.\n\nIn the background, the peaceful sea horizon stretches across the image, intersected by silhouettes of distant people and vehicles, suggesting other beach-goers present, likely enjoying a quiet beach outing. The scene is framed by a vast, empty sky, underscoring a sense of solitude or the end-of-day calm.\n\nThe overall composition and elements in this photograph — from the recreational artifacts, classic car, distant human figures, and expansive natural setting — collectively evoke a sense of timelessness and the commonplace human interactions with nature during leisure times.","title":"Litter and sandcastle on West Beach","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["548698","548752","546417","547499","545237","547869","547035","545252","550922","547478","546412","543493","547495","542918","550934","552995"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","60","goer","car","leisure","timelessness","artifact","70","compact"]}
