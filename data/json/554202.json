{"path":"554202.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive agricultural field that appears to have been recently plowed, showing rich, dark soil turned over in large clumps and furrows. Scattered throughout the newly turned soil are remnants of previous vegetation, which include bits of green and dried plants clearly visible against the dark earth.\n\nTowards the background, positioned almost in the center of the image, there is a tractor. The tractor is attached to what looks like a plowing implement, possibly a disc harrow, indicating that the field is in the process of being worked upon. The tractor and its attachment are small compared to the vastness of the field, emphasizing the scale of the agricultural operation.\n\nThe landscape beyond the field includes a hint of more fields and patches of greenery, possibly small patches of grass or shrubs, and a clear sky without visible clouds which suggests a favorable weather for farming activities. The horizon is flat, punctuated only slightly by low-lying vegetation, giving a sense of the open, rural environment typical of farmland regions. This setting provides a clear depiction of modern agricultural practices in expansive arable lands.","title":"Farmer near grygla ploughs up an unproductive hayfield for reseeding","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["548820","547297","554046","548903","548902","548898","554204","555879","545893","547436","548907","548997","548950","544552","554056","548991"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["tractor","field","implement","plowing","furrow","attachment","soil","clump","lands","plow"]}
