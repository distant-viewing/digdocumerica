{"path":"546921.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph appears to be taken inside the bridge of a ship. It features two men, each focusing intently on their tasks. The man on the left, who has a mustache, is looking through what seems to be a pair of binoculars, perhaps scanning the water or the horizon. He's dressed in a light grey uniform shirt. The second man, on the right, appears to be steering the vessel, his hand gripping what looks like the ship's wheel. His focus is directed ahead as he operates the ship, and he also wears a similar uniform shirt.\n\nThe control panels in front of them include various instruments and dials, indicating different statuses likely important for navigation and operation. The environment suggests an active duty scene, with the focus of the two men centered on ensuring the safe passage of their ship. In the background, through one of the bridge's windows, a blurred cityscape can be seen in the distance, indicating that the ship is near a populated area. The overall mood is one of concentration and responsibility.","title":"Crew aboard a Coast Guard vessel on daily inspection of harbor ships and activities","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["555826","553793","555828","549372","549603","546324","549602","549617","549385","555799","548769","546758","557242","549596","544242","542671"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["ship","responsibility","bridge","binocular","status","man","dial","mustache","navigation","instrument"]}
