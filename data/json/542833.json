{"path":"542833.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view, typically resembling a forested area with significant signs of deforestation or logging activities. The upper two-thirds of the image shows densely packed, dark green forest comprising mainly conical trees, probably a coniferous forest. This dense forest is divided by a thin dirt road that weaves through the trees, creating a clear path that cuts from one side of the image to the other, entering from the top middle and exiting through the bottom-right part of the forested area.\n\nThe bottom third of the photograph starkly contrasts with the majority of the scene due to a large area of cleared land. This clearing is filled with scattered debris, fallen trees, and stumps, indicating recent logging activities. Several patches in this cleared area appear lighter, suggesting bare soil or areas where the topsoil has been disrupted. A dirt road curves through this deforested area, connecting to the road that traverses the forested area.\n\nThere is a small, visible body of water or wet area reflecting light, located near the cleared section, contributing to the variety of textures and elements in the scene. The overall composition highlights the environmental impact of logging, with the cleared section sharply juxtaposed against the untouched dense forest, thereby visually representing a significant alteration to the natural landscape.","title":"'Clear cutting'","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542832","545143","542834","555085","542835","556922","542827","557001","542823","555145","545289","542826","542820","555198","542840","555221"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["forest","third","road","deforestation","dirt","area","section","alteration","stump","majority"]}
