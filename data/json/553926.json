{"path":"553926.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a densely packed hillside community with numerous houses tightly clustered together, ascending up a steep slope. Each house appears similar in style, primarily constructed with materials that have dark roofs and light-colored walls, possibly wooden. The houses are closely aligned both horizontally and vertically, giving a layered appearance to the settlement.\n\nIn the background, the silhouette of a rugged mountain range can be seen, providing a contrast in texture and color to the orderly and monotonous housing pattern. The sky is barely visible at the top, and it appears to be clear, enhancing the stark outline of the mountain peaks against it. The lighting in the image brings out the details in the housesâ€™ architecture and the natural terrain, suggesting that the photo was taken during a time of day when shadows and highlights define the shapes and elevation of the landscape. This setting appears remote and possibly difficult to access, given the steep incline and the compact nature of the residential layout.","title":"Hawaii-Kai, built on a swamp and a hillside, is a fast-growing area east of downtown Honolulu. Scarcity of land and skyrocketing costs are favoring construction of town houses and high-rise apartments over the once dominant single-family units.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553927","553920","556423","546765","557526","557527","544816","557404","553941","553929","553940","546756","556333","556580","556438","552603"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["house","incline","mountain","settlement","housing","highlight","elevation","hillside","outline","layout"]}
