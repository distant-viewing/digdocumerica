{"path":"552534.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a somewhat desolate urban scene, characterized by a combination of architectural and industrial elements. On the right side of the image, there is a two-story building with a white, weathered facade. The buildingâ€™s architectural details, such as the cornices and trim, suggest it might once have been a more grand structure, but now appears to be in a state of neglect. The windows on the upper floor are boarded up, and the ground floor has a central entrance with a \"FOR RENT\" sign prominently displayed. The doorway is flanked by two large glass windows, also boarded.\n\nDirectly beside the building, echoing its sense of abandonment, is a cracked and weedy sidewalk leading to a railroad crossing. A railroad signal with lowered gates adds a dynamic element to the scene, suggesting the proximity of an active rail line, despite the surrounding decay.\n\nIn the background, prominently positioned and towering over the small building, is a large red water tower with the word \"KEWANEE\" in white letters around its circumference. This towers adds a strong industrial flavor to the scene and acts as a focal point against the blue sky.\n\nThe overall composition evokes a sense of faded industrial glory and urban decline, with strong vertical elements (like the water tower and the building's facade) drawing the eye upwards and contrasting with the horizontal lines of the railroad and the street.","title":"Near the kewanee railroad station","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["543258","553557","550204","544656","549555","556351","550108","547969","552533","554565","547894","550285","555952","555902","545978","551586"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["railroad","tower","facade","floor","boarde","cornice","echo","crossing","decline","gate"]}
