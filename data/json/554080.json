{"path":"554080.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a whimsically designed sign attached to a tree. The rectangular sign is painted in a faded red color with white, somewhat weather-worn letters spelling out \"CAUTION BABY PIGS CROSSING.\" Additionally, there are three white cutouts of baby pigs, each adorned with simplistic facial features like eyes, affixed to the tree, below and slightly overlapping the sign. The background is a blurred natural setting, suggestive of a wooded area with patches of sunlight filtering through the leaves, creating a serene and slightly dappled lighting effect. The focus on the sign and pig cutouts foreground against a softly unfocused natural backdrop contributes to a charming and rustic aesthetic.","title":"Sign south of hana","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["544492","547123","556605","544262","556608","553585","545621","554103","544239","557938","548846","550699","548063","548836","546954","548845"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","spell","caution","affix","baby","overlap","letter","filter","aesthetic","attach"]}
