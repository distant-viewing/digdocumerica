{"path":"554639.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a panoramic view of a densely wooded mountain landscape during what appears to be the autumn season. The slopes are largely covered in trees that show a vibrant mix of green and golden yellow foliage, suggesting a change in season. Notably, several areas of exposed rock disrupt the forest cover, revealing large, light-colored cliff faces that contrast starkly with the dark green and yellow hues of the trees.\n\nThe composition gives a sense of depth and vastness, with the mountain rising steeply from the foreground to the background. The sky, visible at the top of the photo, is clear and light blue, enhancing the calm and serene atmosphere of the scene. This setting might typically be found in a mountainous region known for its rugged terrain and deciduous forests, which change color beautifully in the autumn.","title":"Balsam firs and yellow paper birch grow against rock slides with hardwood forest below on the south side of","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["554640","554642","554653","554638","550478","550603","554641","550602","557127","554636","548025","554761","554715","542843","546090","554530"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["change","season","disrupt","mountain","know","rugged","forests","cover","find","autumn"]}
