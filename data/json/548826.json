{"path":"548826.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a silhouette scene set against a shimmering backdrop that appears to be a water body reflecting light. The picture portrays several human figures engaged in various actions along a horizontal landscape.\n\nFrom left to right, the first person is standing next to a bicycle, possibly resting or holding onto it for support. The second person is shown bending forward as if picking something up or working on the ground. Near the middle of the composition, the third figure is poised in a throwing action, resembling someone about to throw a frisbee or a ball. Next to this figure, the fourth person is also bending, likely involved in a similar activity as the second person. Further right, another individual stands upright in a relaxed or waiting posture.\n\nIn the background, a serene expanse of water stretches across the horizon under a dusky or early dawn sky, enhancing the tranquility and sparse nature of the scene. The image evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence and casual activity, likely during a time of leisure or a casual gathering by a water body. The silhouettes against the bright background create a striking contrast and emphasize the outlines and motions of the figures.","title":"Little league baseball along Havasu Lake in Lake Havasu City","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["547217","543893","550303","548988","552226","543397","550237","550240","553226","550236","543143","550296","554477","547550","543950","549716"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["figure","person","bend","action","silhouette","ball","poise","throw","pick","bicycle"]}
