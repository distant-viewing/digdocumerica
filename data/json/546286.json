{"path":"546286.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an individual, likely a man, through a screen of vibrant houseplants with vivid green and pinkish hues. He is wearing glasses and a striped shirt. The setting seems to be indoors, likely on a porch or in a sunroom, focusing on a hobby or task involving the plants. The person is engaged in an activity, possibly watering or pruning the plants.\n\nThe composition of the image places the plants in the foreground, partially framing the person behind them, creating a feeling of depth and intimacy. The plants dominate the image, conveying a lush, serene atmosphere. The soft focus and the lighting, which casts a warm tint across the scene, contribute to a relaxed and contemplative mood. The background hints at a domestic environment with light-colored, indistinct architectural elements that suggest a cozy, enclosed space.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Terry Hollister, fishery biologist, studies a manfrone plant for the effects of different grades of herbicides.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555300","544236","557681","544240","544295","555298","555372","557322","553216","551490","554797","551489","542691","555304","551773","551705"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["plant","hobby","indoor","screen","intimacy","tint","person","porch","feeling","task"]}
