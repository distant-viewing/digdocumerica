{"path":"542954.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a somber scene on a bridge. At the forefront, prominently positioned on the road, is the body of a deceased dog, lying in a natural, yet lifeless posture. The road itself shows signs of wear with faded markings and patches. The setting is overcast, lending a dreary ambiance to the environment.\n\nThe bridge, which the road runs across, features a metal railing alongside the roadway, contributing to the infrastructure's aged and utilitarian appearance. In the background, the scene extends to a misty, forested coastline. The visibility is limited due to fog, which adds a further melancholy feel to the photograph. Additionally, a few vehicles are visible towards the horizon of the bridge, heading toward the fog-covered area, and a line of utility poles runs parallel to the road, fading into the mist.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its central, tragic figure set against a backdrop of faded industrial elements and enveloping fog, evokes a poignant mood and possibly serves as a commentary on themes such as neglect or loss within a vast indifferent landscape. The image might provoke thought regarding the intersections of human infrastructure and nature, and the often unseen or overlooked casualties that result from this interplay.","title":"Dog lies dead on major trucking road, route 101","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["544210","542541","557015","552992","551122","552699","548305","543786","557995","551964","547737","547597","547771","552072","546241","545816"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["fog","bridge","road","loss","think","regard","provoke","run","infrastructure","commentary"]}
