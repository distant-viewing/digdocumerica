{"path":"547899.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts two large piles of waste occupying the foreground, likely located at a landfill or dumpsite. The heaps are composed of various types of debris, including unidentifiable scraps, fragments, and what appear to be bits of metal and other discarded materials. The piles dominate the view, creating a striking contrast against the cityscape visible in the distance.\n\nIn the background, a skyline of high-rise buildings can be seen under a cloudy sky, suggesting an urban setting not far from the waste piles. This juxtaposition highlights a stark contrast between the developed urban area and the environmental impact represented by the large mounds of waste.\n\nTo the left side of the image, part of a structure is visible, possibly a part of the facility associated with the waste site. This could be a building or heavy machinery, typically used in the management and processing of waste materials.\n\nThe overall composition and lighting evoke a somber and contemplative mood, drawing attention to environmental concerns and the relationship between urban development and waste management. The cloud-covered sky contributes to the subdued ambiance of the scene.","title":"Barge loaded with ashes from the gravesend bay incineration plant.
