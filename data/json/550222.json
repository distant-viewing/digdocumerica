{"path":"550222.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a rustic, outdoors scene centered around a body of water, which appears to be a river or a stream flowing over a dam. The dam is partially obstructed by a large accumulation of driftwood and debris. This mound of natural detritus is amassed to such an extent that it covers part of the waterway, hindering the water flow and creating small, frothy waterfalls as the river tries to navigate through and over the wooden barrier.\n\nThe water is a murky brown color, likely due to sediment and the disruption caused by the driftwood barrier. Closer to the foreground, there are additional pieces of large, water-logged timber floating loosely. The riverbanks are thickly lined with lush green trees, indicating a vibrant, natural setting that is possibly remote or minimally developed.\n\nOn the far right of the image, there is a figure standing on what looks like a small patch of land or a protruding part of the shore. This person, though small and distant in the frame, is wearing a bright-colored outfitâ€”visible as a small spot of contrast against the natural hues of the scene.\n\nThe overall impression is one of natural ruggedness, possibly highlighting environmental or ecological issues like waterway management or the impact of natural debris on river flow. The combination of the water's power and the tranquility of the wooded setting creates a dynamic and somewhat serene landscape.","title":"Debris chokes the polluted Rocky River.","placename":"Columbia (Ohio)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550655","544795","550647","553349","542537","553420","558006","550950","553136","550698","553392","552046","545650","553419","550658","549639"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["driftwood","dam","barrier","waterway","flow","river","detritus","extent","water","disruption"]}
