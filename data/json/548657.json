{"path":"548657.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph displays a detailed view of the upper section of a traditional building, possibly a porch or veranda. The architecture prominently features ornate wooden railings with a dense pattern of balusters that contribute to a sophisticated and decorative appearance. Additionally, there are stout, turned columns supporting the structure, which suggests a design choice typical of Victorian or colonial-era architecture.\n\nThe roof is covered with blue-gray shingles, and the overall color scheme of the structure includes white and blue-gray, providing a classic and crisp visual effect. Intriguingly, the composition is partially obscured by the silhouette of palm leaves in the foreground, casting dramatic shadows and adding a layer of natural texture to the image. This element introduces a tropical or subtropical context, suggesting the building might be located in a warm climate area.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is bright and suggests it was taken under clear, sunlit conditions, enhancing the contrast between the architectural elements and the shadows of the palm leaves. The angle of the shot slightly looks up towards the sky, emphasizing the height and grandeur of the architecture against a backdrop of a clear blue sky.","title":"Detail of one of the historic houses of Key West.
