{"path":"551251.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This creative photograph captures the reflection of a man driving his car, as seen through the rear-view mirror. The driver, who appears to be a middle-aged man wearing sunglasses and a fedora-style light-colored hat, is holding a cigarette with one hand while steering the wheel with the other. He wears a light-colored, short-sleeve shirt, suggesting a casual or warm-weather setting.\n\nThe mirror’s metal frame is prominently featured, and outside the mirror, we see the interior details of the car which adds a retro or vintage flair to the image. The dashboard has a textured metal finish and includes at least one circular gauge that seems to be a clock, and control knobs – indicative of an older model car.\n\nIn the far background, visible through other parts of the car window, is a wide-open landscape that suggests he could be driving on a highway. This scene mixes elements of movement, personal style, automotive design, and a hint of the roadside environment, creating a visually dynamic and historically evocative composition.","title":"Dan Needham, Missouri Water Patrol supervisor for the Lake of the Ozarks region, at the wheel of his outboard cruiser. About 8 officers, performing a wide range of regulatory and emergency services, patrol the 64,000 acres of water in the Gravois, GRand Glaize and Niangua arms and in the main channel from Bagnell Dam to Warsaw. Although no overtime benefits accrue these men sometimes work around the clock during peak vacation periods.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["557876","557869","557866","551252","557370","552780","557888","557917","557847","546652","548272","549854","556803","556547","546176","545335"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["mirror","car","flair","knob","fedora","dashboard","gauge","retro","finish","clock"]}
