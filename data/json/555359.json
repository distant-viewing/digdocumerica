{"path":"555359.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor agricultural setting, specifically a greenhouse environment. The image captures a narrow, gravel pathway flanked on both sides by lush, dense vegetation. The plants appear to be climbing or vining types, possibly cucumbers or similar vegetables, supported by a vertical trellising system made of wire or metal rods.\n\nThe foliage is large and dark green, indicating healthy growth. The leaves have a broad and slightly textured surface which suggests they are mature. Several stems and tendrils stretch out and wind around the support structure, illustrating the plant's natural climbing tendency.\n\nAt the beginning of the path, close to the foreground, some farming or gardening tools—a pair of pruning shears or clippers—can be seen lying on the ground, suggesting recent or ongoing maintenance work. The shears are partially open, placed directly on the light-colored gravel, visible against the darker, moist earth beneath them.\n\nThe natural light, possibly filtering through a translucent roof or directly through gaps in the coverage, creates patterns on the ground and emphasizes the verdant green of the leaves. The overall atmosphere is one conducive to growth and cultivation, evocative of a productive and well-maintained agricultural space.","title":"View inside one of the solar greenhouses at the university of Arizona environmental research laboratory at Tucson.
