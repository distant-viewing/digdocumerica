{"path":"549060.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a nocturnal waterscape, showcasing a calm and expansive body of water under a night sky. The horizon is speckled with clusters of small bright lights, indicating a distant town or cityscape stretched across the background. The sky transitions from a deep blue at the top to a warmer purple hue near the horizon.\n\nThe reflections of the lights shimmer on the waterâ€™s surface, creating elongated streaks of white and yellow light. The overall atmosphere is serene and dark, with just enough light to outline the silhouettes of landforms in the far distance. No people or moving objects are visible, contributing to the stillness of the scene. The composition centers on the interplay between the natural elements of water and sky and the human-made lights that softly illuminate the scene.","title":"Light reflections from homes on the Colorado River","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["551223","544725","549099","546392","547245","557497","552263","545913","552237","552155","543119","550777","552225","554397","545145","543577"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["waterscape","light","landform","streak","night","horizon","stillness","transition","cityscape","town"]}
