{"path":"552561.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of an elderly man wearing a cowboy hat. He is looking directly into the camera with a stern and seasoned expression. His face shows signs of aging, with deep lines and sun-kissed skin which suggests long hours outdoors. He wears a light-colored cowboy hat and a red plaid shirt, which are typical of Western attire.\n\nThe background is mostly obscured, but it appears that he might be inside a vehicle or a structure with a window, as there is a hint of a bright light source, possibly sunlight, coming from behind him. The lighting accentuates the contours of his face and hat, highlighting his rugged features.\n\nThe composition of the photo frames the subject's face and upper torso centrally, capturing a detailed and personal depiction of his character, hinting at a life possibly filled with outdoor activity and rugged experiences. The man's gaze and the close framing attract the viewer's attention directly to his expression and attire, portraying a strong sense of identity associated with a Western lifestyle.","title":"Rueben Oldland is a third generation rancher on Piceance Creek.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["553091","549199","547679","549120","549122","551300","547179","544349","554857","542613","546068","548226","547344","548236","554858","549042"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["face","hat","torso","identity","cowboy","lifestyle","expression","aging","close","skin"]}
