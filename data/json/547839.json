{"path":"547839.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a submerged and abandoned car in a large body of water, possibly a lake or a river. The car, which appears to be an older model, is nearly halfway underwater, with the top half of the vehicle and part of its hood visible above the water surface. The body of the car shows significant damage and wear: windows are missing, and the paint appears to be severely weathered, suggesting it has been in the water for a considerable time.\n\nIn the background, a distant shoreline can be seen under a clear blue sky. The shoreline is characterized by what appears to be a mix of vegetation and possibly some man-made structures, though these are quite small and not distinct. The water itself is calm with little to no waves, indicating a serene, quiet setting. The overall mood of the photograph is somber and abandoned, highlighting environmental and possibly human neglect.","title":"Abandoned car in Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547835","546315","547911","547481","547605","547132","547484","546318","547601","555850","546173","552439","547597","555849","549107","547963"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["shoreline","car","hood","half","damage","water","paint","neglect","model","body"]}
