{"path":"556014.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an old-fashioned office or workspace, filled with various objects and equipment indicative of past technologies. On the left side of the image, there is a desk near a window, above which hang two pendant lights. On the desk, thereâ€™s an older model typewriter, a telephone, and scattered papers, suggesting a work environment. An empty wooden chair with a studded leather cushion is placed in front of the desk.\n\nTo the right, the room is cluttered with shelves and storage units filled with books, boxes, folders, and miscellaneous items. There is also a large table in the center that holds more papers, documents, and a couple of measurement tools. The shelves on the right also contain some electronic equipment, possibly audio or testing devices, given the appearance of dials and speaker-like components.\n\nThe overall setting appears busy and slightly disorganized, reflecting a workspace that might belong to a researcher, scientist, or engineer, based on the scattered technical and electronic items. The room has a utilitarian feel, with its simple wall color and practical furniture. The large window provides natural light, softening the otherwise busy and crowded interior.","title":"Train depot at Strong City, Kansas, hasn't been used by passengers in more than five years, but is maintained in immaculate condition.
