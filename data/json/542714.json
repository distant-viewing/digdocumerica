{"path":"542714.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of what appears to be a large agricultural area, specifically an orchard. The orchard is meticulously organized with rows of trees planted in a grid pattern, which creates a visually striking and repetitive geometric arrangement. The trees are evenly spaced and identical in size, indicating a well-managed commercial farm.\n\nAlso visible in the image are several long, narrow ponds or canals that are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the rows of trees, suggesting an irrigation system to support the trees. These water bodies reflect light and contrast starkly with the darker land areas.\n\nThe photograph is captured from a high altitude and encompasses a wide expanse of the orchard, extending to the horizon where more tree plots can be glimpsed. The orderly arrangement and the scale of farming indicate a potentially substantial operation most likely focused on fruit production.\n\nThe background and less central areas of the image blur into the distance, enhancing the sense of vastness and continuity of the agricultural practice. The colors in the image are natural, dominated by the green of the trees and the earthen tones of the pathways and surrounding land. The presence of water adds a hint of blue, breaking the green and brown hues with a reflective surface.","title":"Canal irrigates citrus ranches","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["554053","542710","542708","548907","554029","542729","549094","548908","553977","549098","552858","548817","554055","548901","542713","557517"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["arrangement","tree","continuity","fruit","row","irrigation","land","plot","canal","blur"]}
