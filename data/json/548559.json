{"path":"548559.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an industrial or construction site with a large crane and various concrete structures. The foreground shows a body of water, possibly a river or lake, lined with greenery, likely small bushes or trees. In the midground, several large, cube-like concrete structures stand elevated on what appear to be thick, cylindrical supports, distributed across a dirt terrain scattered with debris or construction materials. These structures are possibly segments of a building under construction or elements of an industrial complex.\n\nA tall crane dominates the right side of the image, its boom extending diagonally across the scene. Attached to the crane is a hoisting cable with a hook at its end, dangling above the ground. There appears to be some activity or presence of workers, as evidenced by small, indistinct figures near the crane and structures. The background shows more of the construction or industrial complex with additional structures, possible machinery and construction-related elements, and the hint of a clear blue sky above, suggesting an open, outdoor setting. The lighting and shadow in the image suggest the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day.","title":"Condominium under construction at the Century Village retirement community.
