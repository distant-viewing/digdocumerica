{"path":"549536.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a tourist attraction, possibly Niagara Falls given the presence of large waterfalls and the iconic observation tower in the background. The image shows groups of people engaged in various activities; some are walking along paved pathways, others are standing and taking in the view, and a few are taking photographs of the scenic view and each other.\n\nIn the foreground, we can see turbulent waters that appear to be the top of a waterfall, rushing towards the cliff edge, hinting at the powerful natural forces at play. The mist rising from the falling water partially obscures the view but adds a mystical quality to the scene.\n\nThe background features a tall observation tower that stands out prominently against the sky. This structure, with its distinctive deck on top, suggests it is a vantage point from which visitors can oversee the entire landscape and the waterfalls.\n\nThe area is surrounded by greenery; trees and grass are visible around the walking paths, adding a touch of nature to the busy tourist spot. The crowd is diverse, with people of various ages and attire indicating a popular, likely warm season for visiting. The attire of the people ranges from casual to light outerwear, appropriate for a day outdoors.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph depicts a bustling yet serene natural landmark, enjoyed by many, combining the raw beauty of nature with human curiosity and leisure activities.","title":"Tourists on goat island, which separates the falls into two parts at the brink of the escarpment, enjoy a spectacular view of the canadian, or \"horseshoe falls.\"  In the background is the canadian skylon tower","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549535","549537","549546","549466","549530","549545","549534","549563","549467","549560","549557","549549","552397","549562","544342","549558"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","tourist","observation","tower","visit","attraction","walk","rush","oversee","people"]}
