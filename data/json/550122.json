{"path":"550122.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a cityscape dominated by a series of tall, imposing buildings canvassing the skyline. The perspective is straight down a city street, lined with these high-rises. From the foreground to the background, the architecture varies significantly: \n\n- The building on the right side is textured, showing a warm-toned facade; its windows are structured in long, vertical rows, creating a rhythmical grid. The lower part of this building features neoclassical elements around the entrance, labeled \"THE HOLBENDEN HOUSES.\" \n- To the left of the photograph, a darker, glass-clad building demonstrates more modern architectural characteristics with its reflective surface and sleek, clean lines. A small portion of another similar building is visible behind this one.\n- Further in the background are additional skyscrapers of varying design details and heights, contributing to the dense urban atmosphere.\n\nThe street itself is dotted with various elements typical of a city: street lamps, minimal vehicular traffic, and a few small, leafy trees. The overall lighting in the photo creates engaging shadows casting off the buildings, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. The mood conveys a typical bustling city environment but captured in a moment of unusual tranquility.","title":"Downtown buildings on Superior Avenue","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["548408","549971","555736","548425","552394","548392","551510","552363","553845","550007","548424","546745","545499","548417","555743","549880"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Urban Architecture"],"terms":["city","building","street","characteristic","skyscraper","lamp","grid","entrance","height","cityscape"]}
