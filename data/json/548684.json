{"path":"548684.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a person in a natural forest environment. The person, whose gender is not differentiated in the image, is dressed in a light colored, sleeveless top and dark pants. They are standing in a clear patch of land amidst denser vegetation and looking up at a tall, prominent tree. The tree stands out distinctly from the surrounding foliage, towering with its dense, green canopy against a bright blue sky somewhat clouded by a few wisps of white. The person appears engaged and possibly admiring or studying the large tree. Around the person, the ground is uneven and covered with various small plants and leaf litter, suggesting a relatively undisturbed or wild area. The surrounding trees and plants indicate a dense, lush environment, likely a forest or wooded area. The composition of the image, with its focus on the juxtaposition of the person and the towering tree under a vivid sky, evokes a sense of solitude and interaction with nature.","title":"During the 18th and 19th centuries, English cabinet makers used the mahogany trees of Key Largo for their finest furniture. Numbers of the trees have fallen to the developers' bulldozers, but many can still be found by persistent seekers with a good knowledge of the area.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543452","554099","548685","553595","553635","554995","543445","545515","544632","543446","555116","554977","542728","546947","553576","543488"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["person","wisp","gender","tree","forest","leaf","litter","plant","canopy","juxtaposition"]}
