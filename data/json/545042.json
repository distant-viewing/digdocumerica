{"path":"545042.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents a sweeping panoramic view of a landscape from an elevated vantage point. In the foreground, the scene is dominated by dense evergreen trees, prominently silhouetted against the sky. These trees line the edge of the view, framing the expansive scene below.\n\nThe middle ground reveals a broad, flat valley lush with variegated patches of agricultural fields, likely segmented by various crops or pastoral land. Small clusters of buildings, possibly farmhouses or barns, are interspersed throughout the fields, hinting at human habitation and rural farming activity.\n\nBeyond the agricultural valley, a large river meanders through the landscape, reflecting light and adding a dynamic element to the scene. Adjacent to the river, on the opposite bank, there is visible industrial activity, evidenced by large structures and plumes of smoke or steam rising into the air, likely indicating factories or power plants.\n\nThe sky occupies the upper portion of the image and adds a dramatic flair to the composition. It features striking cloud formations and jet contrails that create an intricate network of lines and textures. These aerial patterns range from thin, straight lines to broad, wispy stretches of clouds, contributing to the visual interest and depth of the photograph.\n\nThe overall color palette is rich yet natural, with the greens of the trees, the earth tones of the fields, the blue hues of the sky, and the grey and white of the industrial emissions and clouds. This photograph captures both the natural beauty and industrial impact on the environment, providing a complex yet serene snapshot of this particular locale.","title":"Pulp mill pollution","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545020","556907","556908","543981","557003","552243","545112","545013","547995","545053","556913","545001","545048","556936","556919","549116"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["field","valley","cloud","flair","farmhouse","jet","locale","line","barn","segment"]}
