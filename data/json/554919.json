{"path":"554919.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph presents an ethereal and somewhat abstract scene, likely captured through a textured or semi-opaque surface, which gives the image a dreamlike quality. The image predominantly features warm hues, with a rich gradient of ambers, golds, and deep browns, interspersed with patches of darker areas that suggest shadows or silhouettes.\n\nThe central part of the image appears to show two obscured silhouettes resembling figures, possibly human, standing. These figures are enveloped in what looks like a mist or haze, contributing to the overall mysterious and ghostly effect. They are positioned near what might resemble the edge of a water body, indicated by reflections and the fluid, wavering lines that suggest gentle movement of liquid.\n\nThe backdrop and surroundings are indistinct, blending into the hazy, cloud-like textures that dominate the image. A subtle hint of natural elements, possibly thin, wispy branches or grass, emerges at the lower portion of the composition, further enhancing the feeling of an outdoor, twilight setting.\n\nOverall, the composition and coloration of the photograph stimulate a moody, contemplative atmosphere, with the impressionistic portrayals inviting interpretations of solitude, reflection, or otherworldly presence.","title":"Steam rising from the Frio River at sunrise on a cold day near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555804","557572","555714","557584","555126","542981","550775","555213","557000","550652","545213","547546","552237","557579","550389","543747"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["interpretation","reflection","fluid","silhouette","figure","gold","standing","portrayal","liquid","coloration"]}
