{"path":"553650.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"In the photograph, a man is seen engaging in an activity near a body of water, likely a river or lake, given the visible water surface beside him. The man is dressed in a uniform that includes a short-sleeve khaki shirt, a similarly colored wide-brimmed hat, and dark trousers. On his shirt, there is a badge, indicating he may be a ranger or an officer of some sort. He has a cigarette in his mouth, and his expression is focused on the task at hand.\n\nThe man is holding a long wooden pole with a net attached to its end. The net is submerged in a makeshift rectangular tank or container, which appears to be filled with water and some form of residue or waste, possibly indicating an environmental cleaning activity or sample collection. The tank is dirty and stained, suggesting it is frequently used for practical, possibly industrial, purposes.\n\nThe background of the image is minimally detailed but includes the textured edge of the waterbody and a glimpse of the opposite bank, enhancing the outdoor setting of the scene. The sunlight falls directly on the man and the tank, highlighting their actions and the textures within the scene. The overall composition and elements suggest a moment captured during an ecological or environmental operation.","title":"A u.s.
