{"path":"542585.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a scrapyard scene filled with various discarded mechanical parts and rusted metal debris. The foreground is densely packed with items such as rusted gears, parts of machinery, broken wheels and wheel hubs, curved metal plates, possibly car parts, and long metal rods. The parts are randomly thrown together, creating a chaotic scene that suggests abandonment and decay.\n\nIn the middle ground, slightly blurred due to the shallow depth of field, there's more of the same type of debris. This layer also includes grayish-white gravel and rocks that provide a contrasting texture to the rusted metal parts.\n\nIn the background, there's sparse vegetation, predominantly taller grasses and some small bushes. The natural landscape suggests that this might be on the outskirts of a rural or wild area. The earthy and green tones of the backdrop subtly contrast with the dark, oxidized colors of the foreground, highlighting the unnatural presence of the mechanical parts in a natural environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph brings attention to the environmental impact of human activity, particularly through the lens of waste and abandonment in a natural setting. The color palette ranges from the rusty reds and browns of the metal parts to the muted greens and grays of the natural background, conveying a somber, neglected atmosphere.","title":"Hillside dump","placename":"Sonora (Calif.)","location":"Sonora, California","nn1":["554318","554300","554335","554346","552740","554301","547625","556324","549307","548109","554357","547611","552102","554334","546267","544831"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["metal","part","wheel","abandonment","scrapyard","lens","debris","outskirt","hub","plate"]}
