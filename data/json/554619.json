{"path":"554619.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat unusual moment in an outdoor setting, likely a park. It features two deer in the foreground; both are light brown with visible white spots and have slender bodies. The deer on the right has small developing antlers, indicating it is a young male. These animals appear calm and unbothered by the human presence.\n\nIn the background, three people—two women and a younger man or boy—are seated around a picnic table. The women are engaged in conversation, one seated on the table and the other on the bench. The younger male figure, who is also seated on the bench, seems relaxed and is casually observing the scene. Their attire is casual, suitable for a day out in a park, and they seem to be enjoying a peaceful interaction, unperturbed by the proximity of the wildlife.\n\nThe setting is lush with trees and green grass, suggesting a well-maintained park. The ambiance conveyed is one of tranquility where humans and wildlife are momentarily sharing the same space harmoniously. The lighting in the photograph suggests it's taken during the daytime under natural light, enhancing the vibrancy of the green surroundings.","title":"Two white-tailed bucks with antlers in velvet walk to a feeding station atop McCauley Mountain near Old Forge, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544114","546232","543279","544916","546088","545902","553808","543368","542963","558368","542955","554621","546163","544914","549219","543326"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","park","bench","wildlife","table","antler","picnic","vibrancy","male","woman"]}
