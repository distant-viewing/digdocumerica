{"path":"554537.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil wilderness scene featuring two main subjects—a man and a dog—in a rustic outdoor setting. The environment is dense with trees, evoking a sense of seclusion and closeness to nature.\n\nIn the foreground, a light-colored dog with a thick fur coat stands alert on a rocky and uneven surface scattered with small logs and debris. The dog’s posture and gaze suggest attentiveness to its surroundings.\n\nTo the right, an older man sits under the shelter of a rudimentary wooden lean-to structure, which provides a basic cover, likely for camping or temporary stays in the woods. He appears engaged in an activity, possibly checking or using a small object in his hands, which could be a tool or a mobile device. The man is dressed in casual, weather-appropriate attire including a denim jacket and a baseball cap, suiting the outdoor environment.\n\nThe lean-to is equipped with a simple wooden bench, on which the man is seated, and beside him, there is a colorful striped bag, indicating a camping or hiking journey. In front of the lean-to, there is a makeshift fire pit surrounded by rocks and partially burnt wood, suggesting recent use, perhaps for warmth or cooking.\n\nOther items visible in the scene include a tarp or plastic sheeting spread out near the dog, possibly used for collecting or storing materials, and a metal plate, hinting at recent or intended food preparation. The overall composition and elements in the image create a narrative of outdoor living and survival in a forested setting, emphasizing a connection between the subjects and the natural environment around them.","title":"Discarded sheet of plastic, garbage and accumulated junk abandoned at a state lean-to on the trail to Mount Marcy, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554532","553089","543031","554559","542726","554126","554513","542874","549928","551516","545497","543261","554679","546137","554682","549716"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["dog","camping","survival","lean","stay","subject","attentiveness","wood","cooking","tarp"]}
