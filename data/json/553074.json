{"path":"553074.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a variety of plants growing from patchy soil, illuminated by patches of sunlight. The focal point of the image is a grouping of fuzzy, white wildflowers. These flowers are still mostly in bud form, with silky, hair-like fibers covering the stems and buds, giving them a soft, downy appearance. To the right of these white flowers, there stands a small plant with shiny, red leaves that contrast sharply with the subdued tones of the rest of the flora. The red-leaved plant has around four leaves that gleam under the sunlight, emphasizing their vibrant hue against the darker, earthy background.\n\nThe backdrop is somewhat obscured by shadow but appears to consist of rocky, uneven terrain typical of a natural outdoor setting, possibly a forest or mountain area. Small rocks and debris scatter over the soil, contributing to the ruggedness of the terrain. This setting allows the play of light and shadow across the frame, highlighting the textures and colors of the plants, enhancing the overall depth and richness of the photographic composition.","title":"Pasque flowers bloom near the Roaring Fork River.
