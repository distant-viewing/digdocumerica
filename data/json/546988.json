{"path":"546988.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a construction site where new residential buildings are under development. The building in view is a two-story structure, partially clad with light-colored wooden siding. Several windows are visible; some are missing glass panels, indicating the ongoing nature of construction.\n\nScaffolding is erected against the first building, suggesting that work is still in progress on the upper parts of the facade. Scattered around the site are numerous pieces of wood, likely offcuts and materials for the construction, which litter the ground, injecting a sense of disorder typical of active construction sites.\n\nThe setting is wooded, with several mature trees interspersed around the construction area. These trees have thick trunks and expansive canopies that suggest an established, possibly suburban or rural, setting. The presence of these trees also indicates that the construction is being integrated into an existing landscape, likely to preserve the natural aesthetics and provide shade.\n\nThere are no people visible in the image, directing the focus entirely on the construction and its surroundings. The overall atmosphere is one of transformation, depicting a phase where new structures begin to shape and alter their natural environment.","title":"Housing construction at sea pines on hilton head island","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["543584","553922","543583","557730","553703","556619","553702","550737","548552","550273","557728","547833","552031","543544","547652","547858"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","alter","inject","missing","exist","disorder","phase","transformation","begin"]}
