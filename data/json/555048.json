{"path":"555048.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a young fern, specifically a fiddlehead, as it begins to unfurl. The fiddlehead is centrally located in the image and demonstrates the classic tightly coiled form that resembles the scroll of a violin, hence its name. It appears lush and vibrant in color, suggesting the freshness and beginning of its growth cycle.\n\nThe fiddlehead is attached to a slender, vertical stem that is predominantly light green with some signs of natural wear such as small brown spots and minor damage, likely from natural elements or insects. The surface of the stem shows varied texture, including rough and smoother areas, reflecting how external conditions affect plant growth.\n\nThe background of the photo is dark and blurred, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the fiddlehead and the stem. Subtle shades of brown and green can be seen, which might be other plants or part of the soil, contributing to the natural woodland setting typically favored by ferns.\n\nThis image captures the delicate beauty and intricate details of plant growth in a natural environment, emphasizing themes of new beginnings and the detailed complexity of nature.","title":"Closeup of a young fern in a private forest preserve at Green Mountain in Kitsap County, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554577","553590","555053","555049","555191","555190","543622","553589","555192","554729","542573","557625","555004","554996","555093","553358"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["stem","beginning","growth","fern","plant","freshness","insect","cycle","show","woodland"]}
