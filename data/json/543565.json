{"path":"543565.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a cluster of small plants, likely grasses or similar foliage, which are covered in droplets of water. The image shows the plants in sharp focus, emphasizing their vibrant green hues interspersed with brownish tips, and the sparkling droplets that cling to each blade and the surrounding mossy surface.\n\nThe drops themselves are highlighted by the light, possibly sunlight, which creates small reflective points making them glisten like little crystals speckled across the image. The composition focuses on a few central blades that are particularly densely decorated with water droplets, standing slightly taller than the surrounding vegetation.\n\nThe background blends into a bokeh of greens and light, blurring into an indistinct mass that offers a contrast to the sharply-defined droplets and plant details in the foreground. This bokeh effect enhances the depth of the image and focuses the viewer’s attention on the minutiae of water droplets and plant textures.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a fresh, vibrant quality, possibly taken in the early morning, capturing the essence of nature’s intricate beauty.","title":"Water drops on grass","placename":"Tahoe National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe National Forest, California","nn1":["543564","555184","558077","553853","547312","543629","547287","557592","555044","543560","543623","555032","557593","543562","555040","551357"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["droplet","blade","plant","crystal","drop","mossy","mass","tip","essence","water"]}
