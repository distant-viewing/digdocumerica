{"path":"548835.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a single swimmer gliding through a body of water, captured from an elevated angle. The swimmer, who appears to be a young male, is partially submerged, with his body extended in a relaxed, face-up position, suggestive of a backstroke or leisurely float. His arms are gently outstretched and his head is tilted slightly back, allowing his face to be partially visible and relaxed. \n\nThe water around him is dark and appears deep, hinting at a natural body of water rather than a swimming pool. Light plays on the surface of the water, creating a sparkling effect around the swimmer, which contrasts with the darker, shadowy hues of the water. The ripples and movements in the water suggest a tranquil, possibly secluded swimming spot. \n\nThere are no other discernible objects or people within the frame. The focus is squarely on the interaction between the swimmer and the natural environment, embodying a moment of peace and simplicity. This tranquil scene captures the essence of solitude and the soothing effect of being immersed in water.","title":"Swimming on Havasu Lake","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548842","548844","544196","544343","544351","553444","544347","549103","550237","545229","552227","548683","547712","551165","544339","548291"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["swimmer","swimming","water","float","face","effect","peace","body","male","pool"]}
