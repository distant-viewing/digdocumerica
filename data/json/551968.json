{"path":"551968.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a protest scene focused on a man in a red clerical shirt with a clerical collar, signifying he might be a member of the clergy. He's holding a large picket sign that reads \"BOYCOTT Jewel Food Stores FARM WORKERS ON STRIKE.\" The sign is mostly white with bold black and red text; the logo of \"Jewel Food Stores\" is visible in red within a white oval.\n\nThe man's expression is serious and he appears to be attentively listening or looking towards something out of the frame. He holds the sign with both hands, and one of his hands is holding a cigarette. \n\nIn the background, another individual is visible holding a similar picket sign with the same message, indicating a coordinated effort or rally concerning the boycott of Jewel Food Stores in support of farm workers. This background protester is partially obscured. The setting appears to be outdoors, with a group of bystanders or fellow protesters somewhat blurred in the background.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment from a protest, centering on workers' rights and the involvement of religious figures in social justice movements. The photograph conveys a sense of solidarity and activism among participants.","title":"Farm workers and supporters boycotting Jewel Food Store on Broadway in the \"New Town\" area of the city, close to the Lake Michigan waterfront.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551939","551938","556544","556256","553143","553140","545253","544069","556257","556255","544235","553243","553302","550077","553307","547423"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["protest","picket","worker","hold","sign","activism","cigarette","involvement","collar","signify"]}
