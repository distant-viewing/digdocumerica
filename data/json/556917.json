{"path":"556917.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a landscape primarily characterized by its vast and varied topography, likely reflecting a military or industrial complex amidst a natural setting. The scene is dominated by large, barren patches of land that appear geometrically shaped, surrounded by ribbons of roads curving through them. Within these barren areas are multiple oblong structures that may be bunkers or storage units, positioned symmetrically with respect to each other. These structures are interconnected by a network of roads that enhance the organized, planned layout of the site.\n\nAt the top and bottom edges of the photograph, dense forests provide a sharp natural contrast to the geometric human-made structures. The forests are dark green, indicating a thick, healthy growth, possibly coniferous in nature due to the texture and color.\n\nThe infrastructure includes several large paved roads that cut through the forest, suggesting significant vehicle access and connectivity to other areas. Farther from the center, smaller dirt tracks link various sections of the site together. The overall color scheme of the landscape varies from deep greens of the forest to lighter shades of brown and gray of the cleared land and roads, which could indicate different soil types or land use.\n\nLight, possibly due to the time of day (either dawn or dusk), casts long shadows and gives a slightly bluish tint to the landscape, enhancing the mood and depth of the terrain. The horizon stretches far into the distance under a pale blue sky, subtly lit by natural light, suggesting expansiveness and isolation of the location. \n\nOverall, the photo suggests a space dedicated to either military or heavy industrial use, carefully planned and integrated into the surrounding natural environment to perhaps camouflage its presence or maintain security.","title":"Aerial view looking northwest of Bangor Annex with the Navy's Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific (clearing) and missile sidings in the foreground.
