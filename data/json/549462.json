{"path":"549462.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an exciting moment of whitewater rafting. The image shows a group of six individuals on a large inflatable raft navigating through rough, foamy river waters. The raft is predominantly white, with the name \"RiverEx\" visible on its side, likely indicating the company operating the adventure.\n\nThe rafters, appearing engaged and somewhat tense, are equipped with safety gear appropriate for the activity. They wear life jackets in shades of red and helmets, some of which are white. The group consists of a mix of men and women, actively using their paddles to steer and stabilize the raft.\n\nThe backdrop features a mountainous river setting with rugged, dark rocky outcrops covered sparsely with green vegetation, enhancing the scene's wild and natural allure. The combination of the energetic water and the serene nature around makes this scene vibrant and full of action.\n\nThe overall composition and lighting of the photograph, with sunlight filtering through, highlight the dynamic interaction between the rafters and the turbulent waters they are navigating. The focus and quick reaction of each rafter suggest a thrilling adventure against the power of natural water currents.","title":"A large (28 foot) raft running Wild Sheep Rapids on the Snake River during a conservation trip through Hells Canyon","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["549437","549464","549463","545733","549440","549465","549447","545729","549439","545741","549441","545737","545937","544925","545745","554462"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["raft","adventure","allure","rafting","reaction","paddle","outcrop","current","group","company"]}
