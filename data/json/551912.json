{"path":"551912.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"In this photograph, we are presented with an urban street scene dominated by vehicles and characterized by a backdrop of aged architectural structures. In the foreground, and close to the camera, a red Volkswagen Beetle is prominently featured at the right side of the frame, capturing attention with its classic curved design and distinct color. Next to it on the left, partially visible at the edge of the frame, is a light-colored Volkswagen Type 2 (also known as a Transporter), distinguished by its boxy shape and rear engine placement.\n\nOn the street, behind the Beetle, there are three more cars; a white sedan and two darker vehicles to the right, each parked facing away from the Beetles' direction and slightly faded in color, perhaps reflecting the era of the photograph. These cars hint at the variety of automobile models in circulation during the time period.\n\nThe setting is an urban environment with a large, multi-windowed building that exhibits signs of wear, such as peeling paint or plaster, hinting at historical significance or aging infrastructure. The architecture includes multiple identical windows and classic structural designs typical of mid-20th century urban constructions.\n\nThe composition captures everyday life from a street-level perspective, focusing primarily on transportation while subtly including hints of human activity and architectural environment that frame the scene. The vehicles' positions and varying sizes create a dynamic urban tapestry, reflecting a moment in time in this specific cityscape. The image evokes a sense of era through the styles of vehicles and the condition of the building, offering a nostalgic tone to the overall setting.","title":"Parking spaces are hard to find.
