{"path":"551102.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a residential neighborhood with an array of houses viewed from an elevated perspective, likely taken from a hillside or higher ground. The houses are mostly one-story structures with steeply pitched roofs, and several feature prominent front porches. Architectural styles vary slightly but maintain a consistent, quaint suburban feel, typical of mid-20th-century American neighborhoods.\n\nThe colors of the houses are diverse, ranging from darker reds and blues to lighter shades like white and beige. The most prominent house in the foreground has a red structure with white trim around the windows and a green roof, which suggests it might be the most distinct or perhaps the newest among them.\n\nIn the background, dense green foliage partially obscures the view, indicating that the neighborhood is either on the edge of a forested area or that there are significant green spaces interspersed among the homes. Electrical lines are visible, running parallel to the street, hinting at the functional, lived-in nature of the neighborhood.\n\nThere are also visible vehicles, including a prominent white car parked beside one of the houses, which helps to date the photograph in the late 20th century. The overall scene is peaceful and typical of a residential area, with no visible people or active movement, emphasizing the tranquility of the neighborhood.","title":"Cedar grove homes, looking toward kanawha river from route 60","placename":"Charleston (W.
