{"path":"542839.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a large-scale deforestation site. The image shows a vast area where extensive logging operations have taken place. The trees in the area have been cleared, leaving behind reddish-brown earth and numerous piles of leftover timber and debris scattered throughout the scene. The soil appears heavily disrupted, with multiple clear-cut paths and tracks made by vehicles, indicating the movement and operations of logging machinery.\n\nToward the center and left of the image, a winding dirt road snakes through the cleared area, suggesting a method for transport and access for the logging operations. The remnants of the forest that surround the cleared area are dark green, sharply contrasting with the bright orange and brown tones of the cleared earth.\n\nAt the lower edge of the picture and partially out of frame, the tip of what appears to be an aircraft wing can be seen, indicating that the photograph was taken from the air, likely from a plane or a drone. This perspective provides a comprehensive view of the scale and impact of the logging activity on the area.","title":"\"Clear cutting\"","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542833","542827","542948","542828","542949","542832","545143","542852","555085","556922","542840","555145","542947","542841","542834","545272"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["logging","operation","earth","deforestation","method","tip","snake","plane","scale","timber"]}
