{"path":"542636.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a striking visual contrast emanating from a dense foreground of tightly-packed colorful cars and a crisply isolated automobile elevated against a dark background. The main focal point of the image is a single car, conspicuously suspended in a wooden frame or harness, hoisted by a crane, as indicated by the visible hook and chain arrangement at the top of the frame. The car, appearing to be a classic model from around the 1970s considering its design and compact form, is held aloft, making it stand out against the simpler backdrop above a sea of other cars.\n\nThese numerous cars on the lower section of the image are diverse in color, ranging from shades of orange and yellow to green, blue, and red, hinting at a time when automobile paint colors varied broadly. Despite the clear day, the image's depth is pronounced with the elevated car casting a focused sense of interruption to what might be a routine setting of a car parking lot or a dealership.\n\nThe horizontal division made by the car lot and the dark upper half gives an almost staged emphasis on the suspended car, likely highlighting it for purposes of either display or transportation. The entire setting suggests a carefully organized act probably within an automotive industry context, such as an auto show or a shipping area for new or used cars. The portrayal captures both industrial activity and a vivid array of mid-20th century automotive culture.","title":"Unloading Datsun","placename":"Terminal Island (Calif.)","location":"Terminal Island, California","nn1":["542639","542640","547480","557848","556703","555492","555748","547722","547469","552800","545955","546900","552077","553896","557874","552801"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","automobile","lot","dealership","interruption","auto","harness","hook","division","act"]}
