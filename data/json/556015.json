{"path":"556015.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a collection of vintage or antique telecommunication devices and associated equipment arranged on a workbench in what appears to be a workshop or a storage room. The scene is detailed with various items that suggest telecommunications maintenance or history.\n\nFrom left to right on the wooden workbench:\n\n1. **Black cone-shaped device**: This object is mounted on a stand and appears to be a large, cone-shaped speaker or a primitive listening device.\n\n2. **Multiple switchboard sockets panel**: Adjacent to the cone-shaped device, there is an array of black manual switchboard sockets with cords plugged into some of the ports. This panel is typical of early telephone exchange equipment used to connect calls manually.\n\n3. **Old-fashioned headset hanging**: Above the switchboard, there's an old-fashioned operator's headset with a mouthpiece and a listening piece hanging on a wooden hook.\n\n4. **Additional electrical equipment**: Further to the right, more unidentified electrical equipment is visible, including a pair of cylindrical objects mounted on a shelf, possibly batteries or transformers.\n\n5. **Desk and backdrop**: The bench is cluttered with various objects, including wires, connectors, and tools, indicating an active or once-active workspace for repairing or studying these devices. Behind the workbench, there's a simple wooden shelf and a mounted lamp providing illumination to the area, with papers and what appears to be diagrams or schematics visible.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph suggests a workspace deeply associated with the history or repair of early telecommunications technology, blending elements of technology, history, and workshop clutter into a cohesive scene that narrates the evolution of communication devices.","title":"Train depot at Strong City, Kansas, hasn't served passengers in more than five years, but is maintained in good condition. Railroad crews maintaining tracks and roadbed in the area still use the station's desk and phones. Although Amtrak is responsible for most U.S. intercity passenger service, it leases use of the tracks from the nation's railroads.","placename":"Strong City (Kan.)","location":"Strong City, Kansas","nn1":["556014","552769","542765","548855","549367","548857","549378","552380","549610","547720","551902","556353","556758","552768","549625","542659"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["device","cone","history","mount","equipment","shelf","workshop","workspace","repair","technology"]}
