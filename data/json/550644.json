{"path":"550644.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a vast natural landscape dominated by numerous lakes, marshes, and dense forest areas. The terrain appears uneven, with varying sizes and shapes of lakes scattered across the scene. These water bodies ranging from smaller ponds to larger lakes are interspersed with patches of land that exhibit a palette of earthy tones - browns, golds, and greens suggesting a mix of marshland and wooded areas.\n\nThe forested parts are dark green, likely indicative of coniferous trees, which contrasts with lighter green and tan areas that may represent grasslands or marshy grounds. The lighting in the photo suggests it might be taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, as the shadows are soft and the overall colors are rich yet mild, giving a tranquil feel to the landscape.\n\nThere are no visible man-made structures or any signs of human disturbance in the photo, suggesting this might be a remote or protected area focused on conservation. The horizon in the distance meets a light blue sky, further emphasizing the expanse and untouched nature of the landscape. This setting could be typical of regions known for their natural reserves and wilderness areas.","title":"Typical country north of the chugach range, taiga forests and numerous small lakes","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550569","550643","550541","550617","556931","550626","556926","550579","550544","556906","552141","550620","554652","550611","553566","542882"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["lake","marshland","reserve","marsh","grassland","gold","disturbance","conservation","know","protect"]}
