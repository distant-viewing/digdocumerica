{"path":"552138.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image depicts an industrial scene dominated by a large factory or plant. The prominent feature of the photograph is the tall smokestack situated approximately in the center of the frame, which emits a plume of smoke ascending into the blue sky filled with wispy clouds. In front of the factory, there is a body of water that appears to be a small pond or a canal, reflecting parts of the plant and the sky.\n\nThe scene is framed at the top and bottom by barbed wire, suggesting the photo is taken from a fenced-off or restricted area. The barbed wire adds a sense of limit and exclusion. In the background, behind the smokestack and other plant structures, a series of other industrial buildings can be seen, while to the left of the smokestack, several vehicles are parked in a parking lot, giving a sense of the scale and possibly the workforce involved with the factory.\n\nOn the right side of the pond, there appears to be some debris or possibly construction material stacked up near the water's edge, indicating ongoing works or waste from the plant operations. The photo captures an industrial atmosphere with environmental implications suggested by the facility's emissions and the restricted access to the area.","title":"Tacoma smelter in Ruston is an air polluting factor.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550869","546808","548068","550724","548195","557293","550956","552179","550868","546087","550329","550716","544691","550328","544495","545925"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","factory","plant","pond","wire","off","implication","restrict","limit","ascend"]}
