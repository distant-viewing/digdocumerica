{"path":"553598.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures the image of a firefighter working in the aftermath of a forest fire. The setting is a dense, wooded area where the immediate surroundings show signs of the fire's impact. Several trees, scorched and blackened, stand stark against a hazy, smoke-filled backdrop. Daylight is visible, but the smoke diffuses the light, creating a muted and somber ambiance.\n\nThe firefighter is dressed in protective gear, including a yellow hard hat and a dark, heavy coat, likely fire-resistant. He appears to be actively engaged in a task, possibly managing equipment or assessing the condition of the forest post-fire. His posture and direction of movement suggest concentration and purpose.\n\nThe ground is visible with patches of snow, indicating the season or high altitude, and the soil looks muddy and charred, showing traces of firefighting efforts such as water or foam. The environment is eerily quiet except for the potential sound of distant cracklings of timber and the muffled sounds of other personnel or machinery.\n\nThe photograph overall conveys a powerful narrative of the aftermath of forest fires and the rigorous, often dangerous work of firefighters in these conditions. It highlights both the destructive power of natural disasters and the resilience and bravery of those who work to mitigate their effects.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora. In post-fire salvage operation, a \"faller\" cuts down a giant tree dangerously weakened by the flames. As it crashes to earth, the tree stirs up thick cloud of soot and ashes.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553597","553596","553639","553562","553626","553632","553583","555157","553611","553635","553561","555113","548590","542598","553624","553584"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["fire","sound","aftermath","forest","blacken","work","assess","personnel","smoke","overall"]}
