{"path":"548741.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts an environmental scene characterized by pollution along a coastal area. The foreground features a patch of sandy soil littered with different forms of debris including several plastic plates, a mug, and other miscellaneous trash like a cable and likely a metal can, scattered around a small pool of water mixed with soil and sand.\n\nLarge rocks are also present in the pool area, which appears to be stagnant with potentially oily or contaminated water, as it shows a sheen on its surface. Flanking the polluted area, sparse vegetation and grass can be observed.\n\nIn the background, there's a long structure extending over the water which appears to be a bridge or pier. The bridge runs parallel to the shore, leading towards a distant landform visible across the water. The expansive body of water that sits next to this polluted site shows variegated shades of blue indicating different depths or bottom surfaces. The horizon is marked by a clear sky with no visible clouds, contributing to a sense of openness and natural scenic beauty which contrasts starkly with the polluted foreground. The overall scene underscores environmental neglect in coastal regions.","title":"Cleared land on Ohio Key, with a section of the Overseas Highway in the background. On the other side of the road, land has been cleared to make room for a \"travel-trailer\" camp. This small key has changed significantly in the years since Rachel Carson camped here to do research for her book, *The Edge of the Sea* (1955).","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547831","547897","546374","552127","550280","550687","547524","547493","550812","551440","550800","550352","552811","543056","547907","547626"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["pool","mug","bridge","soil","water","landform","sheen","openness","plate","can"]}
