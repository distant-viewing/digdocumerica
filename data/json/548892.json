{"path":"548892.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up view of a person's hands holding several sheets of paper. The papers are filled with grids and various numbers, resembling balance sheets, timetables, or record-keeping documents. Each sheet is titled with different headers like “Derek Hughes,” handwritten notes, and printed names of individuals, suggesting they might be attendance records, score sheets, or some form of logistical or statistical data.\n\nThe hands are partially visible, with only fingers and thumbs showing, holding the sheets in a way that they are partially overlapping each other. The papers seem well-used or frequently handled, as indicated by their slightly worn edges and creases.\n\nThe background is blurred and indistinct, with no identifiable objects, emphasizing focus on the sheets of paper in the foreground. The soft focus of the background contributes to highlighting the details on the papers, making them the central subject of the photo. The overall tone of the photograph is somewhat warm, possibly due to the lighting conditions under which the photo was taken.","title":"At EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center--where food, air and water samples are analyzed.","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["546648","555241","556750","555392","546281","556264","544318","556007","542690","546285","546890","558378","557313","552357","558357","555417"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["sheet","paper","record","datum","finger","note","document","balance","hand","grid"]}
