{"path":"549048.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an agricultural scene, depicting a person engaged in field work surrounded by numerous burlap sacks filled with crops. The worker, bending over and seemingly inspecting or handling one of the sacks, is dressed in light-colored long pants, a long-sleeve shirt, and a hat, suggesting warm and sunny conditions.\n\nThe sacks are densely packed and arranged in rows, covering the ground extensively. They appear to be full, causing them to bulge and deform slightly. The ground is barren and dry between the rows, indicative of a harvested field. The sacks bear various marks and writing, indicating content type or origin, which are common for transportation and storage purposes.\n\nThe background is out of focus, emphasizing the worker and the sacks in the foreground. The overall composition of the photograph, with its repetitive patterns of sacks and the solitary figure of the worker, highlights the scale of the harvest and the labor involved in agricultural processing and preparation for distribution.","title":"Farm worker ties bags of onions","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549036","554047","549084","557478","544365","543324","555620","546964","549050","544371","555619","557696","543845","543157","554936","548900"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["sack","harvest","worker","origin","writing","row","distribution","field","preparation","inspect"]}
