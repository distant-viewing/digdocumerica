{"path":"557663.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene reminiscent of a quaint, tourist-friendly town. The image is set along a sidewalk lined with a series of shops with charming facades. On the left, the businesses display traditional German architectural features, including ornate signage like the \"House of JÃ¤ger\" sign with a red and white coat of arms, and matching decorative elements.\n\nOne of the focal activities in the image is of a young boy, dressed in a casual blue shirt, who is actively engaged in gardening. He is seen handling a flower pot, deeply concentrating on his task. The foreground and background show different visitors: in the foreground, a woman appears to be walking and taking a photograph simultaneously, while in the background, another woman and two men are also seemingly strolling or exiting the shops.\n\nThe street is lined with parked cars indicative of the era's automotive design, featuring a mix of sedans prominently on display, suggesting a busy day maybe during a weekend or holiday. Above this busy street scene, European-style lamp posts with hanging flower baskets add a pop of color and a homely feel to the setting.\n\nThe composition is lively and bustling, conveying a sense of leisure and everyday life in a tourist-oriented location, possibly during the 1970s to 1980s based on the vehicle designs and clothing styles. The lush green trees in the background and clear skies suggest a pleasant, sunny day, perfect for outdoor activities and shopping.","title":"Village employed gardeners at work on the main street of Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. Tourism and commercial growth have come to the small mountain village since its officials, businessmen, and residents okayed a Bavarian alpine theme for the business district. Without using state or federal funds, businessmen revamped existing buildings with new exteriors in alpine motifs. The success of the plan has led to new development and tourism.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557656","557806","551790","557654","557803","551788","551849","549671","557655","557805","546428","551084","551871","551851","550115","551742"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["tourist","shop","street","flower","holiday","pop","gardening","pot","basket","shopping"]}
