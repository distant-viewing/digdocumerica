{"path":"545600.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of waste disposal in a rugged, barren landscape under a clear blue sky. A man is standing on the back of a green pickup truck mid-motion, as he throws a bag of trash off the vehicle. The trash bags vary in color, mostly transparent with visible contents, and are loosely tied, filled with mixed refuse that includes papers, plastic items, and organic waste. These bags are lined up on a dirt ground, creating a trail down a small mound where the truck is parked.\n\nThe soil appears dry and reddish-brown, suggesting an arid environment. The angle of the sun indicates either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the soil and the objects. The backdrop contains no vegetation or buildings, emphasizing the isolation and the harsh setting of the dumping activity.","title":"Workers disposing of garbage collected in the park.
