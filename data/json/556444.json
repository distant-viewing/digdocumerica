{"path":"556444.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene with a man engaged in a task next to a large, corrugated metal culvert lying on the ground. The man, clad in work attire consisting of a light-colored long sleeve shirt and rugged pants, seems to be either arranging or examining items strewn about, including what appears to be a toolbox, some cardboard, and other miscellaneous equipment. His attire and posture suggest he is a worker, likely involved in either construction or maintenance work.\n\nThe metal culvert behind him is partially filled with other materials and objects, indicating a temporary storage or a disorganized collection of equipment and supplies likely used for work on this site. Several shoes and a pair of boots, different from those he is wearing, are visible on the ground in front of the culvert, adding a personal and somewhat disordered element to the scene.\n\nThe background, while slightly blurred, consists of trees and a natural environment, suggesting that this location is either remote or on the outskirts of a developed area. The ground around the culvert and the man is rocky and uneven, scattered with small stones, debris, and natural detritus, which emphasizes the ruggedness of the location and nature of the work being performed.","title":"Doren Bishop, superintendent for Robin Mines owned by the Alma Coal Corporation near Clothier and Madison, West Virginia, puts on mining coveralls next to a metal culvert.
