{"path":"555331.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph shows a large, block-like structure set in a dry, barren landscape that appears to be a desert. The structure is tall, resembling a tower, composed of what looks like solar panels or experimental equipment; it's a grid-like facade filled with numerous small, uniform panels.\n\nThe scene is captured during daylight under a clear blue sky. There are two people visible: one standing on a platform near the top of the structure facing the camera, and another person visible in profile slightly below the first, climbing a set of metallic stairs that connect different levels of the infrastructure. Their presence suggests some form of operational, maintenance, or inspection activity is taking place.\n\nSurrounding the structure, the landscape is sparse, characterized by flat terrain with scant vegetation, which might include small bushes or scrubland. Visible in the background are distant hills or low mountains. In the immediate vicinity of the tower, there is some additional equipment and what looks like a mobile unit or trailer, likely used for storage or as a temporary workspace.\n\nThe overall impression is of a technological setup, possibly a solar power plant, research facility or an experimental setup in a remote setting designed either for generating energy, collecting data, or testing equipment in a specific environmental condition typical of arid regions. The setup suggests a focus on sustainability or environmental research.","title":"Reflection of the photographer (center) shooting directly at the heliostat from the back of the test cab of the solar furnace operated for the U.S. Army at White Sands Missile Range Alamogordo, New Mexico.
