{"path":"555166.jpg","date":"September 1968","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene under a dramatic and visually striking sky. The central feature of the image is a large, fiery-looking object in the sky, perhaps the sun, which is partially obscured by dark smoke. This glowing sphere has a brilliant center and a murky, reddish periphery, resembling an eclipse or a celestial event observed through heavy smog.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a silhouette of an industrial structure, possibly a smokestack or chimney, from which a thick plume of black smoke is billowing upward. The smoke partially obscures the bright object in the sky, enhancing the contrast between the dark industrial emissions and the intense light behind it. The structure features a simple, geometric outline with a rectangular body that tapers near the top, ending in a flat platform that frames the smoke emission.\n\nThe sky around the smoke and the glowing object shifts from a dark, almost black color near the top of the image to warmer hues of dark orange and red nearer to the horizon. This gradient adds a moody, somewhat apocalyptic quality to the scene, underscoring themes of pollution or environmental impact.\n\nOverall, the composition and color palette create a stark and powerful visual narrative about industry and nature, invoking themes of pollution, environmental degradation, and the overpowering scale of human industrial activity against the natural world.","title":"Forest products plant in everett, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545438","545421","545446","544708","550821","544704","552156","545425","547204","552190","544173","545418","545239","550984","544696","545439"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","emission","object","pollution","glow","sphere","taper","periphery","smog","theme"]}
