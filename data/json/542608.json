{"path":"542608.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene with two adult males interacting near a vehicle in a forested setting. On the left side of the image, we see the profile view of a man sitting inside a truck, framed by the window. On the right, another man, standing outside the truck, leans in through the open window to talk with the driver.\n\nThe man inside the truck is visible only in profile, appearing to engage with the standing man. He is wearing a dark green shirt and is partially shadowed, adding a bit of mystery to his expression but suggesting attentiveness in their conversation.\n\nThe man standing outside the truck is wearing a white hard hat with the word \"BUCK\" written on it and a light grey shirt with vertical stripes. He also appears to hold a bottle in his hand. His expression is serious and focused, indicative of a possibly work-related discussion.\n\nThe environment around them is sunny and forested, featuring tall pine trees that are slightly blurred, indicating a background distinct from the focal interaction between the two men. The natural light suggests it is daytime, and the overall setting implies a remote or less urban location, possibly relating to forestry or fieldwork.","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["546092","546176","557854","545504","553607","544969","544349","553638","547382","553606","542607","549798","553117","554860","542562","558308"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","profile","man","attentiveness","relate","fieldwork","forestry","expression","mystery","talk"]}
