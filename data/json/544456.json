{"path":"544456.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a natural landscape featuring a waterfall and a surrounding forested area. The top of the image shows densely packed trees in various shades of green, indicating a lush forest environment. A meandering river or stream cuts through the terrain, surrounded by rocky banks and patches of earth that hint at varying elevations and rugged terrain. The river seems to flow towards the bottom of the image where it cascades over a cliff edge, forming a beautiful natural waterfall.\n\nThe waterfall itself is notable for its multiple streams of water falling into a large, dark-colored body of water below, likely a pool or a lake. The water appears to have a significant drop, and the waterfalls create white, frothy lines as they hit the lake, suggesting considerable force. The lake surface glistens with reflections, likely from the sunlight, giving the water a sparkling appearance.\n\nThe cliff faces around the waterfall are steep and rocky, marked with sparse vegetation that clings to the crevices. These cliffs frame the waterfall, enhancing its secluded and dramatic atmosphere. The overall scene is a striking display of natural beauty, offering a snapshot of a peaceful yet dynamic ecosystem likely teeming with wildlife and natural flora. The image is a vivid representation of a serene natural landscape, characterized by its vibrant foliage and the powerful movement of water.","title":"South Central Texas","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542698","544348","544344","558087","554113","545878","554408","542699","554409","543578","550979","555699","555220","545874","555073","550697"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["waterfall","cliff","lake","stream","drop","water","crevice","cut","representation","force"]}
