{"path":"554484.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling lakeside scene, seemingly at a boat rental facility. In the foreground, a prominent sign reads \"BOAT LIVERY\" and below, additional signs list available services such as \"MOTORS,\" \"CANOES,\" \"SERVICE,\" and \"RENTALS.\" There are various advertisements, including one for \"SPRITE\" and what seems to be a local map or guide service. \n\nThe parking area is full of cars, prominently featuring a brown and white station wagon. There are people near the vehicles, including a group possibly loading or unloading gear.\n\nFurther into the scene, the lakeshore is lined with several boats, some moored on the water, others pulled onto the land. A wooden dock extends into the lake with more boats attached. A group of people, including children and adults, is gathered by the shore and on the dock, engaged in activities like walking and conversing.\n\nThe background is dominated by a vast stretch of water reflecting an overcast sky. The vista is framed by mountains in the distance and trees typical of a northern forest environment. The overall ambiance suggests a cool, possibly early summer or late spring day, busy with the activities of vacationing or day-tripping visitors to the lake.","title":"Private boat livery at Raquette Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, on Memorial Day weekend, at the state campsite at Golden Beach.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554683","554610","547773","554485","544002","546856","551259","551528","544006","558233","544126","544025","543934","549934","554659","548002"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["service","boat","dock","guide","lake","unloading","vista","canoe","map","lakeside"]}
