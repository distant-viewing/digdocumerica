{"path":"554251.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a serene winter scene on a ski slope with a clear view of a vast mountainous landscape in the background. The mountains stretch across the horizon, covered in snow, layered in various shades of grey-blue, suggesting depth and vastness. The sky above is a soft blue with scattered feathery clouds, suggesting a calm, crisp winter day.\n\nIn the foreground, two skiers are seen from the back, standing on a well-groomed piste, adding a human element to this picturesque setting. The ski slope is equipped with a ski-lift, visible to the right of the frame, carrying more skiers uphill, emphasizing the active pursuit of skiing in this tranquil environment.\n\nThe first skier, closest to the camera, is donned in a distinctive ski suit patterned with large geometric shapes in shades of brown and white, wearing dark ski boots, and holding ski poles. The skier's outfit is uniquely retro, possibly indicative of the era the photo was taken. The skier wears a dark-colored beanie, further accentuating the old-fashioned style.\n\nThe second skier, slightly ahead and to the right of the first, is dressed in a darker outfit, and is less distinct due to the angle and distance from the camera. This skier is facing more towards the ski lift, perhaps observing the other skiers or simply resting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its vast landscape contrasted against the human activity of skiing, and the vintage clothing of the skiers, creates a nostalgic atmosphere, possibly reminding one of the classic skiing eras of the past. The scene is both dynamic and peaceful, emphasizing the enjoyment of nature and winter sports.","title":"Enjoying the view before taking run from the top of Snowmass Mountain.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554253","554236","550017","554292","554257","554252","550004","554254","554235","548153","554249","554259","554221","543384","554255","554244"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["skier","ski","skiing","winter","lift","beanie","outfit","slope","groom","era"]}
