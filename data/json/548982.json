{"path":"548982.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of agricultural activity, specifically grain harvesting. It features two men operating a combine harvester on a vast, open field. The focal point is the right side of the image showing harvested grain being expelled from a chute into a tractor-pulled collection trailer. The grain, possibly wheat based on its color and texture, forms a poured stream, giving the image a dynamic aspect as it fills the trailer.\n\nThe combine harvester is mostly red, with details such as steps, wheels, and other machinery in a contrast of red and white paint. The driver is visible within the cab section of the combine harvester, sitting behind the wheel and peering out. Another worker is seen in the shadowed part of the vehicle, contributing to the operation.\n\nThe background of the photo illustrates a flat, expansive, and harvested field under a clear blue sky with no noticeable vegetation standing â€” highlighting the completion or nearing completion of the harvest.\n\nThis image captures not only the mechanization of farming but also the arduous and coordinated effort required in agricultural pursuits, set against the expansive and seemingly endless fields that typify large-scale farming landscapes.","title":"Harvesting barley grown in the Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548981","548985","548976","548964","547432","549046","547730","548979","555619","554044","549036","554045","547734","548874","548820","557521"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["harvester","harvest","grain","completion","combine","trailer","farming","wheel","field","near"]}
