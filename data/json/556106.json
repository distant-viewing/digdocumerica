{"path":"556106.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic scene of a train journey. The perspective is from the side of the train, looking backward along the length of it as it rounds a bend in the tracks. On the right edge of the frame, part of a silver-gray train car is seen, detailed with rivets and components typical of a passenger train exterior.\n\nThe train itself is composed of several cars that trail along a curving track, surrounded by nature. Each car appears similar, painted white with windows lining the sides, reflecting a utilitarian design for passenger transport.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes dense green trees and vegetation, indicative of a temperate or mountainous region. The background reveals a mountain slope, underlining the train's passage through a mountainous area. The day seems overcast, casting soft light and creating a somewhat muted color palette throughout the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the train bending around the curve and the lush, natural environment, conveys a sense of movement and travel through a scenic, possibly remote area. The focus and motion blur suggest the movement of the train, adding a dynamic quality to the scene.","title":"Westbound Empire Builder winds around the edge of Glacier National Park after leaving the East Glacier Park, Montana station, enroute to Spokane, Washington. More and more people are returning to passenger trains for long distance leisure travel as rail service is modernized. Amtrak assumed responsibility for most such U.S. intercity service in 1971.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556111","556837","556759","556850","556009","549131","556029","557963","557966","557967","542986","555971","556003","556857","556120","545378"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["train","passenger","rivet","track","car","bend","movement","blur","journey","passage"]}
