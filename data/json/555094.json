{"path":"555094.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape heavily impacted by logging. The foreground features a close view of several large, charred logs, suggesting that this area may have also experienced a fire. The logs lie diagonally across the frame, drawing the eye up the hill they rest on. The terrain around these logs is littered with wood debris, smaller branches, and scattered rocks, indicative of clear-cutting activities.\n\nThe middle ground shows a steep slope that has been almost completely denuded of vegetation, marked by a few remaining dead tree trunks standing upright. These trees appear sparse and bare, underscoring the extensive removal of forest cover.\n\nIn the background, similar conditions are visible on an adjacent hill, displaying sparse tree cover and a significant amount of exposed soil. At the base of the hill, a narrow, winding road is partially visible, hinting at the access routes used for logging operations.\n\nFrom the angle and composition, the photograph captures a dramatic and sobering view of environmental disruption, focusing on the consequences of industrial activities in forest landscapes. The blue sky with a few clouds suggests it is a clear day, which starkly contrasts with the devastation seen on the ground.","title":"Three to five-year-old clearcut on a south facing slope with a steepness of 40 to 60 degrees in olympic national timberland Washington.
