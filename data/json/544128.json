{"path":"544128.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This is a close-up photograph of a person wearing a white hard hat that bears multiple labels, including \"MOBIL CHEMICAL,\" \"FLIPPO PIPELINE,\" \"PIPELINE TERMINAL,\" and \"MOUNT BELVIEU.\" The hard hat suggests that the individual is involved in some sort of industrial or construction work. The person has long, flowing dark hair that extends out from under the helmet. The expression on the person's face is somewhat serious and contemplative, with a piercing gaze slightly directed towards the viewer but not making direct eye contact.\n\nThe lighting is subdued and moody, casting shadows on the personâ€™s face which accentuates their features. The background is out of focus but appears to be a typical industrial setting with faded structures and equipment, enhancing the sense of this being an on-site work environment. The overall tone and composition of the photograph give it a dramatic and somewhat gritty aesthetic, typical of industrial documentary photography.","title":"Navajo miner","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["553610","544171","556599","547163","556391","554953","555816","553634","558312","542783","553618","556867","544835","544105","549632","556345"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["person","documentary","pierce","contact","hat","photography","bear","face","work","sort"]}
