{"path":"547662.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial waterfront scene, focusing prominently on large, black hoses or pipes resting on a worn, wooden pier. The hoses are coiled and looped around the pier in the foreground, leading viewer's gaze along their length towards the background. The surface of the pier shows signs of wear and weathering.\n\nIn the background, a wide expanse of water is visible along with various marine and industrial structures. There is a bridge in the far distance under a hazy sky, likely indicating a wide river or bay area. You can also see an operational crane and some moored boats, suggesting ongoing industrial or commercial activity. The overall mood of the scene hints at tough, utilitarian usage rather than leisure, reflecting a working waterfront subject to elements and heavy use. The color palette is somewhat muted with earthy tones, blues, and grays dominating, contributing to the industrial feel.","title":"Hoses for transferring oil from ship to shore on wharf at the north east petroleum tanker terminal at tiverton.
