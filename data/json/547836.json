{"path":"547836.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a sandy beach setting with several focal points. In the foreground, a prominent sign is displayed on three metal poles, somewhat worn and stained, reading \"WARNING - DANGER WALKING OR SWIMMING PROHIBITED WITHIN 75 FEET OF THIS STRUCTURE DEPT. OF PARKS\". The text on the sign has some graffiti and marks, suggesting age and exposure to the elements.\n\nBeyond the sign, the beach is strewn with assorted debris, including pieces of wood and other materials, possibly washed ashore. The beach appears somewhat deserted, wide, with a gentle slope leading to the water's edge where small waves are breaking.\n\nIn the background, a significant architectural structure, a large suspension bridge with two prominent towers and cables, spans across a wide body of water. The bridge's presence adds a dramatic backdrop to the otherwise serene beach scene.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with patches of blue showing through, indicating a fair weather day. The overall composition juxtaposes man-made warnings and natural coastal beauty with the industrial structure of the bridge, creating a scene that highlights human interaction with natural and engineered environments.","title":"Warning of polluted water at Staten Island beach verrazano-narrows bridge in background","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547828","542984","550280","558000","550276","547831","547867","546928","544617","545248","547607","543436","553861","543168","547973","554119"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["beach","bridge","suspension","sign","wash","warning","stain","graffito","assort","strewn"]}
