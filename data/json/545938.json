{"path":"545938.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rogers, Chuck","caption":"The photograph predominantly features a wide expanse of eroded land with distinct patterns of soil erosion. The center and bottom of the frame show a large, muddy area with multiple deep, curving channels where water has washed soil away, forming a textured surface marked by lighter and darker streaks of earth tones. This area is flanked by lush, green forested areas on both sides, indicating that the erosion may be confined to a clearing or a deliberately cleared section within a forest.\n\nIn the background beyond the trees, a calmer scene unfolds with what appears to be a small lake or pond bordered by more forestry. The water body reflects the sky above, suggesting a somewhat peaceful aspect in contrast to the foreground's raw erosion. Alongside the pond are small structures, possibly houses or outbuildings, on what appears to be a rural habitat integrating into this natural landscape. Above these structures, the environment opens up to a clearer view, possibly fields or low-density residential areas, interrupted by lines of trees and minor roads or paths. The overall topography and juxtaposition of heavy erosion versus managed land use provide insights into environmental challenges and land management issues in the area.","title":"Wash off from Chattahoochee River bank, a result of inadequate land and building controls","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["551231","555598","554547","542612","552994","549176","543767","542881","542825","547053","547098","549170","544751","553454","555594","547661"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["erosion","pond","land","soil","outbuilding","insight","interrupt","confine","unfold","forestry"]}
