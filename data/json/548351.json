{"path":"548351.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of the Statue of Liberty located on Liberty Island, in the expansive waters surrounding it. The statue is prominently positioned toward the front left of the island, visible with its iconic raised torch and robe.\n\nThe island itself is compact, featuring landscaped areas around the statue and a star-shaped fortification at its base, which is part of the pedestal's structure. Several pathways and low buildings can also be discerned on the island.\n\nAround Liberty Island, the water exhibits dynamic textures, suggesting movement, possibly due to boat traffic and currents. These patterns in the water create an interplay of light and shadow.\n\nIn the background, across the river, there are extensive views of industrial and dockyard areas with multiple warehouses, cranes, and docked ships, indicating a busy port area. The horizon shows a flat landscape, dotted with various buildings and infrastructure, typical of an urban industrial zone. The overall mood is one of grandeur and activity, accentuated by the vast, flowing waters and the imposing presence of the statue.","title":"Statue of Liberty, on Liberty Island, Upper Bay, New York Harbor","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548352","553862","555723","548349","549803","554351","555740","549760","554350","549761","548327","549790","549781","549763","554296","554359"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["statue","island","pedestal","robe","star","current","port","water","warehouse","grandeur"]}
