{"path":"548547.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling marina scene, likely captured during the daytime given the bright sunlight and clear skies. The marina is densely packed with a variety of boats, ranging in size, design, and color. Most of the boats appear to be fishing vessels, suggested by visible fishing gear and robust, functional designs.\n\nIn the foreground, a large pile of lobster traps adds to the working maritime atmosphere. The traps are stacked haphazardly, suggesting either recent use or preparation for use. To the right of these traps, the waterway is lined with docks, on which the boats are moored. The boats are closely spaced along these docks, pointing towards an active and possibly crowded marina environment.\n\nThe boats are mostly painted in subdued shades of white, blue, and green, colors typical for marine vessels as they help in reducing heat absorption and glare from the sun. Some of the boats have cabins and deck areas visible, equipped with necessary maritime instruments and gear.\n\nIn the background, more boats can be seen moored at similar docks, and a glimpse of a shoreline or a distant bank hosting buildings and greenery can be observed. The calmness of the water suggests a protected area, possibly a natural or man-made harbor, that provides a safe anchorage for the boats.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the stacked lobster traps in the foreground and the plethora of boats in midground and background, captures the essence of a busy, working marina set in a serene, coastal environment.","title":"Downtown boat docks","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["542871","552027","552028","548078","542912","548075","546877","542911","548228","557450","542902","546853","548546","546388","545155","556191"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["trap","boat","marina","dock","vessel","gear","fishing","glare","heat","use"]}
