{"path":"544578.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a vibrant pink thistle flower, which is circular and dense with spiky, filament-like petals. The flower is focusing the center of the image, and is perched atop a long, slender, green stem. A honeybee, visible in its detailed form—yellow and black striping, and delicate wings—is actively collecting nectar from the flower. The background is out of focus, presenting a bokeh effect with hues of green and spots of darker and lighter tones, likely other vegetation which creates a depth-field and draws more attention to the sharpness and color of the thistle and the bee. The natural lighting implies daylight, perhaps with sunlight filtering through surrounding foliage, enhancing the vividness and contrast of the flower against the softly blurred background.","title":"Flower","placename":"Austin, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Lake, Texas","nn1":["554841","554839","545691","551380","557545","545699","554112","543200","554842","544590","550462","554595","557487","554574","554840","554843"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","sharpness","stem","petal","wing","vividness","spot","daylight","form","effect"]}
