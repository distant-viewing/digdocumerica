{"path":"546129.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a nature scene featuring an open, grassy landscape under an overcast sky. The setting is characterized by dry, yellow grass covering the ground extensively. In the center of the image stands a prominent, solitary tree with a dense canopy, providing a focal point against the sprawling fields.\n\nScattered throughout the field are several large, dark-colored boulders, which upon closer inspection, appear to be grazing buffalo. Their dark shapes contrast with the lighter grass, adding a sense of life and wildness to the scene.\n\nThe background is dominated by gentle, rolling hills that rise gradually from the flat expanse. The hills, covered with sparse vegetation, create a textured backdrop that speaks of a rugged, natural environment. Weather conditions in the scene suggest a moody atmosphere, likely a cool or temperate climate, given the cloud-filled sky and the absence of vibrant sunlight.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its wide, open spaces and interspersed elements of wildlife and natural features, offers a view into a serene, undisturbed landscape where nature plays the leading role.","title":"Buffalo herd on Bell Ranch","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["549238","552903","550667","549156","548673","549186","547649","556990","549227","549229","551370","549218","550489","549142","549183","549132"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["wildness","inspection","field","boulder","hill","grass","absence","wildlife","role","climate"]}
