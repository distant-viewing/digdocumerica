{"path":"552571.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a man engaged in a rural activity, likely mending or working on a barbed wire fence. He is dressed practically for outdoor work, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, a long-sleeved light olive green shirt, and blue jeans. His attire suggests protection from both the sun and the physical nature of his work.\n\nThe man is shown in a bending posture, focusing intently on his hands as he handles the barbed wire using a specific tool, which seems to be used for tightening or securing the wire. His facial expression is concentrated and serious.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, in what appears to be a dry, mountainous area indicated by sparse vegetation and the visible hill slopes in the background under a clear blue sky. A rough wooden fence post, to which the barbed wire is attached, is visible next to the man. The terrain underfoot is rocky and uneven, typical of a rugged rural landscape.\n\nThis scene illustrates a moment of rural life, possibly on a ranch or in a farming area, where maintaining fences is a necessary part of land management. The photograph conveys a sense of isolation and the demanding physical nature of outdoor manual work.","title":"Fence mending at the oldlands' summer cow camp, 15 miles south of their piceance creek ranch.
