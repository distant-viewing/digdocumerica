{"path":"544638.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a high-angle view of a coastal cityscape aligning a long stretch of beach on one side, with a contrasting water body on the opposite side. The immediate foreground shows several high-rise buildings close to the shoreline, painted in light, neutral colors which stand out against the azure hues of the ocean. These buildings appear to be residential or possibly hotels, as some feature outdoor swimming pools, one notably in a clover shape and another rectangular adjacent to the beach.\n\nThe sandy beach is narrow and traces the edge of the water, curving gently out of view. Light waves brush the shore, creating frothy white accents against the wet sand. The city continues in a densely packed formation of similar high-rise buildings along the coastal road that curves away into the distance where the beach and built environment merge into a compressed view.\n\nSet directly behind this coastal development is an inland waterway, creating an island-like feel to the section of the city near the beach. Numerous smaller boats can be seen docked in the water below. Further inland is a more verdant area with what appears to be lower residential housing, interspersed with greenery, suggesting a quieter, possibly suburban neighborhood. The skyscape above presents a clear, sunny day, enhancing the vividness of the coastal and urban features. On the top right corner, a faint hint of other distant buildings suggests the spread of the cityscape beyond the immediate scope of the image.","title":"Hotel row along collins avenue","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["555756","553671","555757","551587","553672","553679","557463","553675","553790","553677","553748","547640","554143","553678","547173","543427"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["beach","cityscape","scope","curve","hotel","brush","trace","swimming","city","rise"]}
