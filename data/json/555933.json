{"path":"555933.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph depicts a view from a bridge, framed by a complex network of dark metal trusses. The intricate geometric framework of steel beams, characterizing typical bridge construction, occupies most of the image, creating a kind of tunnel vision effect that guides the viewerâ€™s gaze forward. Through this lattice, a silhouette of a cityscape is visible in the background under a cloudy sky. Notably, the Empire State Building stands out among the other high-rise buildings due to its distinctive architectural form and prominence.\n\nOn the bridge itself, a wooden or metal paneled roadway can be seen, on which several cars are traveling. The scene captures vehicles in motion; indicative of typical urban traffic. The silhouettes of the cars suggest models from around the mid-20th century, complementing the vintage feel of the photo. The overall color tone is somewhat muted, with a palette leaning towards bluish and purple hues, possibly due to the time of day or the type of film used in the camera.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its strong lines of the bridge intersecting and the distant city skyline, creates a dynamic juxtaposition between industrial engineering and urban architecture. The image not only captures an everyday moment of city transit but also subtly emphasizes themes of connection and transition, framed through the lens of structural and architectural beauty.","title":"Williamsburg Bridge in New York City facing towards Manhattan. This is one of the great bridges that connect Brooklyn and Manhattan. Other coverage of this project shows the traffic and the need and use for living space and beauty. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers and tract homes blacks, Latins and poor whites live there.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555751","546865","555937","549878","549857","555725","549861","548418","550955","550066","555733","550186","555898","548207","548414","552064"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","lattice","tunnel","truss","silhouette","prominence","lens","city","kind","engineering"]}
