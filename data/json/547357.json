{"path":"547357.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive aerial view of a rural landscape, predominantly characterized by agriculture. The image features large fields showing different states of crop cultivation and color variations ranging from dark earthy browns to lush greens.\n\nCentral to the composition is a small white church with a prominent steeple, positioned near the intersection of two roads. Adjacent to the church, there are several small buildings which could possibly serve residential or farm-related purposes. The area around these buildings is more greener and landscaped compared to the broader agricultural surroundings.\n\nThe roads define the layout of the area, intersecting at right angles and creating a grid that segments the fields. Each segment showcases different phases of agricultural development or types of crops. Additionally, there are spots of water bodies visible in the scenery, enhancing the diverse texture and color scheme of the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition provides a serene yet structured depiction of rural life, emphasizing agriculture and the small community, likely centered around the church. It offers a snapshot of how land is meticulously used for farming, while also highlighting a small enclave of buildings that serve as a focal point of this vast agricultural backdrop.","title":"Characteristic arrow-straight roads cut through farmlands on the Seward-Saline county line.
