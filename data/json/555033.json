{"path":"555033.jpg","date":"July 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a delicate, pale yellow flower with five narrow petals that radiate evenly from the center. Each petal displays a faint central vein, and the center of the flower shows darker yellow pollen or stamens. The background of the image is soft and blurred with deep greens, blues, and some touches of white light, creating a dreamy and tranquil atmosphere. On the left side of the frame, partially visible and out of focus, is a dark stem with small, dark red bulb-like structures, possibly buds or fruits, which add a slight contrast to the subdued tones of the background. The overall composition emphasizes the simplicity and beauty of the flower, using a shallow depth of field to isolate it from its surroundings and draw the viewerâ€™s attention directly to its delicate details.","title":"Flowers growing in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555035","545699","551368","554580","544875","545706","545695","555034","555189","543623","550462","554840","557487","549230","554586","551369"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["petal","flower","delicate","stamen","dreamy","fruit","bulb","radiate","bud","vein"]}
