{"path":"546103.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive industrial scene featuring a large factory complex located next to a body of water that extends into the background, leading into a distant horizon. The factory consists of various structures including tall cylindrical storage silos, multiple buildings of assorted sizes, and an array of pipes and machinery. Smoke can be seen emitting from a tall stack within the facility, suggesting ongoing industrial processes.\n\nIn the foreground, the area around the factory is somewhat barren and largely covered in sand or dirt, with several pieces of industrial equipment and vehicles scattered around. These include tanks, small buildings presumably for storage or operations, and several pipelines running throughout the site.\n\nAdjacent to the factory, there is a sizable water body that reflects the gray skies above. This water body is bordered by what appear to be containment or partition structures that segment the water into different areas. Behind the factory, the landscape opens up to show vast, open flat lands that extend to the horizon, colored in shades of beige and light brown, indicating arid or semi-arid terrain.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a busy, functional industrial facility located in a remote, sparse environment, emphasizing a stark contrast between industrial activity and the natural landscape surrounding it.","title":"Olin-Mathieson plant beside the Calcasieu River","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["546080","551994","546005","546087","548070","549508","551998","544573","550724","544788","551576","546083","552179","544179","550868","555776"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["factory","locate","containment","partition","storage","pipeline","facility","body","beige","silo"]}
