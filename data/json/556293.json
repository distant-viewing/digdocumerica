{"path":"556293.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and joyful scene at a body of water, likely a beach or a shallow lake. In the foreground, a woman with a big smile is interacting affectionately with a small child she is holding in her arms. The woman, who has dark hair styled in a large afro, is wearing a light blue and white patterned top. She is standing waist-deep in the water.\n\nThe child, appearing to be an infant, is dressed in a light outfit, receiving the woman's attention and seemingly enjoying the moment. To the right, another woman, who has wet hair and is smiling broadly, is also standing in the water and seems to be moving towards or away from the central pair.\n\nIn the background, other individuals are partially visible, engaged in various activities in the water, further emphasizing the communal and recreational nature of the setting. The lighting hints that it might be late afternoon or early evening, considering the vivid blue of the water and the warm tones cast by the sunlight.\n\nThe overall mood of the scene is one of warmth and community, highlighting a moment of shared enjoyment and relaxation in the water.","title":"Blacks and whites take to the water at a 12th street beach on lake Michigan on Chicago's south side during the summer of 1973 from 1960 to 1970 the percentage of Chicago blacks with an income of $7,000 or more jumped from 26 to 58%.
