{"path":"554650.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a panoramic view of a vast mountainous landscape under a clear sky. In the foreground and running into the midground, a dense forest with predominantly dark green hues covers rolling mountain ridges. On a prominent ridge in the lower third of the image stands a white, castle-like tower, possibly an observatory or historic landmark, contrasting sharply against the dark forest.\n\nFurther beyond, the landscape consists of layer upon layer of mountain ranges stretching into the horizon. These successive ridges create a gradient effect, transitioning from darker to lighter shades of blue and gray as they recede into the distance, adding a sense of immense depth to the scene. There is a faint mist or haze that softens the outlines of the distant mountains, enhancing the atmospheric perspective.\n\nCaptured in seemingly late afternoon light, the overall tone of the photograph is cool, with soft lighting likely attributable to the time of day when the sun is not directly illuminating the landscape, resulting in a tranquil and serene atmosphere. The sky occupies the upper quarter of the image and is a uniform light blue, devoid of clouds, which further emphasizes the vast and unobstructed view of the natural scenery.","title":"Fire and radar towers atop Blue Mountain, with a range of high peaks beyond, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554402","542923","543023","546764","554398","554634","553825","555378","542843","548025","555130","550604","552695","554962","550401","555681"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["ridge","mountain","quarter","layer","forest","third","landmark","midground","scenery","outline"]}
