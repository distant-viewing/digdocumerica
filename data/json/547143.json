{"path":"547143.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic coastal or lakeside scene at either sunrise or sunset. The sun, low in the sky, creates a silhouette effect and infuses the scene with warm hues, predominantly deep orange and shadowy blue tones.\n\nThe foreground prominently features a rugged wooden guardrail, partially angled into the frame and glistening with moisture, possibly splashed by the waves. This rail runs parallel to the choppy, dark water on its right, hinting at a pathway or boardwalk that is partially submerged or very close to the water level, as evidenced by water splashing onto the surface.\n\nThe water itself is turbulent and lively, with waves capped in white indicating strong winds or currents. Light gleams off the peaks and troughs of the waves, enhancing the texture and motion of the water.\n\nIn the distance, a long pier or breakwater stretches into the water, drawing the eye toward the horizon. This structure is lined with evenly spaced posts and topped with what appears to be a small light or beacon at the furthest visible point. The sun aligns with this structure, suggesting a linear perspective that adds depth to the composition.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is moody and dynamic, capturing a moment of natural beauty and the raw power of the water environment. The absence of people in the visible areas contributes to a sense of solitude and the overwhelming presence of nature in this scene.","title":"Gale force winds drive waves against the seawall in Michigan City","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547091","542993","547483","553852","543060","542808","543138","542890","544985","547044","557508","545030","553989","557510","545000","543025"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["wave","splash","water","boardwalk","trough","infuse","breakwater","sun","guardrail","gleam"]}
