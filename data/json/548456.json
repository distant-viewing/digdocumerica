{"path":"548456.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph shows an elderly man standing in a dimly lit basement. He is partially illuminated by artificial light, likely from above or off to the side. The man is looking upwards with a somewhat contemplative or curious expression. He is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeved, polka-dot shirt and appears to be in a space with low ceilings.\n\nThe man is holding onto a thick, vertical pipe that runs from the floor to the ceiling, suggesting the area might be related to utilities or maintenance. The background is dark and mostly obscured due to the lighting, but it shows the rough, unfinished architecture typical of a basement, with exposed beams and ductwork overhead.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is somewhat moody or nostalgic, emphasized by the vintage quality of the image and the solitary figure of the man in this utilitarian environment.","title":"Bernard Picarello touches the steel beam he installed in 1967 when the original 8x8 wooden beam (shown behind him) began to crack. The Picarello home at 112 Moore Street is directly under a Logan Airport flight path. Mr. Picarello believes aircraft vibration caused the damage.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["547427","553516","548458","552104","556398","557892","557393","554945","553030","548455","556569","557648","555332","545986","555532","544365"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["ceiling","man","dot","pipe","beam","maintenance","utility","floor","figure","architecture"]}
