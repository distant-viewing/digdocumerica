{"path":"551027.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an intimate, outdoor scene featuring a family consisting of two adults and a child. The setting appears to be a park with a grassy area, where other people can also be seen relaxing in the background.\n\nAt the forefront, there is a woman seated on the grass wearing a white tank top with a colorful design and dark-colored pants. She looks intensely towards something outside of the frame, exhibiting a focused or concerned expression. Next to her, a man is reclining casually, resting his head on his arm. He is wearing glasses, a black tank top, and khaki-colored pants. His posture and facial expression suggest relaxation or contemplation. \n\nIn between the two adults, a small child, who appears distracted or busy, stands with back facing the camera. The child, slightly turned towards the woman, wears a light-colored, patterned shirt.\n\nThe background features a softly focused crowd of other park visitors, which adds a sense of community and general public life to the scene. The grassy setting suggests a leisurely day out, possibly during spring or summer, given the attire and activewear of the people around. Overall, the composition and the expressions capture a moment of family interaction and surrounding social activity in a public space.","title":"West Virginia celebrated its 100th birthday in 1973 with rock concerts on the steps of the state capitol.
