{"path":"549617.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a segment of a large, red-hulled ship with a man leaning out of a small, open porthole. He is wearing an orange lifejacket over a white shirt and appears to be engaged in some kind of activity or conversation, not immediately visible. His hair is noticeably windblown, suggesting a breezy environment. Below the porthole, three black cords, likely part of the ship's utilities, drape vertically and are secured to the ship's side.\n\nOn the upper portion of the image, parts of the shipâ€™s deck and equipment are visible, including a section of white railing, light fixtures, and another open porthole through which a different individual is partially visible. Rigging elements and a mast appear in the distant background, indicative of a large sea vessel. The weather appears overcast, contributing to the ambient soft light, and enhancing the rich red hue of the ship's exterior. The composition captures a moment of maritime activity, presenting a close-up perspective of life aboard a large vessel.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in Lake Superior.
