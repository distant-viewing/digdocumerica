{"path":"554480.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic outdoor camping site nestled amidst a lush green landscape. The terrain is a mix of sloping meadows and flat grassy areas dotted with numerous picnic tables. In the foreground, on the left, there's a small tented structure and a few propane tanks near a couple of trailers which suggest the area is equipped for staying visitors. A lone flag flies atop a flagpole, infusing a hint of patriotism into the scene.\n\nFurther back, closer to the center and right of the image, there is a large, green-roofed building which could serve a communal purpose, possibly a mess hall or gathering area for campers. Beside it, to the right, are parked several trailers in varying sizes and designs, indicating a well-visited site. The trailers are interspersed with sporadic structures, likely additional amenities or utility sheds.\n\nThe backdrop is dominated by a dense, forested hill that stretches across the horizon, providing a tranquil and secluded environment. Above, the sky is overcast with grey clouds, suggesting an imminent or recent rainfall, which adds a fresh dampness to the verdure.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of this photograph depict a peaceful, rustic camping setting, ideal for outdoor activities and relaxation amidst nature.","title":"Campground and trailer site beside moose river at mckeever New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, formerly was a logging area for paper mills","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548796","544436","557514","549450","552898","544855","548748","543599","542746","554181","548797","545293","548795","553899","545160","544449"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["trailer","camping","dampness","patriotism","infuse","stay","flagpole","camper","site","amenity"]}
