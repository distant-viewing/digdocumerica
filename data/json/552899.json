{"path":"552899.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph presents a tranquil and simple scene that is composed of three horizontal layers. The foreground features a dark, seemingly flat landscape that could possibly be a body of water or a plain, rendered in silhouette against a lighter background, thereby obscuring any specific details. The middle section captures a range of mountains or hills, also in silhouette, showing undulating peaks and valleys which smoothly rise and fall to create a gentle, rhythmic profile against the sky.\n\nThe sky itself forms the final and topmost layer of the image. It transitions from a rich, deep shade at the uppermost portion to a lighter, more luminescent band of yellow and pale green just above the mountains, suggesting either dawn or dusk. This play of natural light adds a serene and contemplative mood to the overall setting.\n\nThe entire composition relies heavily on silhouetted forms and the soothing gradation of twilight colors, evoking a sense of peace and natural beauty. There are no visible signs of human presence or activity, which enhances the feeling of untouched wilderness. The simplicity and the large, uncluttered expanses of color in the photograph contribute to its calming and picturesque quality.","title":"Looking across Pyramid Lake to the Lake Range at sunset","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["554398","557000","557519","552906","542994","544070","550646","556587","552520","549446","557558","552336","554402","543023","542681","557182"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["layer","silhouette","gradation","peace","mountain","band","profile","twilight","simplicity","play"]}
