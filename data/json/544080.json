{"path":"544080.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts an old, cracked asphalt road that stretches into the distance through a rugged landscape. This abandoned road is surrounded by arid terrain with sparse vegetation and small bush plants. Notably, a bush with white flowers grows directly on the asphalt near the foreground, highlighting natureâ€™s reclaim over the man-made surface. In the distance, we can see rolling hills and mountains under a clear, blue sky, which suggests a remote or rural area. There are utility poles lining one side of the road, hinting at a once-established route. The surrounding vegetation is dry and predominantly consists of desert shrubs and wild grass, which are golden-yellow in color, reflecting a hot and dry climate typical of such environments. The overall composition of the photograph, with the road leading toward mountains under vast skies, evokes a sense of desolation and the relentless passage of time.","title":"Nature bursts through the pavement of an abandoned road new road lies to the right","placename":"Patagonia (Ariz.)","location":"Patagonia, Arizona","nn1":["544178","554802","544043","555613","545886","556615","554131","547653","555597","554154","545604","554127","545341","556313","549013","557468"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["asphalt","road","bush","reclaim","mountain","establish","shrubs","crack","flowers","route"]}
