{"path":"545490.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on an outdoor basketball court, set against the backdrop of a large brick school building which is visible in the background. The court appears somewhat neglected, with debris and a pile of trash prominently in the foreground. This trash includes various discarded items such as cans, bottles, and paper, which are scattered around and overflowing from a metal trash basket.\n\nIn the middle distance, four individuals are engaged in a game of basketball. They are young, casually dressed African American males. One of the players is in the act of shooting a basketball towards a hoop fixed with a white backboard. This hoop stands out as being well-maintained in contrast to the surrounding disrepair. The other players are attentively watching the shot, standing ready on the court which is marked with typical basketball lines.\n\nThe atmosphere conveys a stark juxtaposition between the youthful energy of the basketball players and the neglected condition of their surroundings. The school in the background has an institutional look, suggestive of a public education facility, with large windows and multiple stories. The grass around the building appears overgrown, adding to the overall sense of lackluster maintenance. The sky is overcast, casting a dull light over the scene, which contributes to the gritty realism of the image.","title":"Corner of this Birmingham school playground doubles as dump/incinerator","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["556162","551031","552011","546523","551128","546527","555935","550249","556166","556159","553096","556431","552755","545404","552750","552969"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["basketball","player","hoop","trash","school","realism","education","overflow","fix","basket"]}
