{"path":"552497.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features a quaint domestic scene on a covered porch. On the left side, an antique-looking black cauldron filled with various items including fireplace logs, kindling, and potted plants, is set on the ground. To the right of the cauldron, there is a rack holding several croquet mallets and balls, suggesting recreational activities. The center of the image is dominated by a wooden chair with a woven seat, which appears weathered, adding a rustic charm to the setting. On the porch floor near the chair, a few chunks of split wood are scattered around, possibly used for the fireplace inside. The background showcases the porch's wooden architecture with painted white walls and trim, aged by weather, and large windows reflecting the greenery outside, which creates a peaceful, serene ambiance. The entire scene is framed by the porch's roof, casting shadows and giving a cozy, shaded area to the porch space.","title":"Home of artist-sculptor Nick Vergette is near Carbondale where he teaches at Southern Illinois University.","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["552489","557672","543347","555580","547792","556488","557761","555581","557646","547808","558102","543314","557633","557756","557676","557360"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["porch","chair","chunk","ball","rack","weather","charm","trim","log","floor"]}
