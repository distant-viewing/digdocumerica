{"path":"556937.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a verdant landscape, predominantly featuring a mixture of dense forest areas and some cleared land. The image captures a striking contrast between neat patches of agricultural activity or clearings and the lush, surrounding forest.\n\nIn the forefront, there's a stretch of road that vertically bisects the image, lined with occasional structures such as houses or small industrial buildings, which indicates a human settlement or a small community. Alongside the road, smaller pathways or dirt roads branch off, weaving into the dense woods and adjacent clearings.\n\nFurther back, the terrain opens up to larger fields that suggest agricultural use, edged by expansive woods. This area progressively transitions into more rugged, wild terrain with patches of forest and fewer clearings.\n\nThe background of the image showcases an impressive vista of a wide bay or lake leading into a mountain range on the horizon, suggesting a coastal or lakefront region. The body of water gleams under the influence of the sunlight, enhancing the serene and natural beauty of the location.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—from the populated, managed areas in the foreground to the remote, scenic backgrounds—describes a tranquil environment where natural landscapes dominate and human habitation merges modestly with its surroundings.","title":"Aerial view looking southwest across clear creek road and the southern area of the navy's Bangor annex.  It is in this area that much of the proposed construction for training, administration and housing is to take place for the trident submarine base.  The hood canal and the olympic mountains are seen in the background construction will take several years.
