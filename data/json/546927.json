{"path":"546927.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a derelict scene with multiple old buses in various states of disrepair. There are three buses prominently visible in a line, parked on a muddy and rough terrain filled with debris and dirt. The buses are primarily olive green and white in color, showing signs of aging and weathering such as rust and faded paint.\n\nIn the forefront of the image is a significant body of still water, possibly a small pond, reflecting the image of the buses and contributing to a sense of desolation in the scene. The reflection is clear and adds a symmetrical element to the composition.\n\nThe background is sparse with no signs of active human presence or operational structures, emphasizing the abandonment of the area. The sky is visible at the top portion of the image, suggesting that it is a clear day.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements in the photo convey a mood of neglect and decay, depicting what might be a vehicle scrapyard or a similarly forgotten space where these buses have come to rest.","title":"Erosion of the bank may cause these old buses to fall into gwynns falls, just a few hundred yards from the gwynns falls entrance into Baltimore harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["552505","552073","546816","544060","555849","555870","546173","555851","555850","542590","547024","544193","545340","547152","543680","547587"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bus","derelict","scrapyard","muddy","a","desolation","pond","disrepair","fad","weathere"]}
