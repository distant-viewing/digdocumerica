{"path":"555431.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic night-time scene of a busy highway captured with a long exposure technique. The highway is bending gently to the left and is composed of several lanes. The technique used causes the moving vehicle lights to appear as vibrant, streaking lines of light. The white lights, indicative of headlights, dominate the lanes moving towards the left, while the red lights, from taillights, appear on the right side of the lanes bending with the road. \n\nThe light streaks create a radiant contrast against the dark background of the night. The roadway itself shows the texture of the asphalt, with visible lane markings that are intermittently illuminated by the passing vehicles. The surroundings are dark, which suggests that the photograph was taken from an elevated position, potentially an overpass or a bridge, focusing solely on capturing the motion of traffic at night without any distractions from the environment around the roadway. The absence of visible infrastructure other than the road and the lights also emphasizes the movement and flow of traffic.","title":"Stadium freeway in Portland, is shown in November, 1973, as it looked without street lighting. Only car lights were in evidence since freeway and major street lighting were banned by the governor's executive order during the energy crisis.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["546586","554360","546739","545352","546644","551239","546591","553894","546610","555418","546629","546747","549902","547168","547051","546571"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["lane","night","technique","roadway","highway","traffic","light","distraction","overpass","streak"]}
