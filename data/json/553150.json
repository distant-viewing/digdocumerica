{"path":"553150.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a young boy sitting outdoors enjoying a snack. He is seated on what appears to be a low wall or bench. The boy has short hair and is dressed in a hooded, dark green jacket over a collared shirt and gray trousers. He is in the process of eating, holding a chip to his mouth with his left hand, while his right hand is resting on a small stack of chips. Beside him, there is an open can of Coca-Cola and a paper bag, presumably containing more snacks.\n\nThe background provides an urban setting, suggested by the presence of tall buildings with numerous vertical lines and windows. The view is slightly out of focus, emphasizing the subject in the foreground. The general ambiance is that of a busy city environment, possibly during a lunch break or a casual outing. The lighting in the image is soft and natural, coming from an overcast sky, which adds a calm tone to the scene. The photograph captures a moment of simple urban life, highlighting a personal and relatable experience of enjoying food in the middle of a cityscape.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: lunching in front of du bois tower","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551461","553168","553553","553221","556558","551762","543871","556316","553211","551693","551458","555950","558183","556213","556163","545319"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["snack","chip","boy","lunch","enjoy","eat","collar","mouth","outing","can"]}
