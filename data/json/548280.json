{"path":"548280.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene, showing a solitary figure squatting on the white sandy shore. The person, a girl with long dark brown hair, is facing the camera but focused on something in her hands, possibly a shell or small object from the beach. She is wearing a dark outfit that contrasts with the bright, pristine sand around her.\n\nThe beach itself stretches into the distance, curving slightly. The sand is remarkably white, suggesting a pristine coastal environment. The ocean appears serene, displaying a gradient of blues that stretch to the horizon under a clear sky. A gentle surf can be seen lapping the shoreline.\n\nIn the background, there is a row of modest buildings or beach houses atop a grass-covered dune, separated from the sandy beach where the girl is by a slight incline. The presence of these structures indicates that this is a populated coastline, though no other individuals are visible in the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is tranquil and beautiful, highlighted by the vivid colors and simplicity of the scene. The lack of visible activity other than the girlâ€™s exploration of the sand lends a quiet, contemplative quality to the image.","title":"Beach at Destin, on the Gulf of Mexico","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547612","557507","546953","545280","547600","555402","543493","543089","548698","547596","543225","547608","547607","548706","548088","554121"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","girl","sand","surf","incline","squat","dune","shell","stretch","lap"]}
