{"path":"546784.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense cluster of dead fish seen from a close perspective. The fish, appearing predominantly silver with hints of darker shading, are tightly packed within the frame, covering the entirety of the image area. The arrangement of the fish is haphazard, with many facing different directions, suggesting a mass die-off or the aftermath of a fishing activity. Their scales glisten, reflecting light which adds a metallic sheen to their bodies. There are also visible debris and detritus intermingled with the fish, including bits of vegetation and possibly some rubbish, indicating the fish could be lying on a shore or a similar environment where land meets water. Overall, the image conveys a sense of abundance and possibly decay, typical of such natural or man-made events.","title":"Dead fish on the shore of Middle Branch, near Port Covington in Baltimore Harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546792","546846","547704","546782","555560","545063","546930","548142","547687","542892","553878","546898","546779","550878","546185","542985"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["fish","off","detritus","entirety","rubbish","abundance","mass","sheen","aftermath","bit"]}
