{"path":"546996.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a rural agricultural setting where a man is plowing a field with the aid of a horse. The man, dressed in a long-sleeve shirt and pants, holds onto the plow handles, guiding the horse as it pulls the plow through the soil. The horse, appearing sturdy and well-built, is mostly covered in a brownish color.\n\nIn the foreground, rows of a crop with broad leaves dominate the lower edge of the photograph, leading to the middle ground where the man and his horse are actively engaged in their work. The background features lush green trees, and a hint of a rustic environment is visible with a scattering of rural structures and possibly other farm-related equipment.\n\nThe setting is serene, underlined by a clear sky and the natural surroundings, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a bright sunny day, casting natural light that saturates the scene with warm hues. The composition effectively conveys a sense of traditional farming life, showcasing manual labor and the close relationship between humans and animals in agricultural practices.","title":"A local farmer, on st.
