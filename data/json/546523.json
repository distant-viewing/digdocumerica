{"path":"546523.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph presents a striking yet simple composition featuring four basketballs resting on a metal grate on what appears to be an outdoor court. The texture of the ground suggests it might be a rough asphalt surface, possibly wet as indicated by the slightly shiny quality. The basketballs are closely grouped together, prominently in the foreground of the image, creating a focal point.\n\nIn the background, a large, architecturally modern building with a slightly brutalist aesthetic dominates the scene. It features a series of repeated geometric shapes and structures, highly textural with angular protrusions and a series of windows or openings along its upper part. The color of the building is a neutral gray, matching an overcast sky which might suggest a dull or chilly day.\n\nTo the left side of the frame, a solitary figure, small in scale compared to the building, is captured walking towards the entrance of this structure. This person adds a human element to the otherwise still and somewhat austere environment. The overall mood conveyed by the setting and overcast lighting conditions seems somewhat desolate or quiet, highlighting the sense of isolation or abandonment, with the basketballs and the lone figure interrupting this silence.","title":"Southside junior high school; basketballs in foreground","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["545490","556162","552011","551031","546527","555935","551128","546537","546531","553314","546506","546515","553537","549317","546519","552724"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["basketball","austere","protrusion","series","repeat","otherwise","interrupt","figure","asphalt","shiny"]}
