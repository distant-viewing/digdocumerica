{"path":"545787.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph presents a dramatic and expansive landscape presumably taken in a rugged desert region, possibly in the American Southwest. The view is captured from a high vantage point, providing a broad overview of towering cliffs and deep canyons. The terrain is characterized by large, majestic mesas and buttes, typical of eroded plateau regions.\n\nCentral to the composition is a winding river, visible in the mid to distant part of the frame, that gracefully snakes through the landscape, enhancing the sense of vastness and desolation. The river's sharp meander through the valley contrasts with the verticality of the cliff edges and mesas.\n\nThe overall color tone is quite dark with shades of green and blue, giving an eerie or perhaps early twilight feel to the scene. The atmosphere appears a bit hazy, which might suggest dust in the air or a distant mist, common in arid, desert environments. This haziness creates layers of depth in the landscape, progressively fading from clear and detailed in the foreground to softer and bluer in the distance.\n\nNo human presence or man-made structures are evident in the scene, accentuating its natural and untouched appearance. The sense of scale and wilderness is overwhelming, inviting contemplation of natural processes and geological time that have shaped such a landscape. The high cliffs and steep canyon walls stand as silent witnesses to erosion and other natural elements defining the features over countless years.","title":"Dead Horse State Park and the gorge of the Colorado River showing the spectacular cliff and mesa topography that give the region its distinctive character.","placename":"Dead Horse Point State Park (Utah)","location":"Dead Horse Point State Park, Utah","nn1":["545800","545783","545633","545629","544748","544950","545798","545796","544745","543977","545632","545799","545636","545765","544393","545790"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["mesa","cliff","canyon","desert","butte","plateau","verticality","region","overview","year"]}
