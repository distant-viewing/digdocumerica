{"path":"542898.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image captures a yellow railroad caboose with the inscription \"California Western\" in bold, black letters along its side, bearing the number \"10\" near its front edge. The caboose is characterized by its narrow vertical windows and an upper structure that may serve as a lookout or crew quarters, complete with its own small set of windows surrounding it. A metal chimney protrudes from the roof of this upper portion, indicating interior heating or cooking facilities.\n\nThe caboose is situated on railway tracks, suggesting it might still be in use or perhaps preserved as a historic piece. The vehicle's overall condition appears somewhat aged, evident from the weathering of the paint and visible metal elements. Adjacent to the caboose is a red building, possibly a train depot or related railway structure, enhancing the historical ambiance of the setting.\n\nThe background includes a glimpse of the sky, casting a soft glow that indicates either early morning or late afternoon light, adding a serene, almost nostalgic quality to the scene. The overall impression is that of a preserved segment of railway history, potentially an attraction for enthusiasts and tourists interested in vintage rail transport or industrial heritage.","title":"Yellow caboose, California Western Railroad","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542899","556857","552604","556053","557944","556782","556022","556058","556040","556784","555986","548536","557187","556120","556124","556038"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","preserve","depot","quarter","heating","cooking","inscription","enthusiast","heritage","attraction"]}
