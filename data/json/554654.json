{"path":"554654.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene featuring two seaplanes moored at a calm lake. The scene is bathed in bright sunlight under a clear, deep blue sky. In the foreground, the left side of the image displays the wing of a seaplane with a vivid yellow and white color pattern, with registration numbers visible on the side, reading \"25L\". Adjacent to it to the right, there's another seaplane painted in a red and white scheme with \"N113AC\" marked on its body.\n\nThe lake itself is calm, reflecting the sky and surrounding colors with slight ripples, suggesting a gentle breeze. This setting is framed by a dense, autumn-colored forest that lines the far shore, indicating the season might be fall. The trees are a mix of greens and various shades of autumn reds and oranges.\n\nIn the distance, along the lakeâ€™s edge, several structures (possibly homes or lodges) partially visible and nestled among the trees suggest a peaceful, residential area. The distant hills roll gently and are similarly covered with dense, colorful woodland, enhancing the quaint and tranquil vibe of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a picturesque moment that combines elements of nature, aviation, and tranquility.","title":"Seaplanes moored at long lake, are used by bush pilots to fly fisherman, hunters and campers to destinations as well as fly fire patrols and search and rescue in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554487","554656","551219","556909","554714","554635","543579","543547","554651","557562","550579","556928","554758","554757","554750","554648"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["lake","autumn","aviation","registration","covered","orang","wing","quaint","breeze","scheme"]}
