{"path":"547864.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features two adults engaged in birdwatching activities in an outdoor setting that appears to be a grassy and somewhat barren landscape. On the left, there is a woman who wears a dark jacket over a light-colored shirt, jeans, and carries a book titled \"Birds\", which she is reading. She has curly hair and a focused expression on her face, possibly indicating her involvement in identifying a bird.\n\nTo her right, a man is using a pair of binoculars to look into the distance. He is dressed in a dark blue jacket and jeans. His hair is also curly, and he seems intently focused on whatever he is viewing through the binoculars.\n\nIn front of them stands a gray tripod-mounted spotting scope, pointing towards the direction the man is looking. The presence of birdwatching gear such as the binoculars, book, and spotting scope suggests that they are serious about their activity.\n\nThe background is simple and mostly uniform, indicative of a wide, open field or a marsh-like area, with a faint outline of trees or bushes on the horizon. The sky is overcast, suggesting it might be a cool or damp day. The overall vibe is one of quiet concentration and engagement with nature through birdwatching.","title":"Bird-watching at the Jamaica bay wildlife refuge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547853","547849","557179","546835","547124","546312","553592","543238","556992","548873","558108","556991","544838","546300","543236","546345"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["binocular","scope","book","bird","tripod","jeans","title","jacket","marsh","faint"]}
