{"path":"549044.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene where a group of people are engaged in gathering onions that are spread across the ground in a large pile. The background of the photograph shows a flat, arid landscape with a few low mountains or hills in the distance under a clear blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, there are three individuals focused on the onions. The most prominent person is a woman on the right side of the photo. She is wearing a headscarf, long sleeves, pants, and is bending over as she places onions into a metal bucket. To her left and slightly in the background, a young child dressed in striped clothing is visible standing among the onions. On the left side of the frame, another person, appearing older and possibly male, is kneeling and placing onions into a large container (possibly a bag or basket). He is wearing a red striped shirt, jeans, and sports shoes.\n\nThe ground is covered with a thick layer of onions and pieces of dry, broken soil, indicating that the onions may have recently been harvested. There also appears to be some agricultural residue, such as dry plant stems, scattered around the onions. This setting suggests a farming activity, likely part of a harvest process in a rural or agricultural environment.","title":"Industrious scavengers find that many of the onions discarded by a processing plant are fine for the pot.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549049","549050","544010","543324","543845","546964","549084","549079","549048","557478","553659","554047","543480","554108","558245","544265"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["harvest","residue","headscarf","basket","person","male","farming","bucket","shoe","sport"]}
