{"path":"545915.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet industrious scene by a calm lake under a clear sky. In the image, a man wearing a white sleeveless shirt and jeans is seen carrying a white bucket. His attention is directed away from the camera, towards the lake or another activity out of frame. He appears to be engaged in some kind of manual labor, possibly related to the collection or storage of materials, suggested by the multiple buckets and containers around him.\n\nThe foreground of the picture shows a rugged terrain near the water's edge, scattered with various containers, some of which have transparent liquid in them. To his left, there is a pontoon-like structure built with wooden planks, seemingly serving as a makeshift pier or platform. On this platform, numerous metal and plastic barrels are neatly organized in rows, ready for transport or processing.\n\nThe lake itself is vast and tranquil, reflecting the hazy blue sky and distant mountains, which form a soft, undulating backdrop. The tranquility of the water contrasts with the industrial activity onshore, suggesting a juxtaposition of natural beauty and human endeavor. There are faint structures visible in the distance across the lake, possibly indicating remote buildings or industrial installations. \n\nThe entire scene is bathed in the soft light of either early morning or late afternoon, emphasizing the quietude and the expansive view. The colors are rich yet muted, dominated by blues, browns, and the rusty reds of the dirt and barrels, which adds a vintage or timeless quality to the photograph.","title":"Truckee river","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["545922","545936","552139","552040","550268","545926","545940","545932","556504","554546","551118","543818","553082","544266","548034","550937"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["lake","platform","container","barrels","buckets","quietude","barrel","installation","liquid","endeavor"]}
