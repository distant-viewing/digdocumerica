{"path":"545842.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This image appears to capture an aerial view of a rural landscape showing various elements, structured into a vivid composition of land use and natural terrain. Most prominent is a large area of exposed earth, possibly indicating either severe soil erosion or land being excavated or prepared for agricultural or building purposes. This patch of land is marked by deep grooves and patterned ridges, which vividly highlight the possibly disrupted soil structure.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a narrow road, snaking along the side of the landscape. Alongside the road, a farmhouse and its associated buildings are visible, presenting a typical rural homestead with a few structures clustered together, surrounded by fields and patches of green spaces. The presence of dense and sporadic tree growth around the house suggests a managed but relatively natural landscape setting.\n\nThe surrounding area of the image shows cultivated fields—whether these are crops or pasture is not entirely clear from the picture—bordered by tree lines, which act as windbreakers or property demarcations. There are also scattered trees throughout the visible terrain, providing a patchwork appearance with patches of natural vegetation breaking the monotony of exposed earth and cultivated fields.\n\nThe topography and the layout visible in the picture echo typical rural land management practices, where areas are segmented for various uses such as habitation, agriculture, and possibly conservation. The overall ambiance is one of a quiet and secluded area, with human activities interacting intricately with the natural environment.","title":"Big brown coal mining operation","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["558414","553817","556968","547684","554164","547350","552858","549175","558044","556997","557748","555873","553694","556971","557726","547426"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["land","cultivate","field","picture","monotony","soil","patch","demarcation","groove","earth"]}
