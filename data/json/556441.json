{"path":"556441.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a young man seated on a bench in a rustic indoor setting that appears to be a type of games or recreational room. The mood conveyed is somewhat melancholic or contemplative.\n\nThe young man is wearing denim overalls over a denim jacket, paired with dark-colored shoes. His hair is styled in a typical fashion for young men, possibly from the late 20th century. He's holding a cigarette between his fingers and a pool cue rests against the bench next to him, suggesting that he has been or will be playing pool.\n\nOn the wall behind him, there are two handmade wooden signs. The sign on the left reads \"COUPLES ONLY AFTER 8 PM\" and the sign on the right says \"MOUNTAIN ROOM.\" These elements together with the wooden walls and dim lighting create a sense of a private, somewhat secluded area, possibly in a bar or a similar establishment located in a rural or mountainous area.\n\nThe lighting in the room is subdued with the main source of light coming from above, highlighting the upper body of the man and casting shadows that amplify the somber mood of the setting. The overall composition along with the man's expression suggests a narrative of solitude or reflection.","title":"Robert Johnson, 18, sits on a pool table in a beer joint in Clothier, West Virginia, near Madison. He has passed a job physical and is waiting to go to work in the mines. Many of the young men like to get together in the taverns and drink beer and talk. There is little else to do in the small mining towns.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543039","545974","553516","553517","556457","547427","547313","543975","552684","552104","544232","544202","548458","555532","555297","547794"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["room","pool","denim","bench","man","amplify","sign","finger","overall","say"]}
