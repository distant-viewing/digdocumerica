{"path":"545686.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph features an image of a rock surface with carvings clearly etched into it. The texture of the rock appears rough with a deep red color which could suggest a sandy or possibly iron-rich composition. The lighting indicates that the photo was likely taken in natural sunlight which enhances the shadows and texture of the surface.\n\nCarved into the rock are various names and symbols. At the top, \"Darin S + Mye T,\" suggests a personal note or marking, potentially signifying a relationship or visit by these individuals. Below this, stamped more boldly, is the name \"MELE\" accompanied by a large, double-framed, diagonal \"ZZ\" symbol beneath it. To the right and slightly lower is additional text, noted as \"Lerl 24, Anity B and Lyle S\" following the same naming convention as the carvings above. Adding a practical note to these carvings, the phrase \"Alfred Stoner 1970\" was added, cementing a moment in time to these markings.\n\nThe craftsmanship of the carvings suggests they were made intentionally with care; the letters are mostly uniform and legible. The combination of names, symbols, and the evident date forms a piece of preserved history captured within the context of the stone's surface, suggesting a poignant commemoration or a personal record of presence at that location in a specific year.","title":"Graffiti on sandstone","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544915","557118","557117","545679","545608","545682","545692","545683","542915","545675","545688","554172","545687","557534","545606","543079"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["carving","symbol","note","name","marking","rock","cement","etch","record","phrase"]}
