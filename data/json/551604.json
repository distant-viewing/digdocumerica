{"path":"551604.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of what appears to be an accumulation of debris in a water body, possibly a small stream or pond. The image is dominated by water-soaked logs and branches, crisscrossing and layered upon one another. The wood surfaces show varied textures; some parts are smooth and silvery, while others are rough and covered with small particles, possibly soil or disintegrated organic material.\n\nAmong the woody debris, numerous green aquatic plants can be seen emerging from the water. These plants are thin, elongated and unevenly distributed across the composition. The dark water in the background contrasts strongly with the lighter tones of the logs and the vibrant greens of the plants, adding depth to the scene.\n\nThe lighting suggests either an early morning or late afternoon setting, casting long, noticeable shadows across the logs and giving a slight reflective quality to the wet surfaces. Overall, the image captures a natural, possibly undisturbed aquatic environment that emphasizes the textures and overlapping forms of the natural materials found within it.","title":"East of the Con-Wed plant at Cloquet: the side channel of the St. Louis River into which the \"white water\" is discharged passes under the railroad spur that serves the plant.
