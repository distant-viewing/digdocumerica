{"path":"545168.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a striking image of pollution in a body of water, potentially a river or estuary. The foreground prominently features swirling patterns of white foam and darker water, creating a striking and somewhat somber visual effect. These swirling patterns look like mixing currents or turbulence in the water, possibly caused by differing temperatures, speeds, or contamination levels of the water merging together.\n\nIn the background, the scene transitions to a more industrial setting. There are hints of construction or industrial activity with what appears to be a pile of materials (possibly sand or gravel) on the far shore. Some structural elements, possibly part of a bridge or industrial equipment, can also be seen. This setting suggests human interaction with the natural environment, which might be contributing to the visible pollution in the water.\n\nThe overall mood evoked by the photograph is one of melancholic observation of environmental impact, highlighted by the stark contrast between the natural water patterns and the man-made structures in the backdrop. The sky is overcast, casting a dim, natural light over the scene and enhancing the gritty and polluted atmosphere of the image.","title":"Effluent from pulp mills pollutes Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550369","544779","550371","549624","544775","545164","552989","550815","550723","545119","548090","550206","557238","544175","552127","550734"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["swirl","pollution","water","turbulence","pattern","differ","contamination","temperature","current","foam"]}
