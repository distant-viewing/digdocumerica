{"path":"548984.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a pastoral scene focused on a group of cattle in a rural setting. In the foreground, several cows are seen close-up, their heads peering over a barrier, probably a fence, which only partially contains them. These cows have distinctive markings, mostly white faces with patches of black or brown. The lighting on these forefront cows is dim, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon.\n\nIn the background, the field extends far into the distance, dotted with numerous other cattle grazing. The environment appears to be a large, flat pasture with sparse, low vegetation, typical of a grazing field. The horizon shows a clear sky and some sparse trees, likely indicating that this is an expansive farm or ranch. The overall lighting in the scene suggests a sunny day, but the cows in the forefront are shaded, indicating they might be under the shadow of something outside the frame.\n\nThis photograph captures rural farm life, emphasizing livestock management and pastoral scenes. The composition, with a focus on the cows in the foreground against a blurred pasture background, directs attention to the cattle as the primary subjects, indicating their importance in this setting.","title":"Herded cattle in the imperial valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["542626","545153","552465","542960","554560","542627","553100","557022","550833","557012","549214","544535","552566","553105","546102","543318"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cow","cattle","pasture","farm","grazing","sparse","ranch","pee","graze","livestock"]}
