The foreground is dominated by multiple streams of water jets shooting upwards, creating a lively and sparkling effect. The water appears crisp and clear, shimmering under the sunlight.\n\nIn the background, you can see patches of lush green trees and a neatly manicured lawn, suggesting the setting is possibly a park or a styled public garden. There are a few people visible in the distance, enjoying the ambiance of the area. Two individuals, perhaps strolling or sitting near the fountain, blend somewhat into the verdant backdrop, indicating a peaceful and leisurely environment.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the fountain, using a low angle to enhance the feeling of the jets towering into the air, while the sunlit setting provides a bright and vibrant atmosphere.","title":"Park-like settings stressing plantings of various kinds sculpture and pools were features of the urban renewal renaissance program in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the early 1950's such additions complement the environment of towering office buildings","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["557282","550747","552737","550752","550072","552703","551647","551772","548818","551449","551663","553149","551855","551792","551661","551664"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","jet","stroll","shoot","manicure","shimmer","lawn","garden","stream","feeling"]}
