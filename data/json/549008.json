{"path":"549008.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene overflowing with an array of colorful and densely packed motel and other commercial signs. The signs, in varying fonts, sizes, and styles, are clamoring for attention; many declaring vacancies and amenities such as swimming pools and air conditioning. Prominent among them are the words “MOTEL” in large vertical letters, and other phrases like “BEST RATES,” “COLOR TV,” and “AIR CONDITIONED” meant to attract travelers.\n\nThe background shows a mountainous desert landscape, indicating that this location is probably near a highway in a sparsely populated or rural area, typical of roadside motel clusters in regions like the American Southwest. The clarity of the day and the lighting suggest it might be either early morning or late afternoon, enhancing the vivid colors of the signs.\n\nOn the street, several cars of various models, likely dating from the 1960s to 1970s based on their design, are parked or in motion, suggesting normal traffic activity typical of such commercial strips.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its focus on the plethora of advertisements and the natural backdrop, captures a quintessential aspect of American car culture and the roadside appeal businesses use to entice travelers. The image evokes a sense of a bygone era of motoring adventure and exploration, prominently featuring the visual cacophony that is often associated with main highways leading to and from popular destinations.","title":"Las Vegas street scene","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549017","553017","549113","545618","554550","549014","554183","554709","557660","549224","547021","554185","555438","545614","550093","545216"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["motel","traveler","highway","tv","rate","conditioning","font","phrase","amenity","sign"]}
