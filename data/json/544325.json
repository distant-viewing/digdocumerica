{"path":"544325.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts four individuals sitting outside a building. Three are sitting on the ledge of a large window while one person stands. They are positioned against a backdrop of a yellow and white brick building, which features a tall window covered by glass blocks. The appearance suggests an urban setting, possibly near an industrial or utilitarian building given the large window size and simple construction style.\n\nThe person standing wears a horizontally striped short-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and boots. The first seated individual (from the left), who faces slightly away from the camera, holds what appears to be a blanket or jacket overhead, possibly blocking the sun or adjusting their hair. The next two seated persons are a man and a woman, both wearing simple casual attire: the man in a collared, light-colored shirt and the woman in a collared shirt as well. They seem to be in a relaxed or conversational pose.\n\nThe overall scene evokes a casual, everyday moment among a group that appears engaged in a low-intensity social interaction or possibly just enjoying a break together. The time of day appears to be either morning or afternoon, given the quality of the light and shadows visible in the image.","title":"Navajos passing time","placename":"Gallup (N.M.)","location":"Gallup, New Mexico","nn1":["553166","553167","551433","553122","546452","543511","546209","546541","553169","556764","553218","551063","548625","552973","545330","546443"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["person","window","shirt","ledge","overhead","blanket","intensity","break","woman","boot"]}
