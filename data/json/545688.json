{"path":"545688.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph features a scene where a person is engaged in photographing ancient rock art. The person, who appears to be a woman, is dressed in a plaid shirt and a cap. She is holding a camera close to her eye, focusing on capturing the details of the artwork. The rock art itself is on a large, smooth, vertical red sandstone surface that forms part of a canyon wall or similar natural structure. The art consists of numerous handprints, some animal figures, and other geometric and anthropomorphic symbols, predominantly in a reddish pigment.\n\nThe rock art is arranged in several horizontal rows spanning a wide section of the rock surface, indicating it might have been a significant site for its creators. The setting implies a dry, possibly desert environment given the texture and color of the rock and the clear, bright quality of the light. The overall composition of the photograph, with the person on the right and the art on the left, creates a visual flow that connects the viewer from the modern act of photography to the ancient expressions of human culture on the rock face.","title":"These Fremont culture pictographs, dating back to the 11th century A.D., have been vandalized by a recent application of spray paint.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545608","545687","545567","545576","557117","557118","545683","545692","545675","544946","545697","545679","544931","544750","544895","544920"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["art","rock","person","sandstone","artwork","act","symbol","canyon","culture","photography"]}
