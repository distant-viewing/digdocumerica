{"path":"544361.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"In the photograph, there is a group of three people, presumably a family, positioned next to a dark blue vehicle. The man, likely the father, is standing and holding a young child in his arms. He is wearing a plaid button-up shirt and a light-colored cowboy hat, smiling as he looks away from the camera. The child he is holding is wearing a bright orange shirt and is facing away from the camera, with only the back of their head visible.\n\nNext to them stands a young girl who appears to be looking up contemplatively. She is dressed in a long-sleeve orange sweater and dark pants. Her expression is thoughtful and she seems to be gazing at something out of the frame.\n\nThe background features a rural landscape, largely flat with a hint of undulating hills and sparse vegetation under an overcast sky. On the horizon, there is a visible utility tower, and hints of a road leading towards it. The setting suggests a remote or less populated area, possibly in a desert or prairie-like environment. The overall mood of the image is quiet and serene, capturing a simple moment among the individuals standing beside their vehicle.","title":"Navaho father and children","placename":"Arizona","location":"Arizona","nn1":["543540","548303","553094","557049","556531","552821","547135","551316","547398","556356","557368","551934","545504","544230","556595","556235"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["prairie","father","child","cowboy","camera","undulate","button","sweater","hold","vehicle"]}
