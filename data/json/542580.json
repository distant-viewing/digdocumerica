{"path":"542580.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a bird's eye view of an urban scene dominated by a large, tall black building, centered in the foreground. This building contrasts sharply with its surroundings due to its dark color and monolithic structure. The backdrop of the image sets a hazy-blue sky above and a panoramic view of a residential area interspersed with trees and smaller buildings that stretch into the distance, suggesting a sprawling suburban landscape.\n\nTo the left of the black building, a busy multi-lane road, possibly a highway, runs vertically through the photograph, featuring moving vehicles that suggest typical urban traffic. Alongside the highway, numerous smaller buildings, likely commercial establishments given their design and clustering, can be seen. The entire scene is viewed from a high vantage point and shows a densely packed urban setting with man-made structures primarily dominating the environment.\n\nThe foreground of the image includes a parking lot filled with cars, directly adjacent to the black building, signifying a high-traffic or possibly a commercial or business district. The photograph as a whole captures a typical urban environment, focusing on architectures like skyscrapers, roads, and vehicles, indicative of mid- to late-20th-century city planning and design.","title":"Universal studios seen through smog","placename":"San Fernando Valley (Calif.)","location":"San Fernando Valley, California","nn1":["549476","551509","556193","546624","555743","551507","548364","553016","551510","548425","547764","546715","551506","549971","553001","551508"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","building","traffic","viewed","planning","signify","sprawling","hazy","district","road"]}
