{"path":"544402.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph features two young boys seen within the raised trunk of a red pickup truck, parked in a rugged, barren landscape. The scene likely takes place during twilight as the sky, partially cloudy, displays warm hues suggesting either sunrise or sunset.\n\nThe vehicle is prominently red with its rear lid open and parked on a dirt path. The older boy, clad in an orange jacket, leans on the edge of the trunk with a pensive expression, gazing toward the viewer. The younger boy, wearing a plaid shirt, appears to be partly inside the trunk, looking up with a serious facial expression.\n\nThe background consists of an expansive, sparse desert scene with rolling hills in the distance, giving an overall remote feel to the setting. There is minimal vegetation and the ground around is dusty and rocky, typical of a desert environment.\n\nThe boys' expressions and the isolated setting evoke a sense of solitude or waiting, capturing a moment of stillness in an otherwise expansive and empty environment. The open trunk and their partial retreat into the vehicle might suggest preparation or conclusion of a journey or a temporary pause in their travel.","title":"Navajo children examine their family pick-up truck","placename":"Red Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Red Rock, Arizona","nn1":["556490","550283","545504","544349","554543","545596","546093","552087","549272","544767","551003","544361","548303","546092","551032","545959"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["boy","trunk","desert","expression","lid","pause","retreat","pickup","journey","sunrise"]}
