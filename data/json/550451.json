{"path":"550451.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph depicts a Dall sheep with remarkable clarity and detail. The sheep is positioned center-frame amidst a rugged mountainous terrain characterized by dark, textured rocks. The sheep, appearing calm and composed, looks directly towards the camera, giving an intense, engaged expression.\n\nThis Dall sheep has a distinct white coat and curved, thick horns which indicate its maturity. The fur looks clean and plush against the stark, rough background of the dark rocky mountainside. Its horns are a prominent feature, spiraling backward.\n\nThe lighting in the image is natural, possibly overcast, which casts soft shadows and highlights the texture of both the sheep's coat and the rocky surface. The focus is sharp on the sheep, making it the clear subject of the photograph, while the rocks provide a monochromatic and textured background that contrasts with the animal's bright white fur.\n\nThis composition and setting suggest a wild, natural environment typical of the habitat where Dall sheep are found, likely in some mountainous regions of North America. The image evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence with nature, highlighting the sheepâ€™s adaptation to its harsh, rugged environment.","title":"A young ram at the west salt lick in Atigun Gorge, near the point where the pipeline will cross the Atigun River.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550449","550446","550448","550453","550445","550452","550450","554889","543269","554890","554891","554888","550444","554928","550454","544933"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["sheep","horn","fur","coat","maturity","mountainside","adaptation","rock","coexistence","clarity"]}
