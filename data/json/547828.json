{"path":"547828.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a coastal scene featuring a large and prominent suspension bridge spanning across a body of water. The view is from the shoreline looking across the beach towards the bridge. The bridge has tall and slender white towers supporting the main cable, which dips in a characteristic suspension bridge curve and rises back up, connecting on either side. The roadway appears to be a significant distance above the water, suggesting it accommodates large maritime traffic.\n\nThe beach in the foreground is mostly empty and appears somewhat unkempt, with driftwood and scattered debris along the sand, indicating less frequent maintenance or recent storm activity. The sand meets gentle waves breaking softly onto the shore. The shoreline curves softly from the left to the right side of the frame, leading the viewerâ€™s eye towards the bridge.\n\nThe water is relatively calm, with small waves suggesting a gentle breeze. The sky is partially cloudy with blue patches, giving the scene a serene and peaceful atmosphere despite the visible debris. The trees and vegetation are lush and green, filling the space between the beach and the bridge, which reinforces the natural environment surrounding this man-made structure.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of nature and engineering, showcasing how the bridge integrates into the coastal landscape. The photograph might be conveying themes of connectivity, the juxtaposition of human activity against natural settings, or simply offering a scenic viewpoint of an impressive architectural feat.","title":"The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge crosses New York Bay and connects Staten Island and Brooklyn.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543313","547669","546810","546870","543436","552846","544722","542804","548207","548401","547836","543087","549547","548415","547867","549068"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","suspension","beach","sand","shoreline","wave","curve","dip","accommodate","connectivity"]}
