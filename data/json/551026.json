{"path":"551026.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene surrounded by a natural landscape. In the foreground, there's an industrial plant characterized by several buildings with angular architectural features, along with cylindrical structures that might be storage tanks or silos. Large plumes of smoke or steam are being emitted from tall stacks, rising prominently into the sky. The color of the emissions varies from white to dark gray, indicating possibly different substances or temperatures.\n\nThe background is framed by hill or mountain ranges, adding a contrasting natural element to the industrial activity in the foreground. Overcast or slightly hazy sky conditions, possibly due to the emissions, dominate the atmosphere, casting a muted light over the entire scene and blending the colors into shades of purple and blue, reflecting a somber or polluted environment.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the impact of human industrial activity with the surrounding natural environment, captured under a subdued light that suggests early morning or late evening times. The photograph carries a vintage look, possibly shot on film, with a general tone that evokes environmental concerns or industrial might.","title":"West Virginia celebrated its 100th birthday in 1973 with rock concerts on the steps of the state capitol.
