{"path":"555464.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph portrays a nighttime scene in what appears to be a gas station environment. The main focus is on a large rectangular sign in the foreground. The sign features a misspelled word \"ZEERO\" in orange at the top, which seems to be an incorrect spelling of \"ZERO.\" Underneath, there is a large section painted white with bold text that reads “ICE” in the same orange color. An additional sign is propped against the larger one, prominently displaying the message “We regret We’re out of gasoline…” in dark blue font on a white background. This smaller sign also indicates that they will be \"OPEN FOR BUSINESS TOMORROW…\" in a smaller text right at the bottom.\n\nIn the background, another sign is slightly visible with the text \"COAST IS FREE\" in red and below that \"TIRES BATTERIES\" also in red, which suggests some promotional offers. The background further shows a dark, possibly late evening sky with no other discernible features except for these two advertisement boards. No people or moving objects are apparent in this image, adding to the sense of desertedness and possibly emphasizing the inconvenience caused by the lack of gasoline.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed is one of interruption and a slight disarray, signaling a disruption in normal services which might be a temporary and resolvable issue, as noted by the sign promising business the following day.","title":"\"zero ice\" and \"out of gas\" signs at sherwood, during the fuel crisis of 1973-74 result in unintended irony","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548169","548176","555413","548171","548168","555416","550103","555411","555414","548175","548053","548047","548173","555506","548174","555423"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["gasoline","sign","text","business","interruption","font","prop","disarray","disruption","coast"]}
