{"path":"550444.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures two mountain goats on a steep, rocky slope. The terrain is rugged and composed of dark, coarse gravel and scattered small rocks, creating a stark contrast with the white and light gray color of the goats. Each goat is facing towards the camera, with their attention seemingly directed at the photographer. The one in the foreground is slightly closer to the camera and positioned at a slight angle, showing its side and partial front, while the other goat is a bit higher up on the slope and appears to be looking slightly to the side but still towards the camera.\n\nThe background is a continuous extension of the rocky slope, which forms a diagonal line across the frame, indicating the steepness and rough texture of the mountain environment. The overall lighting is soft, and the focus is sharp on the goats, highlighting their fur and facial features against the darker, less detailed background. The setting appears remote and desolate, emphasizing the natural habitat and rugged lifestyle of these mountain-dwelling animals.","title":"Two young sheep cross hillside on the south side of the atigun gorge","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550454","550447","550456","550455","550453","550445","550450","550446","550451","550452","550449","550425","543269","550421","550448","543029"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["goat","slope","mountain","camera","coarse","extension","photographer","fur","lifestyle","rug"]}
