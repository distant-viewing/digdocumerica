{"path":"555662.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a majestic and serene landscape dominated by dramatic mountain peaks and expansive icefields. In the foreground, a dense coniferous forest, consisting primarily of tall, slender evergreen trees, extends across the bottom edge of the image, acting as a natural frame to the spectacular view beyond. \n\nIn the middle ground, we see a large, sprawling glacier, its surface textured with crevasses and moraines, leading the eye toward the mountains. The glacier appears thick and distinct, with blue and white hues that indicate ice and snow cover.\n\nThe background is dominated by a range of steep, jagged mountains. These mountains, sharp and towering, feature patches of snow and ice clinging to their slopes, suggesting high altitudes. The sky above is a clear blue, suggesting a crisp, possibly cold, day without clouds obstructing the view.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph creates a layered effect, with the tranquil, sheltered forest in the foreground, the rough icy textures of the glacier in the middle, and the harsh, imposing mountains in the background, all under a vast sky. This scenery likely conveys a sense of wilderness and unspoiled nature, emphasizing tranquility and the grand scale of the natural world.","title":"Photograph of view toward Worthington Glacier","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542842","550592","552173","555660","544905","555709","552143","550635","550610","550415","555657","543582","555656","550419","554398","555690"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["glacier","mountain","ice","snow","obstruct","coniferous","cling","forest","act","world"]}
