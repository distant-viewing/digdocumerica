{"path":"546627.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This is an image depicting a cluttered urban rail yard scene, shot under harsh sunlight resulting in high contrast and deep shadows. The photograph features multiple tracks curling through the frame, flanked by a disarray of both vintage and more modern (relative to the time the photo was taken) automobiles and service vehicles, including tank and freight cars stationary on adjacent tracks. Notably, amidst all the vehicles, there is a person walking along the tracks, providing a human element to the otherwise mechanical setting.\n\nThere are also industrial buildings in the background, with visible signageâ€”most prominently, a sign that reads \"NOG\", which adds to the industrial vibe of the scene. Overall, this photo captures a moment of everyday activity within a busy industrial area, highlighting elements of transportation and logistics with a backdrop that suggests the mid to late 20th century due to the style of the vehicles and the general quality of the scene.","title":"B & O branch in center of Bethesda is rarely used.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556692","547140","551007","556853","556783","556382","556900","547050","551006","556852","546719","552063","545541","550012","550065","556021"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["track","vehicle","disarray","freight","logistic","automobile","rail","yard","vibe","signage"]}
