{"path":"542610.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph displays a striking red plant emerging from a dry, earthy soil set in a natural environment. The plant, resembling the structure of a budding pine cone, is the main focus of the image. Its color is deep red, with a glossy, segmented texture much like leaves stacked tightly in a spiral pattern, creating a closed bud-like shape.\n\nIt is surrounded by a natural setting of fragmented forest floor elements including various dried twigs, small branches, and pine needles scattered disorderly across the ground. The ground itself is composed of coarse, pebbly soil mixed with decomposed organic matter which suggests a generally dry or arid habitat, possibly typical of temperate forest regions.\n\nThe lighting in the frame is natural, seemingly midday, as suggested by the stark shadows and bright highlights, emphasizing the vibrancy and color contrast between the plant and its surroundings. This setup underlines an intriguing focus on the solitary growth of this unusual plant amidst a seemingly harsh environment.","title":"California - Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["553361","550461","553074","543451","551331","542597","555053","544875","544889","544887","550460","555884","557617","555004","554743","543622"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["plant","soil","bud","cone","matter","twig","forest","needle","pine","midday"]}
