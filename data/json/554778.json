{"path":"554778.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph appears to show a close-up view of a patch of ground with some interesting details. The surface is predominantly muddy, with sediments and various small rocks scattered around. There is a noticeable stream or flow of a rusty-red liquid which could be water mixed with iron oxide or another reddish sediment, creating a stark contrast with the darker earth tones.\n\nThe red liquid has formed patterns and streams across the frame, drawing the viewer's attention with its bright color against the muted background. There are patches of greenery, possibly small weeds or grass, emerging sporadically across the scene, which add a touch of life to the mostly inorganic elements pictured.\n\nThe overall composition of the image has an abstract quality, focusing on the play of colors, textures, and the natural decay or weathering that has affected this patch of ground. The photograph does not contain any discernible human activities, figures, or man-made structures that are immediately obvious, emphasizing a natural or environmental focus.","title":"Once topsoil is removed, rainwater and exposed rock react to form sulfuric and other acids which eventually poison water and the land itself. This is an apparent violation of Ohio law. Land shown is at an Ohio Power Company pit off Route 146.","placename":"Freeland (Ohio)","location":"Freeland, Ohio","nn1":["544858","546110","554347","555200","544992","552430","555626","551232","552062","543523","552066","547905","550393","545656","555545","550837"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["liquid","sediment","stream","patch","weed","iron","affect","weathering","emerge","contain"]}
