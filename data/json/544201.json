{"path":"544201.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid and rustic scene of a stilt-supported waterfront community, likely a fishing village. It features two main wooden structures, standing on stilts above calm water. These buildings appear weather-beaten, with peeling paint and patches on the siding, indicating they have withstood various environmental elements.\n\nEach building has a porch and the one on the right has clothes hanging on a line, suggesting daily life and habitation. A series of wooden walkways connects these structures, allowing for movement between them over the water. The focus of the image involves several individuals: one person walking towards one of the buildings on the wooden dock, and a few others appear in varied positions along these walkways and porches, contributing a sense of community and activity.\n\nIn the foreground, large rocks jut out into the water, adding texture to the scene. The background is a flat horizon of lush green marshland under a sky scattered with clouds, emphasizing the setting's remote and natural environment.\n\nOverall, the image exudes a sense of isolation and simplicity of life, tied closely to the water and dependent on the sturdiness of these wooden structures in a remote locale.","title":"Fishing camps, at goose point","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["544243","545005","547847","548044","551114","547965","544567","550293","550357","547033","550307","551224","553925","544266","552955","548105"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["stilt","walkway","beaten","marshland","jut","village","porche","community","locale","waterfront"]}
