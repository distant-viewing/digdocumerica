{"path":"553761.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph appears to capture a vibrant outdoor event, likely from the 1970s based on the fashion styles visible. A group of individuals, predominantly women, are standing closely together, possibly watching or reacting to an event out of frame.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a woman who stands out prominently due to her dynamic pose and laughter. She's wearing white shorts and a dark top, accessorized with red sandals, a checkerboard pattern headscarf, large sunglasses, and several bracelets. Her pose, with hands on her hips and one leg slightly forward, suggests an animated interaction or reaction, and her open-mouthed laugh conveys enjoyment and engagement with the surrounding activity.\n\nBeside her, to the left, another woman in a brightly colored floral dress with large pink flowers smiles broadly. The man partially visible next to her is wearing a vividly patterned shirt that suggests a festive occasion. On the right, another woman is dressed in a pink suit, which along with her pose, looking towards the laughing woman, adds to the communal and spirited atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe background is less detailed but appears to be a grassy outdoor area, heavily sunlit, contributing to the summery, casual vibe of the gathering. The entire scene conveys a sense of enjoyment and communal interaction typical of a social or public event in an open, sunny environment.","title":"Spirited tourists follow the movements of a hula dance demonstrator","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["556532","558295","553210","553321","553267","553264","553183","551019","553251","553759","553322","553275","546821","553804","551808","555906"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["pose","woman","event","enjoyment","bracelet","summery","laughter","reaction","react","headscarf"]}
