{"path":"548938.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large hydroelectric dam nestled in a rugged, arid landscape. The dam, a massive structure made of concrete, spans the width of a river, creating a reservoir on one side. The water in the reservoir appears deep blue in contrast to the surrounding terrain.\n\nThe landscape is characterized by rocky, mountainous terrain with sparse vegetation, predominantly in shades of brown and gray, indicating a desert environment. There are winding roads on either side of the river, leading to and from the dam. These roads provide access to the dam and spillways.\n\nOn the reservoir side, the calm water reflects some sunlight. On the river side downstream of the dam, the water continues its course, snaking away into the distance surrounded by steep, rocky cliffs.\n\nThe dam itself is equipped with several large cylindrical structures that are likely part of the water intake system or spillways. These structures are positioned at various points on the dam. There also appears to be some infrastructure built on top of the dam, possibly for operations or monitoring. This view doesn't show any visible human activity, emphasizing the scale and the industrial nature of the dam in its rugged natural setting.","title":"Hoover Dam on the Colorado River","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548920","548975","548927","548947","548003","548936","549004","548007","548915","548013","548930","548940","548024","548012","548925","548008"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","reservoir","spillway","river","course","width","monitoring","side","snake","water"]}
