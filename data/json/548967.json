{"path":"548967.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a dairy farm, focusing on a feeding trough where several cows are eating. A long wooden trough filled with fresh green grass or hay extends diagonally from the foreground to the background of the image. Cows of various colors, including black, white, and brown, are uniformly lined up along the trough, most of them with their heads down as they feed. \n\nOne cow, prominently visible with a distinctive black and white pattern typical of Holstein Friesians, is in the foreground on the right side of the image. This cow is facing the camera, with its head turned slightly to the side, giving the viewer a clear view of its profile.\n\nThe environment is well-lit, suggesting the photograph was taken during the day, and the sky in the background appears bright and clear. The backdrop shows an open field under a vast sky, hinting at a location with ample space typical of rural or agricultural settings. There are no buildings or other structures visible in the immediate background, emphasizing the open, natural pasture environment. The bright sunlight casts shadows on the ground, enhancing the outdoor, sunny day ambiance of the scene.","title":"Livestock on epa's experimental farm","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548966","542626","548984","552465","554560","542627","542960","552566","554917","557022","545153","550833","544535","548065","542652","553100"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cow","trough","feeding","head","pasture","hay","feed","eat","casts","ample"]}
