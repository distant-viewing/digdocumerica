{"path":"551458.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a candid moment of a woman seated outdoors, engaging in a casual activity. She has long, light brown hair styled in what appears to be a ponytail, secured with a ribbon or a similar hair accessory. She is wearing a short-sleeved plaid shirt, predominantly red with black and yellow lines forming a grid pattern. The woman is sitting at a bench or table, involved in the act of eating; she is looking down and away from the camera, holding food to her mouth with her right hand. A crumpled paper, possibly used as wrapping for the food, is visible on the table in front of her.\n\nIn the background, although slightly out of focus, there are elements that suggest a public or recreational space. Notable is the presence of blooming red flowers, possibly roses, adding a colorful contrast to the scene. There are hints of other visitors and possibly park benches, contributing to the feel of an outdoor communal or dining area, underlined by a sunny, serene ambiance filtered through natural light. The scene communicates a relaxed, everyday moment, set in a lively yet peaceful public setting.","title":"Lunch time on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553211","545742","553156","557935","551826","545523","543835","551448","544742","553165","546555","544747","549444","553164","551845","546566"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["food","bench","table","ponytail","blooming","ribbon","crumple","accessory","dining","hair"]}
