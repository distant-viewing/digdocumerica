{"path":"547891.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene featuring a part of a manufacturing or processing plant. The image is dominated by two large, vertical cylindrical structures, which appear to be smokestacks or chimneys. These towers are colored in a faded yellow hue and are capped with green tops. Adjacent to these chimneys is a large metal structure, likely part of the facility's processing equipment. This structure is equipped with multiple levels and features, including stairways and guardrails, suggesting access points for maintenance or operation.\n\nThe metal construction is clad in a weathered steel finish and includes several compartments and possibly ventilation outlets. Notable on this structure is signage that reads \"Wheelabrator,\" which indicates either the brand or the operator of the equipment. \n\nThe sky in the background is overcast, contributing to a somber and utilitarian atmosphere typical of industrial zones. Overall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the towering and robust nature of industrial architecture.","title":"This air pollution control device, in the Gravesend Bay area of Brooklyn, is the first electrostatic precipitator in the U.S. to be installed on a municipal incineration plant.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547468","546143","557304","557387","555617","542591","544691","552003","542521","550344","549713","545445","542545","542705","544966","548376"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["chimney","processing","outlet","stairway","guardrail","ventilation","operator","finish","compartment","brand"]}
