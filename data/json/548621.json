{"path":"548621.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"In the photograph, an elderly woman is seen relaxing on a portable lounge chair at a beach. She wears a leopard print swimsuit and a colorful headscarf. A pair of sunglasses are placed on her head, slightly pushing back the headscarf. She is knitting something yellow, focused intently on her activity. The woman's skin suggests that she has been out in the sun, with visible tan lines.\n\nThe chair she sits on is green and seems to be made from a type of metal frame, suggesting portability and leisure use. A vibrant pink towel adorned with white hibiscus flowers covers the back of her chair, adding a splash of color and enhancing the relaxed, vacation vibe.\n\nBehind the woman is a natural rocky backdrop which indicates the beach might be a more rugged, possibly secluded area rather than a typical sandy beach. The ground beneath her is sandy and strewn with small rocks and pebbles. This setting evokes a sense of peaceful solitude away from busy tourist spots. The lighting is bright, indicating it is possibly midday or early afternoon. \n\nOverall, the image encapsulates a serene beachside moment where the elderly woman enjoys her hobby in a natural, tranquil setting.","title":"A member of the South Beach retirement community enjoys the sun and sea air.
