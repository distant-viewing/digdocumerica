{"path":"554864.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in an industrial or workshop setting where two men are engaged in metalworking activities. The primary focus is on the man on the left, who is using a large, rapidly spinning grinding wheel. Sparks are flying vividly from the contact point where the man applies a metal piece to the grinder, suggesting that he is either sharpening or smoothing the piece. He is wearing protective gloves to handle the metal and possibly to shield his hands from the sparks and heat.\n\nThe man is dressed in a light blue long-sleeve shirt that appears to be work attire, well-suited for a potentially hazardous environment. His attention is intensely focused on the task at hand.\n\nIn the background and to the right, another man (partially visible) appears to be bent over, possibly working on a separate part of the machinery or engaging in another task related to the metalworking process. This man is also dressed in blue, suggesting a uniform or common work attire for both individuals.\n\nThe environment around them is cluttered with various tools, machinery components, and possibly scraps of metal, indicating a busy and functional workspace. The workshop's setting includes visible masonry and other typical structural elements of an industrial area, reinforcing the utilitarian nature of the space.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of concentrated labor involving manual skill and machinery in a workshop dedicated to metalwork, highlighting the expertise and safety measures necessary in such environments.","title":"Sheep shearer sharpening his shears on a ranch in the Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio area.","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["556267","544331","544316","556269","554918","554931","555955","546023","558303","549695","556863","549694","546036","554930","548231","558304"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["workshop","spark","machinery","man","metalwork","masonry","metal","expertise","task","measure"]}
