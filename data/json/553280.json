{"path":"553280.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene with two people as the main subjects. The setting appears to be a public square with a distinctive patterned pavement, possibly made of cobblestones or similar materials. The background showcases an architectural structure that features bold, dark strips, giving it a modernist appearance.\n\nThe left of the image features a man who is partially cropped out of the frame. He dons a light gray shirt paired with dark pants and black shoes. He is holding a large flag with a wooden pole, showing only the bottom portion of the flag which displays a golden or yellow motif on a red background. He also carries a large cardboard box filled with items wrapped in white; these could be food packages or some form of brochures or handouts.\n\nBeside him, on the right, stands a woman with blonde hair, smiling and facing towards the left side of the image. Her attire includes a blue top and a green long skirt, and she is barefoot. She also has her hand on the bottom section of the flagpole, appearing to either be raising it alongside the man or simply touching it playfully.\n\nThese individuals appear to be participating in or preparing for an event, likely something formal or ceremonial given the presence of a flag and packed items, potentially in a public or communal setting. Their expressions and posture suggest a moment of casual interaction or cooperation in a lively public space. The image exudes a vibrant and dynamic energy, likely characteristic of whatever event they are part of.","title":"D'aug days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, fountain square.
