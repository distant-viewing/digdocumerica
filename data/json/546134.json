{"path":"546134.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image captures a scene of a picnic area by a waterfront, with an industrial backdrop. In the foreground, three individuals are seated at a green picnic table under a shelter with brightly colored yellow and green supports and a reddish-orange fabric canopy. The person on the left appears to be a woman with her back toward the camera, sitting on a green bench and wearing a red sleeveless top. The two people facing the camera, also appear to be women, are engaged in a conversation or a meal. One of them is holding what looks like a beverage can.\n\nThe picnic area is sparsely equipped with a few visible items on the table, such as a green cooler and some personal belongings, indicating a casual gathering. The sand and sparse grassland suggest a beach-like setting but without lush vegetation.\n\nIn stark contrast to the leisurely foreground, the background features industrial structures along the waterfront. Visible are tall silos, cranes, large buildings, and other industrial machinery, predominantly in gray and metallic colors, suggesting a setting near a port or industrial complex. The air has a hazy quality, possibly indicating pollution or mist.\n\nOverall, the photograph juxtaposes a relaxed, social human element against a mechanical, industrial environment, highlighting a striking balance between nature, human interaction, and industrial activity.","title":"Picnic area on beach along the Calcasieu River Olin-Mathieson plant in background","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["546224","546219","557488","557955","556298","558188","550937","552180","546145","552032","549283","551959","549444","545228","552036","548568"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["picnic","waterfront","table","cooler","sleeveless","belonging","grassland","beverage","meal","shelter"]}
