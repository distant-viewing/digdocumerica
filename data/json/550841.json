{"path":"550841.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a serene outdoor scene centered on a small motorboat on a calm body of water, presumably a lake or river. There are three men in the boat. Sitting in the front is a man wearing a blue jacket and blue pants, who is attentively looking ahead. The man in the middle, wearing a brown jacket and cap, seems to be operating the outboard motor. Another man, located at the back, is preoccupied with some activity in the boat, possibly adjusting equipment or handling fishing gear, dressed in a green shirt and brown hat.\n\nOn the shoreline in the background, there are two vehicles parked beside the road; one appears to be a white station wagon and the other a dark-colored van or SUV. A simple wooden dock extends into the water close to where the vehicles are parked, surrounded by lush green trees that suggest a verdant, secluded area likely used for recreational purposes such as fishing or boating. The scene conveys a peaceful, leisurely atmosphere often associated with outdoor recreational activities in a natural setting.","title":"Fishermen pass launching ramp on the Fox River","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546976","553411","549417","552316","551350","544980","546352","544770","552317","554198","552982","548736","544260","546079","546356","544270"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["fishing","man","jacket","motor","motorboat","boat","boating","wagon","vehicle","gear"]}
