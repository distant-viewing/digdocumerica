{"path":"554878.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a group of seven men exerting effort to push a large, muddy truck out of what appears to be a mud pit. The setting is outdoors, in a green, rural environment with trees and grass around, suggesting it may be a countryside or farm-like setting.\n\nThe truck is red and white and hooked to a loaded cattle trailer with metal bars. The trailer is filled with red and white crates, indicating some type of agricultural or livestock activity. The ground is visibly muddy and wet, which has contributed to the vehicle's predicament.\n\nEach man is actively pushing against the trailer; their postures and expressions (as discernible) exhibit exertion and focus. They are dressed in work-appropriate casual clothes—jeans and shirts predominantly—which are muddy, especially at the lower sections, reflecting their physical engagement with the muddy terrain.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate action, there is a tranquil, natural environment with trees, suggesting a quiet, rural location. The photo captures a moment of teamwork and physical effort, embodying a narrative of resilience and collective problem-solving in a rustic setting.","title":"Sheep being loaded on a truck at a rank in the Leakey, Texas area near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555866","555875","556043","545667","555874","545535","544469","555561","557751","554685","544767","553117","545531","555876","542535","553631"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["trailer","push","effort","exertion","truck","embody","crate","cattle","countryside","pit"]}
