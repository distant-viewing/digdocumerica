{"path":"545345.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph features a dark, twilight scene within an urban yard or alleyway. Dominating the foreground is a large, blurred animal, likely a horse, positioned on the right side of the frame. Most of its body is not clearly visible due to the dim lighting and focus, but its head and neck are evident, leaning towards the camera.\n\nIn the background, there is a woman dressed in a light red sweater and dark pants. She is seated on what appears to be a mini tractor or a similar small, wheeled vehicle situated on rails, possibly used for transporting goods or equipment within the area. The woman is looking directly towards the camera with a facial expression that is difficult to discern under the low light conditions.\n\nThe backdrop reveals some architectural elements like a brick wall and an open gate, beyond which a brighter, yellowish light source illuminates another section of the alley, contrasting with the overall dimness. Clothing items are also visible; they are hanging out to dry, stretched across the upper part of the frame, adding to the everyday, practical ambiance of the scene.\n\nThe setting suggests a work-oriented environment, likely a stable or an industrial alley, characterized by the combination of functional equipment and domestic items such as the hanging clothes. The overall mood is quiet and serene, tinged with the onset of evening or early morning. The texture and graininess of the image add a rustic and vintage quality to the photograph.","title":"El Paso's second ward.
