{"path":"545629.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, open landscape dominated by the serpentine flow of a muddy river. The river meanders through a valley, surrounded by expansive, arid terrain characterized by rolling hills and striking rock formations.\n\nThe color palette of the scene includes hues of orange, brown, and red typical of eroded rocky landscapes, suggesting a desert environment possibly in a region like the American Southwest. Along the river banks, sparse vegetation can be seen, adding patches of green to the otherwise earth-toned environment.\n\nTwo distinct buttes or mesa formations frame the scene, rising prominently in the background. These geological features exhibit steep, rugged faces and flat tops, typical of arid plateau landscapes subjected to wind and water erosion over millennia.\n\nThere are no visible structures or people in the image, emphasizing the natural and undeveloped nature of the landscape. This environment seems remote and untouched, offering a broad view that might appeal to lovers of natural beauty and geology. There's a feeling of tranquility and timelessness conveyed through the combination of flowing water, stark landforms, and a wide, open sky.","title":"Log boom site in Monument Valley, Utah, where massive oil spill into the San Juan River was temporarily contained.
