{"path":"547175.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, slightly melancholic scene featuring two women seated separately on a wide concrete staircase under a bright blue sky. Both women appear to be in casual attire, immersed in thought, adding a reflective quality to the scene.\n\nThe woman on the left is seated lower on the steps; she has short blonde hair and wears a dark jacket with a red accessory on her wrist, contrasting with her light-colored trousers. She sits with her arms around her legs, looking slightly upward with a contemplative expression. \n\nThe woman on the right, with long blonde hair, is seated higher up on the stairs. She wears a dark green coat and denim jeans, her legs crossed, and she supports herself with one arm against the stairs. Her gaze is directed straightforward, possibly lost in thought or enjoying the moment of solitude.\n\nBehind them, the background features an urban setting with small brick buildings, one prominently displaying a white bicycle mounted decoratively on its facade. The architecture is simple and utilitarian, typical of small-town or suburban areas. The roofs of the buildings, covered with a bit of shadow, and the clear sky above contribute to a calm, laid-back atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition with its cool colors, clear lighting, and relaxed postures of the subjects juxtaposed with the urban backdrop creates a contemplative and somewhat nostalgic mood.","title":"Resting on steps to Lakeside Park in Pentwater","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["549290","551448","552962","557842","553484","553164","553156","551828","556165","553534","549322","551450","556541","556176","546474","547748"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["stair","thought","woman","leg","seat","arm","wrist","lose","immerse","accessory"]}
