{"path":"546798.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a Coast Guard motorboat speeding across a body of water. The boat, prominently painted in black with \"COAST GUARD\" inscribed in bold white letters along its side, cuts through the water creating a frothy wake. The hull also features a red panel with a white Coast Guard emblem near the bow.\n\nOnboard, there are two individuals wearing yellow rain jackets and hats, indicative of maritime or weather-ready gear. One individual is seated at the rear of the boat, steering with controls visible near him, and appears focused on maneuvering the boat. The other individual is standing forward, holding onto a support structure of the small roofed area, looking out towards the water ahead.\n\nThe background shows a relatively calm sea extending to the horizon under an overcast sky, hinting at possibly cool or inclement weather conditions. On the very distant horizon, there are faint outlines suggesting other ships or landmasses, but these are not distinctly visible. Overall, the image captures a moment of alert, professional activity by the Coast Guard, likely engaged in a routine patrol or responding to a maritime situation.","title":"Coast guard vessel making sharp port turn on chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["546786","546324","549622","547461","547156","548520","546049","554445","545156","549313","545179","550840","547463","544234","546317","545057"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","inclement","inscribe","landmass","steer","emblem","individual","motorboat","situation","black"]}
