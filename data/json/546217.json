{"path":"546217.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a striking and somewhat abstract perspective, likely taken from beneath a translucent surface looking upwards. The focus is on a large bubble extending across the frame, featuring intricate shimmers and delicate reflections that suggest features of light hitting water or a similar liquid medium.\n\nCentered within this bubble are leafy silhouettes, possibly from branches that hang overhead, intersecting with the transparent entity. These leaves and branches cause a series of shadows and diffractions within the bubble, adding to its textured and dynamic visual appeal.\n\nThe background outside the bubble is dark, emphasizing the luminosity and intricate details of the bubble's surface. It gives the appearance of a nighttime setting or a dark environment where the main source of light might be just hitting the bubble itself, creating contrasts and highlights that are visually intense.\n\nOverall, the composition plays with natural elements and reflections, creating a dreamlike or otherworldly scene that merges the organic forms of nature with a moment of fleeting beauty captured in the bubbleâ€™s transient existence.","title":"Oil seePage in pond","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["552980","555069","543520","557581","555032","552237","557314","543564","557584","558077","543194","555044","550372","554585","555804","555838"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["bubble","hit","dreamlike","entity","luminosity","reflection","branch","medium","nighttime","upwards"]}
