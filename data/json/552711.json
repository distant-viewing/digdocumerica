{"path":"552711.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling urban scene, seemingly captured from an elevated point of view. The image features a crowded street filled with numerous cars, which suggests heavy traffic. The cars, appearing in a variety of sizes and styles typical of an earlier era, are densely packed in what looks to be multiple lanes.\n\nIn striking contrast to the congested road, there are pedestrian activities visible. People are seen crossing the street, navigating between the cars. Separate from the roadway, on the left side of the image, there is a walkway or sidewalk where a group of people are standing and walking. This area is sectioned off from the road by barricades, indicating either a construction area or a pedestrian-only path.\n\nThe environment has an industrial feel, possibly hinting at the outskirts of a downtown area or a less cultivated part of a city, given the visible patches of dirt and undeveloped land alongside the pedestrian area. There are no prominent buildings or trees in the immediate vicinity, focusing all attention on the street-level activities of cars and pedestrians. The scene captures a moment of urban life characterized by movement, likely taken during a busy time such as rush hour.","title":"Traffic on Market Street, Philadelphia's main east-west artery, looking west","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549874","549849","551478","548419","556195","546730","556734","556727","546626","549919","546716","556732","553893","556729","550126","548388"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["pedestrian","car","street","barricade","rush","downtown","cultivate","outskirt","vicinity","walkway"]}
