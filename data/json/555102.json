{"path":"555102.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a charred or darkened piece of wood, likely part of a tree trunk or a wooden structure. In the center of the image, there is a naturally formed shape within the wood that strikingly resembles a fish head. This form is lighter in color compared to the surrounding dark wood, highlighting its fish-like features including what appears to be an eye and mouth opening. The texture on the rest of the wood surface is rough and rugged, indicative of weathering or possible burn marks, which contribute to an almost abstract background. The lighting and shadowing enhance the depth, making the fish head protrusion appear more pronounced against the dark, textured backdrop. This photograph could be interpreted as an example of finding patterns or familiar shapes in natural objects, often referred to as pareidolia.","title":"Closeup of a piece of wood shaped like a bird's head, found in a clear-cut area of olympic national timberland, Washington.
