{"path":"557538.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an upward view of a utility pole against a bright sky. The main focus is on the elaborate structure of the pole, which includes multiple crossbeams holding various electrical lines and equipment. The lines crisscross at various angles, creating a web-like structure.\n\nThe highest crossbeam is heavily equipped with insulators and electrical components, suggesting a high-voltage line. Below this, two additional crossbeams carry more lines and utilities, featuring various types of insulators, some glass and others likely ceramic, reflecting the sunlight differently.\n\nThe background is overexposed due to the sun, which is directly behind the pole creating a halo or flare effect, giving a dramatic backlight to the silhouette of the pole and its equipment. The entire scene is cast in silhouette due to the strong backlight, emphasizing shapes and outlines rather than colors or textures.\n\nThe photograph has a minimalist and slightly abstract appeal, focusing on the interplay of technology and natural light, and illustrating the complex yet commonplace infrastructure often overlooked in daily life.","title":"Power pole in the Malibu canyon area of the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county.  The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles county, but are threatened by development.  Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure.  Several commissions have been set up to restrict coastal development","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["548146","544613","543823","547936","557977","557298","543903","544355","547732","554296","549110","557978","543926","547944","553830","549011"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["backlight","pole","halo","web","utility","line","voltage","flare","silhouette","equipment"]}
