{"path":"554990.jpg","date":"July 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a serene forest scene characterized by tall, majestic trees that dominate the view. The most notable trees in this forest appear to be large, with thick trunks and a high canopy, possibly indicating that they are old-growth. The bark of the trees is deeply textured and varies in color from dark brown to a muted gray, suggesting they might be species such as redwoods or sequoias, although the precise species cannot be determined just from the image.\n\nThe forest floor is dappled with sunlight, creating areas of light and shadow which contribute to the overall moody atmosphere of the scene. This variation in lighting highlights the lush underbrush, predominantly featuring low-lying ferns and other small plants. These plants are vibrant and green, providing a stark contrast to the darker tones of the tree trunks.\n\nThere is a palpable sense of tranquility and the untouched quality of a natural, dense woodland area. The background is a continuation of similar trees, extending the depth of the forest and enhancing the isolated and serene mood evoked by the setting. There are no visible paths, animals, or people, reinforcing the feel of an undisturbed natural environment. The overall composition focuses on the vertical lines of the trees, with the play of light filtering through the canopy adding texture and depth to the scene.","title":"A dense stand of old growth Douglas fir 200 to 375 years old in the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554966","542745","555051","554970","542725","554967","543447","542569","550791","554965","546947","554425","555116","555120","542750","555028"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","specie","canopy","trunk","tree","redwood","continuation","fern","filtering","plant"]}
