{"path":"557241.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph features a natural scene with some industrial elements. A man is visible on the right side of the image, walking cautiously over a rugged terrain composed of large reddish-brown rocks. The man is dressed casually in a light-colored T-shirt and dark pants, with his right hand stretched out for balance. He is carrying a jug, possibly containing liquid, in his left hand.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a small water body running over a bed of similar reddish-brown rocks, leading out to a larger body of water, possibly a river or lake, visible along the left side of the image. The water has a foamy appearance as it washes over the rocks, suggesting some speed or turbulence in its flow.\n\nIn the background, obscured by a slight haze, there are two tall industrial structures resembling towers, probably part of a power plant or factory given their design and the context of the surroundings. Trees and foliage are also visible around the edges of the scene, blending the industrial and natural elements together. The overall atmosphere of the photo is somewhat serene yet underscores the interaction between human activity and nature, indicated by both the presence of the man and the industrial structures in the vicinity.","title":"Employee of the Pennsylvania state department of environmental resources approaching to take water samples from the monongahela river at the outfall of the edgar thompson plant owned by the united states steel corporation at Braddock Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.
