{"path":"550986.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a large toll bridge. The bridge structure is made of a metal framework, densely packed with beams and girders, creating a tunnel-like effect with shadows and sunlight patterns on the road. The structure features a deep rust or brown color, typical of many steel bridges, reflecting its possibly aged condition and exposure to elements. Prominently, there is a yellow sign fixed to the upper part of the structure which reads \"TOLL BRIDGE\" in bold, black letters, identifying the function of the bridge.\n\nThe road on the bridge appears to be paved and shows streaks of light filtering through the metalwork above, casting lined shadows that create a textured look on the surface. Currently, there are two visible vehicles on the bridge, driving away from the viewpoint, likely indicating the photograph was taken mid-transit through the bridge.\n\nThe environment around the bridge is not highly visible due to the encapsulating structure, but some foliage is perceptible at the bottom corners of the bridge, suggesting the bridge may be over a river or a similarly vegetated area.\n\nOverall, the photograph highlights the industrial design of the bridge and provides a real sense of place and purpose, with the vehicles implying its continued use for transportation. The contrasting interplay of light and shadow adds a dynamic visual appeal to the scene.","title":"Rusty toll bridge crosses the Kanawha River below Glen Ferris","placename":"Charleston (W.
