{"path":"555597.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph captures a rural environment focusing on a severely damaged road or pathway. The surface is extensively cracked and fragmented into various sizes of asphalt, showcasing deep ruts and erosion features. There are visible puddles of water collected in larger depressions, indicating recent rain or water exposure. \n\nIn the background, across the road, there's a sparse rural landscape featuring a few small shrubs and a single medium-sized tree to the left. Beyond this thin line of vegetation, another dirt road is visible parallel to a fence made of wooden posts and wire. The grass appears dry and the scene gives an overall sense of a neglected or less traveled rural area.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it was taken during the day with bright sunlight casting sharp shadows from the uneven road surfaces. The sky is not visible in the image, focusing all attention on the terrain and the damaged road. The composition centers on the texture and the destructive pattern across the road, leading the viewer's eye through the winding path of devastation.","title":"Coal companies have reclaimed some of the land that has been strip mined in southeastern Ohio for use as recreation areas.
