{"path":"546167.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant outdoor scene set in a lush, green park-like area with several mature trees, some with notably textured bark and dense foliage. A gentle stream crosses through the area, lined with stones and surrounded by green grass and sporadic undergrowth.\n\nOn the left side of the image, an older man in a dark shirt and light-colored pants is standing, conversing with a woman who faces away from the camera, wearing a shorts ensemble. A child, who appears to be interacting with the water, is next to them in white clothing, squatting near the stream's edge.\n\nIn the middle and right-hand side of the image, a family can be seen engaging actively around and in the stream. On the bank, a shirtless man with light-colored trunks is bending over, reaching toward the water where two small children are. Both children are lightly clad; one wears orange trunks, and the other is in a yellow and white outfit. Nearby stands another adult male wearing a yellow shirt with a sun hat, next to a young child standing upright and facing the water. \n\nIn the background, a vintage-styled camper provides a scenic and fitting backdrop to this nature-focused, recreational outing. Overall, this photograph exudes a sense of summer leisure, family interaction, and a connection with a tranquil natural environment.","title":"Camping beside the Rio Frio","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["552975","543530","543692","554475","557740","554506","543164","553439","552033","550227","544442","543943","557743","545267","547756","543892"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["stream","child","family","trunk","ensemble","camper","undergrowth","outing","male","bark"]}
