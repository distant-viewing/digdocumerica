{"path":"550195.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic industrial scene under what appears to be stormy weather conditions. The key features of the image include large structures of an industrial complex, possibly a steel mill, with multiple tall smokestacks from which voluminous dark smoke is billowing into the sky. The skyline is dominated by these thick plumes of smoke, blending with the dark, cloud-covered sky above, creating an almost monochromatic appearance in shades of gray and black.\n\nThe industrial complex includes several large, rectangular buildings and a series of interconnected pipelines and possibly conveyors. Additionally, there are tower-like structures that rise above the main buildings, typical of heavy industrial setups, likely used for functions such as housing blast furnaces or smelters.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a glimpse of metallic structures, possibly part of transportation or conveyor systems used within the mill. The appearance of the sky suggests either an overcast day or the effect of the smoke itself making the atmosphere dark and dense. There's a subdued light that seems to reflect off wet surfaces, suggesting recent rain or damp conditions, which highlights the industrial activity's environmental impact.\n\nThis image captures the intensity and somewhat grim reality of industrial operations, emphasizing themes like pollution and environmental degradation. It serves as a powerful visual commentary on the impact of industrial processes on the surrounding environment.","title":"'Republic Steel'","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557218","550344","550982","547204","545447","549967","546884","545445","557215","557216","550328","550981","550676","550181","545446","546908"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["mill","conveyor","smoke","complex","furnace","pipeline","reality","impact","commentary","appearance"]}
