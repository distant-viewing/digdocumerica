{"path":"549733.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures an exciting moment during a powerboat racing event. The focus is on a sleek powerboat that is speeding across a body of water. The boat is brightly colored predominantly in red, with white, blue, and gray accents, and features the U.S. flag design on its side. The number \"U2\" in bold black letters and the text \"U.S.\" are visible on its side panel.\n\nThe powerboat is at high speed, creating a large spray of water at its sides, indicating swift movement and the power of its engine. A helmeted pilot, wearing a red racing suit, is in the cockpit, which is centrally located. The pilot appears to be steering the boat, though other details of the cockpit and the controls are not clearly visible.\n\nIn the background, viewers can observe a shoreline densely covered with trees and foliage, giving a natural backdrop to the scene. There is also a blurred viewing area on the bank where a crowd of spectators can be noticed, indicating that this event is being watched by many people. Additionally, a bright orange buoy floats in the water, suggesting this could be part of a racecourse marking.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes speed and competition, with the powerful motion of the boat against a static natural background, enhanced by the patriotic color scheme of the racing boat.","title":"Gar wood trophy race on the Detroit river--a contest for hydroplanes.  \"miss usa\" speeds past a course marker","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549731","550879","549085","549732","542697","547708","550840","548520","546049","548058","545740","549622","546912","543945","549062","545156"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["racing","speed","pilot","cockpit","boat","competition","swift","event","viewing","notice"]}
