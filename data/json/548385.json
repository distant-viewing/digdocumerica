{"path":"548385.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph presents a cityscape enveloped in a hazy, atmospheric fog or pollution, casting a muted, almost monochromatic palette over the scene. This is likely an image of a large city during either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and the visible shadows which indicate low light.\n\nProminently in the background, there is a prominent, very tall skyscraper which is under construction, as indicated by the scaffoldings or structures visible at its top. This building stands out not only due to its height but also because it's substantially taller than the surrounding buildings. It appears as a stark, vertical line against a more textured and varied skyline.\n\nSurrounding this central building are numerous other high-rise buildings, tightly packed together, forming a dense urban landscape. The buildings are of different heights, designs, and probably purposes, some with flat tops, others with peaked or stepped features. The architectural variety suggests a mix of commercial or office buildings.\n\nThe air quality suggests a grim or industrial atmosphere, possibly indicating pollution or a very foggy day. This affects the clarity and contrasts of the buildings in the distance, which gradually fade into the background haze.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph emphasizes verticality and density, characteristic of many urban metropolitan areas, while the atmospheric conditions add a layer of mystery or melancholy to the scene.","title":"Manhattan skyline.
