{"path":"553351.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a construction scene focused on environmental infrastructure, presumably taken during the daytime. The composition includes a prominent informational sign on the right that reads \"Clean Water\" at the top, followed by text that announces \"Water Pollution Control Facilities for City of Nashua New Hampshire,\" and includes logos or mentions of various agencies such as the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission, Water Quality Office, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The sign is very clean and appears to be relatively new or well-maintained.\n\nIn the backdrop, there is an ongoing construction scene with a reddish-orange excavator actively digging or moving earth. Several construction workers can be seen around the machinery, wearing typical work attire which hints at an active work site. Adjacent to the construction site are some buildings, possibly part of the cityscape of Nashua, New Hampshire. There's a sizable, multi-story brick building and a smaller, traditional house like structure beside it, which provide a contrast between commercial and possibly residential architecture.\n\nThe environment looks partially urban with visible vegetation such as trees being integrated into the city surroundings. An architectural railing in the foreground adds a grounding element to the scene, suggesting the photo might be taken from a bridge or an elevated platform. The natural light and clarity of the elements indicate favorable weather conditions, enhancing the visibility and details within the scene.","title":"Photograph of the environmental protection agency (epa) water quality office in New Hampshire","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547876","549162","545858","546009","548209","544282","553379","553392","553350","553375","553380","546252","552031","557479","547220","549304"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["construction","announce","site","excavator","mention","dig","integrate","daytime","work","clarity"]}
