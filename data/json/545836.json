{"path":"545836.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely a water treatment or chemical processing plant. The foreground shows a body of water, possibly a containment or processing pond, with several wooden poles protruding at regular intervals and metal conduits running along a walkway at the edge of the water.\n\nIn the middle ground, a variety of industrial equipment dominates the scene. There are multiple large cylindrical tanks arranged in two rows, all connected by a complex network of pipes and metal structures. These tanks are likely used for storing or processing liquids. Adjacent to these tanks are two prominent structures: one features a tall metallic tower with a winding staircase, while the other is a smaller, shed-like building with a flat roof.\n\nSmoke or steam is visible emanating from a stack located at what appears to be an adjacent facility in the background, suggesting some form of combustion or steam generation process is underway. This area is well-equipped with infrastructure supportive of heavy industrial operations.\n\nThe background features an open landscape with minimal vegetation, some distant buildings, and utility poles, hinting at a suburban or semi-urban setting typical of industrial outskirts. The sky is clear and bright, indicating favorable weather conditions at the time the photograph was taken.","title":"Cooling towers and settling tanks for removal of effluents from the water used by this general tire chemical plant are partially financed by the government.
