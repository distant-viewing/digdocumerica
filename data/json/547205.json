{"path":"547205.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a candid moment on a bustling city street. The setting is lined with vehicles and commercial signage, evoking a typical urban environment.\n\nIn the foreground, we see a diverse group of people in a seemingly casual gathering. Most of the focus is drawn to a police officer on the left, dressed in a dark blue uniform complete with a badge, looking sternly towards the camera. A series of individuals, varying in age and attire, stand beside him and behind, reflecting different social backgrounds. Notably, a young woman and an older man wear coats, with the man donning a traditional hat, emphasizing cooler weather.\n\nThe older man appears to be holding a bag and a newspaper, while a woman adjacent to him, possibly middle-aged, carries several newspapers as well. Behind them, a younger woman in a bright yellow jacket is also holding a newspaper. This suggests that news consumption or distribution may be a theme or activity in this scene.\n\nThe commercial context is pronounced with a vintage sign for \"Cindy Sue's Bar-B-Q Snacks\" in the background which adds a distinct flair to the setting. This name, along with another sign reading \"Steaks Chickens Cocktails,\" indicates local dining options available in the area.\n\nThe vehicles parked along the street and the bare trees suggest this may be suburban or on the outskirts of a larger city. The underlying mood is one of a community or public gathering point, imbued with a hint of everyday street life energy and public engagement.","title":"CTA busman waits with commuters for bus at the Sheridan Road stop","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["546633","556277","546676","556199","549863","556222","547026","547190","554293","551941","554691","554354","551829","546672","549932","556214"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["newspaper","street","gathering","woman","consumption","flair","option","officer","distribution","dining"]}
