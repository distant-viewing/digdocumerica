{"path":"543122.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts an old, weathered wooden fence in a decayed and disassembled state surrounded by wild, arid landscape. The fence is primarily constructed of wooden posts and beams. The tops of several posts are carved into blunt points, suggesting a purposeful design, perhaps for aesthetic or functional reasons. The wood shows substantial wear and weathering, indicating age and exposure to elements.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent wooden post also shows significant signs of weathering and erosion, its surface rough and cracked. Scrubby, low-lying brush and wild grasses dominate the vegetation, indicative of a dry, possibly mountainous region.\n\nThe background reveals a gently sloping hillside covered in similar brush, extending out to a faded horizon under a clear blue sky. The scene suggests a remote or abandoned area, evoking a sense of desolation and the passage of time. Further back, partly visible, appears to be a similar structure or perhaps other fences, contributing to an impression of an area once actively used, now neglected or forgotten.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of serene abandonment, emphasizing themes of decay, the relentless passage of time, and the resilience of nature reclaiming human-altered landscapes.","title":"A wooden tombstone and cemetery in Bodie State Historical Park.
