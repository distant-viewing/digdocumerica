{"path":"552335.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene, primarily focusing on the dramatic sky and a body of water beneath. The sky is a canvas of vibrant colors ranging from dark blue to pink, orange, and yellow hues that radiate outward from the setting sun. There are scattered wispy clouds that are illuminated by the fading sunlight, adding texture and depth to the sky.\n\nBelow the expansive sky, there's a view of a calm sea that mirrors some of the sunset's colors. The boddeif water is interspersed with land masses – possibly small islands or peninsulas – adding a sense of scale and geography to the scene.\n\nThe foreground features dark silhouettes of conifer trees, which frame the photograph and provide a natural, rugged contrast to the softness of the sky. This framing by the trees helps to draw the viewer's eye towards the center where the sunset colors are most vibrant.\n\nOverall, the composition utilizes the natural lines of the horizon and the forms of the trees to guide the viewer through the scene, while the tranquil setting and the gentle fade of daylight into dusk evoke a peaceful, contemplative mood.","title":"Puget Sound and the San Juan Islands at sunset, seen from overlook at Larrabee State Park","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["552338","557447","552277","552294","557497","554759","545000","554396","547719","554731","550646","546100","554404","544707","547731","544711"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","geography","masse","canvas","peninsula","softness","viewer","island","framing","sky"]}
