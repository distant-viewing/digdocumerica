{"path":"550235.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic natural setting featuring a riverbank with gently lapping waves. In the foreground, we see a man from behind walking along the edge of the water. He is wearing a pair of dark shorts and is otherwise shirtless. His posture suggests a leisurely stroll, possibly enjoying the serene environment around him.\n\nThe surroundings are densely vegetated with lush greenery, which indicates a vibrant, healthy ecosystem, likely during the summertime. Large stones and rocks are visible both submerged and alongside the riverbank, contributing to the rugged terrain. The lighting in the photograph suggests it's either late morning or early afternoon, as the sunlight illuminates the scene with a soft warmth.\n\nThe river itself has slight ripples and waves, reflecting the light differently in areas, creating a textured appearance on the surface of the water. The composition of the shot, being wide and encompassing, allows the viewer to appreciate not only the activity of the man but also the serene, untouched natural environment he is in. This gentle and peaceful setting evokes a sense of calm and connection to nature.","title":"Strolling along ceaselessly eroding strip of Huntington Beach on lake erie","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550826","549012","542555","545031","550238","555376","542509","550839","546171","544994","543628","550234","557106","542653","552976","553439"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["riverbank","lapping","summertime","appreciate","wafe","warmth","vegetate","connection","ecosystem","shot"]}
