{"path":"554299.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features a bustling urban street scene likely from the mid-to-late 20th century. The street is packed with a variety of vehicles, suggesting a busy metropolitan area. On the left side of the image, a small, distinctive white vehicle labeled \"Cushman 501\" is visible, marked as a property of the \"City of Traffic Dept. Enforcement.\" This compact utility vehicle is partially mounted on the curb.\n\nThe center and right of the image feature a variety of cars typical of the era, including sedans and what appears to be a luxury car. These vehicles show the characteristic design styles of the 1960s or 1970s, with sleek lines and prominent chrome detailing.\n\nOn the right, pedestrians are walking along the sidewalk. A man in a dark coat and a white hat and a woman in a light-colored coat are crossing the street, passing directly in front of a large delivery truck with \"Country Life Products Co.\" painted on its side.\n\nThe background scene is composed of tall buildings lined up along the street, housing various businesses. Notable among them is a sign for \"Hong Kong Inn\" visible above the street level.\n\nThe street itself is wet, possibly from recent rain, reflecting some of the signs and vehicle lights, adding a vibrant but slightly grimy feel to the urban environment. The atmosphere is typical of a busy city life with a slightly chaotic but dynamic energy typical of metropolitan areas of that period.","title":"A white mini-truck is part of the traffic on 47th street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556724","548388","549882","554293","551135","546626","548369","554297","549886","556710","550139","556734","549853","547369","545216","554551"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","vehicle","coat","luxury","delivery","variety","curb","chrome","detailing","housing"]}
