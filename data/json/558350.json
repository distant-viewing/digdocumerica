{"path":"558350.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an individual at work in a setting that resembles a factory or an industrial kitchen. The person, who appears to be focused on their task, is holding two tools dipped into a large metal pot filled with a red, viscous liquid, possibly melted chocolate or a similar substance.\n\nThe person is wearing a distinctive white cap marked with what seem to be company logos, complemented by a simple pair of eyeglasses. They are clothed in a striped apron layered over a white coat, suggesting a hygienic environment typical in food processing or preparation settings. Some splatters on the apron indicate the messy nature of the task.\n\nIn the background, the environment is equipped with metal machinery featuring gauges, dials, and heavy-duty knobs, reinforcing the industrial nature of the setting. These machines look robust and functional, designed presumably for the processing or creation of food products.\n\nOverall, this scene illustrates a moment of diligent work in food production, emphasizing attention to detail and the machinery involved in the process.","title":"Member of the donald dannheim family who operate a dairy and ice cream store.
