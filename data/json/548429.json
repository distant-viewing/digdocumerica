{"path":"548429.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an airport showing a United Airlines aircraft being serviced. The image features a four-engine jet airplane parked on the tarmac directly next to a boarding gate where an enclosed jet bridge connects the terminal to the aircraftâ€™s forward door. Visible on the airplane are the words \"UNITED\" prominently displayed along the upper fuselage.\n\nSeveral ground service vehicles and equipment are around the plane, including a baggage tractor and carts, a scissor lift truck for cargo loading, and various maintenance stands and ladders which are likely being used for servicing the aircraft. There are a few ground crew members in proximity to these vehicles, engaged in various tasks related to preparing or maintaining the airplane.\n\nThe overall setting suggests an active period of either arrival or departure preparation, focused on ensuring the aircraft's readiness for flight. The details and activities depicted show a typical array of ground operations common at commercial airports. The light and shadows indicate either early morning or late afternoon sunlight, enhancing the depth and texture of the photograph.","title":"Ground activity at Logan airport seen from 16th floor observation deck","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548130","553731","548428","548166","554092","547951","553730","547959","547810","546178","547824","545935","542720","548487","547237","542498"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["aircraft","airplane","airport","service","jet","boarding","arrival","tarmac","terminal","departure"]}
