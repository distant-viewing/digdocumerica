{"path":"555497.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a gas station, likely from the 1970s given the style of the vehicles and attire. In the forefront of the image, there's a bright yellow Chevrolet Camaro parked at a gas pump. A gas station attendant, dressed in a uniform with a name tag that reads \"Chris,\" is interacting with a woman seated in the driver's seat of the car. The attendant, who appears happy and engaged, is handing a piece of paper -- possibly a receipt -- to the woman in the car. Another attendant or possibly a customer, dressed similarly but with darker hair, is standing nearby holding a fuel nozzle and observing the interaction.\n\nThe woman in the driver's seat is seen from the side, with her hair styled in loose curls typical of the era. She seems to be looking at the attendant with attention as she takes the paper.\n\nIn the background, the setting is further identified as a gas station by the presence of additional fuel pumps and another light-colored sedan parked behind them. The environment suggests a routine yet pleasant interaction typical of full-service gas stations, where attendants would pump gas, clean windshields, and check vehicle fluids as part of their service.","title":"After a long winter without having a smiling service station operator offer to wash the windows and check the tires, a driver from west of the Cascades had to drive east of the mountains to find such service as at this station.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550096","557834","557685","555465","554898","555485","555498","555467","557893","555486","557766","555484","557831","555489","555490","557919"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["attendant","gas","pump","station","fuel","driver","seat","service","paper","nozzle"]}
