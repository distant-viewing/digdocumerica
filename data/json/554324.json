{"path":"554324.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures an urban scene focused on a graffiti-covered subway train. The train, painted in a muted, blue-grey color, has significant graffiti markings including \"LEO 170\" in large, rough white script on its side. This gives the image a gritty, urban feel. \n\nThe train has open windows and doors, revealing several passengers inside. The passengers appear diverse in terms of age and gender, engaging in various activities such as looking out the window, holding onto the bars, and conversing with fellow passengers. The interior lighting of the train casts a warm glow, contrasting with the darker, more subdued exterior.\n\nThe focus and framing of the photo place an emphasis on the contrast between the marked exterior of the train and the life going on within it. The overall mood captured is dynamic and somewhat tense, reflective of the energy often found in subway travel in a big city. The image dates to a period when subway graffiti was prevalent, suggesting themes of urban decay and community expression.","title":"Subway car","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554325","556811","548261","548263","548258","556653","548266","548253","556652","556690","556669","554326","556814","553823","548265","548260"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","subway","graffiti","passenger","exterior","script","gender","bar","marking","term"]}
