{"path":"545481.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"In the photograph, an elderly man is engaged in a scientific or medical activity involving a machine that appears to be connected to pulmonary function testing, often used to assess lung capacity and performance. He is standing upright and using a breath analyzer hose, which he holds with his mouth while covering one of his nostrils, a standard procedure for such tests.\n\nThe man is dressed in a blue and white patterned, short-sleeve shirt and dark slacks with a belt, wearing glasses. His body posture is straight as he focuses on performing the breathing task correctly.\n\nThe equipment beside him includes a tall, cylindrical blue unit possibly housing the mechanisms for measuring breath, connected via a sturdy metal frame to another unit with dials and knobs. Next to this, there's a larger cylindrical chamber and a recording device resembling a polygraph with a moving paper scroll showing real-time data, providing visual outputs of the breath measurements.\n\nThe setting suggests a typical medical or research laboratory environment of the 20th century, given the style of the equipment and furniture, like the simple chair in the background, which is indicative of clinical utility rather than comfort. The walls are plain and the floor is covered with what looks to be commercial carpeting, emphasizing the utilitarian nature of the space.","title":"After a lifetime of working in a cotton factory, Mr. George Lewis of Birmingham undergoes treatment for emphysema.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545480","556568","545395","556567","545482","545413","545416","556574","556569","545486","557829","545485","542665","545479","553035","556570"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["unit","output","recording","test","knob","procedure","capacity","slack","datum","measurement"]}
