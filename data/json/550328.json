{"path":"550328.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by a factory or plant. The image is taken under an overcast sky, contributing to a subdued lighting and a moody, almost somber, atmosphere. Prominent in the scene are multiple large structures, likely part of the industrial operations, with tall smokestacks from which significant amounts of white and gray smoke are billowing. This smoke rises into the sky, blending with the cloudy background and creating a dramatic visual effect.\n\nIn the foreground, there appears to be a vast pile of scrap materials, possibly metal, suggesting that this facility might be involved in manufacturing or processing using these resources. There are also pieces of machinery visible, such as cranes, which are presumably used to handle the materials.\n\nVisually, the photo has a distinct vintage or dated quality, possibly indicating it was taken several decades ago. The color balance is shifted towards cooler tones, with purples and blues dominating, which enhances the somewhat eerie and imposing industrial environment portrayed. The composition of the image, with its focus on the expansive plumes of smoke and the sprawling industrial setup, invites reflection on themes such as environmental impact and industrialization.","title":"Georgia Pacific paper plant going full blast--in Woodland on the St. Croix River","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["542999","545447","550344","546908","550676","552190","546884","551026","545446","546808","550336","550983","548068","557375","557218","545445"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","dominating","industrialization","scrap","material","balance","resource","amount","decade","purple"]}
