{"path":"553591.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a person inside what appears to be a fire lookout tower, surrounded by a beautiful, expansive view of a forested landscape. The person is partially visible on the right side of the frame, busily engaged in examining or operating a large, circular map table. The map table is detailed, possibly showing topographical information, and it dominates the foreground. The table includes a sighting instrument mounted on it, suggesting it is used for navigation or observation.\n\nThe background offers a stunning panoramic view of a mountainous region blanketed with dense forests under a clear sky. Two distinct layers of mountains can be seen fading into the horizon beneath a dusky sky, hinting at either early morning or late evening light conditions. The interior setting and the items suggest this space is used for monitoring and perhaps for emergency or environmental surveillance. This setting evokes a serene yet vigilant ambiance, highlighting the isolation and the expansive vantage point the lookout tower provides.","title":"In August 1973, a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain range near Sonora. Although in the center of the burn area, the Woods Forest Service lookout was unharmed. Mrs. Lois Carlson looks at the \"fire-finder\" in the tower, which was evacuated during the emergency.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["554452","554695","557178","542677","556907","554500","556929","556930","545515","556906","556936","545001","550604","554491","549448","557003"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["table","map","surveillance","tower","emergency","monitoring","navigation","forest","instrument","information"]}
