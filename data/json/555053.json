{"path":"555053.jpg","date":"March 1971","photographer":"","caption":"The image features a close-up of a plant, possibly a type of fern or thistle, displaying young fuzzy shoots or buds in vibrant detail. The plant has long, slender leaves covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, textured appearance that stands out sharply against the background. The stalk is adorned with thorns, suggesting it might provide a protective function for the plant or could be characteristic of its species.\n\nThe colors of the plant are rich and distinctive, with various shades of green and perhaps light yellow, suggesting the photo was taken in natural sunlight that highlights these details effectively. The backdrop is blurred with varying shades of dark green, hinting that this plant was likely photographed in a densely vegetated area, possibly a forest or woodland.\n\nThe focus of the photograph is narrow, drawing attention to the intricate details of the plant's emerging shoots and the texture of its leaves, while the rest falls softly out of focus, emphasizing the foreground against a diffuse, natural environment. This choice in depth of field enhances the delicate details of the plant while imparting an artistic quality to the photo.","title":"Devils club in the Queets River Valley of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553361","557617","555004","554587","554745","555884","557593","542573","543622","558077","554993","553074","553590","553366","550461","558079"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["plant","detail","bud","stalk","leave","choice","fern","dark","woodland","close"]}
