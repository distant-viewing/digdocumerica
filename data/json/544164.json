{"path":"544164.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of heavy vehicles on a rugged, possibly unpaved, road during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the low light conditions and overall deep blue tone of the image. The scene involves two main vehicles. The vehicle in the foreground features prominent headlights and is spraying a large amount of water onto the ground, possibly for dust control or road maintenance. This vehicle is equipped with a tank and nozzles specifically designed for distributing liquids.\n\nThe second vehicle, located slightly behind the first, is a large truck carrying a mound of dirt or some other type of material, with its headlights also visibly lit, providing illumination in the twilight. The environment is vast and open, hinting at a rural or undeveloped area. The sky is overcast, contributing to the moody, cold atmosphere of the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a scene of industrial or construction activity, likely focused on road work or land development, set in a desolate, expansive landscape. The time of day and weather conditions add to the drama and isolation of the setting.","title":"Hauling coal by night from the Navajo Mine to the Four Corners Generating Plant","placename":"Shiprock Peak (Ariz.)","location":"Shiprock Peak, Arizona","nn1":["553662","544169","547979","544061","547922","555866","549203","547232","555875","555608","545677","542538","556986","554809","544138","547523"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["vehicle","headlight","nozzle","road","drama","liquid","illumination","dust","condition","mound"]}
