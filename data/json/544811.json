{"path":"544811.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph presents a view from a darkened shelter, possibly a porch or pavilion, which frames a sunlit scene in a valley town. The framing structure features elaborate woodwork, including spindles and decorative cut-outs with elegant shapes, typical of Victorian architecture. Through this detailed wooden framework, we see a rural or semi-rural landscape with a dirt road running centrally through the image.\n\nThe background is dominated by arid, hilly terrain with sparse vegetation, suggesting a setting in a mountainous or high desert region. Several buildings are visible, primarily small, modest structures with simple designs. One prominent building is a large, light-colored structure with a flat roof, possibly a community or commercial building. Smaller structures, possibly residential or utility buildings, flank it.\n\nIn the distance, the hills rise gently and are dotted with scrub and low trees, typical of a dry environment. Also visible in the background are utility poles lining the road, emphasizing the small town or rural community feel of the area.\n\nOn the dirt road, a lone individual is visible walking away from the viewpoint, lending a sense of scale and human presence to the scene. The person's presence also adds a dynamic element to an otherwise tranquil and static rural setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its dark, intricate foreground and brightly lit, expansive background, creates a striking contrast and depth, guiding the viewer's eye from the details of the carved wood out into the broader landscape beyond.","title":"Colorado--Black Hawk","placename":"Black Hawk (Colo.)","location":"Black Hawk, Colorado","nn1":["551101","544285","556341","548664","546450","556333","556999","555881","551111","547354","555624","555609","555629","554562","557726","545283"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["town","pavilion","utility","woodwork","road","scrub","dirt","community","cut","shelter"]}
