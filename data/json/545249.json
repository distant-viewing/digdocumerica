{"path":"545249.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts an engaging and somewhat contrasting scene, featuring four individuals playing golf in the foreground, against an industrial backdrop. The setting includes a vividly blue sky and is framed by dark silhouette pine branches at the top, adding a natural framing element to the composition.\n\nForeground:\n- Four people are shown; three men and one woman. They are in various golfing stancesâ€”one appears to be taking a shot while the others watch. Their attire is typical of golfers, including caps and casual golfing clothes.\n\nMiddle ground:\n- There's a vibrant green golf course that serves as a playing area for the individuals. This patch of green is lush and well-maintained, running slightly uphill.\n\nBackground:\n- The industrial scene in the distance is marked by a large chimney emitting a billowing cloud of white smoke which stands out against the blue sky. A spherical, orange-colored structure, possibly a gas holder, adds a pop of color against the grayscale industrial equipment. Additional smoke plumes and structures suggest ongoing industrial activity.\n\nThis juxtaposition of leisurely and industrial elements within one frame creates a visually striking image that contrasts human relaxation and industrial activity. The presence of nature, industry, and recreation all in one view prompts reflection on their coexistence.","title":"Smokestack of Weyerhauser-Kraft pulp mill","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557512","543633","546959","554149","554492","553980","550180","554148","549283","549069","552608","548821","546513","554167","547286","545053"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["golf","holder","playing","smoke","pop","course","stance","pine","recreation","coexistence"]}
