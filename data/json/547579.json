{"path":"547579.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph shows a vividly rusticated industrial scene near a body of water. The focus of the image is a large, elevated crane-like structure towering on a dock. This structure, mainly supporting a red house-like box at the top, stands on dark metal stilts that form an intricate skeletal frame. The box has visible windows, hinting at its possible use as a control room or a sheltered workspace.\n\nTowards the right side of the frame is a red brick building, with a significant portion of its side visible. The building has large glass-paned doors that are painted in a shade of blue, adding a sharp contrast to the red brick. The doors have some signs of wear and tear, indicating aging or weathering effects.\n\nThe dock itself appears worn and somewhat derelict, with old wooden planks making up its pathway which leads towards the crane structure. There are no visible people, making the scene appear abandoned or in disuse. The backdrop features a calm water body and opposite shorelines that are vaguely discernible. The sky is overcast with a dull, cloudy atmosphere contributing to the moody, deserted feel of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the image captures a sense of old industrial activity now quiet and perhaps abandoned, standing against a natural water setting. The colors and composition add to the feeling of a bygone era of robust industrial use now in decline and disrepair. The mood is somber and reflective, evoking thoughts about the passage of time and changing industries.","title":"State pier--on Narragansett bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["551984","546067","547594","547575","547622","551954","547113","547581","547584","547582","543258","543320","547577","549300","548105","547474"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["abandon","box","crane","dull","dock","brick","door","stilt","tear","decline"]}
