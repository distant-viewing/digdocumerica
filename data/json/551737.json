{"path":"551737.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of outdoor activity at what appears to be a historical or significant building. The building, prominent in the background, features a distinctive architectural style with rounded turrets, a conical roof, and stone masonry. It gives an impression of being an old, grand structure, often associated with institutional or government buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, a group of workers is engaged in gardening tasks. There are four individuals visible; three are bending over, planting or arranging plants in a plot of prepared soil, while the fourth stands, holding what seems to be a rake or a similar tool. The garden area is well-maintained with sections marked out for different plants. Several flats of flowers and other gardening equipment like a wheelbarrow are also visible, suggesting active and organized landscaping efforts.\n\nThe setting includes a neatly trimmed lawn around the gardening area and an imposing staircase with a stone balustrade that leads up to the building. The composition of the image, with workers in the foreground and the grand building in the background, creates a contrast between manual labor and architectural elegance, emphasizing a moment of everyday work in a remarkable environment. The lighting suggests that the photograph was taken on a sunny day, contributing to the vibrant and active atmosphere.","title":"Workers from the New York City Department of Parks plant a huge bed of annuals at 80th Street and Central Park West near the Museum of Natural History.
