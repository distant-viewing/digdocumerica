{"path":"548092.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a well-developed urban area, showcasing a major highway intersection prominently featured in the center. Running vertically through the image is a wide highway, with multiple lanes in each direction, divided by a narrow grassy median. Horizontal to the highway, there is a symmetrical overpass bridging across, featuring exit and entrance ramps that spiral at its south end, forming a loop.\n\nThe surrounding area is densely populated with residential housing, arranged in grid-like patterns around the highway. Each block consists of single-story homes with varying roof colors and designs, surrounded by green trees and lawns. To the left of the highway, at the intersection, thereâ€™s a large parking area adjacent to a sizable commercial building, possibly a shopping center or large retail store.\n\nThe photograph captures the contrast between the organized, linear infrastructure of the roads and the clustered, organic layout of the residential areas. The green spaces and small patches of trees interspersed among the residential and commercial zones add a natural element to the urban environment. Overall, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the interplay between transport infrastructure and residential life in a typical urban setting.","title":"Freeway (Route I-5) runs directly through this established residential area of Northeast Portland.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548363","546713","546617","547770","546726","548411","546703","552719","546678","553015","555781","548332","553838","546612","547766","546616"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","intersection","spiral","median","ramp","loop","overview","infrastructure","overpass","shopping"]}
