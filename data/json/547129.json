{"path":"547129.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph shows a complex industrial site next to a body of water, likely a river, given the presence of a barge docked alongside the jetty. The scene captures various components likely associated with a construction or manufacturing process, possibly that of large equipment or parts for infrastructure projects.\n\nKey elements include:\n- Large, circular objects, perhaps sections of tanks or machinery, dominate the foreground. These are mounted on platforms with a network of beams and scaffolding around them, indicating ongoing construction or assembly.\n- A significant industrial structure, like a crane or gantry, extends over these circular parts. This structure looks robust, possibly used for heavy lifting.\n- Numerous smaller buildings and warehouses are spread throughout the site. These buildings are functional, boxy, and generally utilitarian in design.\n- In the periphery, there are various industrial materials scattered across the site, including pallets, barrels, and construction debris, which create a sense of active, heavy-duty operations.\n- To the far left, a sloped hill with a road running parallel to the site suggests the location is on a raised bank or cliff over the water, emphasizing a strategic placement for waterway access.\n- Vehicles, including what appears to be a mobile crane and several cars, are parked around the site, suggesting the presence of workers or ongoing operations during the time the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the composition presents a vivid portrayal of industrial activity, possibly related to manufacturing, construction, or energy sectors, with various components being built or assembled, ready for transportation or installation. The location beside the water facilitates logistical operations involving the movement of large, heavy components.","title":"Generating station of Consumer Power Plant in Ludington","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["555796","549526","551988","548346","552007","551994","546833","552207","550886","550890","547214","552206","551976","549494","548423","555776"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["site","component","construction","manufacturing","operation","crane","lifting","pallet","scaffold","sector"]}
