{"path":"544389.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene where a group of people are enjoying the landscape at a lakeside road. In the foreground, a vintage car (possibly from the 1960s or 1970s) with its trunk open is parked on the side of the road. The trunk seems to contain some items, perhaps travel essentials or equipment for a day out.\n\nThere are five individuals standing near the car. The group appears to be engaged in either conversing or taking in the scenic view. They are dressed in casual summer outfits suitable for warm weather; their attire includes shorts, dresses, and light shirts. The gesture of one person with their hand around another suggests a relaxed and friendly atmosphere among them.\n\nJust beyond the road where the group stands, there is a vast body of blue water, likely a lake, reflecting the bright sky. The lake is bordered by distinct natural formations; large round rock formations emerge prominently near the shore. In the distant background, majestic mountain ridges create a striking contrast with their rugged outlines against the sky. The layers of the mountains, along with the texture and colors, add a dramatic backdrop to the scene, illustrating a typical arid or semi-arid landscape.\n\nOverall, this image conveys a sense of leisure and exploration, likely capturing a moment of travel and appreciation of natural beauty in a desert-like setting.","title":"Arizona--near Page","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["553133","544853","550649","557684","545596","544002","555386","546093","548963","547773","543856","554485","543998","548303","549368","548748"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["travel","group","trunk","road","essential","formation","lake","appreciation","mountain","shorts"]}
