{"path":"545887.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a large mining operation, specifically focusing on a massive red and white crane situated in the center of the scene. The crane is quite large and robust, positioned on a circular platform, suggesting it may be capable of rotating. The crane's arm extends diagonally across the image, emphasizing its length and reach.\n\nThe environment around the crane is rugged and heavily excavated, with visible layers of earth and various shades of soil and rock. The ground appears muddy and uneven, with tracks from vehicles and machinery imprinting the soft earth. To the right side of the crane, darker, deeper areas suggest recent or ongoing digging activities, possibly coal or mineral extraction.\n\nThe overall terrain is expansive and open, with no vegetation in sight, highlighting the industrial nature of the scene. Paths and tracks crisscross the landscape, indicating regular movement of trucks or heavy machinery. The background hints at a broader mining area with similar excavation characteristics spread out over a large region.\n\nThere is no visible presence of people in the immediate vicinity of the crane, suggesting the focal point of this photograph is the machinery and the scale of the mining operations rather than human activity. The lighting and shadows indicate that the photo was taken during daylight, contributing to the clarity and detail visible in the excavation siteâ€™s rugged textures.","title":"Big brown coal mine","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554770","545883","545831","544134","544157","555593","555586","554826","554545","545888","544156","544165","548775","555644","545655","552418"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["crane","mining","machinery","excavation","track","earth","sight","operation","extraction","characteristic"]}
