{"path":"550853.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene featuring a waterway and factory buildings. The image is taken from an elevated perspective looking down on a canal that passes through a series of locks. The canal is lined with green grassy areas and neatly trimmed hedges, and there are small walking paths along its sides.\n\nThe main building in the view is large with a flat roof, constructed of bricks painted in beige and brown tones, indicative of mid-20th-century industrial architecture. It encompasses multiple sections and connected parts, forming an L-shape as it wraps around the canal. Some sections feature large, arched windows.\n\nTo the left of the scene, there's a larger body of water, possibly a river, and part of another building with a visible chimney emitting smoke, suggesting ongoing industrial activity. On the right side, beyond the main factory, a train is seen passing by, composed of numerous yellow and red cars, hinting at the transport of goods or raw materials related to the factoryâ€™s operations.\n\nTrees and lush foliage surround the area, adding a natural frame to the industrial setting. The overall composition juxtaposes human-made industrial elements with natural waterways and greenery which enhances the depth and complexity of the scene.","title":"Consolidated paper company at appleton, near the northern tip of lake winnebago in the fox river valley","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["551156","547529","548070","546395","557295","554630","557377","550855","550956","551113","557223","550856","545996","544328","550890","549526"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["canal","factory","pass","waterway","lock","hedge","walking","section","encompass","wrap"]}
