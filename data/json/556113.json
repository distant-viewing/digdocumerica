{"path":"556113.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an indoor scene, likely within a railway or transit office, marked by a sign that reads \"CONDUCTORS.\" The image shows two men focused on their tasks. On the right, a man wearing a conductor's uniform complete with a cap is standing at a counter, writing on a clipboard resting on an open, well-thumbed book or folder. He is an older gentleman, paying close attention to his work.\n\nOn the left, inside the office framed by a window, another man can be seen. He is wearing glasses and a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt. He stands behind the counter, looking down at some papers or a book, projecting an aura of concentration and professionalism.\n\nThe office is equipped with simple, functional furniture including a wooden counter where interactions take place. Above the window, there is a fluorescent light fixture that illuminates the scene. The overall lighting and details suggest a focus on efficiency and clarity within the workspace. The ambience relayed by the photograph is one of orderly activity and dedicated work typical of a railway or similar setting.","title":"Conductor checks scheduling information at the Wenatchee, Washington, depot for the Expo '74 passenger train which makes a 10 minute stop enroute from Spokane to Seattle.
