{"path":"554914.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts a dynamic scene in a rustic farm-like setting. In the foreground, a vibrant rooster with a prominent red comb and shimmering feathers in shades of red, orange, and black stands vividly against a muted backdrop. This rooster, with its tail feathers elegantly arched and black, is the focal point of the image. In the background, another chicken, which is partially obscured and appears to be white and reddish-brown, is also visible, adding to the rural atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe ground is patchy with dry dirt and some scattered vegetation, typical of a poultry yard. The background suggests a simple, agricultural environment with possible structures like a coop or barn, though details are not fully visible due to the depth of field and lighting.\n\nThe image is partially framed by what appears to be a wire mesh on the right side, hinting that the photo might have been taken from behind a fence, which contributes to an onlooker's perspective into this small slice of farm life. The lighting and shadow suggest either early morning or later afternoon sunlight, enriching the colors and textures in the scene. Overall, the image captures a lively and natural farm environment highlighting the everyday life of farmyard poultry.","title":"Gamecocks raised for fighting near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554946","554927","554947","551326","543117","549115","547406","546759","547394","547043","557202","550608","557614","552562","554917","544547"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["farm","feather","mesh","onlooker","tail","barn","slice","yard","wire","life"]}
