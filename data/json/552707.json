{"path":"552707.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a distinctive fisheye lens view, capturing an upward perspective of a circular cityscape. The circular frame, created by the lens, encircles a view of ornate, classical architecture. Buildings, curving around the edge of the circle, feature detailed façades with multiple rows of windows, some adorned with flags. These structures create an enclosing ring centered around a glimpse of a cloudy sky.\n\nAt the base of the photograph, multiple people can be seen. They appear very small due to the lens distortion and are mostly scattered around the edges of the circle. Due to the extreme wide-angle perspective, the people look slightly stretched and skewed towards the outer edges.\n\nThe photograph is bathed in natural light, seemingly taken either in the late morning or early afternoon, judging by the softness and angle of the light that gently touches the building tops. This innovative composition effectively captures a slice of urban life and architecture, turning a typical street scene into a dramatic and engaging visual experience.","title":"Fisheye view from center courtyard of City Hall","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["547210","546745","549971","557274","551493","545429","549991","553845","548417","550198","548392","549317","549681","551510","548384","552394"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["lens","circle","edge","angle","ring","softness","perspective","architecture","façade","experience"]}
