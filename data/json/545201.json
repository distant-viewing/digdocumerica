{"path":"545201.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a residential area with multiple buildings in a suburban setting. In the foreground, there is a range of multi-story apartment buildings in shades of brown and green, typical architectural colors for blending with natural surroundings. These buildings feature balconies, some of which have visible outdoor items like chairs and plants.\n\nPsychologically, the image has a mix of personal and communal dwellings evident through the presence of both apartments and houses. Directly in front of these buildings, there are parked vehicles which include cars and vans in various colors such as red, white, and yellow, suggesting individual ownership and possibly a middle-class neighborhood.\n\nThe middle ground of the image gradually transitions into a natural landscape. The presence of a hill at the back shows diverging vegetation, predominantly covered in grass with sporadic trees, indicating the suburban spread into more rural or less urbanized territories.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph and its elements—from built environments to natural landscapes—provides a snapshot of residential life in such areas, showcasing the balance between human habitation and natural elements. The weather seems overcast, casting a muted light over the scene, which complements the tranquility of a residential community not bustling with immediate activity.","title":"Apartments and houses rise in tiers below the hilly farmlands of King City.","placename":"King City (Or.)","location":"King City, Oregon","nn1":["557547","557454","557427","557552","548011","553929","557405","553704","557404","558057","553700","553939","556601","558059","543106","547433"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Residential Neighborhoods"],"terms":["apartment","ownership","dwelling","class","show","van","building","balance","balcony","habitation"]}
