{"path":"553355.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil river scene, characterized by calm, reflective waters and lush greenery. The river is central in the image and mirrors the sky and trees lining its banks, creating a serene symmetry. On both sides of the river, dense forests of deciduous trees are visible. Their full canopies suggest that the season is either late spring or summer.\n\nOn the left side, the trees are darker and more silhouetted, contributing to a mood of depth and richness. In contrast, the trees on the right appear lighter and more varied in color, indicating possibly different species or varying light exposure. \n\nAt the far end of the river, a bridge is partially visible, connecting two land masses. This man-made structure, depicted in a small scale, seamlessly integrates into the natural landscape, hinting at human activity without overwhelming the natural beauty. \n\nThe foreground is slightly dominated by budding branches of a tree, these are likely early blooms suggesting the season might still be spring.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is peaceful and contemplative, with a composition that draws the viewerâ€™s eye along the river towards the bridge, inviting exploration of the tranquil waters and the lush, inviting landscape that surrounds it. The lighting is soft, likely taken on an overcast day, which further enhances the calm atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Looking across the Merrimack River to the mouth of the Nashua River.","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["550845","550782","557239","557996","557106","546963","550656","550839","550844","542844","555076","554753","554775","554629","547526","542653"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","spring","season","bridge","masse","richness","tree","symmetry","bloom","specie"]}
