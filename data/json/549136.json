{"path":"549136.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged outdoor landscape dominated by a large, steep hill covered in a white, crumbly material that appears similar to chalk or dry clay. Scattered across the hillside are small rocks and boulders, most of which have a reddish-brown hue that contrasts with the light color of the ground. A few sparse patches of vegetation, possibly grasses or small shrubs, are also visible emerging from the arid soil.\n\nThe angle of the shot is upward, focusing on the slope and lending a sense of scale and steepness to the terrain. This perspective emphasizes the texture and roughness of the surface, highlighting the fragmented, almost porous quality of the material.\n\nIn the background, beneath a bright and partly cloudy sky, the top edge of the hill meets the horizon. The clouds are fluffy and white, providing a stark contrast against the deep blue of the sky. The overall lighting suggests a sunny day with strong sunlight casting shadows and enhancing the texture of the hill's surface. The image evokes a sense of remote, natural environment, possibly indicating a geological site of interest or a challenging hiking terrain.","title":"In 20 years nothing has grown on this old spoil pile from a strip mine near Colstrip.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["555616","549184","545899","557100","549179","549130","555589","551233","550585","542518","545895","546385","543635","549147","552685","555592"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hill","clay","hiking","material","boulder","emerge","hillside","challenge","terrain","shot"]}
