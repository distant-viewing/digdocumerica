{"path":"554037.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures two elderly women sitting behind a wooden counter in a rustic store setting, probably located in a rural or semi-rural environment. The women appear amiable and relaxed, engaging informally perhaps as if catching up or sharing a moment of friendliness amidst daily routines.\n\nThe counter they are sitting behind features a large hand-painted sign that reads “THE NEIGHBORHOOD STORE” in multicolored, slightly irregular capital letters, characterizing the store’s local and perhaps informal nature. Below this main sign, there is a smaller, worn-out sign with the word “STORE” reiterated, suggesting a casual or resourceful approach to signage, likely indicative of the store's functional and straightforward nature.\n\nOn the counter and within reach of the women are various items suggesting the operation of a small retail business. Visibly, there is a Coca-Cola bottle case, hinting at the store dealing in common beverages. There are also some other indistinct packaged goods likely to be retail products.\n\nThe setting around the counter is modest and appears to be part of a larger structure built from raw and natural materials, possibly wood or bamboo, typical of traditional constructions in certain rural areas. These details suggest a setting that relies on locally available resources and caters primarily to the surrounding community, providing basic essentials and a gathering place for social interaction.","title":"Store in Pukoo area","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["547805","557767","554036","554895","557763","557686","556176","554866","553484","547796","546226","556207","555377","551342","553541","547184"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["counter","store","essential","woman","reach","case","capital","sign","approach","beverage"]}
