{"path":"556458.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a man sitting on wooden stairs outside a building. The man is dressed in a dark green work uniform, consisting of a shirt and trousers, and he is wearing dark boots with green socks. He has a friendly expression, smiling slightly with his eyes squinting a bit, suggesting that it is sunny. The man is holding a white mug in his right hand.\n\nHe is seated on a rugged wooden plank that forms one of the lower steps of a stairway. To his right is a wall enhanced with pale blue siding at the top and decorative, textured glass block panels near the bottom, likely providing both privacy and light to the interior.\n\nThe setting appears to be a work or construction environment, suggested by the informal attire of the man and the basic, utilitarian nature of the furnishings and building materials. Overall, the image portrays a casual, possibly break-time moment, imbued with a sense of warmth and relaxation.","title":"Paul Bryant, 39, a neighbor of Paul Davis in Newton, West Virginia, near Charleston.
