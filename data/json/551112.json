{"path":"551112.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene nestled in a lush green environment. Dominating the composition is a large industrial facility, possibly a factory or processing plant, located in a valley. The main structure is a sizable building with a rusted, metallic roof and weathered-looking walls. Several auxiliary buildings and structures, including silos and conveyor belts, are connected to this main building, suggesting complex industrial operations.\n\nThe surrounding area is heavily forested, with dense trees covering the rolling hills in the background. A dirt road bisects the trees leading to and from the facility, and there is a distinct clearing where the forest has been cut away to accommodate power lines, which are visible as they cut through the greenery, mounted on tall utility poles.\n\nThe foreground includes a view of a terraced segment, possibly a road or another part of the industrial plant, adding depth to the scene. This foreground is shadowed, giving the impression that the photograph was taken from a higher elevation, likely from an opposite hill, offering a clear, unobstructed view of the facility and its interactions with the natural landscape. The colors in the scene are somewhat muted, with rich greens of the trees contrasting against the darker, more industrial tones of the factory buildings.","title":"Coal plant at harewood mine near boomer in the kanawha valley region","placename":"Charleston (W.
