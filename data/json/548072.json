{"path":"548072.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph presents a moody and mysterious scene dominated by dark shadows and an illuminated window. A silhouette of a man is visible, highlighted against the backdrop of a window that is covered with a blind, allowing strips of light to filter through and create a pattern. The manâ€™s head is bowed slightly forward, and he appears to be engaged in an activity, perhaps reading or looking at an object in his hands, but the specifics are not clear due to the darkness. His posture and the positioning suggest a moment of introspection or concentrated activity.\n\nAt the bottom right of the window, there seems to be a blurred, partly visible object, possibly another item on the window sill, contributing to the enigmatic feel of the scene. The environment and elements of this photograph evoke a sense of solitude and quietude, with the play of light and dark intensifying the overall dramatic effect.","title":"Fish-counting station with public viewing windows under construction at Bonneville Dam.
