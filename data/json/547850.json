{"path":"547850.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features an information sign standing in an area of natural beauty, likely within a park or wildlife refuge. The sign has a rectangular shape with a dark border and a white background. It reads \"Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge\" in bold, black lettering at the top. Below this, a list of various prohibited activities and requirements for visitors includes \"NO Dogs, Picnicing, Bicycles, Fishing\" and \"Visitors must have permit Department of Parks.\"\n\nThe sign is mounted on a vertical post which appears to be made of metal, with a series of bolts visible, securing the sign in place. The base of the post is surrounded by small rocks and debris, suggesting it is firmly anchored into the ground. \n\nThe setting around the sign includes lush green foliage, a grassy field, and shrubs with pink flowers that brighten up the scene. The vegetation suggests a well-maintained natural environment, typical for a wildlife refuge. The background includes a variety of bushy, dense trees and more open grass areas. The sky is not clearly visible but appears to be light, indicating overcast or bright diffuse lighting typical of an outdoor setting. This strategic placement of the sign also serves to inform and regulate the behavior of visitors to preserve the natural habitat.","title":"Nine thousand acres of salt marsh","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547865","547854","544228","554119","548846","557205","545109","550699","546386","543168","557489","554038","548836","544531","548845","550664"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["visitor","sign","wildlife","post","bolt","behavior","placement","information","border","lettering"]}
