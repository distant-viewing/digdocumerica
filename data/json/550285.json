{"path":"550285.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban decline featuring an old neoclassical building, likely once a place of importance, now showing signs of neglect. The building is characterized by a grand facade with four large, fluted columns supporting a pediment that projects out over a raised porch. The paint on the columns is visibly peeling, and there are signs of wear and damage around the windows and doors. A lone figure appears at the top of the steps leading to the building's main entrance, adding a human element to the scene.\n\nTo the right of this building is a small commercial establishment that starkly contrasts with the grandeur of the neoclassical architecture. The shop, with a sign reading \"SHIO\", is housed in a more modest and contemporary structure with large glass windows and a flat, unadorned facade. This juxtaposition of buildings highlights a mix of architectural styles and perhaps represents the economic shifts within the area.\n\nThe foreground features a street with visible traffic lines, and a sidewalk runs in front of both buildings, separated from the road by a curb. A light pole stands at the corner near the commercial building, contributing to the urban street scene.\n\nThe background, although less detailed, seems to be composed of residential homes, some of which also appear to be in a state of disrepair, similar to the larger building on the left. This setting contributes to the overall atmosphere of an area experiencing economic and physical decline.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, suggesting it is a sunny day, which casts sharp shadows and enhances the textures and colors in the scene, especially highlighting the deterioration of the buildings. Overall, the photograph captures a poignant moment of change and decay in an urban setting.","title":"Once home of the elegant Western Reserve Club, this classical building on East 55th Street is now a rooming house.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["555902","553472","553555","553478","550108","550140","552968","553557","557643","552757","553552","549785","550129","555952","550113","557634"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["decline","building","column","pediment","facade","deterioration","sign","shift","curb","importance"]}
