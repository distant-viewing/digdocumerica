{"path":"557855.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene, possibly within a factory or a testing facility. On the left side of the image, a man wearing a light blue uniform with short sleeves is interacting with a vehicle, specifically adjusting or inspecting the window on the driver’s side of a blue car. His back is partially turned toward the camera.\n\nOn the right side of the image, another man dressed in a striped, short-sleeved shirt and wearing a white cap is standing beside the car. He appears to be looking at or working on something on the car’s side or its interior, but his exact activity is not completely visible.\n\nIn the forefront and a bit out of focus, there is a dark control panel with at least two prominent red buttons illuminated from within, suggesting some monitoring or control functionality.\n\nThe background is relatively simple and clean, featuring a large, smooth metallic wall with vertical ridges painted in teal-green. Below this wall is a yellow strip running along the base, adding a contrasting color detail to the otherwise monochromatic backdrop.\n\nThe scene suggests an environment focused on vehicle inspection or quality control, with emphasis on precision and attention to detail. The incorporation of control equipment in the image further supports the idea of a technical setting where specific parameters or functions of the vehicles are being monitored or adjusted.","title":"Employee of an auto emission inspection station in Norwood Ohio, talking to a customer whose station wagon has just failed the carbon monoxide emission test.
