{"path":"543219.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a midday scene in a commercial parking lot. At the center of the frame, a man is seen from behind, walking towards the camera. He is dressed in a blue short-sleeved shirt and blue pants, accessorized with a black belt and black shoes. The man is carrying four large, freshly caught fish, two in each hand by the gills, suggesting he might have just returned from a fishing trip.\n\nIn the background, there's a single-story building that houses various establishments including a place labeled \"Carniglia Bros Sea Food.\" The name along with neon signs advertising cocktails indicates a blend of a seafood market and a bar or restaurant. The architecture is utilitarian with a flat facade and large windows partially covered by a patterned tile border.\n\nThe parking lot is dotted with cars from an era that suggests the photo was taken in the mid-20th century; prominent in the foreground is a bright orange car to the left and a station wagon to the right.\n\nThe overall ambiance is one of a bustling yet casual commercial area possibly located near a waterfront, given the seafood-focused businesses and the presence of freshly caught fish. The scene is lit by bright sunlight, indicating clear skies and contributing to the sharp shadows and vibrant colors captured in the image.","title":"California--Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["549885","548297","550297","544995","554098","550032","545951","545180","550128","545192","550320","557687","554095","545154","545333","543210"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["seafood","fish","lot","parking","restaurant","neon","tile","advertising","bar","trip"]}
