{"path":"549540.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures a striking and architecturally interesting view that incorporates a large waterfall, a bridge, and a building. In the foreground, there's a metallic bridge with two levels, which is attached to a tall, glass-fronted building. This unusual combination creates a vertical symmetry, drawing the eye upward toward the building and across towards the scenic background.\n\nIn the background, the magnificent, wide waterfall cascades powerfully down, creating a mist that rises and blends with the air, hinting at the force and volume of the water. The waterfall is flanked by natural rocky outcrops and lush greenery, suggesting that this scene is set in a location rich with natural beauty.\n\nOn the bridge, several people can be observed walking and standing, likely enjoying the view of the waterfall. Their presence adds a human element to the scene, providing a sense of scale and activity.\n\nThe far background beyond the bridge is softly focused, featuring more greenery and some areas of open park space, likely a popular spot for visitors to relax and take in the surroundings.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—with its combination of industrial architecture and natural beauty, human activity and the raw power of the waterfall—creates a visually compelling scene that highlights both human ingenuity and nature's prowess.","title":"American Niagara Falls and observation tower","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549563","549466","549548","553354","549545","548870","549547","549552","549557","557745","550669","550736","553387","553386","550979","545874"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["waterfall","bridge","combination","cascade","symmetry","volume","outcrop","standing","greenery","force"]}
