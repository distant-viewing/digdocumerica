{"path":"556723.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene that predominantly features vintage cars and a single pedestrian. On the left side of the frame, there's a red classic Mustang parked behind a blue-gray car resembling a Mercury Capri or a similar model. Both vehicles are facing towards the camera, hinting that they are parked along the side of the street.\n\nOn the right, the composition includes a pedestrian, appearing to be a woman dressed in a green coat with a black bag slung over her shoulder. She is walking away from the viewer, toward the direction of traffic signage.\n\nThere are multiple street signs visible: One indicating a \"One Way\" direction on the left top and another indication of \"Two Way Traffic Ahead\" next to it. There's also a curbside sign showing parking regulations: \"TWO HOUR PARKING 7 AM - 6:30 PM.\"\n\nThe background features lush green trees and a large structure in the distance, giving the image an urban feel balanced with greenery. The scene is completed with a well-defined zebra crossing in the foreground. The ambiance is typical of a calm, urban street landscape in what could be the 1970s or 1980s, based on the vehicle models and photographic aesthetic.","title":"Car extends into a crosswalk where its driver parked it illegally during a bus strike in Washington, District of Columbia during May, 1974. Some 250,000 people were forced to find alternate methods of transportation, usually the auto. Monumental traffic jams were the result as drivers learned there were more cars than legal places to park. As a result they used bus lanes, traffic \"islands\", \"no parking\" zones, sidewalks and lawns. Normally 1,800 buses are on the streets.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556709","556726","556724","556718","551913","556715","556753","554297","556711","550139","556707","546626","549882","549872","555944","556734"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["pedestrian","way","direction","street","model","regulation","crossing","indication","hour","car"]}
