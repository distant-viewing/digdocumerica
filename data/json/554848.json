{"path":"554848.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts a man crouching by a riverside. He is dressed in a white shirt and pants, which suggest a formal or semi-formal attire. The man appears to be collecting samples or examining the water, as he holds small bottles in his hands filled with a liquid, likely samples from the river.\n\nThe setting is a tranquil outdoor scene by a river bank covered with an abundance of rounded stones. The river water is calm with just a slight ripple, reflecting the overcast sky. Thick, lush greenery and trees can be seen in the background on the opposite side of the river, suggesting a rural or undeveloped area. The overcast sky hints at a cloudy day, possibly with a cool temperature, emphasizing the serenity and natural beauty of the environment.\n\nThe composition of the photo focuses on the man's interaction with the environment, capturing his engagement in the activity which seems to be for the purpose of environmental or water quality monitoring. The colors are natural and muted, contributing to the overall serene and somber mood of the scene.","title":"A local health officer taking a water sample from the Frio River near Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552110","542556","548956","550962","549012","546847","546922","544994","548831","550235","543829","546331","551406","547718","542509","549059"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["sample","river","abundance","temperature","monitoring","serenity","liquid","riverside","bottle","man"]}
