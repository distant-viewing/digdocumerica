{"path":"548525.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant maritime scene, likely taken during a sunny day. The image shows three people on a motorboat traveling away from the camera at a moderate speed, causing water to churn and form waves behind the boat. All individuals appear relaxed and involved in their journey.\n\nThe boat is a small, open motorboat with a classic design, painted white and red with a noticeable stripe detail. One person sits at the front of the boat, seemingly enjoying the breeze, with their back to the camera. Another person, with his back also to the camera, operates the boat from the rear left side. The third person is partially visible, seated next to the operator.\n\nIn the background, a range of other boats varying in size and color are moored along docks that line both sides of a water channel. The setting suggests a boat marina, possibly in a busy, urban area considering the various businesses and residential apartments visible along the waterfront. The visible signs, such as the \"Gulf\" gas station, echo the period feel of the setting. The architecture includes multi-story buildings with large windows and balconies, painted in standard brick and muted colors, characteristic of waterfront developments.\n\nOverall, the image reflects a leisurely yet dynamic water activity, possibly within a coastal city, capturing a moment of maritime recreation combined with urban scenic views.","title":"Annapolis harbor","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548736","550840","548520","552050","554199","546317","548080","552316","548058","549418","548078","548518","549414","546912","546348","542912"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","motorboat","waterfront","camera","person","back","churn","echo","operator","consider"]}
