{"path":"552596.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an atmospheric sunset scene on a highway. The sun is setting behind mountains in the background, casting a warm golden glow and creating a silhouette effect on the ridges of the mountains. The sky displays a rich gradation of warm tones, transitioning from a yellowish-orange near the horizon to deeper hues above.\n\nThe highway, taking up a sizable portion of the frame, stretches straight into the distance, then gently curves left as it disappears into the landscape. The road appears slightly wet, reflective in areas, which suggests recent rain or dew. Alongside the road, the terrain is uneven and features some wild shrubbery and patches of grass.\n\nOn the highway, there are three visible vehicles traveling in the same direction away from the viewpoint. They are spaced out, with the nearest car being a classic model, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s, highlighting the era the photograph might have been taken. The cars’ headlights are on, cutting through the dimming light.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is serene, underscored by the soft lighting and the seemingly quiet movement of the day’s end. The scene is likely to evoke a sense of calm or nostalgia.\n\nThe composition of the photograph utilizes a perspective view, drawing the eye along the road toward the sunset, effectively guiding the viewer through the scene. This placement and the lighting emphasize the depth of the landscape and convey a tranquil passage through time and space.","title":"Rifle, the major town of the Piceance Basin, is located on the Colorado River.
