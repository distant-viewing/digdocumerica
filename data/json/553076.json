{"path":"553076.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and lush wildflower field. The field is predominantly filled with yellow flowers, each featuring a prominent brownish-black center. The blooms are interspersed with a few pinkish flowers that stand out due to their size and distinct color against the majority yellow blooms. These flowers appear to be coreopsis, a common wildflower known for its striking, daisy-like appearance.\n\nThe flowers are set against a backdrop of fresh green grass, enhancing the vivid colors of the petals. In the background, you can see large trees with thick, sprawling branches, indicating a mature, possibly oak variety, typical of grassland or open woodland landscapes.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with a hint of blue peering through, suggesting a bright, sunny day. The composition of the photo, with its focus on the foreground filled with flowers and the majestic tree line in the distance, creates a perspective that draws the viewer into this serene, natural setting. The depth of field is shallow, with the focus primarily on the flowers near the center, softly blurring the background and lending an ethereal quality to the scene. This peaceful, natural setting evokes a sense of calm and beauty intrinsic to wildflower meadows.","title":"(From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
