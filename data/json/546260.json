{"path":"546260.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph displays a scene at a scrapyard or recycling facility, particularly focusing on a heap of crushed and compressed vehicles. On the left and stretching into the center of the image, a large mechanical claw, likely part of a crane or similar heavy machinery, is visible. The claw has a few automobiles in its grasp, showcasing the process of moving these crushed cars possibly for sorting or further crushing.\n\nThe background is dominated by a structure that seems to be part of the facility, possibly a control room. This building has large windows allowing a view into the interior, and the structure is made of metal with industrial designs. It rises directly from behind the maze of metals and conveyors used to manage the scrap materials.\n\nThe image is set against a clear blue sky, indicating it might be during favorable weather conditions. The equipment and facility appear aged and heavily used, indicative of an industrial environment dealing with heavy materials and requiring robust machinery. The general atmosphere is that of an industrial setting focused on recycling automotive parts and vehicles.","title":"Old cars are being dropped into compression feeder at car shredding plant of klean steel manufacturing corporation in Flowood.
