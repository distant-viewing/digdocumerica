{"path":"546599.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling parking lot scene from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s, given the styles of the cars and fashion. The parking lot is filled with a variety of vehicles, prominently highlighting sedans and station wagons with designs typical of the era, featuring vivid colors and distinct body shapes. There are many vehicles with a mix of colors including yellows, blues, whites, reds, and greens.\n\nIn the background, there are groups of people and some solo pedestrians walking along a sidewalk adjacent to a building with a plain, brick facade. A few individuals are engaged in activities such as walking or conversing with one another. Visible behind the sidewalk are multiple bicycles parked near a lamppost, indicating a bike parking area.\n\nThe parking lot itself is located in what appears to be a suburban commercial or possibly a university setting, suggested by the style of architecture and the casual dress of the people. The overall atmosphere of the scene captures a day-to-day moment, likely during a midday or early afternoon timeframe given the hard shadows and bright sunlight.","title":"Parking area at Woodward High School on Old Georgetown Road in Bethesda, MD","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546731","556204","556773","556736","556201","548496","554617","549858","556790","556801","546879","547826","554349","549885","556722","547954"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["parking","lot","sidewalk","timeframe","lamppost","bike","wagon","bicycle","midday","sedan"]}
