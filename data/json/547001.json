{"path":"547001.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph was taken beneath a pier, presenting a unique and striking composition. The frame is mostly filled with the geometric patterns and sturdy silhouettes of wooden pier pylons and cross braces, which create a series of triangular and polygonal shapes throughout the image. Light filters through these openings, illuminating patches of the wet sand floor and accentuating the forms' textured surfaces.\n\nIn the midground, a child is captured in motion, seemingly running along the waterâ€™s edge beneath the pier. The figure of the child is in silhouette against the brighter background of the sandy beach and the shimmering ocean. Sunlight reflects off the water, providing a bright contrast to the predominantly darker, shaded area under the pier.\n\nIn the background, beyond the confines of the pier structure, the open beach is visible. Figures can be seen engaging in beach activities, with the ocean horizon stretching across the top portion of the image. The sky appears clear and well-lit, suggesting it might be late afternoon or early evening given the quality of the light and the long shadows.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of youthful energy and the tranquility of a beach setting, juxtaposed with the architectural and almost abstract quality of the pier structure above. The use of light and shadow, combined with the dynamic composition, gives the image a vibrant yet serene feeling.","title":"On the beach at isle of palms, popular ocean resort","placename":"South Carolina","location":"South Carolina","nn1":["552241","557511","547867","550241","544203","542890","543215","543493","550233","552341","547009","549105","543225","547083","550310","547091"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["pier","beach","confines","silhouette","pylon","child","figure","brighter","shaded","quality"]}
