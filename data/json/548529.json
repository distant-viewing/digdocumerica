{"path":"548529.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene on a sunny day at a seaside pier. A group of people, consisting of men, women, and children of various ages, is gathered on a wooden pier deck, with the expansive blue sea visible in the background. The majority of individuals are engaged in conversation or enjoying the view, creating a casual and relaxed atmosphere.\n\nThe attire of the people suggests a setting from a past decade, possibly the 1960s or 70s, judging by the fashion such as polka dot and patterned dresses, wide collared shirts, and flared pants. One man, central in the frame, holds what appears to be an ice cream cone, further adding to the leisurely vibe of the setting. Many of the adults are wearing sunglasses and summer clothing, fitting for a day out by the water.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with people scattered across the pier and engaged in various activities, along with the bright sunlight and clear sky, conveys a sense of warmth and communal enjoyment typical of a pleasant day out by the sea.","title":"Tourists on the public beach pier","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548533","551711","545176","544185","547009","550243","550228","546874","549329","547503","550026","554176","549373","553446","555923","546794"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["pier","flar","sea","leisurely","cone","70","polka","fitte","seaside","majority"]}
