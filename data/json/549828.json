{"path":"549828.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a high-angle view of a multi-level urban infrastructure. The image prominently features an elevated, double-decker bridge with the upper deck supporting a group of cyclists pedaling in a single line. The lower deck of the bridge houses rows of parked cars under a partially shaded area, suggesting it could be a parking structure or an under-bridge parking zone. Adjacent to this bridge is a lush park area, dotted with various trees, bushes, and neatly manicured grass.\n\nA river or body of water can be seen on one side of the bridge, reflecting sunlight, which adds a dynamic, sparkling texture to the lower left corner of the image. The peaceful coexistence of recreational, transportation, and natural elements in a dense urban setting is beautifully captured, illustrating a slice of city life where infrastructure and nature intertwine.","title":"A lovely, well-kept park at Manhattan's exclusive sutton place","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546588","546722","549469","546581","549815","546569","548418","548401","558049","547263","546704","546865","558051","548427","548414","546724"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","deck","parking","pedal","housis","sparkl","cyclist","manicure","parke","infrastructure"]}
