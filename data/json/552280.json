{"path":"552280.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph depicts three individuals standing on the deck of a ferry or ship, looking out over a large body of water under a clear blue sky. From left to right, we see two children and an adult. The child on the left, whose gender is not discernible, is decked out in a blue jacket and red pants, and appears to be leaning forward against the railing. The adult in the middle, most likely a woman given the visible hair and style of dress, has her blonde hair dramatically blowing in the wind. She is wearing a dark coat and seems to be holding a white object, possibly a handbag, under her arm while looking towards the water. The third figure, a young boy on the right, is wearing a dark jacket and light-colored pants, and is also gripping the railing and staring out at the sea.\n\nThe deck area where the figures are standing is enclosed with a metal railing and mesh, ensuring safety. The sea is choppy, with visible whitecaps indicating wind strength. In the distance, a landmass and a faint silhouette of a mountain range can be seen under the clear skies, suggesting a serene yet bracing environment. Overall, the atmosphere conveys a sense of tranquility mixed with a brisk, invigorating breeze typical of a sea voyage.","title":"Passengers on the Washington State ferry run between Edmonds and Kingston enjoy the view from the forward deck. The ferry system transports cars and passengers across Puget Sound. Bridges may be built someday if engineering problems can be solved at reasonable cost.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["547465","549373","543462","545728","545057","546840","554177","544269","552050","555976","549707","546812","554199","551960","549412","548523"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["railing","sea","wind","deck","whitecap","adult","ferry","strength","gender","handbag"]}
