{"path":"550411.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a river canyon filled with a large number of sheep, possibly being herded. The river appears to be shallow, as part of its bed is visible and it curves gently, creating a shiny, reflective surface where the water is deeper. The surrounding terrain includes lush green grass, indicating a well-watered and fertile landscape, possibly a highland or mountain valley.\n\nThe image captures the natural form of the landscape with sharp color contrasts; the greens of the grass are vivid against the grays and whites of the riverbed and the sheep. The photo's perspective, taken from above, emphasizes the mass movement of the sheep along the river, highlighting their density and the way they almost blend into the texture of the river environment due to their color and clustering. It also captures a sense of tranquility and isolation, owing to the absence of visible human activity or modern infrastructure. The soft light suggests it may be either early morning or late afternoon.","title":"A near vertical view of the atigun river east of its intersection with the pipeline.
