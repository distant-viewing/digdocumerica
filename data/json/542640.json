{"path":"542640.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant, colorful scene at an outdoor parking lot filled with numerous cars. In the foreground, a red sports car, specifically a Datsun 240Z, is featured prominently. It’s mounted on a rust-colored, four-post lift structure, likely for maintenance or display purposes.\n\nAbove the car, mounted on the lift’s top frame, is a small, metallic sculpture of a bird, adding a quirky artistic element to the industrial setting. The car shows distinctive features like the sleek, aerodynamic body shape, a rear hatch, and chrome bumpers, indicative of classic sports car designs from the era.\n\nIn the background, a multitude of cars tightly packed together spans the parking lot, creating a vast grid of colorful vehicles. The majority are likely new, given their organized arrangement and uniformity. Various models and colors are visible, including sedans and station wagons in shades of white, blue, red, yellow, and brown.\n\nTo the right, the scene includes a glimpse of a few older cars in motion, depicted with 1970s design features such as long bodies and large, rectangular headlights. These cars add a sense of activity and contrast to the static arrangement of parked cars.\n\nOverall, the composition brings together elements of automotive culture, from the detailed showcasing of a classic sports car to the broader context of a car lot, suggesting a setting involved in the sale or maintenance of vehicles. The presence of the bird sculpture introduces an artistic touch that contrasts with the commercial and functional nature of the rest.","title":"Datsun being unloaded","placename":"Terminal Island (Calif.)","location":"Terminal Island, California","nn1":["542636","556790","547954","549852","553896","547480","546813","542817","547469","555748","547495","549881","547327","546879","546900","556204"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","sport","lift","lot","sculpture","bird","arrangement","parking","hatch","maintenance"]}
