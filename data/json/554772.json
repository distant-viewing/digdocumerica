{"path":"554772.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph captures a large-scale mining operation in a vast, open-pit setting. This scene is dominated by a massive piece of mining equipment labeled \"The Silver Spade,\" which is a giant bucket-wheel excavator. This huge machine spans across the image with a large boom arm from which a conveyor belt extends, suggesting it's used for extracting and transporting materials from the pit.\n\nThe environment around the excavator is rugged and barren, with mounds of earth and rocks piled up, indicative of the ongoing excavation. The earth is varied in color, mostly shades of brown and gray, which contrasts with the industrial machinery.\n\nIn the foreground, at the bottom of the image, there's a small vehicle that provides a sense of scale, emphasizing the colossal size of the excavator. No people are visible in the scene, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention more on the machinery and the scope of the mining operation.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with hints of blue peeking through, suggesting either an early morning or late afternoon time, as the lighting appears soft. High tension power lines in the distant background match the industrial theme and suggest the presence of substantial infrastructure supporting the mining operation.","title":"A coal shovel bites into a rolling hill off Route 9.","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["552417","552416","552418","554826","554831","555606","544099","543639","554828","549245","554773","554812","544100","549171","545831","549124"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["excavator","mining","pit","operation","scope","earth","extract","machinery","tension","boom"]}
