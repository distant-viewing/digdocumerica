{"path":"548420.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of an urban traffic circle or roundabout, vividly capturing the bustling activity typical of a city environment. The roundabout is encircled by multiple lanes of traffic, each marked with white lines that define specific pathways for vehicles. Obvious from this vantage point is a series of buses and bus stops, suggesting this area serves as a significant hub for public transport. The buses are neatly arranged in a parking area adjacent to the roundabout, indicating organized traffic flow and public transit operations.\n\nAround the perimeter of the roundabout, the road splits off into various branches, showing the connectivity of this junction within the urban network. The presence of numerous automobiles circulating and waiting along the roadways reflects a busy daily commute. In contrast to the mechanical elements, there are small patches of greenery, including shrubs and trees, which offer a glimpse of urban landscaping efforts.\n\nThe surrounding environment features a mix of residential and commercial buildings, indicating a densely populated urban area. These mid-to-high-rise structures are tightly packed, each with their own distinct facade and construction style, typical of many metropolitan areas. The buildings create a backdrop that encapsulates the essence of a bustling city life.\n\nOverall, the photograph illustrates a dynamic urban space characterized by its transportation systems and architectural elements, captured from a birdâ€™s-eye view that highlights the complexity and vibrancy of city planning and infrastructure.","title":"Approach to Lincoln Tunnel","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546723","546617","546616","546678","546698","546707","548358","547765","546573","548363","555743","546704","555781","546726","546574","548364"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["bus","traffic","city","junction","commute","perimeter","circle","connectivity","stop","landscaping"]}
