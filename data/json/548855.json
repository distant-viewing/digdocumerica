{"path":"548855.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man engaged in some type of technical work in a room with various electronic equipment. The individual, dressed in a dark turtleneck sweater and glasses, is attentively adjusting or tuning a device housed in a blue casing which is part of a larger, complex setup of electronic devices positioned on a wooden desk. To the left, we can observe additional equipment including what appears to be a tape reel system, indicating this environment may be related to audio recording or engineering.\n\nOn the desk, there are scattered papers and a telephone, suggesting a workspace where communication and documentation are important. The background, though not sharply focused, shows the presence of other electronic devices, further emphasizing the technical or scientific nature of this setting. The lighting is dim, primarily highlighting the man and his immediate surroundings, contributing to a concentrated and perhaps industrious atmosphere. The entire scene is indicative of a period setting, possibly in the mid to late 20th century, given the style of the equipment and telephone design.","title":"Dennis Wood at console for operating \"Whole Body Counter\" at EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["552380","542765","549378","547720","542659","557317","549610","545952","549367","551595","542664","555334","552356","542668","552391","553329"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["device","telephone","desk","equipment","reel","documentation","recording","tape","turtleneck","communication"]}
