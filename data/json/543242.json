{"path":"543242.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a scene of a rugged coastline with a complex, weathered structure perched on the rocky shore. The structure is primarily made of wood and appears to be a series of interconnected buildings, elevated on sturdy pilings to protect against the ocean tide. These buildings feature a combination of weather-beaten timber and corrosion-resistant materials and are fitted with various fixtures like windows, doors, and external stairs, suggesting functionality and human activity.\n\nIn the foreground, the rocky coastline is strewn with a multitude of round, smooth stones, interspersed with larger, rugged boulders. Notably, several concrete blocks with protruding iron rods are scattered among the rocks, possibly remnants of a previous construction or erosion control measure.\n\nThe backdrop features the ocean, showing a relatively calm sea state under a cloudy sky. The water near the shore breaks gently over the rocks, creating a dynamic interaction between the sea and land. A single seagull is visible flying over the water, adding a sense of life and motion to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere appears somewhat desolate and abandoned, evoking a sense of isolation. The color tones, predominantly in shades of brown, gray, and muted blues, contribute to a feeling of agedness and wear from exposure to the elements. This place likely serves, or used to serve, an industrial or maritime function, hinted by its robust construction and seaside location.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543359","543288","543405","543364","543320","547040","547118","549338","547068","543291","552955","543426","547581","551953","547038","551963"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["coastline","ocean","corrosion","shore","piling","sea","seaside","measure","seagull","construction"]}
