{"path":"550899.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil yet thought-provoking scene involving elements of industry and nature. In the foreground, a silhouette of a boy stands on a rocky shoreline beside a sparkling body of water, possibly a lake or river. The boy appears in profile, gazing out over the water. Near him on the rocks, a white cooler is positioned, suggesting that he might be engaged in a leisure activity like fishing or simply enjoying the outdoors.\n\nThe background presents a stark contrast to the peaceful foreground, featuring an industrial complex on the distant shoreline. The complex includes multiple structures with tall chimneys, one of which is emitting a large plume of white smoke that disperses into the sky. This juxtaposition of natural beauty in the foreground with industrial activity in the background creates a visual and thematic dichotomy, likely provoking reflections on environmental and industrial impacts. The overall mood is somewhat somber, enhanced by the muted colors and the silhouette effect created by the lighting.","title":"Fishing in the Houston ship channel.
