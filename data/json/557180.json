{"path":"557180.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene winter scene, primarily centered around a frozen body of water which likely is a lake, broadly covered in snow. Prominently in the foreground, thin, dry plants or bushes with sporadic dried leaves and seed heads stand tall against a blue sky. These elements suggest a cold, somewhat desolate winter landscape, yet thereâ€™s a quiet beauty to it.\n\nThe background features a clear blue sky dotted with a few wispy clouds, creating a calming backdrop to the detailed, frosty vegetation in front. Across the horizon, a line of bare trees and perhaps distant shrubs or grasses subtly demarcates the edge of the lake and the beginning of a further snow-covered field or shore. The overall mood is peaceful and stark, highlighting the simplicity and stillness typical of a winter day. The lighting is bright and clear, suggesting a sunny day, which casts sharp shadows and enhances the textures of the plants and snow.","title":"A portion of the Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge near Mound City, Missouri, in the northwest part of the state.
