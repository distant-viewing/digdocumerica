{"path":"557842.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This image captures a young woman sitting alone on the concrete steps outside a house. She appears reflective or perhaps somber, looking downwards with her blonde hair partially obscuring her face. She is dressed casually in a floral patterned shirt and jeans, a typical style that suggests the photo might be from the 1960s or 1970s based on its aesthetic and texture.\n\nTo the woman's right, a light brown cat, wearing a collar, is partially visible as it seems to be walking down the stairs. The cat's attention is directed away from the young woman, adding a sense of quiet companionship but also of individual solitude.\n\nThe background shows part of a small garden or bushes with some flowers and a rose bush climbing up the side of the house near the porch. The house's exterior is modest, with a blue or grey wooden siding. The steps on which the woman sits are simple and unadorned, leading to a standard residential entrance. The overall mood is peaceful yet slightly melancholic, potentially evoking themes of solitude, reflection, or waiting.","title":"Young girl sits on the porch steps daydreaming while her cat sniffs flowers. Her home is across the street from the auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio. Norwood and Cincinnati began testing in January, 1975, for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Some 250,000 vehicles are registered in the two cities. Officials estimate that 185,000 will be tested by the end of 1975. Vehicles must be checked annually by an exhaust analyzer.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["553156","547175","551448","549290","553534","546474","552610","556498","556541","551439","552961","545525","553501","548232","553165","545510"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["woman","step","house","solitude","companionship","collar","stair","siding","1960","garden"]}
