The houses are modern, single-storied with flat roofs, and are arranged in rows. The exterior walls of the houses are decorated with light and dark brown panels. In front of the houses, heaps of red-brown soil and construction materials are visible, indicating the area is under development. There are also several large white pipes or conduits positioned on the ground near the piles of dirt.\n\nIn the background, a mountainous landscape and city skyline can be seen. The city features numerous tall buildings, most likely condominiums or office buildings, which glisten under the bright sky. This urban setting is situated against a backdrop of verdant mountains, providing a striking contrast between natural beauty and urban development. The overall composition of the image demonstrates the juxtaposition of a tranquil suburban residential area with the bustling cityscape in the distance.","title":"Rezoning of \"surplus pineapple land\" enabled pineapple growers-turned-developers to build this subdivision in Mililani Town, one solution to the island's housing shortage.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["557550","546407","546765","557547","553927","542674","544814","547863","553922","553936","553920","557455","553693","557526","553939","547664"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["house","development","conduit","construction","city","heap","panel","office","pipe","cityscape"]}
