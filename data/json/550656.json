{"path":"550656.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river landscape, dominated by the wide, tranquil body of water that stretches horizontally across the frame from left to right. The river is a deep, rich blue, reflecting the sky above, and is flanked by dense forests of evergreen trees on both sides. These trees appear lush and vividly green, suggesting the season is either late spring or summer.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left side of the image, there is a grassy bank that slopes gently towards the water. This area is dotted with wildflowers, including white and orange blooms, which add a touch of bright color to the predominantly green and blue scenery. The grass and flowers suggest a well-maintained yet natural riverside environment, possibly indicating a park or preserved natural area.\n\nThe background of the photo features a hint of mountains, or large hills, which are partly shrouded in a blue haze, giving depth to the scene and suggesting that the river may be part of a larger valley or watershed area.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the tranquility and natural beauty of the landscape, with an emphasis on the unspoiled waterway and forested areas, likely intended to evoke a sense of peace and appreciation for nature. There are no visible human figures or man-made structures, which reinforces the theme of natural beauty and remoteness.","title":"Androscoggin River in the \"13-Mile Woods\" area near Errol not far from the headwaters of the river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["542653","550700","550845","550839","544861","550680","552318","555075","551348","550691","557106","554762","542844","550782","554629","550682"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","remoteness","appreciation","peace","riverside","bloom","wildflower","emphasis","waterway","beauty"]}
