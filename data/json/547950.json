{"path":"547950.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features a vivid scene showcasing a clothesline with various items of laundry hung out to dry in the foreground. Visible are multiple types of clothing, including trousers, shirts, and a few towels or possibly tablecloths, each in varying colors like white, red, blue, and yellow. These items sway gently on the line, suggesting a breezy day.\n\nIn the background, there is a medium-sized, somewhat rustic house with visible architectural details such as a wooden structure and a balcony enhanced with bright yellow railings, contrasting sharply against the more subdued colors of the building. The house has a slightly weathered look, with a chimney visible atop its roof.\n\nThe environment around the house appears to be a grassy area that transitions into a dusty, bare patch of ground directly under the clothesline. No people are visible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention on the everyday task of laundry and a quiet residential setting. The sky above is a clear and bright blue, indicating a sunny day. The image captures a mundane, yet intimate slice of domestic life, emphasized by the presence of personal clothing and a lived-in house.","title":"House on Hunter's Point, bordering the John F.
