{"path":"558086.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph showcases a serene and lush forest scene dominated by a collection of large, moss-covered rocks. The rocks are disordered and jagged, scattered in various orientations, creating a rugged terrain. These stones are interspersed with green foliage and small, delicate leaves that are sparsely fallen across the rocks, indicating an early autumn setting.\n\nThe background is filled with dense woodland, consisting primarily of broadleaf trees and a few faintly visible evergreen-like trees. The canopy is thick but allows some light to penetrate through, casting soft patches of light and shadow on the rocks and forest floor. The overall atmosphere is damp and cool, as suggested by the moss growth and the moist-looking surfaces of rocks and leaves.\n\nNo visible sky or water sources are apparent in the image, focusing all attention on the forest floor's natural elements of rock and vegetation. The scene looks untouched by human activity, evoking a sense of calm and isolation, typical of a deep forest environment.","title":"Huge rocks covered with moss have been moved over the centuries by water current of BRandywine Creek, near Boston Heights, Ohio, and Cleveland. The quiet place is full of beauty in an out-of-the-way spot. It is part of the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which contains 30,000 acres of largely undeveloped land within a 20-mile stretch between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron. Land acquisition is awaiting Congressional appropriations.","placename":"Boston Heights (Ohio)","location":"Boston Heights, Ohio","nn1":["558082","554572","558083","542753","555058","554958","558012","547011","555000","554961","554718","547635","554976","554972","554985","554554"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","forest","moss","floor","disorder","penetrate","orientation","leave","woodland","source"]}
