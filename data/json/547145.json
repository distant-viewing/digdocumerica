{"path":"547145.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph features a complex assembly of weathered tree branches and trunks, heavily coated with icicles, sticking out at various angles. These wooden elements form a tangled, organic mass at the focal point of the image. The texture of the wood is rough and accented by the glinting icicles, which vary in length and seem to dangle towards the ground, reflecting light, suggesting a recently frozen environment.\n\nThis mass of wood and ice is positioned on a collection of large, rounded stones or boulders, which are primarily gray with patches of lichen or moss, indicating their exposure to wet conditions. These boulders seem to form a rugged shoreline or riverbank.\n\nIn the background, there is a blurred glimpse of a rushing, muddy river, the water rendered in tones of brown and gray, suggesting strong currents or recent rainfall. The river fills the backdrop of the scene, extending across the frame behind the wooden debris.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a natural setting dealing with cold temperatures, as evidenced by the presence of ice, and likely near a body of water, as suggested by the river and the riparian driftwood. The image encapsulates a moment of natural stillness and transformation, marked by the freezing conditions.","title":"Uprooted tree--victim of high water and winter storms on Lake Michigan","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["555209","558006","543656","546896","551602","551604","547526","555151","545923","543607","552204","554989","550201","542526","549311","547534"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["mass","ice","boulder","river","glint","dangle","wood","lichen","transformation","deal"]}
