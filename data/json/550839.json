{"path":"550839.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene river landscape in full daylight. The river, central to the image, is calm with a reflective surface mirroring the verdant surroundings and the blue sky above. On the left side of the river, the banks are lined with dense foliage including tall grasses, bushes, and a variety of trees. Some patches of this greenery extend into the river, suggesting a somewhat overgrown or natural state. \n\nThe right side of the river is less overgrown with clearer water visible. The banks on this side are similarly lush, contributing to a strong sense of quiet isolation one might feel in such a natural, untouched setting. In the far background, past the initial expanse of the river, you can see a continuation of the lush landscape which further deepens the immersion in nature. The horizon is marked by a line of trees that sets the limit of the landscape's depth in view.\n\nThe colors in the image are vibrant, with rich greens and blues dominating, and the quality of light suggests it might be either morning or late afternoon, creating soft lighting conditions that enhance the calmness of the scene. No human figures or man-made structures are visible, which emphasizes the natural beauty and tranquility of the location. This setting is ideal for nature observation, contemplation, or activities like photography due to its picturesque and peaceful atmosphere.","title":"Flowing in a generally north-easterly direction toward lake winnebago, the fox river meanders through lush meadows and woodlands","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["542653","550845","550656","557106","550782","554762","544861","551348","555075","554629","545861","546963","552108","550691","550844","542558"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","bank","immersion","limit","continuation","greens","blu","calmness","photography","observation"]}
