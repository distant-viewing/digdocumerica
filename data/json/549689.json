{"path":"549689.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a vehicle testing or repair shop. In the foreground, a man is seated in the driver's seat of a vintage teal-colored station wagon, looking out open with a focused expression. The vehicle's doors are open, providing a clear view of the interior which features a tan and brown interior.\n\nTo the right of the scene, there are several pieces of diagnostic equipment. Notably, there's a substantial piece of machinery labeled \"Clayton Dynamometer\" which is placed right next to the vehicle. This equipment, featuring several gauges and dials, is presumably used to measure the car engine's power output and performance directly from the wheels. \n\nThe background of the shop contains various other instruments and machinery, suggesting a well-equipped setup for automobile maintenance or testing. The overall ambiance is industrial, with visible elements like light fixtures overhead, concrete walls, and various tools and cables scattered throughout the area.\n\nThe image suggests both mechanical activity and analysis, in a setting dedicated to the maintenance, testing, and possibly research concerning automotive performance.","title":"New car going through test cycle at EPA's Ann Arbor Motor Vehicle Emission Laboratory","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["542763","549692","557850","553895","557889","557905","557858","557853","557906","557855","557859","542762","557885","557852","557860","557891"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["testing","performance","shop","interior","output","maintenance","vehicle","teal","machinery","piece"]}
