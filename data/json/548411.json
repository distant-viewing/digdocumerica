{"path":"548411.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph is an aerial shot, likely taken from a plane or helicopter, that captures a bustling area with various infrastructure elements. In the center and in the foreground of the image, there are major multi-lane roadways filled with vehicles. These roads are possibly highways, given their scale and the visible traffic patterns. Additionally, one of the roads seems to curve and merge with another highway, suggesting a complex interchange system.\n\nTo the left of the image, there is a commercial area with multiple buildings including what could be shops or offices, surrounded by a large parking lot filled with cars. This built-up area is mixed with patches of greenery, possibly small parks or landscaped areas.\n\nThroughout the image, the landscape is interspersed with dense tree coverage, indicating the presence of undeveloped or forested land adjacent to urban development. This juxtaposition creates a clear boundary between natural and human-made environments.\n\nThe top portion of the image shows another dense tree area and smaller roads that link the more built-up zones. The entire scene is contained within what appears to be a suburban or semi-urban setting, with infrastructure and vegetation closely interwoven, highlighting the interaction between urban development and the natural environment. The lighting and shadows suggest that the photo was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, giving a dim yet clear view of the area.","title":"Traffic interchange at tappan zee bridge","placename":"White Plains (N.Y.)","location":"White Plains, New York","nn1":["547764","548092","547765","548363","546616","553001","547770","548359","546617","553015","548332","546714","546703","552719","546707","546726"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["roads","interchange","development","helicopter","built","infrastructure","coverage","plane","zones","merge"]}
