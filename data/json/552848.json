{"path":"552848.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph shows an aerial view of flooding affecting a community. The image captures houses and buildings submerged in water, with parts of roads also covered. Several residential structures, which appear as single-story homes, are visible, with their roofs just above the water's surface. There is also a larger building surrounded by floodwaters, alongside smaller structures. Trees surrounding the area are partially submerged, indicating the depth and extent of the flooding.\n\nA clearly visible road runs parallel to a flooded river, acting as a demarcation between the waterlogged areas and drier ground. Along this road, a few vehicles are visible, suggesting some ongoing traffic despite the flooding. The area surrounding the flood-affected zone includes greenery and additional water bodies, suggesting a typically water-rich landscape possibly exacerbated by recent heavy rainfall or other hydrological impacts. The overall atmosphere looks gloomy with overcast weather conditions, enhancing the somber setting of a community in distress due to floodwater intrusion.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
