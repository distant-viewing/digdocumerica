{"path":"557922.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up view of a sticker or decal attached to a window or glass surface, which is wet with numerous rain droplets. The sticker is labeled \"TEMPORARY CITY OF CINCINNATI Motor Vehicle Inspection\" and includes the year \"1975.\" It features a purple and white color scheme with text and a grid of punch-out holes likely used to indicate the expiration date, though no holes have been punched in this specific sticker. The layout of the sticker includes two rows for \"MONTH\" and \"DAY\" at the bottom part, where each row has a series of round dots arranged to represent each month and day. The background, only slightly visible due to the focus on the sticker, appears to be a blurred blue-toned view, probably reflecting the setting outside the window where the sticker is attached. The photograph itself has a vintage feel, indicative of the film and color processing typical of the mid-1970s.","title":"Temporary 30-day sticker attached to the windshield of a young woman's car which had failed testing at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.  All light duty spark ignition powered motor vehicles must pass the emissions test annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons as well as receive a safety check which has been in effect since 1940.  All other type vehicles registered in the city must undergo only the safety check.
