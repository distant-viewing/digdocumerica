{"path":"546765.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a residential area located adjacent to rugged, hilly terrain. At the top-right of the image, houses with flat roofs are spread in a relatively regular grid pattern. These houses have various shades of brown and beige, complementing the earthy tones of the surrounding landscape. The streets winding through this residential area are curved and interspersed with occasional green from gardens or small patches of vegetation.\n\nTo the center and left of the photograph, the terrain becomes more undeveloped and hilly, with dirt roads and unfinished plots, indicating ongoing construction or expansions. The ground is marked by several curving and looping dirt tracks that suggest heavy machinery might have been used, possibly altering the landscape for further development.\n\nThe image also reveals the contrast between the developed area with orderly homes and the rugged terrain nearby, showcasing the intersection of human habitation with the natural environment. The overall color scheme is dominated by earthy tones which appear dry, suggesting an arid or semi-arid climate.","title":"New housing at the foot of Squaw Peak in the North Mountains","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["546756","557516","553938","553935","553693","553059","553940","546399","553125","545625","557547","553692","553927","557518","553936","548825"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["terrain","curve","dirt","loop","alter","expansion","house","become","plot","scheme"]}
