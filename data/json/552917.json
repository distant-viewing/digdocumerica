{"path":"552917.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This image captures a tranquil aquatic scene, possibly a lake or a slow-moving river. The top portion of the photo shows calm, smooth water surface that reflects subtle undulations and light, creating a serene atmosphere. The horizon line is set approximately mid-way up the image, separating the water from a distant landscape which features a mountain with a relatively soft, rounded contour under a light blue sky, slightly hazy which could suggest distance or a mild overcast condition.\n\nThe lower part of the image, below the calm surface of the water, reveals an underwater view of rocky terrain. The underwater rocks are covered in patches of green algae or aquatic plants which give the underwater scene a textured and somewhat eerie look. The water is mostly clear, allowing a distinct view of the submerged landscape.\n\nThe colors in the photograph are muted and cool, featuring shades of blue, green, and gray, which contribute to the overall serene and perhaps slightly mysterious mood of the scene. The photograph likely aims to showcase the peaceful coexistence of above and below-water environments, highlighting the natural beauty and calmness of aquatic settings.","title":"Algae growth in one of the shallow bays of Pyramid Lake Nevada's largest natural lake","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["552916","551352","554623","554527","544679","549446","552894","550750","548030","550745","546963","543816","543546","542583","555077","550686"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["aims","separa","undulation","underwater","water","alga","calmness","hazy","coexistence","contour"]}
