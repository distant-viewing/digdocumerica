{"path":"548644.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene centered around a large body of water, likely a man-made pit, filled with calm, blue water. Dominating the scene are large, white mounds of a chalky, rocky material, probably limestone, piled along the edges of the water. One particularly large pile sits on the right-hand side of the image.\n\nOn the right-hand side, there is a prominent red crane with a long, extended boom, positioned near the pile of material. The crane appears to be either extracting material from the pile or depositing more. Despite the presence of this large machinery, there are no visible operators or other individuals in the scene.\n\nThe background features a clear blue sky with scattered clouds, contributing to a sunny and bright atmosphere. A thin strip of greenery, possibly bushes or low trees, lines the horizon behind the crane and rock piles, marking the boundary of the site. The absence of any buildings or other structures suggests that this location is relatively isolated, focused solely on industrial activity. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the machinery and the piles of material, highlights the scale and scope of the operations at this site.","title":"Scene across a channel dug by a dragline at North Key Largo.
