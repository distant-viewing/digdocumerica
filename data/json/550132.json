{"path":"550132.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a city street scene with a store front displaying a variety of advertisements and signs. There are two people in the image, each standing near opposing edges of the photo, which adds a balanced human element to the scene.\n\nThe store front is cluttered with large bright yellow signs advertising various products with their prices. Prominent items advertised include \"T.V. Antennas,\" \"Fever Thermometer,\" \"Alarm Clocks,\" \"Religious Candles,\" \"Broom Spray,\" \"Men’s Colognes,\" \"Anacin,\" \"Bufferin,\" \"Women’s Hosiery,\" \"Tampax,\" and on the far right, \"One-A-Day Multiple Vitamins\" and \"J.J. Cotton.\" Pricing details are highlighted next to each product, underlined occasionally to draw attention.\n\nThe building itself appears to be old, with a traditional design typical of urban architectures such as thick moldings around the windows; the windows are used as spaces for displaying the large advertisements. Above the window, the word \"LEADER\" can be seen, suggesting either the name of the store or a branding element.\n\nTo the left, there is a man standing, dressed in a light-colored striped suit with a hat, looking away from the camera, which gives an impression of casual observation or waiting. On the right, a woman with a bag slung over her shoulder stands near a hydrant, also facing away from the camera, possibly waiting or observing something outside the frame.\n\nThe presence of a streetlamp and a hydrant adds an urban functionality to the scene. The color palette of the environment mainly consists of greys, browns, and the vivid yellows of the advertisement boards, which draw the viewer’s attention to the products on offer.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures an everyday urban commercial setting, possibly from a few decades ago judging by the style of the clothing and the design of the advertisements.","title":"Drug store plugs its wares on building wall","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546672","546428","549806","550127","551125","546034","545333","554307","550130","550142","556223","551494","556199","556225","546427","556224"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["advertisement","product","hydrant","store","candle","window","molding","branding","price","front"]}
