{"path":"548813.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a vast outdoor storage or staging area, potentially for vehicles or equipment, organized into numerous neat rows. The site is surrounded by roads on all sides, ensuring accessible entry points. It appears to be meticulously structured, with rectangular sections clearly delineated for organized placement. Beyond the bounds of this storage site, the area transitions into agricultural fields, featuring varying shades of green and brown, indicative of different crops or stages of tilling and harvesting. The overall landscape is largely flat, suggesting that this could be a rural or semi-rural area with ample space for such large-scale operations. The aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of the systematic layout and the contrasting textures between the man-made site and the natural surroundings.","title":"Irrigated fields of the imperial valley, near el centro","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["550552","542710","549098","553047","542729","548907","555759","546695","554053","548894","555752","556917","542708","544564","553696","556921"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["site","stage","bound","delineate","storage","entry","harvest","ensure","placement","ample"]}
