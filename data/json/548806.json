{"path":"548806.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts a landscape undergoing clear-cutting or land clearing activities. In the foreground is a rough, rugged open field covered with numerous white rocks and sparse vegetation, which includes a few smaller plants and young trees that stand isolated from each other. Dominating the scene on the left side of the image is a large pile of chopped and uprooted trees, branches, and assorted vegetation debris, indicating recent deforestation or clearing efforts.\n\nIn the background, beyond the cleared field and debris pile, the landscape features more untouched greenery consisting of denser trees and brush, hinting at the natural environment before the intervention. Parallel to this transition between cleared and uncleared land runs a two-lane road, visible stretching horizontally across the middle background, where a solitary, light-colored vehicle, likely from the 1960s or 1970s era, can be seen, providing a sense of scale and human activity associated with the area.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with patches of blue showing through, suggesting an open, daylight setting that brightens the entire scene. The overall composition captures the contrast between human impact and the remaining natural landscape, emphasizing the environmental change represented by the cleared land in comparison to the adjacent uncleared areas.","title":"Land scraped for commercial development at Key Largo near the northern tip of the Florida Keys.
