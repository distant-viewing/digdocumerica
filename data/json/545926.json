{"path":"545926.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene yet industrious scene on a large body of still water, likely a lake or slow-moving river. In the center of the frame, there is a large raft or floating platform constructed from numerous white buckets that seem to be supporting wooden planks. This makeshift platform holds four individuals who appear engaged in various activities.\n\nOn the left side, one person stands and two bend over, possibly engaged in some kind of manual labor or maintenance of the platform. They seem focused on their tasks. On the right side of the raft, another individual, sitting, appears to be either working with or resting beside a black object that could be a tool or a container.\n\nInterestingly, the water is so still and clear that it mirrors the image of the individuals and the raft, creating a striking symmetrical reflection in the composition. The background is minimalist, with a water horizon blending smoothly into a pale sky, delivering a sense of tranquil isolation and vast open space. The clarity of the light suggests it may be early morning or late afternoon, as it gives the colors a warm, soft quality. The overall mood is peaceful, with human activity integrating quietly into the natural setting.","title":"Truckee River","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["545932","545940","545922","545915","544278","545936","544770","552283","545928","551389","547557","544266","545658","550240","552982","551350"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["raft","platform","deliver","individual","kind","integrate","clarity","bucket","plank","mirror"]}
