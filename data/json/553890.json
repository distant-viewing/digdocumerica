{"path":"553890.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph captures a live performance by a rock band on stage, enveloped in moody, red lighting that casts a dramatic hue throughout the scene. On the left, there is a male guitarist with long hair. He is intently playing a white electric guitar while standing next to a keyboard mounted on a stand. The guitarist is in mid-performance, suggesting a moment of engagement with the music.\n\nIn the background, slightly to the right, we see a drummer seated at a drum set. He appears deeply focused, playing the drums with visible intensity, characterized by his slumped posture and the way he holds the drumsticks. The drum set is complete with various cymbals and drums, illuminated slightly by the stage lighting.\n\nEquipment such as amplifiers and various electronic devices including what appears to be effect processors or synthesizers are scattered around the musicians, contributing to the cluttered and active stage environment. The overall atmosphere is one filled with energy, emphasized by the reddish stage fog that combines with the lighting to create a sense of motion and vibrancy.\n\nThe setting and instruments suggest a moment frozen in time during a powerful performance, highlighting the musicians' immersion and their connection with the music.","title":"Rock concert.
