{"path":"554539.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of three individuals at what appears to be a trailhead or a check-in station for a hiking or camping area. Each person is seen from the back, wearing large backpacks and rain gear, which suggests they are preparing for outdoor activity in wet or variable weather conditions.\n\nThe person on the left is clad in a yellow rain jacket and blue jeans, the middle one in a red jacket, and the rightmost person in a dark jacket, possibly blue or black. All of them carry backpacks equipped with various gear strapped to the top and sides, indicating a multi-day trek or camping adventure.\n\nThe background features a dark wooden structure, possibly a board or shed, that has signs and notices attached. Prominently displayed on the shed is a large sign with the directive: \"YOU PACK IT IN - PACK IT OUT! LEAVE IT HERE.\" This suggests an emphasis on conservation and the responsibility of hikers or campers to remove all their trash and belongings from the area to maintain cleanliness and minimize environmental impact.\n\nAbove this sign, amidst the backdrop of lush green foliage, is a hanging rectangular object, looking much like an additional sign or informational placard. The precise content on the structure is indistinct due to image quality but appears to include multiple bullet points or guidelines for the visitors.\n\nThe environment looks wet, with the foliage appearing lush and vibrant, suggesting the setting is either during or just after a rain. This further complements the attire and preparedness of the individuals depicted. The overall mood reflects preparation and readiness for an immersive outdoor experience within a natural setting that promotes environmental responsibility.","title":"Sign asks campers to carry out what they carry into the Adirondack Forest Preserve at the start of trails for Mount Marcy and other climbs in the High Peaks area, in New York State.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543379","543371","554508","554509","554510","554558","545512","545776","554672","543510","554502","558090","554463","543385","543236","554705"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["responsibility","rain","backpack","camping","jacket","gear","sign","person","notice","preparedness"]}
