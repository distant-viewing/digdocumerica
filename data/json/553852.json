{"path":"553852.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a seascape during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, characterized by a moody and dimly lit ambiance. The sun, positioned low on the horizon, casts a shimmering reflection on the surface of the water, creating a narrow pathway of light that leads the eye across the composition. The photo is dominated by dark silhouettes of rugged, rocky outcroppings that protrude from the sea, creating an interplay of light and shadow on the water.\n\nThere is a large rock formation near the center, which is the most prominent feature, split into two parts and resembling a broken heart or a split mountain. Smaller rocks and formations are scattered throughout the foreground and midground of the scene, which add to the rugged texture and natural feel of the seascape.\n\nThe ocean itself is depicted with dynamic textures, evident in the whitecaps and the rhythmic patterns of the waves that suggest movement and the gentle power of the sea. The sky, visible at the top of the frame, blends smoothly from a darker shade at the top into the brightness near the horizon, enhancing the overall dramatic and tranquil mood of the photograph.\n\nNo human presence or man-made objects are visible in this natural scene, emphasizing the solitude and untouched beauty of the landscape. The overall composition is balanced and serene, inviting contemplation and appreciation of natural beauty.","title":"Northern California coast.  (from the sites exhibition.
