{"path":"548749.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene with a focus on recreational activities and natural surroundings. In the foreground, a large, sturdy tent with shades of green, brown, and beige is pitched on a sandy beach area. The tent, equipped with flaps and guy-ropes, appears robust and ready for outdoor conditions.\n\nThe middle ground reveals a shallow, turquoise sea where two people are seen swimming. They are distant, small figures in the water, enjoying the shallow sea, facing each other and appearing engaged in conversation or leisurely swimming activities.\n\nThe background includes the calm ocean extending to the horizon under a clear sky, hinting at good weather conditions. There are no other structures or people visible in the immediate vicinity, suggesting a quiet, relatively secluded spot, ideal for relaxation and escape from busier environments.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on leisure and natural beauty, evokes a sense of peacefulness and the pleasure of being outdoors.","title":"Campers enjoy a swim at bahia honda state park in the lower Florida keys","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548797","545293","545162","553781","547596","548796","548706","547612","548757","543493","547009","543089","554159","553882","546982","543536"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["tent","swimm","extending","beach","sea","pleasure","turquoise","escape","peacefulness","pitch"]}
