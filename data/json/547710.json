{"path":"547710.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an indoor laboratory setting focused on biological or chemical experimentation. In the middle of the scene, a woman, dressed in a white lab coat, is visible working attentively. She is standing behind a table where several meat samples are laid out, each piece on what appears to be white paper or trays. She seems to be performing some form of analysis or preparation on the meat samples.\n\nThe background and foreground feature an array of complex scientific equipment. This includes multiple glass bottles and flasks, some filled with liquids of varying colors. These vessels are connected by an assembly of clamps and metal rods, suggesting an experimental setup possibly for distillation or chemical processing. Diverse laboratory apparatus such as pipettes and support stands are set up across the workspace, which is depicted with an array of shelves and cabinets filled with additional lab materials and tools.\n\nBehind the glassware, the laboratory environment is equipped with typical features such as sinks, counters, and storage drawers, all suggesting a well-used and functional space for scientific research. The lighting in the laboratory is muted, with emphasis coming from overhead lights that cast a soft glow on the central working area. This setup indicates a meticulous and controlled environment essential for scientific inquiry and experimentation.","title":"Technician tests meat samples for radiation at epa's national environmental research center at Las Vegas","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548858","548867","548862","548856","548860","549342","546278","549608","549607","549332","546288","555249","546344","555250","555254","546284"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["experimentation","meat","lab","sample","laboratory","setup","distillation","array","essential","inquiry"]}
