{"path":"557168.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of bold, red leaves, likely from a deciduous tree. The leaves are rich in color, with a deep crimson hue and distinct veins visible across their surfaces. The texture of the leaves is highlighted by natural light, creating slight contrasts in shade and darkness in various parts. Small imperfections, possibly caused by insects or environmental factors, are scattered across the leaves, including tiny holes and black spot marks.\n\nOne of the leaves has a particularly noticeable tear, surrounded by jagged edges where the leaf material has been removed. The background of the image is blurry and out of focus, emphasizing the leaves in the foreground by creating a smooth, indistinct backdrop that shifts in tone from dark to light. This draws attention to the crisp, detailed texture and vibrant color of the leaves in contrast to the soft, undefined background.","title":"Closeup of bright red sumac leaves growing in Johnson County, Kansas, near Kansas City. It is a typical plant of tallgrass prairie and invades areas of grass that are not maintained by grazing or fire. Only isolated patches of native tallgrass prairie survive in the state after the wave of pioneers plowed and planted crops in the fertile soil.","placename":"Johnson County (Kan.)","location":"Johnson County, Kansas","nn1":["554744","542686","552693","544731","557539","554727","551356","551372","543620","555041","551357","554725","555030","546011","550461","542688"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leave","factor","imperfection","tear","insect","vein","hole","shift","mark","leaf"]}
