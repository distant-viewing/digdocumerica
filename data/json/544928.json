{"path":"544928.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"In this photograph, two hikers traverse a rugged desert landscape, characterized by its vast and majestic red, rocky canyon walls. These towering cliffs exhibit vertical striations and gorges, colored in varying shades of deep red and orange, indicative of sedimentary geological formations often found in plateaus. The hikers, appearing minuscule compared to the grand scale of the cliffs, wear shorts and backpacks, suggesting a journey or exploration. The sunlight illuminates part of the canyon's face, highlighting its texture and sheer size.\n\nThe setting includes a wide, sandy trail where the hikers walk, which is spacious with little vegetation, symbolizing a typical arid region. The ground, a dusty and rocky terrain, features sparse patches of small shrubs or grasses, enhancing the barren, isolated ambiance of the scene. This stark, natural beauty of the canyon offers a sense of solitude and the sheer magnitude of natural processes, providing an overwhelming backdrop against the human activity of hiking, emphasizing the interaction between humans and the immense, untamed wilderness.","title":"Harris Wash, Escalante Canyon","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["544301","544903","544917","545762","545772","544305","545700","545693","544931","545704","545697","545759","545758","545751","544902","545782"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","canyon","cliff","gorge","magnitude","plateaus","striation","backpack","hiking","journey"]}
