{"path":"556713.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a vintage car parked alongside a city street. The car, prominently featured in the foreground, has a light cream body, dark brown convertible top, and is styled with sleek lines, indicative of mid-20th-century automotive design. It features chrome bumpers and accents, along with spoked hubcaps.\n\nIn the background, there's a sequence of cars parked along the curb extending down the street, and the architecture visible includes classic brick buildings with large windows, likely residential or possibly mixed-use structures given their style and the urban setting.\n\nThe street is lined with mature trees, suggesting a well-established neighborhood. A \"Bus Stop\" sign is visible directly beside the parked vintage car, connected to a light post. The environment is typical of a calm, urban residential area, and the time appears to be during the day given the natural light.","title":"The driver parked in this bus stop didn't have to worry because there was a bus strike in Washington, district of Columbia during may, 1974.  Police were forced to ignore the majority of illegally parked cars because the strike forced 250,000 people who normally rode the buses to find alternate methods of transportation, usually the car.  The metro bus system usually has 1,800 buses on the streets during morning and evening rush hours","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556707","556718","556709","547797","556735","557877","556753","556724","555475","556723","557878","548238","551913","555922","549895","551021"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","street","sequence","mature","vintage","bumper","parke","sleek","cream","establish"]}
