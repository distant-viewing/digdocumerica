{"path":"546650.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph presents a scene at a bus stop featuring several people. The setting appears to be during a relatively cold season, likely autumn or winter, as evidenced by the leafless trees and the attire of the people. The bus stop consists of a simple white, rectangular shelter made of glass panels, providing partial visibility inside. It helps viewers observe people standing and waiting.\n\nThe focus group includes about seven individuals visible through or standing by the glass shelter at different depths. These individuals primarily appear to be middle-aged men, dressed in typical cold-weather clothing such as coats, and several are wearing hats. Their expressions and poses suggest a typical waiting scenario, with some engaged in light conversation or observing their surroundings.\n\nIn the foreground, to the right, there is a male figure, possibly a bus driver or conductor, characterized by a uniform hat, engaging with, or preparing to engage with, both the bus and the waiting passengers. Additionally, a bus stop sign is partly obscured in the image and there is what seems like a schedule or a map directly to the right of the shelter.\n\nThe photograph is composed in a way that captures the urban mundane life, emphasizing routine and the communal experience of public transportation. The background displays a muted, overcast sky and scant urban vegetation, emphasizing the starkness and functionality of the location. The mood feels somewhat subdued and introspective, reflective of a daily commute's often quiet nature.","title":"Park and ride metro bus shelter at Springfield, va.
