{"path":"554073.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an evocative natural scene, primarily capturing the interaction of light and landscape under a clear sky. In the foreground, the silhouette of tree branches and leaves frames the top left corner, the thin branches sprawling diagonally across the frame. The sun, located behind these branches, creates a stark point of light, casting gentle rays and causing smaller spots of flare which pepper the surrounding air.\n\nThe background is dominated by a vast coastal view, showing a rugged coastline that stretches into the distance. The sea glistens with reflected sunlight, suggesting a time of day when the sun is high. The rippling surface of the water is textured and bright, indicating either wind activity or currents. The coastline, extending towards a mountainous horizon, is rocky and uneven, potentially volcanic, indicating a wild and natural environment devoid of human presence.\n\nThe sky is minimally cloudy with a few scattered clouds, contributing to a sense of openness and serenity in the image. The overall composition of the image, which combines elements of flora and vast oceanic and land expanses, communicates a sense of isolation and the overwhelming beauty of nature.","title":"The hana area of Maui is mostly prime agricultural land and is not immediately threatened by development.
