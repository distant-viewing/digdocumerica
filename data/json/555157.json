{"path":"555157.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a forested area engulfed in smoke and flames, likely a wildfire scene. In the foreground, various pieces of charred and burning wood can be seen, emitting smoke and small fires. The wood pieces are scattered chaotically, suggesting they have been thrown or fallen in disarray, possibly as a result of the fire's destructive force.\n\nThe background features more trees, their visibility obscured by a thick, grey smoke that blankets the scene. Some of the trees appear to be fir or spruce, typical of a mountainous or northern forest environment. The atmosphere of the image is dense and hazy, indicating the intense presence of smoke.\n\nA mountain can be detected in the background, but it is mostly obscured by the smoke, which glows slightly with hues of pink and orange, possibly reflecting the color of the sky at either sunrise or sunset. This glow adds a dramatic effect to the overall mood of the image, emphasizing the severity and the harsh reality of the wildfire.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a serene yet threatening nature scene where the destructive power of fire is evident in the midst of a once tranquil forest.","title":"Burning slash on a 75-degree slope in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553843","548591","548590","548592","548597","555156","553560","548593","553561","555113","553128","548596","548595","557577","557578","555202"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["smoke","wildfire","fire","forest","spruce","glow","severity","fir","engulf","wood"]}
