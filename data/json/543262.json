{"path":"543262.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a tranquil outdoor scene set on a golf course. In the foreground, at the left side of the image, there is a bright red golf flag prominently positioned, stuck into the finely manicured green grass of the putting green. The flagpole appears slender and tall, stark against the natural backdrop.\n\nBehind the flag and slightly to the right, the middle ground of the photo reveals a cluster of lush, mature trees providing dense shade, with various shades of green and brown tones in their leaves. Sunlight filters through the trees, casting dappled patterns on the ground. \n\nIn the background, a pair of deer are visible, bathed in the soft, warm light of what could be either early morning or late afternoon. The deer, likely a doe and its fawn based on their size and proximity to each other, are in a clearing beyond the trees. They seem to be in a peaceful, calm state, possibly grazing or roaming around the area.\n\nThe entire scene is encapsulated in a gentle, serene ambiance suggesting a quiet moment in nature, possibly undisturbed by human presence aside from the golf course facilities. The contrasting elements of wildlife and the groomed sports environment create a juxtaposition between the natural and the man-made.","title":"California--Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543633","554149","544114","542955","553808","542963","543369","558368","545898","546232","545902","544571","554619","554167","551367","543326"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["golf","deer","course","flag","undistur","groome","flagpole","manicure","graze","contrasting"]}
