{"path":"552425.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a large excavation site or quarry filled partially with water, creating a man-made lake. This body of water has irregular and rugged edges, surrounding by stark, bare earth and rock formations that slope steeply down to the water. The lake area is marked with different tones of blue, suggesting varying depths.\n\nTo the right-hand side of the image, there is a significant feature; a white stucco building with a dark pitched roof, resembling a farm house or possibly a church, given the presence of what might be a steeple or bell tower. This structure adds a contrasting man-made element to the otherwise natural and rugged terrain of the quarry.\n\nIn the background, there is a relatively flat landscape with sparse vegetation, and a series of electricity pylons, extending into the distance, indicates the presence of industrial or urban activity nearby. The sky is overcast with grey clouds, lending a somber tone to the scene.\n\nOverall, the image captures a mix of natural and human-impacted elements, depicting the interaction between industrial activities and the environment. There is a sense of isolation and being at a significant distance from bustling urban life.","title":"Aftermath of strip mining in Monterey, Fulton County after land has been stripped, the cut often fills with water from underground springs and rain.
