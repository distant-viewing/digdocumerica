{"path":"553917.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a joyous scene centered on a woman sitting outdoors with a backdrop rich in nature. The woman, who has a large, bright smile, is casually dressed in a traditional lei made up of white flowers that drapes heavily around her neck and falls down to her lap. She sports a sleeveless top and a green grass skirt, complementing her relaxed and festive attire.\n\nAdorning her hair, is a bright red flower placed on one side, enhancing her cheerful expression. The woman is seated on a wooden bench, leaning slightly forward, her body language open and inviting, as if mid-laughter or conversation.\n\nThe setting is lush and verdant, with tropical palm trees visible in the background and colorful foliage peeking from behind. The lighting suggests it might be a sunny day, casting soft shadows and accentuating the vibrant natural colors surrounding the woman.\n\nThe scene captures a moment of genuine happiness and a relaxed, tropical ambiance, suggesting a festive or cultural event taking place in a vibrant outdoor locale.","title":"Hawaiian rests after demonstrating hula dance to appreciative waikiki beach tourists","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553916","553918","553708","553915","553758","544747","553760","551028","553711","553759","553761","553737","547340","543835","556495","543853"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["woman","laughter","flower","happiness","language","locale","palm","peek","place","neck"]}
