{"path":"554079.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image features a rural landscape, taken with an infrared filter, giving the photograph a pinkish-red hue that enhances its dreamlike quality. The foreground consists mainly of neatly patterned fields, likely rice paddies, which are segmented into various geometric shapes. Some areas of the fields are flooded with water, reflecting light and adding a visual texture to the scene.\n\nTo the middle and back portions of the photograph, thick clusters of trees dominate, varied in shape and size, suggesting a diverse range of species. These trees are interspersed with a few scattered buildings â€“ possibly modest residential homes or farm-related structures. The buildings have white roofs, which contrast strikingly against the red-toned vegetation surrounding them.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a tranquil and somewhat surreal appearance due to the infrared photography effect, showcasing a peaceful rural setting with a touch of mystery.","title":"Infrared patches in lower half of picture are fields of taro growing along highway 36.
