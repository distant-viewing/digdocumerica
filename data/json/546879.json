{"path":"546879.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, tightly packed car parking lot filled with numerous cars, showcasing a variety of bright colors including yellow, red, blue, and others, along with shades of black, gray, and white. The cars are mostly from the same era, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s, indicated by their boxy and compact design typical of that period.\n\nThe photo is taken from a high vantage point, giving a comprehensive view of the dense arrangement of vehicles. The parking lot appears to be organized yet crowded, with the rows of cars neatly aligned but little space between each vehicle. No people are visible in the shot, focusing attention wholly on the cars and their systematic arrangement.\n\nThe setting seems to be a commercial or industrial area given the vastness of the parking space and the uniformity in vehicle models, suggesting it could be a dealership lot or a manufacturing facility parking area. The sheer number of cars and the organized chaos of colors provide a vibrant and somewhat nostalgic impression of automotive history.","title":"New cars ready for shipment from dundalk marine terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546813","553303","547826","556721","554349","547480","546685","556722","548432","556773","556204","542635","546900","547686","553896","547469"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["parking","car","lot","arrangement","dealership","vehicle","uniformity","chaos","history","space"]}
