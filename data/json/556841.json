{"path":"556841.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a complex network of railway tracks. The perspective is from within the cabin of a train or on a pedestrian bridge, looking down the length of the tracks as they curve gently to the right. The view shows multiple tracks, some diverging or converging, gleaming with reflections, possibly after rainfall.\n\nOverhead, numerous wires for electric trains form a dense grid against the sky, connecting to tall metal poles that stand beside the tracks. These poles and wires are a defining feature of electrified rail corridors, and they stretch out into the distance both laterally and longitudinally.\n\nIn the background, a variety of buildings, possibly from a small urban area, can be seen. These include a mix of mid-rise commercial or residential structures, showing the outskirts of a city or an industrial area that abuts the railway line. The sky above is overcast, suggesting cloudy or impending rainy weather which casts a dull light on the entire scene, enhancing the industrial feel.\n\nThe immediate surroundings of the tracks include patches of grass and sparse vegetation, typical of land adjacent to heavily used railway lines. There's no visible human activity in the photograph; the focus is on the infrastructure and the built environment interfacing with the railway system.","title":"View from the window of Amtrak's Broadway Limited as it leaves Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The train leaves daily at 4 p.m. from Chicago and arrives at Harrisburg the following morning at 6:22. There it splits into two sections, one bound for New York City and the other to Washington, D.C. The train has a history of late arrivals. Amtrak officials blame it on the poor upkeep of the tracks which are leased from the nation's railroads.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556854","556783","556692","547140","556853","547940","556873","556856","545378","556888","544324","556851","556076","547050","556464","556877"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["railway","track","wire","train","pole","corridor","rainfall","outskirt","cabin","rail"]}
