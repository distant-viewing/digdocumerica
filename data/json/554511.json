{"path":"554511.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph displays an outdoor scene where a man is engaged in cooking in a wooded environment. The man, likely in his middle years, stands to the left and slightly faces towards a small campfire emitting noticeable smoke. He is wearing a camo hat, denim jacket, a dark shirt, and jeans, suggesting a casual, functional clothing choice suitable for outdoor activities. In his hands, he holds a metal cup and something that looks like a utensil or small food item.\n\nDirectly next to the man, to his right, there's a rudimentary camping setup that seems to include a portable table or stand on which cooking pots and perhaps some other camping gear are placed. A campfire is placed on the ground, with visible flames and substantial smoke, on which the cooking seems to be occurring.\n\nThe background is dominated by densely packed trees, indicating that this activity is happening deep within a forest. The area around the man and fire is clear, but the surroundings quickly give way to the natural underbrush and tree cover typical of a forest setting. The lighting in the image suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft light and shadows cast across the scene.\n\nThis image captures a moment of outdoor living or camping, highlighting themes of self-sufficiency, nature immersion, and traditional campfire cooking.","title":"Preparing breakfast on the tailgate of a camper truck in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549451","554687","542726","545497","554862","554682","543230","554686","544855","554443","545523","554863","544974","551399","545500","542727"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["campfire","cooking","camping","immersion","underbrush","utensil","self","smoke","man","flame"]}
