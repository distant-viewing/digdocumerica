{"path":"552402.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil river scene focused on an old stone tunnel entrance on the bank of a river. The tunnel is large, arch-shaped, and appears aged, with some masonry around the edges that looks slightly deteriorated. The stone embankment leading up to the tunnel is constructed of large blocks and features small patches of whitewater where water exits from the tunnel into the river. There is a noticeable accumulation of debris and small rocks near the tunnel's entrance, suggesting possible erosion or remnants of construction.\n\nThe river itself is calm, displaying ripples on its surface indicative of a gentle flow. It reflects the verdant green hues of the dense trees surrounding the area.\n\nThick foliage in shades of deep to light green cloaks the background and sides of the frame, indicating a lush, forested area. The trees look mature and undisturbed, contributing to a secluded, serene ambiance. The overall lighting in the photo is soft, suggesting it might be an overcast day, enhancing the scene's calm and untouched feel.\n\nThis natural and somewhat mysterious setting evokes a sense of quiet and isolation, far removed from urban activity. It could be a natural habitat for wildlife or a scenic spot for contemplative visits.","title":"Looking across the niagara river from Niagara Falls ontario, to the american side.
