{"path":"548928.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial shot capturing a river flowing through a desert setting. The river meanders, surrounded on either side by expansive sandy areas with sparse vegetation. A bridge spans across the width of the river, visible in the lower part of the image. The bridge is a straight, narrow structure with vehicles traveling across it, indicating functionality as a transit route. The water appears calm and reflects light, suggesting it might be a sunny day. Along the banks of the river, there are structured waterfront areas with rounded edges, lined with what seems to be small rocks or formations designed to manage erosion or enhance visual appeal. Additionally, there are various small boats visible in the water, hinting at recreational or transportation activities. The surrounding land shows signs of development, such as paved pathways and a few scattered buildings, but the overall area remains markedly barren and desert-like. The photograph provides a scenic overview of a man-made integration into a natural landscape, highlighting interactions between human infrastructure and natural watercourses in an arid environment.","title":"London bridge crosses havasu lake at lake havasu city rescued from demolition by an american buyer, the famous old span was transplanted here in 1971","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548941","548924","548933","548895","553660","549469","553663","544752","543735","548925","548097","543976","545329","548918","547990","547263"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","desert","bridge","like","overview","integration","width","appeal","route","transit"]}
