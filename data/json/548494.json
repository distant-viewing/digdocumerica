{"path":"548494.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid maritime scene featuring a sailing yacht underway on a calm body of water. The yacht, notable for its sleek dark hull and profound keel, is prominently displayed from a rear side-view angle. A significant characteristic of this yacht is its large, inflated spinnaker sail, predominantly white, which balloons forward in a three-dimensional form, filling the frame's top section. Additionally, two smaller white sails are hoisted on its mainmast, contributing to the vesselâ€™s elegant profile.\n\nAboard the yacht, several individuals are engaging in sailing activities. On the stern, someone in casual attire observes the scene ahead, standing upright and looking forward, possibly navigating or keeping lookout. Another person, wearing minimal clothing for sun exposure, stands facing the expansive spinnaker, likely managing the sail ropes or adjusting the sail trim. Other crew members are scattered near the center and front of the yacht, involved in various tasks essential to sailing.\n\nThe background suggests a peaceful, sunny day with clear blue skies and calm seas, enhancing the leisurely and sportive ambiance of the scene. Faintly in the distance, other watercraft can be seen, indicating a popular area for sailing. Overall, the photograph exudes a sense of freedom and mastery over the water, encapsulating a perfect day for sailing.","title":"Sailing on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547448","549403","549398","547458","547457","548513","549421","547454","549391","549386","549390","544667","547460","548526","549387","552348"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["yacht","sailing","sail","watercraft","freedom","crew","characteristic","member","trim","hull"]}
