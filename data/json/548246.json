{"path":"548246.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"The photograph features an elderly woman standing by an open window. She is smiling and appears to be interacting with someone outside the frame. The woman is wearing a light-colored blouse and has her gray hair pulled back. She is positioned behind a window which occupies the right half of the image; the window frame is white and contrasts with the darker interior behind her.\n\nIn front of the woman, on the windowsill, there are a few potted plants with white flowers, suggesting a homely and cared-for space. There is also a stack of books or magazines next to the plants, indicating a space used for personal relaxation and enjoyment. A net-like pattern is visible on the upper part of the window, possibly a reflection or a decorative element.\n\nThe exterior of the building is clad in white siding, giving the photograph a quaint and traditional look. To the left edge of the frame, there's a vertical white pipe and the wall below the window shows signs of wear and mildew, giving it a slightly aged appearance. The composition focuses on the woman and the window, using these elements to convey a sense of everyday life and personal space.","title":"Rockport's main street","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["548232","544410","552680","551337","552745","548454","554798","553480","543028","556487","549289","554194","556176","548459","546547","556488"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["window","woman","pott","space","magazine","quaint","flowers","frame","net","plant"]}
