{"path":"549294.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph features two elderly men standing close together and reading a newspaper. The man on the left has silver hair and is wearing dark-rimmed glasses. He is dressed in a tan trench coat over a suit with a pale gold tie. The man on the right is wearing a dark three-quarter length coat over a red scarf and a gray fedora hat. He also holds a smoking cigar in his left hand.\n\nBoth men are engrossed in reading the newspaper, which the man on the right is holding open for both to see. They are standing against the backdrop of a building with dark blue shutters, hinting at an urban setting. The focus is tightly on the men and the newspaper, making the background appear slightly blurred and out of focus, creating an intimate scene centered on their shared activity of reading.","title":"Residents of the community bordering on Logan Airport are engaged in a continuous struggle with Massport (Massachusetts Port Authority). Here Matthew Vieira (left) and Jerry Colella discuss a news story praising Massport for buying a neighborhood house for $30,000 when its original price had been $5,000. The story says nothing about today's price for a comparable structure.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["556775","547411","549291","549293","554097","549286","557907","553558","549292","557894","547443","557765","551338","556552","551454","547410"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["newspaper","man","coat","smoking","quarter","fedora","trench","reading","scarf","shutter"]}
