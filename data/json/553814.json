{"path":"553814.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image depicts a pastoral scene illuminated with a cold, soft light, likely taken at either dawn or dusk. It shows a solitary figure mounted on a brown horse, presiding over a group of cattle in a rugged terrain. The rider, clad in traditional cowboy attire including a wide-brimmed hat, is seen from the back, gazing out over the herd.\n\nThe cattle are predominantly white and various shades of gray, scattered and grazing or standing in what appears to be a dry, brush-filled area. The atmosphere is dusty, contributing to a slight haze that mutes the colors and adds an ethereal quality to the scene. The light, possibly filtered through mist or dust, casts long, soft shadows and highlights the outlines of the animals and the rider with a glowing edge.\n\nThe background is minimally visible due to the focus and lighting but suggests a wild, natural environment without any immediate signs of modern human infrastructure. This setting evokes a sense of timeless rural life, closely tied to nature and traditional livelihoods. The overall composition with its muted tones, soft lighting, and natural setting conveys a serene yet rugged portrait of life in the countryside.","title":"Cattle drive in southwestern Colorado.
