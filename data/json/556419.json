{"path":"556419.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph displays a scene of environmental degradation, featuring a waterway cluttered with substantial debris and refuse. On the left side of the image, there is a creek or small river, which appears swollen, possibly from recent rains. The far bank of the creek is heavily littered with various forms of waste, including fragments of metal, wood, and other unidentifiable materials, which seem to have been discarded haphazardly.\n\nJust beyond this accumulation of garbage, there is a lineup of what appears to be mobile homes or trailers. These structures vary in color and size, ranging from beige to yellowish and white. They look dated and somewhat deteriorated, indicative of long-term placement or neglect.\n\nSurrounding the scene are trees and dense foliage indicating that this location is in a heavily wooded area. The vegetation looks lush and green, suggesting that the photograph was taken during spring or summer.\n\nThe overall composition gives an impression of a neglected or overlooked area where waste disposal has not been managed properly, reflecting environmental challenges and possibly health hazards for any residents or wildlife in the vicinity. The juxtaposition of natural beauty and human-generated waste underlines significant environmental concerns.","title":"Row of Mobile homes near Madison, West Virginia, with trash thrown along the edge of the creek is a typical scene in the mining valleys that dot the area. The trailers are appealing to the young miners because they can be bought for less than conventional housing and take less space. Level land is at a premium in the valleys.","placename":"Madison (W.
