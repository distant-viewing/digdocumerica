{"path":"543967.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene featuring a large, multi-deck riverboat illuminated with string lights, cruising on a body of water during twilight. The image is imbued with a warm glow from the lights of the boat and the setting sun, creating a serene ambiance.\n\nThe riverboat, reminiscent of historical paddle steamers, is grand and festively lit. It has several decks, each adorned with rows of white lights, and emits puffs of smoke from its twin stacks, suggesting it is powered by a traditional steam engine. The American flag is visible, flying proudly atop the vessel.\n\nIn the background, the silhouette of a densely wooded hill slopes gently into the water, creating a natural horizon line that frames the scene. The sky transitions from hues of deep blue to shades of pink and peach, reflecting the setting sun's last light.\n\nThe water is calm, with gentle ripples reflecting the boatâ€™s lights and the fading light of the sky. This tranquil setting evokes a sense of peacefulness, and the boat's journey appears leisurely and unhurried. The scene captures a quintessential river ambiance, suggesting a timeless elegance associated with river explorations.","title":"Paddlewheel steamboat on the Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543963","543971","543955","553815","543962","543959","543972","545917","545736","551313","545921","551215","551214","551147","551222","550825"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["riverboat","boat","peach","twin","cruise","sun","string","elegance","light","imbue"]}
