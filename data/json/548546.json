{"path":"548546.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene at a marina, featuring several fishing boats moored in calm waters. The boats are closely aligned and vary in color; notable names visible on the boats include \"TROUT,\" \"CAY SAIL,\" \"OSPREY,\" \"GRAND SLAM,\" and \"SHARK,\" each painted in different hues such as blue, yellow, and white. The composition focuses on the rich details of the boats, including their fishing gear like rods and radars mounted on top.\n\nThe foreground shows a calm water surface where a bird, which looks like a pelican, is perched gracefully on a floating object, possibly a barrel, adding a touch of nature to the nautical setting. In the background, there are other boats, and beyond the marina, some low-built structures and lush green vegetation can be seen under a clear blue sky. This setting suggests a peaceful day at a harborside location, possibly in a tropical or subtropical region. The overall atmosphere is serene, capturing a typical day at a busy yet quiet fishing marina.","title":"Pelican sits on a mooring at the municipal boat docks.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["546388","543545","548547","543246","542904","542871","546939","548535","548247","542911","546935","546877","556191","548763","542902","552028"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","boat","fishing","pelican","perch","barrel","rod","moor","bird","align"]}
