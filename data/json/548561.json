{"path":"548561.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly woman sitting indoors next to a stylish lamp. She is wearing large glasses and is dressed in a pink and white gingham dress. Her hair is pulled back, possibly into a bun. The lighting is soft and warm, highlighting the texture of her dress and the reflective crystals of the lamp.\n\nThe woman appears to be engaged in a sewing or crafting activity, as she is looking down at a piece of fabric, possibly a ribbon or part of a garment, that she is holding in her hands. The composition includes a decorative lamp to her right, with a white lampshade and a porcelain base adorned with gold trim and crystal teardrops.\n\nIn the background, partially blurred, are vibrant red flowers, adding a splash of color that contrasts with the soft interior tones. The overall atmosphere of the image projects a quiet, contemplative mood, suggesting a moment of leisure or creative pastime at home.","title":"Mrs.  Ben ratner in her apartment in the century village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["558327","556482","548459","558336","546977","552611","557151","558339","546479","558323","557153","558329","558337","551337","558335","557807"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["crystal","lamp","bun","indoor","ribbon","garment","gold","dress","craft","fabric"]}
