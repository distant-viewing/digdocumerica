{"path":"554692.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a tender and curious moment between an adult and a child at a lakeside setting. We see an adult, crouching on one knee, who is either adjusting or admiring a colorful headdress worn by a child standing in front of him. The child's back is toward the camera, making the details of their face indiscernible, but the headdress features bright blue, red, and yellow feathers.\n\nThey are positioned on a concrete dock or landing, right by the water's edge. The background reveals a serene lake scene with motor boats docked along a pier lined with diagonally striped, red and white poles. Each boat has occupants engaged in various activities, possibly preparing for a boat ride. On the far side of the lake, a line of trees and other greenery can be seen under a clear sky, suggesting a peaceful, outdoor recreational area.\n\nThe scene's lighting indicates it might be a bright day, given the reflection of the sun on the water and the overall clarity of the colors in the image. The mood is calm and leisurely, with a focus on a moment of connection or teaching, as the adult seems fully engaged with the child.","title":"Father places Indian headdress on son's head at Lake George Village, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543693","552029","544200","547727","544033","558186","543515","552940","551544","552975","554517","543951","552235","544380","551473","551257"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","adult","boat","landing","lake","feather","occupant","motor","ride","lakeside"]}
