{"path":"557754.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural, agricultural scene focused on hay collection. In the foreground, several piles of freshly cut hay are scattered across a wide, green field. One compressed bale of hay is prominently visible in the foreground. The middle of the image features three individuals involved in the hay baling process. To the left, two men, both dressed in long-sleeve shirts and pants, one wearing a brimmed hat, stand near a tractor that is pulling a hay wagon stacked with numerous rectangular hay bales. To the right, another man drives a red tractor that is towing a baler, actively compressing hay into bales. This tractor and baler setup is moving through the field, leaving a trail of compressed hay bales in its wake.\n\nThe background reveals a lush and tranquil landscape with rows of crops parallel to the horizon and a forested hill that gently slopes upward. The sky is slightly overcast, casting a muted light over the scene, emphasizing the greenery and the earthy tones of the farming equipment. This image captures a moment of traditional farming life, highlighting teamwork, agricultural machinery, and the rural environment.","title":"Hay gathering and baling time on the farm of Joseph Kimsey seen in the left foreground with a white pith helmet. The land is located at Robertstown, Georgia, which is a mile northeast of Helen on State Highways 17/75. This low mountain area some 90 miles northeast of Atlanta attracts campers and fishermen. Also of interest is the business district in Helen which has been Renovated with a Bavarian alpine theme. Project success has led to new development affecting both towns.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552578","557752","551158","551169","552576","551168","549258","551167","557751","557753","552577","549137","544888","553665","555619","549252"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hay","bale","tractor","farming","teamwork","field","wake","wagon","trail","crop"]}
