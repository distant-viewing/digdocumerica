{"path":"552287.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph depicts a man holding a large oyster shell in what appears to be a coastal environment. The man, likely middle-aged, has unkempt, wind-blown hair and is dressed casually in a dirty, button-down shirt and red suspenders. He is not looking directly at the camera, instead focusing his gaze on the oyster shell with an expression that might suggest curiosity or concentration.\n\nThe man holds the oyster shell in his right hand, displaying its inner surface. The shell is large and irregularly shaped, with a rugged, encrusted exterior suggesting it may have been just harvested from the sea. In his left hand, he holds a smaller object, possibly a pearl or a smaller shell, that he appears to be examining closely.\n\nIn the background, a gray sky looms over a mountainous landscape, which is partially obscured by cloud cover. The color palette of the scene is subdued, with the blues and grays of the sky and distant mountains contrasting against the earth tones of the manâ€™s attire and the dark, rich color of the oyster shell.\n\nOverall, this image captures a moment of discovery or inspection, set against a dramatic natural backdrop that suggests a rugged, oceanic setting.","title":"Jim Poth of Seattle shucks oysters on the public tidelands of the Hood Canal at Brinnon, on the east coast of the Olympic Peninsula. Oysters must be shucked on the beach and the shells left there so that the spat (young oysters) have a place to attach themselves and grow.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552860","552288","546365","545310","552307","552879","545190","552866","546297","552867","552880","552290","546270","552865","546306","552304"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["shell","oyster","discovery","suspender","man","inspection","gaze","hand","button","curiosity"]}
