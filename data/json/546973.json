{"path":"546973.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph features an old, weathered building that appears to have been a gas station or service store. The structure has worn, pale yellow horizontal wooden siding and a rusted metal roof. Several windows on the building are boarded up or covered with grilles, and the front door is also made of wood with portions boarded over.\n\nA distinctive feature in this image is a vintage Phillips 66 gas station sign, mounted on a pole to the left of the building. The sign, colored in orange and black and featuring the Phillips 66 logo, is sun-faded and stands out as a nostalgic element.\n\nAcross the front of the building, an old advertisement can be seen which looks like an automotive-related sign. The surroundings of the building are somewhat overgrown, with green bushes and grass around the base and several large trees in the background that shade the scene. A clear sky with a few cumulus clouds can be seen in the distance.\n\nThe overall atmosphere exudes a sense of abandonment and decay, capturing a slice of rural Americana that hints at a bustling past. The photograph evokes a feeling of the passage of time and the changes it brings, highlighting the decline of some roadside businesses in America.","title":"A deserted filling station on john's island","placename":"South Carolina","location":"South Carolina","nn1":["554784","544028","556368","550103","554707","550279","556330","555509","552681","555511","555640","547866","555510","554561","552513","556013"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["gas","board","station","cumulus","building","grille","sign","decline","past","bring"]}
