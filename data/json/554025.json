{"path":"554025.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man exiting a vehicle, conveying a visual narrative of mid-20th-century rural or semi-rural life. The man, likely engaged in laborious work given his attire, wears a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, grubby gray pants, and muddy brown boots, complemented by a silver-colored bowl-shaped helmet reminiscent of a hard hat, suggesting he could be involved in agriculture, construction, or mining.\n\nHe is caught in a moment of action as he steps out of a classic, muted green car with glossy chrome details, holding the car door open. His expression is intense and perhaps focused, with mouth slightly open as if he is speaking or breathing heavily. One can almost sense a rustic or agricultural setting by his practical, work-focused outfit and the rugged dirt and gravel under his feet.\n\nIn the background, the environment is sparse with visible patches of grass and shrubbery under a bright blue skyâ€”a typical depiction of a dry, warm climate. There is another car, similar in style, parked next to the one he is exiting, both hinting at a communal or multi-purpose trip possibly related to work or local travel between sites.\n\nOverall, the image captures a slice of life, emphasizing themes of work, the rural experience, and the less-documented everyday moments of older individuals in particular environments during a past era.","title":"Sam peters, president of the Molokai Homesteaders association is plaintiff in a suit against the developers of kaluakoi regarding their intended use of water from the kualapuu reservoir","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["546092","544349","557138","556547","547277","543478","557115","549058","549042","553090","547313","553036","549054","548302","558333","546380"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["exit","work","car","classic","bowl","trip","reminiscent","chrome","shrubbery","foot"]}
