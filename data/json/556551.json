{"path":"556551.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph features a man sitting at a drafting table appearing to be analyzing or working on a large architectural drawing. He is leaning forward slightly, with his hands on the drawing, gazing thoughtfully at it. The man has dark hair, a mustache, and is dressed in a dark blue cardigan over a lighter blue shirt. \n\nThe setting seems to be a workspace or office, as indicated by the professional nature of the drawing table and the tools it holds. The table has several drawers, possibly containing drafting supplies, and there is an open bottle, possibly of soda or beer, sitting atop the table.\n\nIn the background, there is a vividly colored and playful tapestry or curtain hanging, decorated with cartoon-like medieval characters, including knights and mythical creatures. The atmosphere created suggests a creative or artistic workspace, blending professional work with personal style and possibly a sense of humor or whimsy. The lighting in the room is subdued, with natural light filtering from the left, highlighting the details of the drawing and the man's expression.","title":"Jack Smith, 42, a disabled miner who lives in Rhodell, West Virginia, works on a union poster in the tavern he now operates. He had worked in the mines for a year when his legs were crushed during a roof cave-in. It took him 18 years to receive workman's compensation. His wheelchair was brought for him by his friend Arnold Miller, now president of the United Mine Workers. Smith is active in the union, and has manned picket lines in the past.","placename":"Beckley (W.
