{"path":"548983.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting focused on large-scale agricultural processing. In the foreground, numerous piles of sugar beets are prominently displayed, scattered across the ground and loaded onto several trailers attached to trucks. These trailers are of various types; some are red, others are green, each filled to capacity with beets, ready for processing.\n\nIn the background, there is a large facility including several buildings linked with structures that seem to be conveyor belts, suggesting a system to transport these beets from the trailers to the processing units. The main building has a modern architectural style with flat roofs. Adjacent to it is a tall, white circular structure that appears to be storage silos, likely for holding processed materials. Smoke or steam can be seen emitting from stacks, indicating the factory is in operation.\n\nThe scene is set against a clear blue sky, and the overall outlook is a bustling industrial landscape actively engaged in agricultural processing. No people are visible in this image; the focus is strictly on the industrial operation and the raw agricultural material. This setup underscores the scale and mechanization typical in modern agriculture industries.","title":"Truckloads of sugar beets will be processed at the Holly Sugar Corporation plant near Brawley in the Imperial Valley.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549035","546390","543169","557385","553013","542553","554936","549168","543159","556602","558141","543764","545992","544068","552152","542551"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["processing","trailer","capacity","scale","operation","conveyor","material","silo","agriculture","belt"]}
