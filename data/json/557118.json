{"path":"557118.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph captures a natural outdoor setting featuring a rocky cliff with various inscriptions and graffiti marked on it. A person is visible in the image; their profile is shown as they stand facing the rock. The person is dressed in a patterned, light-colored long-sleeve shirt and appears to be either observing the rock closely or perhaps reading the inscriptions.\n\nThe rock itself has a rugged texture and is covered in places with low vegetation, including small bushes and what might be vines creeping up its surface. The inscriptions on the rock seem to be casually etched, including names and possibly dates, filling the image with a sense of history or personal stories left by previous visitors.\n\nThe lighting suggests that it might be a sunny day, and the general ambiance is one of quiet exploration or contemplation. The background hints at a wooded environment, suggesting that this location might be part of a forested hiking area or natural park. The overall mood is peaceful and introspective, emphasizing a human interaction with a lasting natural landscape.","title":"Ron mckinney, 22, a potawatomie-Kickapoo whose indian name is mahkuk, is seen looking at india petroglyohs.
