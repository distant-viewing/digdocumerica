{"path":"550182.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph exhibits an urban freeway scene that captures the essence of industrial and automotive activity common to city outskirts. The scene is set on a bright sunny day, under a partly cloudy sky. \n\nForeground: The frame is filled with several cars, primarily from the 1970s based on their design, traveling along a multi-lane highway. The vehicles, which include sedans and station wagons, show varied colors and are moderately spaced on the busy road. \n\nMiddle ground: On the far right, there is a large road sign indicating \"71 North Cleveland\" with directional arrows, suggesting that this is a route leading toward Cleveland. Another sign warns \"RIGHT LANE ENDS 1 MILE,\" marking ongoing changes or limitations in lane usage.\n\nBackground: Dominating the vista are large industrial structures, likely a factory or plant, characterized by multiple large stacks, some of which are emitting significant amounts of smoke or steam into the air. This sight is indicative of heavy industrial activity and reflects environmental and economic aspects of the era.\n\nThe juxtaposition of prominent industry and bustling freeway traffic effectively illustrates a dynamic urban industrial landscape, capturing both the energy and environmental impact of the time.","title":"Ford foundry on Interstate 71, in Brook Park, just outside Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["545455","545463","544723","542682","550175","552001","550167","553722","557230","556194","547811","547785","555437","545451","547569","553475"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["freeway","arrow","vista","sight","usage","outskirt","wagon","route","amount","sedan"]}
