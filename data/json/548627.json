{"path":"548627.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The image features a rectangular sign, predominantly in white with text in red. The sign reads \"UNDER FRIENDLY OWNER MGT. REASONABLE RATES OPEN ALL YEAR\" in all-caps, bold red font. The layout of the text is organized into four lines centered on the sign, and there are two red starsâ€”one at the top and another at the bottom of the text. The background behind the sign appears to be a deep blue, possibly representing the sky or a dark surface. The photograph's composition focuses entirely on the sign, and it occupies most of the frame, emphasizing its message and clarity. There are no visible people or other objects, as the sign itself is the main subject of the image.","title":"Sign on one of the many retirement hotels that crowd the beach area of South Beach.","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["554158","555518","554185","554924","555439","555503","548846","543100","549008","554186","555411","555464","549871","554550","544136","555414"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sign","text","rate","font","star","year","message","clarity","open","represent"]}
