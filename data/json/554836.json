{"path":"554836.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a vast mining area characterized by deeply carved earth and rugged terrain. The scene is dominated by large, exposed striations in various shades of purple, brown, and gray, indicating the removal of layers of soil and rock. The mining operations have created extensive patterns of terraced landscape, potentially for extracting minerals or coal.\n\nSeveral pieces of heavy machinery, including a large red crane, are visible across the landscape, emphasizing the industrial scale of the operation. There are also some white and red structures, possibly for storing equipment or as operational hubs, concentrated on a slightly elevated mound towards the left part of the scene.\n\nA series of dirt roads snake across the terrain, providing access to different parts of the mine. Patches of standing water and mud indicate recent excavation activities or the effect of natural elements on the exposed earth. The background shows a relatively flat, more intact landscape compared to the foreground, and the overall environment appears devoid of vegetation, highlighting the impact of industrial activities.\n\nThe sky has a muted, almost overcast quality, casting a subdued light over the scene and enhancing the stark, raw aesthetic of the mining area.\n","title":"An Ohio power company coal shovel works the land off Route 146, near Freeland, Ohio, and Steubenville.","placename":"Freeland (Ohio)","location":"Freeland, Ohio","nn1":["554765","554769","543857","554768","544139","552177","544111","543758","549174","551065","544100","544785","555621","554764","554829","549242"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["mining","removal","earth","striation","snake","mine","operation","coal","mud","hub"]}
