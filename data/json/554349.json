{"path":"554349.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This image features a large, densely packed car park filled with numerous vehicles from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s, given the style and design of the cars. The lot contains an assortment of vehicle types, including sedans, station wagons, and a few vans, with no noticeable pattern in the arrangement. The cars vary widely in color, showcasing a palette of reds, blues, yellows, greens, and more subdued tones such as white, black, and gray.\n\nThe setting of the car park is expansive, and it is not enclosed by any visible structures, suggesting it could be near a large venue or public area capable of hosting many people. In the background, a natural landscape is visible, hinting at a rural or semi-rural setting. The area is bordered by what appears to be a tree line and a distant hill, giving the scene a backdrop of greenery and open space.\n\nEach vehicle is parked with relative orderliness, although the density suggests a busy day or event. There are no visible people or animals; the primary focus of the image is entirely on the variety and arrangement of the vehicles. The photograph itself is taken during daylight, evident from the clear visibility and shadows cast by the cars, providing a vibrant view of this packed parking scenario.","title":"Shipment of new cars just arrived at Jersey City dockyard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["546813","556721","546879","553303","556773","547826","546685","556736","556790","542635","556722","548432","558254","547480","556204","547954"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["car","vehicle","arrangement","park","venue","van","wagon","assortment","scenario","sedan"]}
