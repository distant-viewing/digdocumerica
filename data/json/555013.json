{"path":"555013.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features the silhouettes of several birds perched on thin branches. The image captures the birds in various stages of activity, with some appearing to have their wings spread, perhaps fluttering or steadying themselves, while others are in a more settled position.\n\nThe background of the image displays a richly hued, uniform color palette that shifts from a darker tone at the top to a lighter tone at the bottom, suggesting the photo may have been taken at twilight or with a color filter that enhances the silhouette effect. The focus is sharp on the silhouetted branches and birds against the gradient background, emphasizing the shapes and movements of the birds and the slender, angular lines of the branches.\n\nOverall, the composition is simple yet evocative, utilizing the contrast between the dark figures of the birds and branches against the softer, colored background to create an artistic and moody visual.","title":"Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) in the Simpson Sustained Yield Unit of Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
