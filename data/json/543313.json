{"path":"543313.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a picturesque view of a large, arching bridge over a coastal scene. The bridge is constructed with a series of tall, vertical support pillars and has two significant arches, connecting at points to the rugged cliff sides. The bridge is seen in a side view, showing the elegance of its structural form and the grace of its curve over the water.\n\nIn the background, the ocean expands towards the horizon, punctuated by a large, jagged rock island jutting out from the water. This rock formation is distinctly shaped with a sharp peak, contributing to the dramatic oceanic landscape.\n\nThe capture suggests a bright, clear day, given the vivid blue of the ocean and the bright illumination on the bridge and rocky landscape. The photograph shows no signs of human activity, which emphasizes the tranquility and natural beauty of the scene. The surrounding vegetation is dense and green, clinging to the rocky cliff sides, adding texture and a sense of the untamed wilderness enveloping the man-made structure.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of human engineering with the natural environment, providing a stunning view that highlights both the scale of human achievement and the grandeur of nature.","title":"California--Rocky Point","placename":"Rocky Point (Calif.)","location":"Rocky Point, California","nn1":["543436","547828","546810","549547","546870","547669","542734","552846","548207","557959","549469","547703","542804","545227","549068","544542"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","cliff","arch","shap","grace","achievement","expand","jutt","elegance","cling"]}
