{"path":"551670.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor music festival scene, specifically labeled as the \"Schaefer Music Festival,\" with a densely packed audience of various individuals focused towards a stage where a band is performing. The stage, set up with scaffolding and covered by a canopy, is elevated and equipped with multiple musical instruments including keyboards and drum sets, and framed by large speakers on either side. On the stage, lit by stage lighting, musicians and possibly a singer, can be seen performing to the crowd.\n\nThe audience consists of a diverse group of people, many of whom appear to be sitting down, dressed in casual clothing suitable for an outdoor event. The heads of the crowd create a textured sea of colors against the green trees in the background.\n\nBehind the park and the festival scene, urban architecture dominates. There are several tall buildings, including a prominent tall building with a unique fa√ßade featuring vertical columns and cross bracing, and large windows reflecting the bright sky. This juxtaposition of the natural park setting with the urban skyline provides a striking contrast, emphasizing the outdoor and communal nature of the event within a metropolitan setting. The feel of the event seems vibrant yet relaxed, evoking the communal enjoyment of live music in an urban green space.","title":"Large audience at the schaefer bandstand in central park during a concert by singer judy collins","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551671","551672","551708","551674","551673","553296","553297","551012","553284","551782","551707","551709","551770","553264","553201","553286"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["stage","festival","music","audience","perform","event","crowd","speaker","set","musician"]}
