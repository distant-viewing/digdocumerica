{"path":"554944.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man engaged in the process of preparing animal pelts. The man is dressed in a white apron over casual attire and wears glasses and a red cap. He holds a knife in one hand and appears to be working on a pelt on a rustic wooden table supported by a barrel with diagonal white and black stripes.\n\nThe background includes a variety of animal pelts and tails hanging vertically, showcasing various patterns and shades, primarily black and gray. The setting suggests a workshop environment, possibly within a covered area as natural light appears to filter in from the surroundings. Shadows and a muted ambiance hint at a space dedicated to craft or manual work related to hunting or pelt preparation. The composition skillfully captures a traditional and possibly vanishing craft, emphasizing the artisan's expertise and the raw materials of his trade.","title":"Fur skins of fox, raccoon and bobcat being prepared for market in Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554943","546094","554926","554940","554925","554941","554945","554675","555533","552649","554934","548252","552634","558324","557115","554521"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["craft","animal","expertise","hunting","related","trade","apron","tail","barrel","workshop"]}
