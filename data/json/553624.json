{"path":"553624.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat eerie and moody landscape scene, primarily dominated by heavy machinery and forestry. It shows a thick forest with numerous tall, slender trees, many of which appear charred or burned, suggesting a recent forest fire or controlled burn scenario. Amidst the trees, swirling clouds of dust or smoke further accentuate the post-fire atmosphere, reducing visibility and adding a mysterious, fog-like effect to the scene.\n\nThe foreground focuses on a large bulldozer or similarly heavy-duty piece of construction equipment, enveloped in the mentioned dust or smoke. This machinery, with its bulky structure and visible treads, is actively engaged in clearing debris or moving earth, contributing to the dusty conditions. Its presence suggests ongoing recovery or clean-up efforts following the fire.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is dim, perhaps indicating either dusk or a smoke-obscured sky, which casts a somber, purple-blue tint over the entire scene. This lighting helps to enhance the feeling of desolation and recovery that dominates the narrative captured in this image. The surrounding environment appears wild and untamed, with the exception of this human intervention captured at the center of the frame.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora, California. Salvage operations on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly. Soot and ashes billow up as drags logs from burn area.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553632","546950","556456","545138","543105","553561","548807","555162","553625","555088","555087","552584","553565","553597","546060","555136"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["recovery","smoke","dust","fire","burn","machinery","forest","tint","forestry","intervention"]}
