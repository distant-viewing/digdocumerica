{"path":"553773.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph is a scenic landscape capturing a coastal area. The viewpoint overlooks a rocky coastline where the waves are crashing against the shore. The sea is vast and stretches to the horizon, and the water is a deep blue with shades of turquoise where it meets the rocky edges. The sky is mostly clear with few clouds, suggesting it could be taken during a sunny day.\n\nIn the foreground, there's an array of greenery with fleshy, rounded leaves, possibly a type of coastal shrub, which adds a touch of natural, vibrant green contrasting with the deep blue ocean.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a concrete observation platform jutting out into the sea. A few individuals are present on this platform, enjoying the view, possibly tourists or locals looking out over the ocean. This area seems to be slightly elevated, as a significant part of the rock the platform is built on is visible.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of human interaction with nature and the untamed beauty of the coastal environment, providing a sense of tranquility as well as human interest.","title":"Part of conservation zone along Highway 72.
