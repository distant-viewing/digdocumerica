{"path":"549818.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, outdoor scene dominated by heaps of garbage. On the left side, a massive pile of mixed waste reaches toward the sky, made up of various discarded items like cardboard boxes, papers, and assorted broken and unidentifiable objects. These pieces have a range of colors but mostly show tints of brown and grey, suggesting they might have been weathered or aged.\n\nOn the right, against a clear blue sky, is the top part of a red tugboat. Its shape is partially obscured by the garbage, but its distinctive round cabin and small deck are visible. The tugboat has a striking bright red color that starkly contrasts with the sprawling waste around it. It does have some equipment on top, possibly for navigation or control.\n\nThe scene is likely in a waste management or processing area, possibly near a port or river considering the presence of the boat, indicating a method of transporting large volumes of trash. The environment suggests a heavy industrial use, lacking any visible living plants or animals, focusing solely on the waste and the boat. The clear sky suggests a sunny day, but the exact location or time of year is not specified in the image.","title":"Part of the 26,000 tons of solid waste that New York city produces each day.
