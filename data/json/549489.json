{"path":"549489.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures an awe-inspiring night view of Niagara Falls. The image focuses on the waterfallâ€™s powerful streams, which are illuminated beautifully, creating a bright white, glowing effect against the nighttime setting.\n\nIn the foreground, the cascading waters of the falls display a dynamic, misty flow, lit to reveal a silky texture as water plunges downward. The rocky structures adjacent to the falls are just visible, emerging from the shadows, adding an element of rugged nature to the scene.\n\nIn the background, the horizon is dotted with lights from the city or structures across the falls, shining brightly and creating starburst effects due to the camera's aperture setting. The sky above is dark, enhancing the contrast between the urban lights and the natural majesty of the falls.\n\nThe lighting and exposure used in this photograph amplify the enchanting and dramatic atmosphere of Niagara Falls at night, showcasing both the power of the natural world and the presence of human habitation nearby.","title":"The american Niagara Falls at night, viewed from prospect park at the base of the falls on the united states side","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549488","549492","549491","552405","549530","549549","549557","549485","549556","549548","549563","549544","549554","549496","549558","549475"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["fall","night","plunge","inspire","majesty","amplify","effect","shine","nighttime","awe"]}
