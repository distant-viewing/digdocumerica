{"path":"547994.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an industrial area near a river. The river curves from the left side of the image towards the upper right corner, dividing two land masses. We can see various industrial facilities and plots.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a large area filled with neatly arranged stacks of logs. Adjacent to this, numerous small and large buildings can be observed, possibly used for storing and processing the logs. There are also multiple vehicles and roadways, indicating active operations in this zone.\n\nTo the left of the log storage area, there are several large circular tanks and white buildings which could be part of a chemical or oil facility. Roads and sparse vegetation surround these structures.\n\nAcross the river, to the right, a large warehouse or factory with a white roof is prominent. Near it, additional circular storage tanks and smaller buildings are visible. The river appears to be a central artery for transport and logistics, with several docks and moored boats, indicating the importance of river transport for these industrial operations.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes patches of green areas, fields, and trees. Overall, the photograph presents a vibrant industrial scene nestled within a natural river environment.","title":"Rivergate industrial complex and terminal area on the willamette river","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["550327","542933","547214","552140","550856","549495","551194","551172","551201","550890","555165","550855","552009","549525","551203","545889"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["river","logs","transport","tank","storage","storing","logistic","mass","operation","facility"]}
