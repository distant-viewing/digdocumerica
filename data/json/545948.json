{"path":"545948.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photo captures an unusual and futuristic-looking vehicle on a track in an open landscape. The vehicle, appearing somewhat like a blimp or capsule, has a streamlined shape with a metallic finish and a set of windows near its front. It is equipped with a rotor or propeller mounted on top, which suggests it may be designed for both ground and possibly air movement. The vehicle's body includes red detailing or striping, adding a touch of color to its mostly white and silver exterior.\n\nThe setting is flat and sparse, typical of a test track environment meant for experimenting with such vehicles without many obstacles or interference. The horizon is flat, interrupted only by the track and some sparse vegetation. The sky is relatively clear with just a couple of faint clouds, suggesting a calm day with good weather conditions for testing or operating the vehicle.\n\nThis kind of vehicle hints at concepts often explored in high-speed ground transport or experimental vehicle designs, possibly related to concepts of efficiency or alternative propulsion methods. The composition focuses on the vehicle, using the expanse of the landscape and sky to emphasize its isolation and the uniqueness of the testing scenario.","title":"The LIMTV (the linear induction motor test vehicle) is tested at the Department of Transportation's High Speed Ground Test Center. The vehicle is designed to operate at speeds up to 250 miles per hour. It uses electro-magnetic forces for noiseless propulsion.","placename":"Pueblo (Colo.)","location":"Pueblo, Colorado","nn1":["545931","545960","545946","545939","545956","545942","545964","552798","545947","555333","545596","552801","545604","544508","547979","555883"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["vehicle","concept","testing","track","obstacle","interference","propeller","rotor","test","efficiency"]}
