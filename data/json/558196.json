The ceiling is low, with acoustic tiles and minimal lighting. In the background, various gymnastics apparatuses, such as rings and a basketball hoop, are seen. The background also features gym mats in dark colors scattered on the floor, suggesting an environment focused on safety and functional training.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of concentration and dedication, highlighting the gymnastâ€™s focus and physical ability in a typical training environment.","title":"Young gymnast trains in the gymnasium of the Turner Club in New Ulm, Minnesota. Turnvereins, or Turner clubs, began in Germany in the 1800's and stress good health through exercise, especially gymnastics. The club claims to be one of the co-founders of this German community of 13,000 which is a county seat trading center.
