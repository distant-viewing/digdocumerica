{"path":"555216.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This picturesque photograph presents a serene natural setting, likely captured during a transition between seasons. The image encompasses a dense woodland filled with a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees. The foliage of the deciduous trees varies in color, with tones ranging from light green and golden yellow, suggesting it might be either spring or autumn. A small, meandering stream flows through the scene, its surface reflecting the sunlight and surrounded by a narrow strip of sandy bank that curves gently through the foreground.\n\nThe forest itself has a rich array of colors and textures, from dark evergreens to pale, nearly leafless trees that may indicate early spring or late fall dormancy. No human activity or man-made structures are visible, emphasizing the untouched natural beauty of the area. The light appears soft and diffuse, possibly filtered through thin clouds or a mist, adding a slightly ethereal quality to the landscape. Overall, the composition and natural elements convey a serene and secluded woodland environment, inviting contemplation and appreciation of the natural world.","title":"The canyon river in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554718","543581","555217","558085","554525","555218","554715","557159","555215","547011","554748","555076","555116","558012","554738","554394"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["spring","evergreen","appreciation","encompass","woodland","world","strip","contemplation","autumn","stream"]}
