{"path":"544987.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a grouping of freshly caught fish, specifically salmon, laid out on a dark, wet surface. The fish are positioned in various orientations, with some overlapping others. They appear shiny, likely due to being wet, which also accentuates their silvery skin contrasted with patches of darker shades. The surface beneath the fish is dark and reflective, hinting at recent washing or natural moistness associated with fish handling areas. This setting could be a market, dockside, or a processing area where fish are temporarily stored or prepared for sale. No people are visible in the image, focusing the view entirely on the fish and their immediate environment.","title":"A catch of fish","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545063","547848","546792","554095","544995","542892","544978","554093","546784","545075","554098","552329","555697","546846","555560","547704"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","salmon","washing","grouping","orientation","overlap","market","skin","sale","lay"]}
