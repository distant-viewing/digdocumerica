{"path":"545261.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial landscape with a prominent focus on environmental pollution. In the foreground, a long row of white railroad boxcars lined up on tracks, displaying various logos, appears beside a waterway, which might likely be a port or river. Two small orange boats are visible on the water, and a pair of people can be seen standing on one of these boats.\n\nIn the middle ground, there are extensive industrial facilities characterized by numerous smokestacks emitting large amounts of smoke and pollution into the air. The background features a dense cluster of buildings and structures that make up an industrial cityscape. The smoke from the stacks blends into a hazy sky, creating a sense of air filled with pollutants.\n\nThe overall composition and the colors in the photograph, dominated by the hues of grey and white from the smoke and industrial structures, contrast with the vivid blues of the water, highlighting the environmental impact and stark industrial activity. This image encapsulates a moment in time that highlights the environmental challenges linked to industrial areas.","title":"St. Regis pulp mill blankets Tacoma skyline with smoke","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557246","545507","547058","545265","548107","544294","550875","557226","550176","557218","548070","546808","550985","550761","545988","550181"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["smoke","pollution","air","pollutant","boat","railroad","port","link","amount","challenge"]}
