{"path":"549794.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive view of a landfill, featuring a large accumulation of garbage covering the ground. The heap consists of a variety of waste materials, indiscriminately mixed and strewn about, making it difficult to discern individual items although various colors and materials are visible in the mix.\n\nCentral to the image, there are two heavy construction vehicles positioned on the mound of trash. These vehicles, which appear to be bulldozers or similar machinery, are equipped with large metal tracks and have front-end implements likely used for moving and compacting the garbage. The bulldozers are numbered \"651\" and \"658\" respectively, suggesting they are part of a managed fleet working in the area.\n\nThe surrounding landscape offers no vegetation or buildings in sight, providing a stark view that emphasizes the vast amount of waste. The sky above is clear, suggesting a bright, sunny day, which further illuminates the scene and gives a stark contrast to the clutter and disorder of the landfill below.\n\nThis image offers a gritty, unfiltered glimpse into the scale and operational aspects of waste management, while also visually representing environmental concerns associated with large-scale waste disposal.","title":"At Staten Island landfill.
