{"path":"557321.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features an interior view of a functional greenhouse. The structure is semicircular in shape and appears covered with a translucent plastic material, which is stretched over a series of arched frames suggesting a tunnel-like shape.\n\nInside the greenhouse, the environment is densely populated with a variety of plants. To the right, there are rows of plants supported by thin bamboo sticks, possibly functioning as stakes for climbing or fragile plants. The vegetation varies in size and type, demonstrating a healthy and vibrant growth.\n\nThe ground inside the greenhouse is primarily dirt, with a clear central pathway that allows navigation through the length of the structure. To the left of the path, more diversity in plant life can be seen, along with small white labels in front of some plants, likely indicating the plant types or care instructions.\n\nVarious gardening tools and pieces of equipment are scattered throughout the interior, underscoring the active use of the space. There are containers, pots, watering cans, and makeshift shelves housing other gardening implements or possibly seed packets.\n\nOn the left, near the rear end, there is a storage or work area rigged with wooden shelving, and cluttered with items that seem to be non-plant related, perhaps storage or discarded materials. Hanging from the center of the greenhouse roof is a small fan, suggesting an attempt to regulate the temperature or air circulation within the space.\n\nThe lighting inside suggests either a bright day outside or artificial illumination helping to support plant growth. The overall composition of the photograph captures a bustling, utilitarian space dedicated to gardening and plant cultivation.","title":"Solar greenhouse owned and built by Peter Howell, located at about the 8,500 foot level in the Front Range","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["557322","555299","555361","555359","555356","555300","555372","555362","557323","555357","555298","555364","542691","555360","554105","554622"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["greenhouse","plant","gardening","growth","space","shelving","stake","climbing","fan","seed"]}
