{"path":"554853.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures two men engaged in the physical labor of handling large wood fragments or driftwood. The setting appears to be an industrial or agricultural outdoor space. Both men are wearing hard hats, suggesting a focus on safety due to the nature of their work. One man wears a yellow hard hat and a yellow jacket, and he is actively throwing a piece of wood. The other man, wearing a red hard hat and a cream shirt, assists by stabilizing or picking up other large pieces.\n\nIn the background, a rows of neatly stacked bags, which might contain agricultural products, can be seen. These bags are piled up in several layers and stretch across much of the background. The distant view shows a clear sky and lush green fields, which further suggests that the photograph might have been taken in a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nIn the foreground, a shed-like structure with an open side provides some cover over the area where the men work. On the right, there appears to be a mechanical conveyor or barrier, likely part of the infrastructure for handling or processing the wood. The ground around them is littered with wood chips and fragments, indicating the intensity and scale of physical work performed in this space.","title":"Labor from Mexico at a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554855","553631","556903","542857","554937","554856","553608","554431","544469","557945","550224","544007","554414","554427","553614","546914"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["wood","fragment","hat","bag","man","chip","piece","driftwood","conveyor","cream"]}
