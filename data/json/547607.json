{"path":"547607.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a picturesque beach scene with a clear emphasis on the natural landscape and the effects of human presence. In the foreground, there is a sandy path heavily indented with a variety of footprints, suggesting frequent passage, leading directly toward the sea. The sand's texture is detailed, showing ripples and mounds formed by the wind, and a few stray pieces of debris and vegetation are visible.\n\nIn the midground, the path is flanked by sparse dune vegetation, some of which spills over onto the sand path, indicating a relatively undisturbed natural area. This part of the beach seems somewhat protected, as indicated by the rustic wooden fencing on the right side, which is partially broken down and covered by the overgrown dune grass.\n\nThe background features the ocean, displaying moderate waves and a partly foam-covered shore, suggesting a windy day at the beach. The horizon line where the sea meets the sky is visible, reinforcing the openness of the space. Overall, the image conveys a serene and somewhat solitary seaside experience, emphasized by the natural tones and the absence of any people or modern structures in the view. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and enriching the colors of the scene.","title":"Tracks across sand dune","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547600","545280","551554","543287","548220","547015","547608","543069","547612","548088","557459","546953","548221","542890","548757","544989"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","path","sand","sea","seaside","fencing","footprint","spill","dune","enrich"]}
