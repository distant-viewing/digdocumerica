{"path":"558019.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque white church set against a clear blue sky. The church is a traditional example of vernacular architecture, characterized by its pointed Gothic arches and quaint steeple. The front facade features a large pointed arch window with radial muntins forming a wheel-like pattern, and two arched windows on either side. A wooden cross tops the steeple, which houses a visible bell.\n\nThe entrance to the church is accessed by a set of stairs leading up to a wooden double door, set within a Gothic arched frame decorated with intricate tracery. Above the door, a small statue of an angel or saint can be seen nestled in a niche. The front of the church is flanked by symmetrically placed small shrubs, and the area to the left side (in the viewer's perspective) reveals a bit of a neighboring structure with a brick chimney, hinting at a residential or industrial area nearby.\n\nThe scene is bathed in soft lighting, casting gentle shadows on the church's facade, enhancing the tranquil and serene ambiance surrounding this place of worship.","title":"Mother of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church along Akron-Peninsula Road in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron. Only the steeple has changed on the exterior of the structure since it was photographed about 1910. The village, with art shops and places for refreshment, is located within the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which was signed into the law in December, 1974. The National Park Service is preparing a master plan for the area.
