{"path":"544569.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view depicting a large industrial site in a relatively flat, expansive landscape. There are two prominent man-made lakes with turquoise-colored water. These lakes are enclosed by earthen barriers and appear to be connected by a narrow, bridge-like structure that runs across the water towards a large industrial facility.\n\nThe industrial facility, located on the right side of the image, consists of several tall structures, possibly silos, and a number of smaller buildings grouped together, forming a complex. There is also visible infrastructure like roads that curve around the lake and connect different parts of the facility. This suggests that the facility might be involved in some type of processing, possibly related to minerals or chemical production, given its isolated location and the presence of these water bodies, which might be settling ponds or cooling ponds.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is predominantly flat and sparsely vegetated, suggesting a dry or arid climate, possibly a coastal or desert area. A straight, long road stretches parallel to the right side of the lakes, emphasizing the remoteness and planned layout of the area. The sky above is scattered with clouds, implying a sunny, yet partly cloudy day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its expansive view and industrial subject contrasted against a natural but subdued landscape, highlights human industrial activity within a large-scale natural environment.","title":"Florida Portland cement factory near the boundaries of the everglades","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544788","551612","544573","551556","544471","551998","550331","546103","549168","551576","551611","554546","551585","544059","544036","549727"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["lake","facility","pond","connect","settle","remoteness","cool","silo","mineral","production"]}
