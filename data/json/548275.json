{"path":"548275.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up scene featuring an old-fashioned delivery truck on a city street, possibly from the mid-20th century based on the vehicle's style. The truck, appearing somewhat worn and dusty, is a dark color, possibly green, with visible chrome accents and a rounded front design characteristic of older model trucks. It has a large, vertical grille and rounded headlights.\n\nVisible on the side of the truck is a portion of a printed sign that includes numbers and the word \"REGULAR.\" There is a slightly illegible plate near the front, probably indicating registration details. The truck's window is rolled down, and an adult male driver, wearing a cap, can be seen looking out, partially facing the camera with his head slightly turned away.\n\nThe background includes a second, larger vehicle or a container marked with faint, worn lettering. This backdrop gives an impression of being in a commercial or industrial area. The overall image gives a feel of a regular day's work in urban transportation or delivery services from a bygone era. The lighting and colors in the photograph suggest it could have been taken during an overcast day, softening the details and giving the image a slightly blurred and moody effect.","title":"A frustrated driver sits through a traffic jam in Herald Square.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549866","548264","556714","542803","553488","550128","549832","547666","549869","552077","557044","549859","554309","547651","555817","549867"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","delivery","registration","grille","headlight","characteristic","chrome","print","soften","plate"]}
