{"path":"547597.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph showcases a severely deteriorated and burned-out car, positioned prominently in the foreground with a backdrop featuring a tranquil water body and a bridge. The car, possibly once a sedan, is visibly damaged: the paint is scorched and peeling, the windows are shattered, and the interior is gutted and exposed. The vehicle's frame and metal parts are rusted, indicating it has been exposed to elements for some time.\n\nIn the background, there is a large, calm body of water, perhaps a river, reflecting the sky. On the far side of this water body, a bridge with several arches spans across. The bridge's architecture suggests a mid-20th century design. The scene beyond the bridge includes a shoreline dotted with various buildings, possibly indicating a suburban or semi-urban area. There's a partly cloudy sky above, suggesting variable weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the foreground's stark, destructive theme against a calm and enduring scenic background, possibly underscoring themes of decay versus stability, or nature versus human intervention.","title":"Abandoned car on seekonk river bank","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547481","546315","547484","547835","547601","552072","552073","547605","546318","555850","549107","547911","547839","555849","554302","553007"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bridge","parts","scorch","shatte","perhaps","expose","stability","deteriorate","endure","theme"]}
