{"path":"546504.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph presents an intriguing composition and use of light, featuring a young boy walking alone along a paved area bordered by a large, textured brick wall. The scene is likely taken during the day as evidenced by the harsh shadows and bright sunlight illuminating the scene.\n\nThe boy, who is centrally positioned in the image, seems to be in mid-stride, with his shadow stretching long and elongated on the pavement beside him. He is dressed casually with a dark pair of pants and a red plaid shirt. His hair appears light-colored, and he is facing towards the left side of the frame, giving the impression that he is moving purposefully in that direction.\n\nThe background is dominated by the expansive brick wall, which has a coarse texture and appears robust and slightly uneven in places. Its dark hue contrasts strikingly with the brightness of the sunlight. The perspective offered by the wall and the paving leads the viewerâ€™s eye along the path that the boy is walking.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of solitude and the scale of the architecture against the solitary figure of the boy accentuates the feeling of reflection or introspection. The use of light and shadow adds a dynamic element to the otherwise static and straightforward architectural elements.","title":"Cleo rogers memorial library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546423","553494","552035","555009","547820","546520","546450","553537","552763","553506","551693","550145","546537","545542","552971","546525"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["boy","wall","coarse","paving","brick","shadow","introspection","walk","intriguing","elongate"]}
