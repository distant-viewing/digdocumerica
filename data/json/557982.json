{"path":"557982.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"In the photograph, a man is actively engaged in the sport of archery in an outdoor setting. The man, who stands firmly on grass with a few fallen leaves around, is captured at full draw of a modern compound bow. His stance is focused and balanced, enhancing his precision in shooting.\n\nHe is dressed in casual attire, wearing a grey T-shirt tucked into blue jeans that are detailed with stylish embroidery on the legs, including what appears to be the logo \"PGA\" and a graphic resembling a golfer. Additional interest is added by his accessories: he wears a bandana with a paisley pattern on his head, a silver necklace, multiple bracelets, and a wide belt. His left forearm is covered by a tattoo, visible as he extends his arm to hold the bow.\n\nThe archery equipment is significant, with a prominently featured black and silver compound bow, which includes a mounted sight and stabilizers to aid in accuracy. A quiver full of arrows is attached to his belt, readily accessible for shooting.\n\nThe setting is a tranquil park or garden area with lush greenery and trees forming a soft-focus background that subtly fades into darker shades, focusing attention on the archer and his action.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the sport of archery through the dynamic posture of the archer and the visual detail of the equipment and attire, captured in a serene natural setting.","title":"Bowman zeroing in his equipment prior to hunting, using private facilities at the Agoca Bowman, Inc., field course adjacent to the Hampton Hills area and Akron, Ohio, Metropolitan Park System at Bath Road.
