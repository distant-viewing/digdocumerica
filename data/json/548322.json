{"path":"548322.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, open landfill area covered extensively with waste and debris. Two yellow bulldozers, equipped with large front blades, are actively working on the site to manage and compact the waste. Trash of various kinds is visible, including broken pieces of furniture, textiles, papers, plastics, and miscellaneous rubble that make up the landfill's terrain.\n\nThe scene is devoid of vegetation, and the ground is entirely covered with trash creating a mosaic of assorted refuse. The atmosphere appears dusty and grim, suggestive of ongoing movement and activity by the bulldozers which are possibly stirring up debris and dust. The sky is overcast, casting a dull light over the scene and emphasizing the bleak, desolate nature of the landfill environment.\n\nIn the background, a relatively cleaner and less cluttered groundwork suggests the outer periphery of the landfill operation zone. This photograph captures a scene of industrial activity focused on waste management in an expansive landfill setting.","title":"Landfill at Fresh Kills, Staten Island (just opposite Carteret NJ.)","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546231","546250","549943","546235","550252","546247","546239","546234","546251","549937","546246","549938","549796","549794","549807","546257"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["landfill","waste","bulldozer","trash","periphery","blade","refuse","rubble","debris","furniture"]}
