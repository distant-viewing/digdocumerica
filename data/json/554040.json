{"path":"554040.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man standing on a rocky shoreline by a water body, perhaps a lake or river inlet. He appears focused, as he is crouched slightly and holding a stone in one hand, possibly preparing to skip it across the water. The man is dressed casually in a yellow t-shirt with a large number 3 printed in a darker color, and gray pants. His outfit is completed with dark shoes.\n\nThe background features a wide expanse of calm water bordered by large rocks and further back, a sandy shore opposite the rocks. Beyond the shore, lush green hills rise under a partly cloudy sky. The landscape suggests a remote, tranquil setting, possibly in a natural park or a largely undeveloped rural area. The overall ambiance is peaceful, emphasized by the natural beauty surrounding the central figure.","title":"At pukoo development site, bruce bowen, island resident school teacher, and part-time newspaper publisher, studies the man-made shore.
