{"path":"551679.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph depicts a tranquil lakeside scene scattered with numerous rowboats, both in use and tied up at the dock. In the foreground, a collection of docked rowboats is densely packed together. The boats vary slightly in design and aging, portrayed in subdued shades of blues, grays, and greens, reflecting a utilitarian functionality rather than decoration.\n\nIn the middle of the lake, two rowboats with occupants are visible. Each boat contains two people, engaging in the leisurely activity of rowing. Their placement on the serene water provides a contrast to the crowded docking area in the foreground.\n\nBeyond the lake, lush greenery and trees frame the edges, contributing to a peaceful, almost secluded atmosphere, despite the presence of high-rise buildings noticeable in the background. These buildings, seemingly distant, remind viewers of the urban environment adjacent to this natural repose, possibly placing this scene within a city park.\n\nThe overall composition, with the urban skyline juxtaposed against the pastoral lake scene, evokes a sense of escape within the city limits. The photograph captures a moment of leisure and relaxation, with a clear focus on the beauty and calmness of the natural environment alongside urban life.","title":"Rowboats in central park lake, one of the several Bodies of water that give the park much of its variety and charm","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550054","551680","544266","546856","546070","552982","550324","543579","550769","549417","549416","548555","557563","551219","550835","557562"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["rowboat","dock","rowing","lake","escape","docking","occupant","limit","boat","city"]}
