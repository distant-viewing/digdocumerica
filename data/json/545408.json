{"path":"545408.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man who appears to be a patient in a medical or care facility. He has a thin and gaunt expression, with eyes that look tired and somewhat blank. The man's skin is pale, and he has visible age spots and wrinkles that detail his old age.\n\nHe wears a light blue hospital gown and is sitting or reclining on a white pillow on a chair or bed, with another pillow visible behind him. He has a nasal cannula fitted around his nose, presumably delivering oxygen, which suggests he might be having trouble breathing or is in need of respiratory support. The background is unfocused and plain, which directs the viewer’s attention solely to the subject.\n\nThe overall feel of the photograph is quite striking—it portrays a sense of vulnerability and perhaps solitude or contemplation. The setting and his attire suggest that he is in a health care environment, dealing with health issues related to aging. The image evokes empathy and a reflective mood about old age and medical care.","title":"Damaged lung patient receiving treatment","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545412","545407","545420","553035","545409","545417","545416","545552","543906","552871","545486","543701","553055","556563","556452","558338"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["care","pillow","health","age","gown","patient","hospital","vulnerability","wrinkle","nose"]}
