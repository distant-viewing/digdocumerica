{"path":"551765.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a young boy outside, intently focused on examining a leaf. The boy appears to have a Middle Eastern or South Asian heritage, and is wearing large, dark-rimmed glasses, along with a denim jacket over a lighter-colored shirt. The small leaf he is inspecting is held delicately between his fingers, and he seems to be carefully studying it or perhaps about to place it inside the brown paper bag he is holding with his other hand.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, in what appears to be a wooded area with lots of shrubbery and plants. Leaves with a hint of autumnal color change, suggesting the season may be fall. The lighting is natural, subtly highlighting the boy’s facial features and the greenery around him.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, another child can be seen. This contextual detail adds a deeper layer to the image, suggesting that these children are part of a group activity, possibly a nature walk or a school field trip focused on environmental education.\n\nOverall, the photo conveys a sense of youthful curiosity and the joy of discovering nature’s small wonders. The composition focuses on the boy’s engagement with his surroundings, portraying a moment of learning and observation.","title":"Taking a close look at nature at High Rock Park on Staten Island.
