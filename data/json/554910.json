{"path":"554910.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene with three young adults, likely in a casual outdoor setting, under the shade of trees. The central activity involves a young woman and a young man seated closely together with their attention focused on a small object that the woman is holding and manipulating. The woman, who has blonde hair and wears a white bracelet and rings, is intently looking at her hands as she works on the object. She is dressed in a light-colored, sleeveless outfit.\n\nNext to her, a young man with curly dark hair and a noticeable mustache is capturing most of the visual attention. He is blowing into a pipe, aiding the initiation of smoking what appears to be a makeshift device. He wears a striped, earth-toned t-shirt and a watch on his left wrist, emphasizing a casual and relaxed atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, there is another individual who is partially obscured. This third person wears a checkered shirt and has her hair in braids, suggesting a laid-back, possibly bohemian lifestyle among the group.\n\nThe overall setting is natural and woody, providing a feeling of an informal, secluded gathering. The mood conveys a spirit of youth and perhaps rebellion, typical of certain social scenes from the 1960s or 1970s. The lighting is soft and diffuse suggesting the photograph was taken on a bright but overcast day or under the shade of trees, contributing to the ambiance of an intimate, youthful encounter.","title":"Boy and girl smoking pot during an outing in Cedar Woods near Leakey, Texas.
