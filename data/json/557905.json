{"path":"557905.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph showcases a scene in what appears to be a car service station or garage. The primary focus of the image is on a classic, dark-colored station wagon positioned on the left side of the frame. The vehicle has distinctive tail lights and chrome details, which point to its vintage status.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a man visible from behind. He is dressed in a light-colored uniform or outfit that seems to include a hat, shirt, and pants, which could suggest he is an employee of the service station. The man is standing with his arms placed behind his back, looking towards the parked car.\n\nThe setting has industrial characteristics, visible in the large open structure with high ceilings supported by metal beams. There are several car maintenance related elements visible, like hydraulic car lifts and other equipment on the far right. Natural light streams in through large windows filling the top section of the walls and providing ample illumination. There are red platform mats placed on the floor, possibly indicating walkways or work areas.\n\nIn the background, another car and parts of other vehicles are visible, along with more service station machinery and equipment. The overall ambiance suggests an organized yet busy automotive service area. The photograph captures a calm moment amid what is likely a typically bustling environment.","title":"Workman follows his station wagon during testing at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Since January, 1975, all light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must be checked annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, and given a safety check. All other vehicles registered in the city must undergo an annual safety check. The safety check had been a semi-annual event until the addition of emissions testing.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557885","557893","557906","557850","542763","557839","557848","557900","557891","557858","553490","557852","557853","557884","557927","557902"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["service","station","car","employee","status","mat","tail","equipment","characteristic","garage"]}
