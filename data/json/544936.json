{"path":"544936.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning landscape scene dominated by rugged, snow-capped mountains. The image features a series of peaks, exhibiting varying shades of snow and rock, under a bright blue sky scattered with fluffy, white clouds. At the base of these mountains, there is a lush, green forested area which is primarily composed of dense clumps of trees that appear to be mostly deciduous with some coniferous trees intermixed.\n\nDirectly in the foreground, the scenery transitions from thick patches of dark green trees to a slightly more open grassy area that has patches of lighter green, possibly indicating smaller bushes or young trees. These grassy and bushy areas are gently sloped, suggesting the lower contours of a valley or the foothills of the mountains.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its vivid contrast between the green vegetation and the stark, snow-covered mountains, creates a refreshing and serene natural setting. The scenery is void of any human presence or man-made structures, providing a sense of untouched wilderness. The vibrant colors and clear blue sky suggest it might be late spring or early summer, at a time when the snow still clings to the mountain peaks despite warmer weather at lower altitudes.","title":"Mt.
