{"path":"557434.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a suburban setting with a focus on new housing development. In the foreground, vibrant orange poppy flowers are prevalent, adding a splash of color and natural beauty to the scene. These wildflowers are in full bloom and scattered throughout the grassy foreground.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows several single-story homes lining a street. The houses are designed with similar, simple architectural stylesâ€”flat roofs possibly covered with shingles, rectangular bodies mostly identical in shape and size. The houses on the left have exteriors with what appears to be wooden paneling, while those farther along the street display slight variations in color and materials. Each house features a large garage door facing the street, suggesting car-centric suburban living.\n\nThere is a visible lack of mature vegetation around the houses, indicating that this is a new development. The land around the homes is sandy and bare, with only a few small patches of grass or plants near the houses, and the roads are clean and unmarked by much traffic.\n\nIn the background, the landscape gently rises before leveling off. There appear to be some hills or mountains in the far distance under a hazy sky, suggesting atmospheric conditions that are slightly overcast.\n\nOverall, the photograph showcases the contrast between human development and natural beauty, captured through the vividness of wildflowers against the orderly uniformity of suburban housing.","title":"Flowers planted around Spyglass homes built on a terraced hillside with a","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["557455","548825","553704","553700","543106","553934","557427","557437","557436","553129","557547","544600","557552","557440","548011","553939"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["house","housing","wildflower","development","street","home","centric","paneling","uniformity","shingle"]}
