{"path":"554303.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The image depicts severely crushed and mangled components of a vehicle, primarily featuring distorted red metal surfaces and what appears to be broken glass and debris. The wreckage is tightly framed, showing twisted sheets of metal that were once parts of the vehicleâ€™s body and structure. The identifiable parts include what looks like the remains of circular headlights surrounded by crumpled and twisted red metallic parts, possibly parts of the car's fenders.\n\nThe overall composition displays a chaotic and fragmented arrangement, highlighting the intense impact and destruction of the crash. The lighting is dim, casting shadows that enhance the texture and depth of the damaged surfaces, creating a somber, impactful visual. No people or other identifiable objects are visible in the photograph, solely focusing on the demolished parts of the vehicle. The background is obscured and dark, directing all visual attention to the red, wrecked metal ruins at the forefront.","title":"Flattened cars are ready for recycling.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554295","554305","554321","554355","554302","550020","547476","553863","554311","552083","554317","549107","544472","547484","554319","552738"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["part","fender","metal","vehicle","visual","remain","wreckage","sheet","destruction","headlight"]}
