{"path":"547204.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and industrial scene dominated by thick, dark smoke clouds billowing against a backdrop of a stormy sky. The sky above shows patches of blue and gray, with a glaring small patch of light that seems to be either the sun peeking through the clouds or a reflection. The smoke or steam is rising vigorously from multiple points, suggesting the presence of industrial structures or smokestacks, although these structures are mostly silhouetted and details are not clear due to the lighting conditions.\n\nThe skyline is uneven, with the outlines of buildings or industrial facilities visible against the light in the background. There are no distinct features of these buildings visible due to the silhouette effect. The overall atmosphere of the picture is somewhat ominous and bleak, highlighted by the dark colors and the overwhelming presence of the smoke. The composition of the photograph, with the dark foreground and the lighter, yet still somber sky, creates a strong contrast that emphasizes the industrial activity and its impact on the environment.","title":"Morning sun in East Chicago is blotted out by smoke from the steel mills.","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["550983","550195","545446","550333","550987","546237","545439","557218","550981","550982","551054","550181","550676","550177","550344","544704"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["smoke","cloud","patch","steam","outline","presence","smokestack","picture","skyline","reflection"]}
