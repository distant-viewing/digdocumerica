{"path":"545895.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a stark, arid landscape, characterized by rugged, textured hills and a distant mountain range. The foreground of the image shows barren, wavy hills that appear to have a rough, sediment-like texture, displaying various shades of dark gray and brown. These hills form intricate patterns of ridges and valleys, which emphasize their dry, eroded nature.\n\nIn the background, contrasting with the close undulating hills, are layers of tall mountains that are slightly obscured by haze, suggesting distance and depth in the image. These mountains rise sharply against the sky, their silhouettes darker and more defined compared to the washed-out color of the sky.\n\nThe sky itself appears muted and overcast, hinting at either dawn or dusk due to the low light. At the base of the hills and mountains, there is a flat expanse that appears to be a desert plain, sparsely decorated with small shrubs and sparse vegetation, typical of arid regions.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene yet desolate scene, invoking a sense of isolation and the harsh beauty of desert environments. The play of light and shadow, along with the textural details and the gradation of colors from the foreground to the background, adds to the dramatic essence of this landscape.","title":"View of Terlingua","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["543635","544874","544027","545809","544016","549179","549184","549183","552923","554817","545843","549132","546385","555885","553994","555642"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["hill","mountain","desert","gradation","sediment","ridge","play","essence","dawn","haze"]}
