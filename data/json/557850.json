{"path":"557850.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene that likely takes place in a vehicle inspection or maintenance facility. At the center of the image is a vintage white car, possibly from the mid-20th century given its design features like the prominent tail fins and shiny chrome details. The car's driver side door is open, and the driver, dressed in a light-colored uniform, is seated inside, with his arm extending casually out of the window.\n\nOn the right, we see two men, both wearing uniforms that suggest they might be security guards, mechanics, or officers; the precise nature of their roles isnâ€™t clear, but their attire gives a disciplined, official look. One of these men is inspecting the back side of the car, possibly checking some aspect of the vehicle focused around the trunk area.\n\nIn the foreground, two large machinery pieces with buttons and warning lights are visible. These equipment units are robust and industrial-looking, set on what seems like a dark-colored platform or control station, possibly related to the vehicle maintenance or checking process.\n\nThe setting is indoors, as indicated by the metal siding and the lighting conditions that suggest an enclosed space with artificial light. The overall mood is busy and occupational, with attention focused on the state of the car and possibly preparing or inspecting it for service or compliance with standards. The photograph has a documentary feel, capturing a routine yet crucial aspect of vehicle management in what appears to be a mid-20th-century setting.","title":"Red light of the exhaust analyzer indicates that this car failed the test at the auto emission inspection station at Norwood Ohio.  A red light will glow if either the carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon emissions are above the maximum limits for a particular model year.  The car owner will be given a 30-day sticker to have his auto repaired and be returned for retesting.  If the vehicle is not certified within that time, it can be ticketed by the police","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557906","542763","557853","557905","557855","557897","557921","557885","557860","557865","557864","549692","557919","557900","557893","557884"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["inspect","driver","car","vehicle","uniform","aspect","maintenance","documentary","guard","mechanic"]}
