{"path":"548893.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows an up-close view of a graph and some handwritten notes on a piece of graph paper, with the blurred background featuring an emblem. \n\nThe graph paper is marked with red pen ink; various annotations and lines indicate some sort of data recording or planning. Notable markings include a temperature notation (\"36 Â°C\"), and a chronological list of steps or observations, including the phrases \"CHANGER OPEN\", \"PH 6 to 19 orange color\", and others. \n\nOne particular focus is a hand-drawn graph with fluctuations represented on it, suggesting it may be tracking temperature changes or some other variables over time. \n\nIn the blurry background, the emblem features a blue and white design with a symbol that suggests it could be an official or governmental insignia, but the text and context are not clear due to the lack of focus. The emblem suggests that the activity or notes may be related to a formal study or work environment, possibly involving physical or environmental sciences given the nature of the recorded data.","title":"At EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center--where food, air and water samples are analyzed","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["546285","555249","555266","546281","543834","555392","546358","545163","549610","545374","555256","549333","552377","555280","555248","545002"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["emblem","datum","temperature","note","paper","recording","insignia","science","record","phrase"]}
