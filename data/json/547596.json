{"path":"547596.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil beach scene. In the foreground, there is an array of lush green vegetation, which includes broad, hearty leaves and clusters of bright pink flowers. The plants are dense and appear healthy, suggesting they are well-adapted to the sandy environment.\n\nThe middle ground shows a sandy beach stretching across the frame, with sparse vegetation such as grasses poking through in patches. The sand looks fine and pale, typical of many coastlines.\n\nIn the background, the ocean is visible, meeting a clear blue sky at the horizon. The water is calm with no visible waves, adding to the serene and untouched feel of the scene. There's also a very small figure of a person, likely engaged in a leisure activity like walking or perhaps bird watching, which emphasizes the vastness of the beach and the peaceful solitude it offers.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its natural foreground leading to an expansive beach and the ocean, evokes a sense of calm and unspoiled beauty.","title":"Wild roses and beach grass on the dune","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["545280","547612","547599","547592","548757","543303","547607","543287","548706","547608","552434","547603","546970","545215","543255","543089"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","ocean","adapt","coastline","bird","meet","watch","vastness","sand","vegetation"]}
