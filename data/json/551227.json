{"path":"551227.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of a white toilet with the seat raised. Inside the toilet bowl, there is a bright and vividly blue colored liquid, possibly a cleaning agent or freshener. The liquid emits tiny bubbles, giving an effervescent appearance to the surface. The top of the image includes a section of an arm, belonging to someone who appears to be in the act of either cleaning the toilet, interacting with the bowl or perhaps just observing the state of the water. The overall lighting of the image is dark, enhancing the luminosity and deep color of the blue liquid in the contrasting white toilet. The background is obscured, drawing focus primarily on the toilet and the hand's action.","title":"This \"monomatic holding head\" is in use on a houseboat.
