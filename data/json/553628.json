{"path":"553628.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a poignant scene within a fire-affected landscape. In the foreground, a large, robust-looking white logging truck is positioned on a muddy road. The truck has multiple round headlights and rugged tires, indicative of vehicles used in heavy-duty operations such as logging or wildfire management.\n\nThe background reveals a stark contrast to the relatively unscathed truck: a charred, barren hillside stretches upwards, with blackened tree trunks standing out starkly against a murky sky. Most of the trees have lost their foliage, and the ground is covered in ash and debris. A few green trees in the midground seem to have escaped the worst of the damage and provide a small hint of color in an otherwise muted and grayish scene.\n\nThe atmosphere is somber and heavy, possibly still filled with smoke or mist, which gives the entire scene a desolate, eerie look. The picture seems to have been taken shortly after a wildfire, capturing both the devastation inflicted on the natural environment and the efforts possibly involved in the aftermath to manage or salvage the situation. The logging truck, perhaps, plays a role in these efforts, perhaps involved in removing timber or aiding in cleanup.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora, California. Salvage operations on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly. A truck with salvaged timber leaves the burn site for a trip to Standard. Crews are in a race against fall snows, which bring a virtual halt to logging in the area.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553632","542609","553624","552584","555154","545930","542780","542819","553633","545272","554416","553468","542858","542854","544767","555094"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["wildfire","truck","logging","effort","ash","cleanup","devastation","situation","headlight","timber"]}
