{"path":"557489.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a weathered wooden sign prominently displayed, which reads “Buena Vista Lagoon Wild Life Sanctuary” in bold, black lettering. Below, it mentions that the location is “Managed by Orange-San Diego Counties Chapter of Nature Conservancy.” The sign has a rustic appearance with its paint slightly chipped, and it stands on timber posts with visible wear.\n\nIn the background, you can see a calm lagoon or body of water reflecting light, creating a peaceful ambiance. Further behind the water, there is a row of houses visible, symbolizing the proximity of urban development to this natural site. Above these houses, the sky is blue and cloudless, suggesting a clear, sunny day. Some low shrubbery partially obscures the bottom of the sign, indicating that the area around is somewhat overgrown and natural. The surrounding environment supports the concept of a wildlife sanctuary, with natural elements prominent in the composition.","title":"Sign notes that the Buena Vista Lagoon, is a wildlife sanctuary. One of the last lagoons in Southern California, there is concern for the body of water because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments. Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900. By the early 1970's that amount had decreased to about 125,000 acres.","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["557205","547865","550212","544496","543271","553085","554119","545109","548670","557441","544551","543101","556943","547850","543420","547973"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["concept","lagoon","sign","house","timber","shrubbery","lettering","wildlife","proximity","post"]}
