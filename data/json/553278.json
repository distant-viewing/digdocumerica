{"path":"553278.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic urban scene focused on an abstract sculpture under a broad sky. The sculpture, featuring curved, intertwined strips of metal in various colors including red, black, and brown, contrasts sharply with its surroundings. These sleek, ribbon-like elements arc gracefully against the backdrop of the sky.\n\nThe composition includes two prominent buildings framing the sculpture: on the left, a tall skyscraper with a facade composed of closely spaced, vertical lines, possibly a modern office building; on the right, another high-rise with a distinctive, textured exterior that suggests a pattern of small, repeated windows or a grid-like facade.\n\nThe sky above is mostly clear with scattered white clouds, suggesting a bright, sunny day. This backdrop contributes a light, airy feel that enhances the sculpture's visual impact. The angle of the view, looking upward from a low perspective, emphasizes the height and form of the buildings and the sculpture, portraying a sense of scale and the interplay between human-made structures and open space. This setting likely indicates a city environment where art and architecture meet.","title":"D'aug Days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, Fountain Square.
