{"path":"553829.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a large industrial structure, likely a cooling tower, associated with a power plant. Its significant conical shape dominates the foreground, and it is constructed with a white exterior and a visible framework at the base. Adjacent are other industrial buildings and a construction site with stacked materials and several vehicles, suggesting ongoing work or maintenance.\n\nIn the broader landscape, the tower is situated near a large body of water, possibly a river, extending into the distance toward a hilly and lush landscape. The river curves around the land, bordered by greenery, indicating a likely rural or semi-rural setting within a valley or between hills.\n\nFurther background details include patches of forest interspersed with cleared or developed land, and distant mountains shrouded slightly by haze or clouds, adding depth and a picturesque quality to the scene. The overall perspective is from a high vantage point, possibly from another aircraft, given the partial view of an airplane element like a wing in the extreme left foreground, suggesting that the photograph is taken through an aircraft window.","title":"The trojan nuclear power plant on the Columbia River.
