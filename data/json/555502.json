{"path":"555502.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a gas station. The primary subject is a man dressed in a dark coat and a hat, standing on the back of a red and blue pickup truck. He appears to be holding a hose or a pump, likely filling a blue tank in the bed of the truck with gasoline from one of the station's pumps.\n\nThe photograph shows several gas pumps in the foreground, each marked with pricing and types of gas available such as “Import,\" “Super Enthyl,\" and their corresponding prices per gallon. These pumps are vintage in style, suggesting the photo might be from an earlier time, possibly mid-20th century.\n\nIn the background, there are hints of a residential neighborhood with houses and bare trees, indicative of a colder season. There is also a small building that appears to be part of the gas station, and a dimly visible street lamp further away.\n\nOverall, the setting has a somewhat nostalgic feel, reflecting a typical American gas station scene from decades past. The colors are somewhat muted, common with film photography from that era. The composition focuses on everyday life and the routine activity of refueling a vehicle.","title":"Imported gasoline was aVailable in Oregon during the fuel crisis of 1973-74 at double the cost of the domestic fuel.
