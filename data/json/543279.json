{"path":"543279.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a serene moment in a woodland environment, featuring a young deer standing in a clearing. The deer, likely a fawn given its small size and the presence of white spots on its coat, looks directly towards the camera with alert eyes, suggesting a touch of curiosity or wariness.\n\nThe setting is a forest with a dense assembly of thin, leafless trees with dark bark, possibly indicating a colder season or an environment where deciduous trees have shed their leaves. The ground is covered in what appears to be pine needles or dry leaves, lending an orange-brown color to the forest floor which contrasts with the muted tones of the trees.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, with several tree trunks spaced at varying distances, enhancing the focus on the fawn at the center. Natural light seems to filter through the tree canopy, casting subtle shadows and contributing to a somewhat moody, autumnal atmosphere. The simplicity of the scene and the solitary presence of the deer evoke a sense of calm and the stillness of nature.","title":"California--near Monterey","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["544916","558368","546163","545902","550802","552339","542778","554621","550803","544623","543839","550804","551367","544434","545898","543851"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","tree","assembly","needle","leave","forest","curiosity","shed","bark","clearing"]}
