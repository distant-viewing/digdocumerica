{"path":"556132.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a circular promotional badge or pin. The badge is primarily white with a bold black border and text, along with a blue and red Amtrak logo at the bottom. The text on the badge reads \"Tracks Are Back!\" in blue uppercase letters that are slightly curved to align with the shape of the badge. Below the text, the word \"Amtrak\" and the logo – which includes a red and blue stylized arrow suggesting movement – reinforce the connection to the American railroad service.\n\nThe pin is shown against a rich red background, providing a strong contrast that highlights the pin itself. The badge appears to be made of metal or plastic with a shiny, reflective surface, as indicated by light reflections visible on the image. In the bottom left corner of the pin, there's a very small text that seems to indicate the manufacturer or maker (\"NG Slater Corp., N.Y.C. 11\").\n\nThe overall composition focuses on promoting a positive message about Amtrak, perhaps indicating a revival or enhancement of rail services. The photograph captures the crisp details of the badge’s design and text, emphasizing the promotional nature of the item and its message.","title":"\"Tracks are back!\" is one of the themes publicized by Amtrak, which has the responsibility for most U.S. intercity rail passenger service. The corporation is working to Renovate station terminals and has allocated more than 550 million dollars for new train equipment to improve rail service and attract riders. This pin is worn by Amtrak employees.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556701","556063","556058","556059","555995","556704","556064","555986","555960","556090","556107","555984","556053","556649","556073","552604"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["badge","pin","text","message","logo","service","bottom","arrow","railroad","border"]}
