{"path":"543634.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic outdoor scene likely set in a dry, arid environment. It captures two cowboys mounted on horses, overseeing a small herd of cattle in a sparse, grassless landscape. The terrain is characterized by sandy soil, sparse patches of dry grass, and a rugged, rocky hillside in the background, suggesting this could be a desert or similarly dry region.\n\nThe cowboys, both wearing traditional Western attire including cowboy hats and possibly chaps, sit atop their horses, which are adorned with ornate saddles and bridle gear. The cattle, which appear to be Hereford due to their reddish-brown bodies and white faces, include a few adults and several calves. These cattle are moving across the image from left to right.\n\nThe setting doesn't show any modern constructions or technology, lending the image a timeless, historical feel, potentially illustrating ranching or cowboy culture in rural America. The overall composition combines elements of the daily life and work of ranchers with the vast, open landscapes typical of certain American regions.","title":"Cattle roundup","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553104","548828","543776","548838","553105","548830","553110","552565","549033","553109","552698","548829","553100","553814","548954","548878"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cowboy","cattle","horse","ranching","calf","bridle","saddle","herd","region","oversee"]}
