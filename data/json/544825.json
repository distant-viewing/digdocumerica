{"path":"544825.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a group of children, possibly on a school trip, standing in a dark tunnel-like structure with a rounded arch-shaped entrance. The entrance frames a view of the outside where daylight illuminates the children and highlights their faces and attire. The kids are positioned on a wooden platform stairway within the tunnel, and several of them are gazing outside while others look towards the camera or each other. The children appear to be of different ages, mostly elementary or middle school-aged, dressed in varied casual clothing styles.\n\nThe tunnel interior is almost entirely shadowed, providing a stark contrast to the brightness visible at the entrance. The background glimpsed through the tunnel portal shows a simple, flat landscape with what seems to be sparse vegetation or grass, under a bright sky.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with the children surrounded by the dark structure and lit by natural light from the entrance, creates a vignette effect, drawing the focus to the expressions and interactions of the group of children. The atmosphere conveyed is one of curiosity and exploration, typical of young students on an educational journey.","title":"Students in covered wagon at the plains conservation center.
