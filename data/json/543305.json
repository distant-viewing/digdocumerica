{"path":"543305.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene nautical scene where three sailboats are cruising on a broad expanse of blue water. The sailboats each have large, white sails that are fully extended, suggesting a breezy day ideal for sailing. Two of the boats have hulls that appear white, while the third has a striking red hull that adds a splash of color to the marine palette.\n\nThe background features an expansive coastal cityscape with numerous low-rise buildings painted in light hues that blend with the dry, somewhat arid landscape. The city is set against a backdrop of gentle hills under a clear sky, suggesting a warm, sunny climate.\n\nThe water on which the boats are sailing shimmers with reflections of light, and the surface is relatively calm except for gentle ripples. Adding to the natural beauty of the scene is a single bird, possibly a seagull, captured in mid-flight close to the waterâ€™s surface near the center of the image.\n\nThe photograph's perspective is from a higher vantage point, looking down slightly on the sailboats and across to the cityscape, providing a broad view that encompasses both the tranquility of the sailing activity and the bustling life of the coastal city beyond.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["544697","556190","547781","544669","550754","542903","543059","544021","552345","552355","552351","544667","544665","548555","550758","549413"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","sailing","sail","hull","cityscape","cruise","seagull","encompass","boat","city"]}
