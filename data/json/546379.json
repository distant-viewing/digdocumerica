{"path":"546379.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures a poignant juxtaposition of an industrial facility and a cemetery. In the foreground, there is a cemetery filled with various graves marked by crosses and other headstones, some accompanied by floral arrangements. The graves are arranged in neat rows and are enclosed by low fences or borders. This setting conveys a sense of calm and permanence.\n\nDominating the background is a large industrial complex. It features multiple tall smokestacks, some of which are emitting smoke, and a complex framework of metallic structures that include scaffolding and various industrial apparatus. The sky is clear and blue with a few clouds, suggesting that the photo was taken on a sunny day.\n\nThe contrast between the quiet, somber cemetery in the foreground and the bustling, smoke-emitting industrial plant in the background creates a striking scene. It provokes thoughts about the coexistence of memory, mortality, and the relentless pace of industrial progress. The positioning suggests a commentary on the impact of industrialization on the environment and possibly on the community represented by the cemetery.","title":"Palo seco electric power plant across the bay from San Juan","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["546038","554825","546168","554791","545363","546196","546204","545989","555542","550328","546147","543013","546179","545993","546031","546363"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["cemetery","grave","emit","headstone","memory","provoke","smoke","scaffolding","industrialization","pace"]}
