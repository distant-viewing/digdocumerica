{"path":"547985.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts an old and seemingly abandoned industrial building or plant. The structure features a series of interconnected sections made of concrete, with varying heights and states of disrepair. Notably, one section has a tall, tower-like building with a wooden exterior, prominently featuring windows and a flight of external stairs leading up to it. Adjacent to this, there are several other building elements, some of which have multiple floors, showcasing heavy, rusted metal infrastructure like staircases and railings.\n\nThe buildingâ€™s facade features exposed concrete that is weather-beaten, creating a texture that hints at both the age and the industrial nature of the construction. Several \"Danger\" signs are visible, suggesting that the area may be unsafe or restricted. There are no visible doors or windows in some parts of the building, just open archways, which adds to the derelict and abandoned feel of the place.\n\nThe setting around the building is a grassy area with some overgrowth, indicating limited recent human activity. The sky is partly overcast, casting an even light over the scene, which underscores the desolate and quiet atmosphere of the location. There is a sense of forgotten history and disuse, making it a space that appears locked in time, awaiting either demolition or restoration.","title":"Disused structures of old Fort Hancock at Sandy Hook will become part of new beach area zoned for recreational use","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["551586","547969","547894","557412","557348","551944","550719","543258","554565","556351","550129","554707","550990","550023","543344","551330"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["concrete","building","restoration","overgrowth","demolition","archway","section","disuse","staircase","stair"]}
