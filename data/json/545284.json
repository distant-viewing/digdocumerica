{"path":"545284.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively scene at a fishing market. The focus is on a young woman in the center, who appears cheerful and is smiling broadly. She is holding two large fish, one in each hand. The fish on the left is longer and silver-colored, probably a salmon, and it hangs vertically from a clear plastic bag. The fish on the right is similar but is not completely visible as it is partially wrapped in a less transparent plastic bag.\n\nThe woman is casually dressed, wearing a dark blue sweatshirt, white pants, brown leather boots, and is holding a plaid jacket draped over one arm. Additional items hanging from her belt, possibly keys or a small tool, add to the practical attire suitable for a market day.\n\nIn the background, under what appears to be a sheltered or shaded market area, several people can be observed. These people are mostly dressed in light, casual clothing and seem to be engaging in casual conversations or transactions typical for such a setting.\n\nTo the upper left of the image, a black hanging scale (for weighing fish) can be seen, giving context to the commercial activities typical for this location. The overall setting is bright, with natural daylight illuminating the scene, indicating it's a sunny day. This ambiance contributes to the vibrant and active atmosphere of the market.","title":"Fisher \"person\" displays salmon catch","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554098","550320","554095","544995","545180","551393","554093","552274","545274","545211","547856","553095","542731","545951","552323","545198"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["market","fish","bag","key","salmon","sweatshirt","transaction","leather","silver","woman"]}
