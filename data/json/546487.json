{"path":"546487.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This is an interior photograph that shows a part of a room or a building with a distinctive and artistic architectural style. In the upper section of the image, there are numerous small lights mounted on a textured surface that forms a repeating, three-dimensional pattern, reminiscent of dome-like structures or scalloped shapes. The lights give a warm and soft illumination, emphasizing the texture and volume of the surface.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there appears to be a large, mirrored or highly reflective surface with the word \"Community\" visible in a bold sans-serif typeface. However, the text is shown inverted, suggesting a reflection on the mirrored surface, conveying that we are seeing the reverse of the word.\n\nAlong the right side of the photograph, part of a dark, arch-shaped architectural element is visible. This element has a series of small lights running along its contour, matching those on the textured surface, and enhances the architectural elegance and harmony of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, lighting, and the use of reflective surfaces create an intriguing visual effect that draws attention to the architectural features and the creative use of text within the space.","title":"Lobby of Cummins corporate building","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["557391","555317","556627","551487","555311","546517","555329","546511","546580","546568","555312","546467","549670","547763","555304","555326"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["surface","word","text","elegance","harmony","use","volume","dome","illumination","contour"]}
