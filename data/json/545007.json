{"path":"545007.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at the beach with a dramatic natural and human element. In the foreground, there is a fishing boat on the shore, colored mostly in green and named \"Miss Tillie\" with the registration number \"OR 772 KG\" visible on its side. It appears ready for or returning from a fishing trip, equipped with large booms and nets. Two individuals, likely fishermen, are attending to the boat; one standing on the boat and the other on the shore beside it. They seem engaged in either preparing the boat for sailing or securing it after arrival.\n\nIn the background, dominating the scene, is a massive rock formation prominently rising from the ocean. This monolith silhouette is striking against the sky, and it features what appears to be a natural arch near its base, observable as a small hole through which light passes.\n\nThe overall composition is set against a backdrop of the calm ocean extending towards the horizon and a clear sky, with the play of natural light adding a serene but also somewhat dramatic ambiance to the beach setting. The photograph might be hinting at either the start of a dayâ€™s labor for the fishermen or the end of one, in harmony with the peaceful yet powerful nature surrounding them.","title":"Oregon--Cape Kiwanda","placename":"Kiwanda, Cape (Or.)","location":"Kiwanda, Cape, Oregon","nn1":["545191","545081","545120","543057","543046","554147","543139","544976","543329","543175","543250","545130","543053","553852","543402","545116"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fisherman","boat","fishing","ocean","arrival","beach","shore","registration","harmony","hole"]}
