{"path":"547778.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast and moody agricultural landscape after heavy rain or a flood. The foreground is mostly dominated by dense, wet grass and vegetation, which is lush and shades of green and brown, indicating a natural, somewhat unkempt growth. The middle ground transitions into a more barren, muddy field that stretches far into the background. The soil looks saturated with water, displaying a slick, shiny surface that spans out towards the horizon, accentuating the flatness of the terrain.\n\nIn the distance, obscured slightly by a mist or fog, faint outlines of farm buildings or machinery can be seen, giving a sense of scale and human presence in this expansive rural environment. The sky is overcast, adding a gloomy atmosphere to the scene with grey tones dominating the upper part of the frame, suggesting recent or impending rainfall. Tire tracks and puddles scattered throughout the muddy field convey that the area is used for farming activities, though no active work is visible at the moment.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a tranquil yet somber moment in a rural setting, highlighted by the wet conditions and the vast, flat open space that conveys a sense of isolation and the formidable power of nature.","title":"Farmland, north of Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["552834","552483","549182","552842","549181","553856","552515","549178","555596","544734","554803","553652","547305","554807","555641","557013"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["flood","puddle","field","rainfall","fog","tire","farming","rain","farm","growth"]}
