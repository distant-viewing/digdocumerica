{"path":"552651.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a festive scene of a parade with three women riding horses down a city street. Each horse rider is dressed in distinct, colorful attire that seems western-themed, including cowboy hats, which suggest the event may have a rodeo or country fair context.\n\nThe first rider, on the left, is wearing a bright green outfit with a classic broad brimmed hat, and her brown horse bears a banner reading '4H ATTEM'. The second rider, in the center, is dressed in a patterned jacket that has shades of yellow, orange, and black, paired with a white cowboy hat; her horse also has a banner that reads 'CARFIELD 4H'. The third, to the right, wears a yellow shirt and brown vest, also donning a white hat, and her horse's banner reads 'CARFIELD 4H' similarly.\n\nThe riders are all waving or smiling, engaging with the crowd lined up on both sides of the street. The spectators are diverse in terms of age, with children and adults visible, and some are also capturing the moment with cameras. The setting exhibits urban features like a stop sign, buildings with storefronts, and a visible crowd barrier, which helps in managing the crowd. The atmosphere appears lively and celebratory, typical of a community event or parade.","title":"Labor Day weekend brings the annual Garfield County Fair parade","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["557046","557712","557058","557062","549576","557047","549566","557716","549574","552660","549583","553715","552657","549581","552662","553716"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["horse","rider","banner","crowd","parade","hat","cowboy","read","event","country"]}
