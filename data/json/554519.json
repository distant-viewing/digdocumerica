{"path":"554519.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and natural outdoor scene centered around a single fisherman engaged in fly fishing. The man stands midstream on large, smooth river rocks, surrounded by a gently flowing river that reflects hints of sunlight. He appears to be an older adult, dressed in classic outdoor attire, including a red and black plaid shirt, dark trousers, and tall rubber boots, suitable for wading through water. His pose is dynamic, as he is actively casting his line, with the fishing rod angled high above his shoulder.\n\nThe surrounding environment features lush greenery, with dense trees filling the background, indicating that the location is likely in a forested or wild area. The river water is clear, with patches of foam and small ripples around the rocks, suggesting a peaceful but active water flow.\n\nThe composition of the image is thoughtful, with the fisherman positioned slightly to the left, balancing the visual weight of the dense trees on the right. The natural lighting appears overcast, softening the colors and adding a moody, tranquil atmosphere to the scene. Overall, the photograph depicts a moment of solitude and engagement with nature, highlighting both the sport of fishing and the beauty of the natural environment.","title":"Trout fisherman casting on Twitchell Creek near Big Moose, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554520","550665","550317","542529","550313","550666","542509","553337","543659","555576","553338","542744","543516","550217","553339","551024"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fisherman","fishing","river","flow","rubber","weight","wade","rock","fly","soften"]}
