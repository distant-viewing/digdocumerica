{"path":"545875.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a wet, stormy scene on a highway. In the image, two vehicles are traveling on a rain-soaked road, with water splashing around them as they move. The vehicle in the foreground is a dark-colored pickup truck heading towards the camera. It's sending up a big spray of water from the rear tires, suggesting the road is quite flooded. The vehicle in the background, which appears farther away and facing the opposite direction, also has its headlights on, illuminating the reflective, wet surface of the road. \n\nIt's either dusk or dawn, given the low light, and the sky is overcast with heavy clouds, contributing to the overall gloomy ambiance of the scene. The surroundings are sparse with little vegetation visible, mostly short grasses and a few bushes along the roadside. There are utility poles intermittently placed along the side of the road, stretching into the distance. The wet road reflects the vehiclesâ€™ lights and the gray sky, adding a shimmer to the overall dark and wet environment. Overall, the image communicates a sense of isolation and the challenges of traveling under harsh weather conditions.","title":"Heavy rain floods road.","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["556986","546738","544490","544164","546401","546747","546644","548298","552856","553894","545367","544598","546610","555421","548197","546739"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","vehicle","shimmer","dark","pickup","headlight","spray","challenge","roadside","tire"]}
