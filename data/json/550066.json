{"path":"550066.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts a broad view of an old steel truss bridge, possibly used for trains or pedestrian traffic. The bridge's architecture features crisscrossing steel beams and riveted joints, signifying a robust industrial design typical of the early 20th century. The steel structures are rusted, hinting at significant weathering and age.\n\nTwo parallel railway tracks run the length of the bridge, suggesting it was primarily used for rail transport. These tracks create lines that draw the viewerâ€™s eye forward towards the cityscape in the background. The shadow patterns on the bridge deck are prominently visible, adding a geometric aesthetic to the scene due to the low angle of the sun.\n\nIn the distance beyond the bridge, modern buildings are visible, including high-rises that contrast with the old and industrial nature of the bridge. This juxtaposition emphasizes the passage of time and the evolution of urban environments.\n\nThere appears to be no human activity on the bridge at the time the photograph was taken, which could imply abandonment or simply a moment of quiet in a usually busy area. The sky is clear and the overall lighting is bright, suggesting the photo was taken on a sunny day, enhancing the clarity and color saturation of the image.","title":"Old bridge on Northern Avenue","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["552064","550955","546139","550966","552247","550954","555749","550189","548207","546865","546112","557090","550964","555937","550986","555933"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","steel","evolution","rivet","track","truss","signify","saturation","time","weathering"]}
