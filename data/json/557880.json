{"path":"557880.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a hand-made, makeshift stand displaying newspapers and magazines for free distribution. The principal element in the image is a cardboard sign with the word \"FREE\" handwritten in bold, block letters, with an arrow pointing downwards. This sign is attached to what appears to be a glass pane or clear plastic divider using tape, which is partly peeled off and curling at the edges.\n\nBeneath the sign, there is a stack of newspapers and magazines, indicative of a public space such as a cafe, library, or a community center where complimentary reading materials might be offered to visitors. The top visible publication in the stack is partially revealed, showing a portion of its title, which includes the word “Clean.”\n\nThe setting is partially lit, focusing more light on the sign and the top of the publications, while the periphery of the frame fades into shadows, suggesting an indoor setting with controlled lighting. The overall composition and the makeshift nature of the setup suggest a casual or community-driven environment aimed at encouraging free access to information or reading materials.","title":"\"I'm clean\" bumper stickers are given to any motorists who wish to place them on their vehicles after passing an inspection at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Since the beginning of 1975, all city motorists must pass the long-standing safety check only once a year. An emissions test on an exhaust analyzer has been added for all light-duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles to monitor safe levels of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["548612","556209","553763","554380","549809","548219","556675","556761","543895","549049","555391","549295","554185","552647","545962","557765"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["magazine","newspaper","word","sign","stack","library","tape","encourage","cafe","periphery"]}
