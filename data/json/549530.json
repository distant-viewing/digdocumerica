{"path":"549530.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view of Niagara Falls, specifically focusing on the American side. The scene is vibrant with natural and human-made elements.\n\nCentered in the frame is the majestic waterfall, forcefully cascading down, surrounded by rising mist. In the foreground, there's a lush grass area on one side and a concrete viewing platform on the other. This platform is crowded with visitors, giving a lively sense of tourism activity. People, appearing in various colors of clothing, are spread out across the platform, some are taking photographs while others simply enjoy the view.\n\nTo the left, a large observation tower rises above the scene, featuring an extensive vertical structure with an enclosed top, likely offering panoramic views of the falls and surrounding area. It is connected to the ground by a bridge-like structure that spans over the river, contributing to the industrial feel amidst the natural beauty.\n\nIn the background, the river continues its flow past the falls, and the opposite bank is dotted with trees and what appears to be additional visitor areas or parkland, adding to the greenery in the view. The sky is clear and hints at a sunny day, enhancing the overall vibrancy of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph beautifully balances the raw natural power of the falls with human interaction and infrastructure, offering a snapshot of this popular natural landmark as a place of both natural wonder and tourist attraction.","title":"The american Niagara Falls seen from goat island, which divides the cataract into two parts at the brink of the escarpment","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549549","549563","549466","552405","549536","549535","549534","549475","549548","549557","549473","549556","549558","549554","549485","549496"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["platform","fall","visitor","tourism","view","wonder","attraction","offer","rise","landmark"]}
