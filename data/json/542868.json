{"path":"542868.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph appears to be an aerial view of a coastal city with several distinct features. The body of water in the forefront is likely a river, featuring a meandering path and contributing to the riverine layout of the city. Across this river, several bridges are visible, facilitating connectivity between different parts of the city.\n\nThe city itself is densely built, with numerous buildings close together, showing a mix of residential and possibly commercial areas. On the left side of the image, an industrial area can be seen. This is characterized by larger structures, possibly factories or warehouses, and is significant by the presence of smokestacks emitting plumes of smoke, suggesting active industrial processing.\n\nThe geographical setting includes a large open area towards the horizon, which might be the ocean, given the city's apparent coastal location. The sky is somewhat overcast with clouds dispersing towards the horizon, creating a dramatic backdrop.\n\nOverall, the mix of industrial activity, dense urban structures, and waterways provides a comprehensive overview of a bustling, industrious coastal city. This presentation speaks to the combined uses of the area for living, commerce, and industry.","title":"California--Humboldt Bay near Eureka","placename":"Humboldt Bay (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt Bay, California","nn1":["548344","548320","555758","556947","550134","555744","556952","555762","552133","551607","555738","548453","549480","550890","551178","546690"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","presentation","connectivity","overview","disperse","mix","commerce","facilitate","river","living"]}
