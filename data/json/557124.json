{"path":"557124.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant natural scene where a flock of birds is in mid-flight over a wild grassy area. In the foreground, tall brown and golden grasses dominate the view, creating a dense texture across the bottom part of the image. Above this grassy expanse, a multitude of birds, likely geese or similar waterfowl, are scattered throughout the air, their wings in various positions of the flapping motion, suggesting energetic movement.\n\nThe birds are predominantly white with black wing tips, contrasting sharply against the natural backdrop. In the background, a forest with a mix of fall colors—reds, oranges, and yellows—can be seen, interspersed with sections of evergreens or darker foliage. The trees are set against a clear blue sky. The whole setting conveys a serene yet dynamic autumnal scene, likely in a rural or semi-wild environment where wildlife flourishes. The absence of any human activity or man-made structures suggests that this place is relatively undisturbed, focusing purely on the natural elements and wildlife in action.","title":"Flocks of blue geese and snow stop at the squaw creek national wildlife refuge near Mound City, Missouri, at the northwest corner of the state.
