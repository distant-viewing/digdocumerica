{"path":"544112.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive open-pit mining operation under bright sunlight. The scene is characterized by large, curving terraces dug out of the earth, creating a multi-layered landscape in varying shades of browns and oranges. Several heavy vehicles, likely trucks and excavators, are scattered throughout the site, some moving along the terraced paths while others are stationary, possibly engaged in excavation activities.\n\nThe layers of the pit show a rich tapestry of geological textures, indicating the removal of different types of materials or strata. These layers dip and rise, following the natural topology influenced by the mining process. The scale of the operation is highlighted by the small size of the vehicles compared to the vast expanse of the terraced earth.\n\nThe background beyond the pit is less distinct, possibly hinting at a horizon that blends into a dusty, hazy sky. No vegetation or signs of life other than the industrial activity are visible, emphasizing the arid and possibly harsh environment typical of such extraction sites. \n\nOverall, the image captures the intense human intervention in a natural landscape typical of large-scale industrial mining operations, marked by heavy machinery and altered earth topography.","title":"The Anaconda Co.'s Twin Buttes mine. The mine is 1,100 ft. deep. The first 500 ft was alluvium, a waste product. The operation has a 10 to 1 ratio of waste to usable ore.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["553049","544111","549172","549241","544100","552177","544054","544110","549177","549242","555621","544096","549167","543758","544785","554768"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["pit","mining","earth","operation","removal","stratum","terrace","layer","site","excavator"]}
