{"path":"546703.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a long, multi-laned road extending into the distance, lined with a blend of residential and commercial infrastructure. The road is bustling with traffic, featuring a mix of cars and trucks, with different lanes accommodating varying directions of travel, indicating a major arterial road or highway.\n\nProminently in the foreground, a large overpass spans across the road, with vehicles appearing beneath it, suggesting connectivity with other major thoroughfares or possibly an expressway system. The architecture visible includes a prominent brown, multi-story building located near the intersection, structured traditionally with symmetric windows and a peaked roof, possibly an institutional or historical building.\n\nThe surroundings are lush with greenery; trees envelop much of the residential areas which consist of smaller-sized homes and some larger buildings that might be apartment complexes or office buildings. The area gives an impression of a densely populated urban setting that balances nature with urban development.\n\nThe shot is taken from a high vantage point looking down the road which leads straight into the thick of an urban landscape, hinting at a perhaps suburban to urban transition. The image also illustrates a clear sky, providing for a vivid and detailed view of the area. It captures a slice of daily life in an urban environment, characterized by busy traffic and a structured urban plan.","title":"Highway leading into Washington","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546612","548092","546713","546616","546707","548411","546726","546678","546670","546617","547764","555781","547770","548363","547430","553015"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["road","plan","traffic","thoroughfare","span","connectivity","overpass","building","apartment","intersection"]}
