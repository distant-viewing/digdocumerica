{"path":"542876.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic harbor scene. In the foreground, there are wooden posts sticking out of the water, possibly part of a dock or pier structure. A small rowboat occupies the center of the image, with a single occupant who appears to be rowing. In the background, a larger boat labeled \"Pilgrim\" is moored nearby, and several other boats are visible throughout the harbor area.\n\nBeyond the water, the photograph reveals a hilly landscape, densely packed with houses and buildings of various sizes and colors. There appears to be a small community built around this harbor, with residential homes built closely together, many of which are typical of coastal towns with external wooden construction and gabled roofs.\n\nThe skies are partly cloudy, and the overall lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting a calm over the scene. The backdrop includes a hill with sparse vegetation under a clear sky, suggesting a location that might experience varied weather, typical of many coastal regions. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful, highlighting a moment of simplicity and tranquility in a picturesque coastal setting.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542872","542878","543358","542877","542907","542905","542913","548249","542910","550322","548235","550307","542903","546998","548229","548247"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["harbor","build","rowboat","occupant","boat","gable","stick","moo","pier","simplicity"]}
