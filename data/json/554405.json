{"path":"554405.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and moody lakeside scene at twilight. It features a calm, expansive body of water under a dramatically overcast sky. The lake stretches out into the distance, surrounded by a dense treeline that creates a natural border. The background shows gently rolling hills shrouded in mist, adding to the atmospheric quality of the scene.\n\nThe sky is a mix of deep blues and purples, possibly indicating onset of dusk or an approaching storm. These cool tones dominate the image, giving it a somber, tranquil feel. A few breaks in the clouds suggest possible light penetration, but overall, the cloud cover is thick and extensive, contributing to the dim lighting in the scene.\n\nThe left side of the frame includes a partial view of pine branches, which are silhouetted against the sky and overhang slightly into the scene, enhancing the sense of being nestled in a secluded natural area. The water itself is smooth, hinting at a lack of wind, and reflects the dark, brooding colors of the sky above.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on nature, the interplay of light and shadows, and the expansive view of the lake and hills, evokes a sense of solitude and contemplative peace. The image is devoid of any human activity, reinforcing its portrayal of the natural environment as untouched and serene.","title":"Rain and mist on twitchell lake, northeast of Old Forge village","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["552142","552319","543577","550493","550735","543604","554397","550745","551280","543611","554752","550777","547127","557570","545213","543590"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["onset","lake","treeline","peace","hill","portrayal","cloud","blu","storm","approach"]}
