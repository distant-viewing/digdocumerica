{"path":"552139.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph presents a serene yet industrially marked landscape, largely dominated by the expansive body of water that reflects a beautifully clear blue sky. On the left side of the image, there is an old, weathered wooden structure that juts into the water. The wood is dark and shows signs of significant weathering and decay, indicating exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Some of the wooden posts are broken off and have uneven, jagged tops.\n\nIn the distance, across the water, there is an industrial area with several large structures, including buildings and storage tanks. Prominent amongst these is a factory with tall chimneys from which white smoke is billowing into the sky, indicating ongoing industrial activity.\n\nOn the right side of the image, another wooden structure, possibly a dock or pier, extends into the water. On this structure, two people can be seen engaged in a form of activity, possibly related to fishing or perhaps inspecting the structure itself.\n\nThe foreground of the photograph features a rocky shoreline, adding a natural texture to contrast with the industrial background. The overall impression is of a place where industrial and natural elements meet, each influencing the landscape under a wide, open sky. The water acts as a calm nexus point for these elements, carrying reflections and the peaceful essence of the sky above.","title":"Commencement Bay framed by old piers.
