{"path":"543563.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of rushing and splashing water, possibly in a natural setting such as a river or creek. The image captures the dynamic movement of the water with bubbles and foam visible, indicating strong currents or water hitting against obstacles. The water is predominantly dark with hints of greens and blues, suggesting either deep water or reflections of surrounding foliage. The light reflecting off the white foam adds a sparkling effect, emphasizing the force and motion of the water. No people, specific identifiable objects, or distinct background features are visible in the image; it is entirely focused on the natural water activity.","title":"Cascading waters","placename":"Tahoe National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe National Forest, California","nn1":["544854","550651","544862","542742","544867","557252","544856","545882","552061","553416","553388","550817","550843","547650","549542","550370"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["foam","water","obstacle","creek","bubble","hit","rush","current","force","splash"]}
