{"path":"544173.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, as indicated by the low light and gentle hues in the sky. The focus is on a large industrial plant featuring multiple structures including towering smokestacks. From several of these stacks, thick plumes of dark smoke are billowing into the sky, which adds a dramatic contrast against the dusky sky.\n\nThe plant itself is heavily silhouetted, and consists of complex arrays of pipelines, scaffolding, and various industrial apparatus, suggesting a facility related to energy production or manufacturing. The myriad of small lights scattered throughout the structure imbue the scene with a sense of activity and ongoing operations, despite the absence of visible workers.\n\nIn the background, the sky is overcast, layered with dark clouds that mirror the color of the smoke, blending the emissions into the natural scene. This juxtaposition hints at the environmental impact of the facility, capturing a moment of industrial exertion against the natural backdrop of the sky at dayâ€™s end or beginning. This photograph likely aims to evoke thoughts on environmental issues, industrialization, and their interactions with natural elements.","title":"Four Corners Generating Plant","placename":"Shiprock Peak (Ariz.)","location":"Shiprock Peak, Arizona","nn1":["542999","545446","547090","544696","544700","551026","557381","550821","545433","544684","545239","551054","547539","543011","544688","552188"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["beginning","myriad","exertion","smoke","pipeline","industrialization","scaffolding","facility","apparatus","plant"]}
