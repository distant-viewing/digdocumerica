{"path":"557894.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph features two men, seemingly engaged in a thoughtful or analytical discussion over a document. The setting appears to be indoors, possibly within an office or institutional environment given the serious tone of their interaction.\n\nOn the left is a younger man, who sports a beard and mustache, wearing circular sunglasses, a dark denim jacket over a white dress shirt, and a darker necktie. He exhibits an intense expression as he points to a spot on the document, suggesting he is explaining or questioning something specific.\n\nThe man on the right is older, characterized by his silver hair and glasses. He is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and is holding the document. He appears to be closely reviewing the content, his face marked by a look of concentration.\n\nIn the background, there is a piece of equipment (perhaps a vending machine or an operational board) labeled with \"Sun Kist.\" Very little else of the background is visible, implying a focus on the interaction and discussion between the two individuals, rather than their surroundings. The overall lighting is slightly dim with a focus of light on the document, enhancing the attention on their activity of reading and discussing.","title":"City employee of an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, left, explains a brochure given to all motorists whose vehicles fail the test.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557037","552390","554322","557856","556271","557907","555233","555247","551338","557910","552356","555234","555334","556383","546628","542546"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["document","discussion","vending","indoor","reading","mustache","beard","silver","board","interaction"]}
