{"path":"544747.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features a young woman in a natural outdoor setting. She is smiling broadly, holding a piece of grass between her teeth. The woman has long, flowing red hair and is wearing round, wire-rimmed glasses. Her attire includes a blue and white floral pattern sleeveless dress layered over a blue turtleneck sweater, indicating a cool but sunny day.\n\nThe focus is sharply on her, with a blurred background that suggests a forested area with soft, diffuse lighting, indicative of either early morning or late afternoon. Her expression conveys a sense of joy and ease, perhaps enjoying a pleasant moment in nature. The color tone of the image has a slightly vintage look, with rich, saturated colors that enhance the natural vibrancy of the scene.","title":"Studying the environment on a trail hike","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["553165","544742","543655","543835","543853","557114","550048","554906","556143","554923","554905","553156","543319","553509","553917","555395"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["tooth","turtleneck","ease","rim","joy","vibrancy","woman","sweater","outdoor","wire"]}
