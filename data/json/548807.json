{"path":"548807.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of significant environmental disturbance or land clearing. The foreground is dominated by a large pile of white rubble, possibly debris or excavated soil. Beyond these foreground elements, a landscape of destruction unfolds where numerous trees have been uprooted or broken. Vegetation is sparse, consisting mainly of a few remaining trees that are scattered unevenly across the terrain.\n\nIn the middle ground, a red tractor appears actively involved in the land-clearing process, positioned slightly to the right side of the image behind some of the remaining trees. The presence of heavy machinery suggests that this clearing might be part of a construction or large-scale landscaping operation.\n\nIn the background, the sky is visible and appears clear, indicating it might be a dry and dusty environment. The setting seems remote, as there are no visible buildings or other structures besides the mentioned machinery. The overall color tone of the image is slightly dark with hues of blue and grey, possibly due to the time of day or photographic effects.","title":"Land scraped for commercial development at Key Largo near the northern tip of the Florida Keys.
