{"path":"552856.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a flooded road with a car navigating through the water. The scene captures a broad expanse of dark, murky water surrounding a stretch of road. The road appears partially submerged, with water levels high enough to cover the lanes almost entirely, except for a visible dividing line visible between what would normally be the traffic lanes. On the road, a white car is making its way through the water, likely navigating carefully due to the unusual conditions.\n\nOn either side of the flood-covered road, there are patches of land with sparse vegetation and small bushes, indicating a rural or less developed area. The surrounding landscape is mostly flat, which might contribute to the extensive flooding. The water reflects some light, suggesting either a time of day with bright sunlight or conditions that enhance the glare on the waterâ€™s surface. In the background, more water continues to the horizon, emphasizing the scale of this flooding event, which likely impacts a significant area.\n\nThis image captures a moment of resilience or urgency as someone attempts to travel despite the environmental challenges posed by the flooding. It serves as a stark visual representation of the impacts of natural disasters or severe weather conditions, emphasizing how such events can disrupt daily life and mobility.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi river reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
