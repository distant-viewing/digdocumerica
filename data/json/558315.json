{"path":"558315.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Truman, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a senior man in the midst of chopping wood. He is dressed in a light grey long-sleeve shirt, khaki pants, and a dark cap, wielding an axe which is caught mid-motion above a chopping block. The setting is outdoors during what appears to be a sunny day due to the well-lit environment and shadows cast by the objects and the man.\n\nBehind him, there's a large pile of assorted logs, suggesting a rural or suburban setting where gathering and cutting firewood is a part of daily life. The trees around this area are tall and bare, implying the season might be fall or early winter.\n\nIn the far background, there's a glimpse of a house, partially obscured by the trees and the woodpile. This subtle architectural element along with the vast pile of logs enhances the rustic, outdoor ambiance of the scene. The pile of logs and cut wood directly around the man suggests that he has been at this task for some time, emphasizing a theme of hard work and self-sufficiency.","title":"Mr. August Vogel chops wood to feed the wood-burning kitchen stove he and his wife still use for cooking.
