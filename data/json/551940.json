{"path":"551940.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph portrays a mature man walking on a concrete pathway, located in what appears to be a park or a similarly verdant public space. The man is centrally positioned, walking towards the camera. He is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, and is wearing a cap. He holds his right hand to his cap and his left hand appears to be reaching towards his chest—as if he is adjusting something or possibly wiping sweat.\n\nThe setting around the man is lush and green, indicative of a warm, possibly humid day given the greenery and the man's action of wiping or shielding his face. The pathway is lined with grass and trees, creating a tunnel-like effect leading up to where the man is located. Additionally, there are streetlamps visible, and benches can be spotted in the background, reinforcing the public, recreational nature of the setting. The blurred background suggests a shallow depth of field, focusing the viewer's attention on the man and his immediate surroundings.\n\nOverall, this image captures a solitary moment of a man’s walk in a serene park setting, emphasising themes like everyday leisure, personal space in public areas, and possibly the summer season.","title":"The pursuit of physical fitness brings sweat to the brow foster avenue beach","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["546535","544295","547816","553176","543037","551815","557713","552113","547820","553418","557112","552723","546450","547310","550298","545091"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["man","walk","pathway","reache","themes","locate","cap","tunnel","shield","chest"]}
