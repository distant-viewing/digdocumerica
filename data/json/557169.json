{"path":"557169.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of natural elements. In the foreground, the main focus is on a cluster of flat, brown, overlapping seed pods which resemble scales or shells. These pods are fixed to a curved, woody stem that arches across the frame. Attached to, or emanating from, this stem are silky, white fibers that spread out softly, creating a dynamic and textural contrast with the hard, rugged appearance of the seed pods. \n\nThe background is blurred and dark, highlighting the details and the textures of the seed pods and silky fibers in the foreground. The lighting emphasizes the sheen on the fibers and the rough texture of the seed pods, achieving a play of light and shadow that enhances the depth of the composition. The overall impression is one of intricate natural detail, capturing the delicate balance between growth and decay in nature.","title":"Closeup of a milkweed pod growing in Johnson County, Kansas, near Kansas City. It is a typical plant of the tallgrass prairie. Only isolated patches of native tall grasses survive in the state after the wave of pioneers plowed and planted crops in the fertile soil. There is a bill in Congress which would preserve an area of Kansas as a Tallgrass Prairie National Park, but there has been some opposition and the bill remains in committee in Congress.","placename":"Johnson County (Kan.)","location":"Johnson County, Kansas","nn1":["555039","558079","546156","555052","554745","557617","542774","557197","557582","557620","545291","555053","545521","555185","552554","555188"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["seed","stem","shell","sheen","balance","arch","detail","play","texture","growth"]}
