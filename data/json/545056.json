{"path":"545056.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a small fishing boat in a deep blue sea with moderate waves. The boat, predominantly white with a cabin near the bow, is equipped with what appears to be commercial fishing gear including large spools or winches possibly used for nets or longlines. There are three individuals on the boat. Two of them are standing and seem to be actively engaged in fishing-related activities, looking towards the sea. They are dressed in dark, waterproof clothing suitable for marine environments. The third person is slightly obscured and appears to be sitting or crouching, focused on a task within the boat.\n\nIn the background, a distant mountainous coastline under a partly cloudy sky provides a scenic backdrop. The mountains are hazy, possibly indicating some distance from the vantage point of the photograph. A few other vessels can be spotted on the sea surface between the fishing boat and the shoreline, suggestive of a busy maritime area.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with the small boat centered and the expansive sea around, highlights the vastness of the environment compared to the small scale of human activity, emphasizing the challenging nature of the fishermen's work. The sea's choppy condition and the fishermenâ€™s gear-laden vessel suggest the hardiness required for their profession.","title":"Gill net fishing on the Columbia River","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["547563","547552","555719","547564","545178","547557","554200","545191","546939","546301","545093","547551","545188","550942","547559","547558"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","sea","fishing","fisherman","vessel","gear","profession","winch","bow","net"]}
