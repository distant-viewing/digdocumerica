{"path":"551879.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a bustling indoor scene, seemingly within a subway or train station. In the foreground, a series of steps leads down to a lower level, bisected by a white railing that also serves as a guide down the stairs. On these steps, several people are either ascending or descending.\n\nA man in a light brown coat and dark trousers stands prominently in the middle of the composition, facing away from the camera and looking towards the lower level, his position acting as a focal point in the image.\n\nAbove the stairway, there is a large window revealing another level of the station where numerous people can be seen. This upper level looks to be a waiting or viewing area, brightly lit, with rows of people standing behind railing dividers, observing the activities below or waiting. \n\nThe overall atmosphere suggests a moment caught in transit, with people in various modes of wait and movement. The station is characterized by a modernist architectural style, with clean lines, minimalistic design elements, and functional lighting that provides a clear, well-lit view of the scene. Signs marked with 'S' and symbols for services such as restrooms ('WC') are visible, aiding in navigation around the station.","title":"Arrivals and departures at an underground station. All have escalators. Some escalators work only when activated by pressure on electronic mats, thus conserving energy. Many are reversible to accommodate rush hour needs.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["556686","556821","551890","556054","556696","551883","556815","551880","551893","556680","549904","556024","556825","556697","556674","551886"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["station","level","step","wait","people","waiting","stairway","mode","bisect","subway"]}
