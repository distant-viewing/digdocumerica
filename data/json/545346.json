{"path":"545346.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph depicts a mobile office unit situated in a desolate, largely barren landscape. The unit itself is composed of modular sections with a metallic exterior, primarily silver in color, featuring several small windows, air conditioning units on top, and a series of steps leading up to the doors. The design includes rectangular and some circular elements, giving it a somewhat industrial appearance.\n\nForegrounding the image is a texture-rich, rough sandy terrain that suggests the unit is located in a remote or underdeveloped area, possibly a construction or mining site. No vegetation or other significant features interrupt the expanse of dirt, emphasizing the starkness of the environment.\n\nThe weather appears to be quite pleasant, given the presence of fluffy clouds scattered in a blue sky that serves as the backdrop for the image. There are no people visible in this scene, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the architectural and environmental aspects depicted.","title":"\"Trailer court\"","placename":"Placitas (N.M.)","location":"Placitas, New Mexico","nn1":["555308","550565","557330","544137","548937","555319","555320","555318","555331","555307","555333","555321","544149","547652","547178","557339"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["unit","conditioning","starkness","silver","step","office","mining","exterior","aspect","air"]}
