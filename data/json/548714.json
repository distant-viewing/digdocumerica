{"path":"548714.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an underwater scene where a person is engaged in snorkeling or free-diving activities. The person is submerged head-first towards the sea bottom, examining or interacting closely with the marine environment.\n\nVisible on the diver are maroon shorts and a yellow T-shirt, and they wear a weight belt to assist with buoyancy. The diver uses their left hand to gently touch or move some objects on the sea floor, suggesting a research or observation purpose rather than recreational snorkeling.\n\nThe sea floor captured in the photograph is teeming with coral, rocks, and marine growth, indicative of a lively coral reef ecosystem. The lighting implies clear water conditions favorable for underwater activities, enhancing visibility and highlighting the diverse textures and colors of the marine life.\n\nThere's a visible effort to keep the interaction with the environment non-intrusive, as the snorkeler seems to be handling the marine life very delicately. The overall composition of the image, with articulated focus on the interaction between human and marine environment, captures a serene yet engaging moment under the sea.","title":"Snorkeler at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo. At the time of this picture, water clarity was good, but experienced divers say clarity is far less than it was 20 years ago because of dredging and filling operations by land developers.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548681","548680","548675","548683","548676","557481","548721","549347","548722","547134","555834","546304","553780","555830","544129","546306"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["diver","sea","reef","floor","coral","maroon","diving","weight","person","observation"]}
