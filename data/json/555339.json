{"path":"555339.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a man standing next to a large cylindrical apparatus that has a shiny, reflective surface, possibly made of metal. The man appears to be in his twenties or thirties and has long hair and a beard. He is wearing a grayish short-sleeved shirt, jeans, and a belt. The equipment next to which he stands consists of a long tube supported by a framework that includes gears and adjustment mechanisms, suggesting it might be part of a scientific or industrial setup.\n\nThe imagery and style of the equipment, along with the casual style of the manâ€™s clothing and his relaxed posture, suggest that this could be a scene from a scientific research facility or an educational institute environment from the 1970s or 1980s. He seems to be either operating, adjusting, or inspecting the device.\n\nIn the background, there is a plain wall with a closed white door, hinting that the setting is indoors, likely a lab or workshop area. The overall atmosphere of the scene is focused and informal, combining elements of technology and casual human presence in an industrial or experimental setting.","title":"Walter Meinel stands in front of a linear parabolic reflector, a prototype of the system that he proposes for large \"solar farms\" to generate huge amounts of electricity. The sun's rays are reflected onto the tube carrying fluid which is heated and can be used to drive turbines and generators.
