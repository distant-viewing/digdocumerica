{"path":"552567.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic and atmospheric scene at a cattle holding area, possibly a corral, in what appears to be late afternoon sunlight. The image captures several cows of varying shades of brown and white clustered together within a fenced enclosure made of wooden logs and poles that form a series of pens. Some areas within the pen exhibit patches of mud, hinting at recent activity or rainfall.\n\nThere are three individuals interacting with the cattle. Two of them are wearing hats: one in a white cowboy hat and a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, the other in a dark cowboy hat, partially obscured in the background. The third person is closer to the foreground, wearing a striped, short-sleeved shirt and a dark baseball cap. All three seem engaged in managing or observing the cows' movement, with their body language suggesting active involvement in their tasks.\n\nThe lighting plays a significant role in the composition, casting long shadows and highlighting the textured surface of the enclosure and the earth. The interplay of light and shadow adds a dynamic quality to the scene, emphasizing the late day timing and possibly the beginning or the end of a work phase related to cattle handling. The lush greenery faintly visible in the background suggests a rural, possibly forested, setting. This all combines to give the image a vivid portrayal of pastoral life.","title":"At the Oldlands' summer cow camp.
