{"path":"557176.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features three people, presumably at an outdoor gathering or event. The composition focuses on the faces of these individuals, showing their reactions and expressions.\n\nOn the left, there is an elderly woman dressed in a warm hooded coat and glasses. The hood is brown, over her wrapped brown scarf, and her expression is slightly smiling, squinting possibly due to the lighting or weather.\n\nIn the middle, another elderly woman is visible, wearing glasses and a dark coat over a lighter sweater. Her hair is curly and appears to be gray. Her expression is neutral but with a mouth slightly open, giving off an impression of attentiveness or curiosity.\n\nOn the right, there is a smiling man, who looks significantly younger than the two women. He wears a hat and a camouflage-patterned jacket. He is smiling broadly and seems to be laughing or reacting joyfully to something out of frame.\n\nThe background is out of focus but includes hints of other people and possibly trees, suggesting the setting might be a park or outdoor public event area. The mood captured suggests a moment of shared experience or enjoyment among the group.","title":"Faces of Burrough Audubon Society members on a scheduled outing to view migratory shore birds at the Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge near Mound City, Missouri, in the northwest part of the state.
