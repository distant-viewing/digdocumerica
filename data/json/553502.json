{"path":"553502.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a candid and cheerful moment between two women on the porch of an older, weathered building. The woman on the left, wearing a horizontal striped black-and-white top and black pants, stands barefoot. She has curly hair and is slightly turned away from the camera, looking down while smiling, covering part of her face with her hand. \n\nThe woman on the right, clad in a plaid shirt and light brown pants, is leaning against the door frame with her arms crossed, smiling broadly. She has straight, long brown hair and also appears barefoot. Both women exhibit a relaxed and joyful demeanor.\n\nAt the bottom right corner of the image, a small black and white dog sits on the porch, looking towards the camera. The porch itself shows signs of wear and age with peeling paint and a makeshift feel, adding a rustic charm to the setting. The overall ambiance of the scene is one of intimate, friendly interaction in a casual, homely environment.","title":"Residents of mulky square, a low-income neighborhood on the city's west side, face large scale displacement by a new interstate highway (i-635).
