{"path":"549842.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on an urban street, focusing on the activity around a considerable accumulation of trash. The image portrays three individuals, presumably sanitation workers, engaged in the process of collecting and managing the garbage.\n\nThe workers are surrounded by an enormous quantity of trash, piled in large, overflowing beige bags and loose items scattered on the ground. One man in the center is actively throwing a bag into a green garbage truck parked next to the sidewalk, visibly filled with similar bags. Another man, also in work attire, stands nearby, seemingly involved in organizing or selecting items for disposal. The third person is partly visible behind the tree and seems to be assisting the others.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a small tree growing in a patch of soil surrounded by a curb, which also contains scattered litter. The setting suggests a dense urban environment due to the high buildings partially visible in the background and the enclosed nature of the street.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a moment in the everyday life of urban sanitation workers, highlighting their vital role in maintaining the cleanliness and hygiene of city streets amidst the challenges posed by excessive waste accumulation. The photograph emphasizes themes of urban maintenance, labor, and environmental management.","title":"Sanitation workers collect garbage on 172nd Street in Manhattan.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550154","550162","550150","550147","549844","549751","545502","549837","550163","549945","549752","549839","549949","549840","546902","542550"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["sanitation","bag","worker","accumulation","garbage","trash","street","cleanliness","quantity","item"]}
