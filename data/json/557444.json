{"path":"557444.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene water scene seemingly located in a natural, forested area. The surface of the water reflects the elements around it, contributing to the calm and tranquil atmosphere of the image.\n\nIn the foreground, a vibrant red and white striped post stands almost in the center of the frame, partially submerged in the water. This post contrasts sharply with the darker tones of the background and is possibly a marker or a part of some waterway navigation system. Surrounding the post are soft green leaves of a plant, likely a water-loving shrub, adding a touch of life and color to the composition.\n\nThe rest of the image is largely occupied by the reflections in the dark water. These reflections include vertical lines and shapes, which are most likely trees from the nearby surroundings reflected in the water. The reflections are somewhat blurred, creating a dreamy, mirror-like effect that enhances the peacefulness of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition and color contrast in the photograph—between the vivid marker post and the subdued natural elements—alongside the calming quality of the reflections, make this image both striking and quietly beautiful.","title":"Construction stake heralds development of this portion of Upper Newport Bay.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["545008","546963","552108","551352","554623","543058","550845","550750","554753","553410","557255","554527","543561","550389","546066","554603"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["post","reflection","marker","water","love","navigation","peacefulness","calm","waterway","mirror"]}
