{"path":"548008.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a large hydroelectric dam facility. The dam spans across a wide river, separating the water into two levels: a higher reservoir on the left and a lower level on the right. This structure is equipped with multiple spillways, which are currently closed, preventing water from passing through them.\n\nOn the downstream side, visible on the right part of the image, there is a powerhouse lined with several large penstocks that channel water to generate electricity. The water is visibly turbulent as it exits these penstocks, indicating active power generation.\n\nThe overall setting is in a sparse, semi-arid landscape evident from the dry, scantily vegetated hills surrounding the water body. Essential infrastructure such as roads and electrical transmission towers are present near the facility, ensuring the generated power is transmitted to other locations.\n\nThe dam's concrete structures are massive, showing the significant engineering work involved in its construction. The shadow cast by these structures suggests the photograph was taken on a sunny day. There are no visible humans or moving vehicles, emphasizing the scale and the isolated nature of the dam within its environment.","title":"Chief joseph dam","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548024","548920","548942","548938","548003","548936","550743","549004","548007","548930","548016","548915","548012","548975","548013","548927"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","generate","power","spillway","level","reservoir","prevent","transmission","electricity","generation"]}
