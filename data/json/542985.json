{"path":"542985.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat disturbing scene at a marina, showing a large number of dead fish floating in murky water. The foreground prominently features these fish, their white and light grey bodies stark against the dark, brownish water, creating a sense of environmental concern.\n\nIn the background, the scene includes a series of boats moored at a dock that extends under a covered area. The boats vary in size and appear utilitarian, possibly used for fishing or transport rather than leisure, which suggests a working marina environment rather than a recreational one. This area is shadowed and interspersed with trees, indicating a location possibly surrounded by a forested area. The reflection of the sunlight on the water contrasts with the darker tones of the boats and the dock, giving depth to the scene.\n\nThe calm water suggests a serene setting, starkly contrasted by the unfortunate pollution or natural event that has resulted in the fish kill. This photograph might invoke discussions about environmental health, water pollution, and the human impact on natural aquatic ecosystems.","title":"Pollution from fish processing plant","placename":"Mendocino (Calif.)","location":"Mendocino, California","nn1":["546930","546782","555560","547687","546898","546846","547704","552067","547737","546784","547626","546779","546185","552127","546887","552158"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","marina","boat","dock","pollution","water","health","discussion","concern","one"]}
