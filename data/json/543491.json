On the left side, close to the shoreline, there are multiple people dressed in wetsuits and equipped with scuba diving gear, including tanks and flippers. Two divers are interacting in the foreground, possibly checking their equipment or discussing their dive plan.\n\nOn the right side of the image, you can see people enjoying the sun and the beach in a more traditional sense. Several individuals are lying on towels, some are sunbathing, while others are sitting or engaging in conversation. A woman in the foreground is prominently featured sunbathing on a towel wearing a bikini. Additionally, there are bags, a cooler, and other beach accessories scattered around them.\n\nThe backdrop features a calm sea and a rugged coastline, which stretches into the distance. Trees and shrubs can be seen behind the sandy beach area, accentuating a natural and somewhat secluded environment. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a sunny weather suitable for both diving and relaxing on the beach. This juxtaposition of leisure activities and adventurous sports draws a vivid picture of a dynamic beach outing.","title":"California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["544129","548541","550932","553686","550919","553685","546794","547507","547628","553683","550243","543065","553684","547482","557458","547680"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","diive","sunbathing","towel","scuba","wetsuit","diver","cooler","bikini","accessory"]}
