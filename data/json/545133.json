{"path":"545133.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene at sunset. The backdrop is dominated by a large, imposing cliff to the left, whose silhouette falls dramatically against a pale sky. The beach itself seems calm, with gentle waves lapping at the shore. A slim, horizontal line of surf marks the boundary between sea and sand, glistening slightly as it reflects the fading light.\n\nIn the foreground, two dogs are captured in mid-motion, playing or interacting with each other on the smooth, wet sand. One dog appears to be slightly larger than the other, and both exhibit an expression of enjoyment or engagement. Their shadows stretch away from them towards the base of the cliff, elongated by the angle of the setting sun.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its natural lighting and contrast between the scale of the cliff and the intimate interaction of the dogs, lends a peaceful yet dynamic feel to the scene. The quality of the image suggests it might be a bit aged, with visible marks or scratches on the film, adding a nostalgic element to the view.","title":"Cape Kiwanda, site of excellent salmon fishing, and of a potential nuclear plant","placename":"Kiwanda, Cape (Or.)","location":"Kiwanda, Cape, Oregon","nn1":["543070","543500","543083","543252","543395","557509","548292","542890","553072","544191","545218","543463","548697","543052","545194","543014"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dog","cliff","sand","elongate","beach","surf","scratch","mark","glisten","lap"]}
