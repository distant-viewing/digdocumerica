{"path":"544299.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features three children, likely boys, leaning over a concrete barrier to look at something in or beyond a large body of water. They are positioned with their backs to the camera. The child on the left wears a light blue short-sleeve shirt, rolled-up white shorts, and white socks pulled up just below the knees, complemented by dark strap shoes. The middle child has on a navy and white plaid short-sleeve shirt, white shorts, and is barefoot. The child on the right sports a gray t-shirt with \"87\" printed in black on the back, navy patterned shorts, and is also barefoot.\n\nThe barrier that the children are leaning on shows signs of wear and graffiti, adding a gritty feel to the scene. The body of water behind them is expansive, hinting at an ocean, lake, or large river. The surface of the water is calm, dotted with minor ripples, reflecting a soft light, suggesting it is a sunny day. The foreground shows worn surfaces and bits of litter, indicating a possibly neglected or very frequently used public space. The overall mood is one of curious exploration and casual relaxation typical of a warm day spent near the water.","title":"Fishing off the pier","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["546940","544302","544221","547676","547692","552828","545539","544200","543473","553429","552341","553431","551225","552940","546220","547727"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","short","navy","barrier","back","lean","sleeve","black","shirt","sock"]}
