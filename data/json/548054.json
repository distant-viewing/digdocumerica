{"path":"548054.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a lively boating scene by the water. Three people are involved with two boats near the shore of a large body of water, most likely a lake or a calm sea given the gentle waves.\n\nOn the left, there is a man without a shirt, wearing tartan swim shorts. He is standing in the water and appears to be either holding onto or pulling a rope attached to the nearest boat. This boat is silver with a white interior and equipped with an outboard motor.\n\nIn the center of the image stands an older man, wearing a cap, a red and white checkered shirt, and beige pants, which are rolled up to his knees. He is energetically involved in pulling a thick rope or cable, showing an expression of effort as he works to either secure or retrieve the boats.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, a woman in a black tank top and shorts, with a red bandana covering her head, is seen leaning into another white boat as she works with some equipment, possibly preparing the boat for use or tying it securely.\n\nThe two boats are partially in the water, and partial on the shore, floating gently on the clear blue water under bright sunlight, highlighting their details and the active involvement of the people with them. The overall feel is that of a sunny, busy day at a lakeside, with people engaged in typical water-related activities.","title":"Public boat launch.
