{"path":"556514.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing scene inside what appears to be a subterranean environment, possibly a cave or an underwater setting. The central focus is on a person who is equipped with a miner's helmet, indicating that the activity could potentially relate to mining or exploration. The individual is sitting inside a rugged, metal-framed boat or submersible craft with various equipment and tools visible, including what looks like hoses or cables.\n\nThe background and the reflections on the water surface above suggest a dark, cavernous area with rocky formations. The rough textures and glistening minerals intensify the sense of a mysterious or unexplored location. Overhead, a triangular object floats on the water, possibly a makeshift guide or marker.\n\nThe lighting is dim and sourced from within the scene, likely from lamps or a flash, highlighting parts of the rocky terrain and the metallic surfaces of the boat, while casting most of the surrounding area in shadows. The overall atmosphere is one of isolation and the pursuit of knowledge or resources in challenging environments.","title":"Miner Lee Caldwell, on a self-propelled roof bolting machine in a mine of the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company near Jasper and Chattanooga. The machine has a drill that bores holes in the ceiling of the shaft and automatically screws four to five foot bolts which act as braces to keep the roof from falling. In the upper foreground is a bolt that has just been drilled in. This method cuts down on the number of wood posts needed as bracing. This is the most dangerous job in the mines.","placename":"Tennessee","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556398","556513","556512","549598","556319","556357","556427","556358","546789","556366","543743","555332","552306","555832","545666","556360"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["cave","guide","miner","pursuit","craft","boat","hose","marker","overhead","mineral"]}
