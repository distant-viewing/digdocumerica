{"path":"555455.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a street scene with multiple elements that collectively depict a moment of disruption or shortage. At the forefront is a man from the back, dressed in a dark suit with short hair, who is extending his thumb outward in a hitchhiking gesture. Seen partially from the side, his face is not visible, focusing the viewer's attention on his action and the context around him.\n\nTo his left, there is a homemade white sign with the words “NO MORE GAS TODAY” written in bold, black letters. The sign stands on the sidewalk by the street, immediately setting the theme of the photograph: a gas shortage.\n\nThe background features an urban street setting with cars, street lights, and a few commercial buildings. Visible is an older model car driving past, suggesting the era might be around the 1970s or 1980s, which aligns with notable fuel crises during those times. The street appears to be a typical intersection with traffic lights and utility poles.\n\nAdditional elements like a house and some leafless trees under an overcast sky give the photograph a suburban feel, contributing to its distinctly North American middle-class setting. This image combines everyday life with a specific historical or situational theme, centering around the impact of a fuel shortage on ordinary people and the measures they take, like hitchhiking, in response to this disruption.","title":"The gas shortage in the Pacific Northwest during December 1973 had even suited businessmen hitch-hiking in places like Beaverton.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548171","548053","555465","548169","555434","555452","548173","548174","555413","555519","555474","555486","555489","548176","555459","555458"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["shortage","street","disruption","fuel","gas","crisis","response","class","theme","past"]}
