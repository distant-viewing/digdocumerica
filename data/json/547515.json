{"path":"547515.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph features a view of two adjoining buildings. The building on the left is painted in a dark color, possibly black or gray, and has weathered wooden siding. It features multiple windows, some of which appear to be broken or missing, and a couple of doorways also lacking doors. The building on the right has a cleaner appearance with a white paint finish, yet compared to the left building, it still shows signs of neglect including peeling paint and closed or covered windows.\n\nThe two buildings appear to be residential in nature, possibly old apartment buildings or dormitory-style accommodations. The black building has a front stoop with steps leading up to the doorways, and there are traces of scattered debris and unkempt vegetation around it suggesting a state of abandonment or disrepair.\n\nThe background is simple and natural, consisting of grassy areas and a line of trees behind the buildings, further enhancing the sense of isolation and neglect. The weather or time of day gives a subdued lighting to the scene, emphasizing the somber mood portrayed by the dilapidated structures.","title":"Abandoned mill houses in charlestown","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["545233","557344","550129","557348","553472","553548","557345","555952","543342","554707","555897","554785","551111","557346","550023","553555"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["doorway","building","paint","stoop","accommodation","cleaner","neglect","dilapidated","miss","consisting"]}
