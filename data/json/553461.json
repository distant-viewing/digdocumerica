{"path":"553461.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph showcases an industrial scene focused on the \"Fitchburg Paper Company,\" a paper mill by a calm body of water, likely a river. The factory complex is extensive and made up of several large brick buildings, featuring large windows and some structural additions that look more modern in style. The buildings are arrayed linearly along the riverbank. Most prominent in the scene is a tall, thin chimney emitting a plume of white smoke, adding to the industrial feel.\n\nIn the foreground, vibrant autumnal foliage, likely brown or reddish-brown, borders the water, partially obscuring the bottom frame of the photograph and adding a touch of natural contrast to the industrial background. The river itself reflects the buildings and sky, displaying smooth and mirror-like qualities that emphasize the calmness of the water.\n\nFurther contributing to the industrial ambiance, the parking lot adjacent to the main building is filled with cars, indicating a busy working day. The setting appears to be during daylight hours, given the brightness and shadows observed in the scene.\n\nThis image captures a typical mid-20th-century industrial landscape in an American small town, highlighting the juxtaposition of nature with man-made structures.","title":"Fitchburg paper company, a major polluter of the Nashua river","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553460","553451","550814","553399","550722","551578","553426","554702","550335","550714","548128","548070","550818","554630","550332","551579"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["addition","building","mill","calmness","river","brightness","hour","plume","mirror","chimney"]}
