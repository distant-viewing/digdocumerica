{"path":"553325.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a dimly lit underground parking garage filled with cars. The scene is illuminated predominantly by fluorescent lighting which stretches across the ceiling in parallel rows, casting reflections on the shiny surfaces of the vehicles and giving the environment an eerie, greenish glow.\n\nThe garage is populated with a variety of vintage cars, suggesting that this image might be from an earlier decade. The cars differ in make and model, ranging from sedans to station wagons, all closely parked side by side. The vehicle colors appear subdued under the green-toned lighting but include darker shades, likely blacks and blues.\n\nProminently displayed at the top of the image is a sign that says “ELEVATOR” in bright white, contrasting sharply with the surrounding darkness. The sign helps navigate visitors, standing out as a beacon within the relatively dark environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is quiet and static, with no visible human presence, giving it a somewhat abandoned and mysterious air. The cars, neatly arranged in the garage, and the clean, organized environment suggest a place that, while currently unpopulated, is regularly used and maintained.","title":"Fountain square's underground garage","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557292","555748","557848","548435","556790","557877","546879","546813","554349","557886","557905","556703","553303","556721","556196","553896"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["garage","car","elevator","differ","say","black","wagon","darkness","decade","sedan"]}
