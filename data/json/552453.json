{"path":"552453.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid outdoor scene predominantly filled with tall trees under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, the primary focus is on a stark, weathered tree stump which is bleached white, suggesting either decay or some kind of lightning or fire damage. The stump is vertically aligned and jagged, with uneven edges and a few sharp points that suggest it was snapped or broken rather than cut cleanly.\n\nSurrounding the stump are various trees, lush with dense, green foliage, indicating a healthy forest area. These trees are dark in color, likely pines or a similar species, offering a stark contrast to the pale, dead tree. The angle of the image is looking upwards towards the sky, capturing the trees from below and emphasizing both the height of the trees and the textures of bark and leaves.\n\nThe lighting appears natural, likely midday given the brightness and the deep shade beneath the trees, accentuating the intricate details of the tree textures and the smoothness of the sky. The picture composition uses the stark whiteness of the tree stump as a focal point against the darker background, creating a visual interplay of death and life within the forest setting.","title":"Abandoned church in Hermon","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["554746","557589","544852","557590","555185","555139","555095","555090","542570","548685","555201","555112","543488","555183","553576","542939"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["stump","tree","smoothness","forest","point","pine","midday","kind","damage","specie"]}
