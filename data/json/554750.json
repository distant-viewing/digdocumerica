{"path":"554750.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene autumn scene featuring a wide tranquil lake that mirrors the surrounding landscape. The foreground prominently displays a calm body of water that reflects the sky and trees, creating a mirror-like effect. Various trees in vibrant fall colors—ranging from rich golds to fiery reds and deep greens—border the lake, enhancing the overall scenery. The trees’ reflections on the water doubles their visual impact, contributing to a symmetrical composition. The sky above is partially clouded, with white and gray clouds scattered across it, suggesting a crisp autumn day.\n\nIn the background, just at the water’s edge, there is a glimpse of a tranquil dwelling, possibly a small house or cabin, nestled among the trees; it is mostly obscured by the dense foliage. The natural calmness and the lack of human activity suggest a peaceful, possibly remote, setting ideal for reflection and nature appreciation. There is also a prominent rock near the water’s edge on the right-hand side of the frame, partially submerged and also reflected in the water, further emphasizing the stillness and clarity of the lake.","title":"Hardwood forest and spruces are reflected in Twitchell Lake in the fall.","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554758","554757","554749","554751","554648","554649","554737","554714","554635","558093","554761","543611","554753","554719","554527","551207"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["lake","autumn","dwelling","reflection","appreciation","water","gold","calmness","ideal","mirror"]}
