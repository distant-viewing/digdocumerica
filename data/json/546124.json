{"path":"546124.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and somewhat desolate landscape characterized by a large expanse of what appears to be dry, cracked ground. The ground is covered in beautiful pinkish hues, probably due to the lighting or special photograph filters, creating an ethereal and slightly surreal effect.\n\nIn the center of the image stands a small, leafless tree or shrub. This is the most prominent feature and it appears almost as a silhouette against the lighter background. The water or moisture, marked by darker tones, creates winding patterns around the tree, perhaps indicating previous water flow or pooled areas that emphasize the tree's isolation.\n\nThe background is more muted and less visually prominent, featuring distant, flat horizon lines that suggest a vast, open plain. The sky is not visible; the photograph focuses primarily on the ground and the middle distance.\n\nOverall, the composition and the desaturated, almost monochromatic color scheme evoke a sense of calm and desolation in a stark but subtly beautiful landscape.","title":"Holding pond behind the olin-mathieson plant","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["550397","543718","544019","544184","543722","552905","548703","543658","555885","552420","543644","545895","543774","555573","548672","557417"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["ground","plain","crack","scheme","moisture","desolation","muted","win","calm","shrub"]}
