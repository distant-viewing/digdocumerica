{"path":"556689.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a row of phone booths, suggesting a public area possibly within a train station or an airport. There are five individual phone booths aligned next to each other from left to right. Each booth has transparent glass walls and metal frames, and is marked with a sign at the top that reads \"phone,\" indicating their function.\n\nInside each lit booth, there is an individual visible, adding a personal element to the scene. The booths showcase a diverse set of users, with the first from the left being occupied by someone visible only in a reflective white sleeve, possibly due to the glare on the glass. Moving to the right, the second booth records a figure dressed in a white overcoat and head covering, focused on the phone conversation. The central booth appears empty. The fourth booth contains a person in a dark coat, deeply engaged in dialing or interacting with the phone. The final booth on the right frames a woman with her head down, suggesting she might be looking at something (possibly a phonebook or notes) while she converses on the phone.\n\nIn the foreground, to the left of the booths, sits a briefcase or luggage, implying transient presence, like someone stepping away momentarily to make a call. The overall lighting is subdued, with brightness emanating mostly from the booths themselves, casting a somewhat cinematic quality to the scene. The background is shadowy and nondescript, which keeps the focus on the activity within the booths. This setting and the artifacts (especially the style of the phone booths and the presence of a briefcase) evoke a sense of the late 20th century, capturing a moment of everyday communication before the era of mobile phones.","title":"Train passengers use a bank of telephones in the 30th Street Station at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is one of four or five stops made by Metroliners which make 16 round trips each day between New York City and Washington, District of Columbia. Amtrak is trying to achieve a 55 percent load factor and has reached the 50 percent level. To reach a higher load factor management would have to pack the trains during peak ridership.","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["548611","556777","548269","549090","556648","556825","556680","553736","556028","555968","556054","549897","556758","556682","556674","556678"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["booth","phone","briefcase","overcoat","head","glare","covering","record","luggage","artifact"]}
