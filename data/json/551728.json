{"path":"551728.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, joyful moment in a lush urban garden setting, bordered by apartment buildings. The scene is enveloped in the vibrant greenery of trees and manicured shrubbery under a clear, bright sky, suggesting a pleasant day. On the left, a woman with long dark hair is intently focused on tending to the plants. She wears a colorful floral dress that blends beautifully with the garden environment. On the right, a young child, dressed in a light blue and white outfit, appears curious and engaged, standing on a stone pathway and looking slightly downwards with a gesture that suggests exploration or discovery.\n\nThe garden is enclosed by an ornate black wrought-iron fence, adding a touch of elegance and demarcating the lush garden from a sidewalk and a quiet street visible in the background. The foreground is filled with a variety of well-kept plants and flowers, bursts of pink among the predominant green, creating a picturesque and tranquil urban oasis. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on nature and human interaction within a confined urban space, evokes a sense of calm and the simple joys of everyday life.","title":"Young mother plants her spring garden in front of her house on 3rd Street near Prospect Park, Brooklyn.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551702","551730","551701","551623","551705","551104","546505","550055","551743","551739","551620","551649","548442","551746","551744","552408"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","oasis","discovery","demarcate","burst","elegance","confine","iron","tend","pink"]}
