{"path":"543440.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a group of eight young individuals, mixed in genders, posing in a forest setting. They appear to be engaged in or have just completed some group activity, possibly related to environmental conservation, given that some are holding shovels and standing on or around bare soil suggesting recent digging or planting activities.\n\nFour females and four males are present. Each individual sports fashion indicative of styles from the 1970s or 1980s, such as striped and plaid shirts, long trousers, and layered hairstyles. Noteworthy is the diversity in expression and posture; some are smiling and looking directly at the camera, while others appear more reserved.\n\nThe setting is deeply wooded, with tall trees casting shadows and spots of sunlight filtering through the foliage, highlighting different individuals and parts of the scene. The background mainly consists of dense greenery, emphasizing the natural, outdoor environment of their activity. This kind of setting suggests a peaceful, secluded area, likely selected for environmental or communal work.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of youthful collaboration and environmental engagement, characterized by casual attire, outdoor setting, and the tools in their hands.","title":"Young conservationists doing trail work","placename":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543441","552948","545308","544003","557005","543236","543927","554665","544739","543176","557007","552944","545725","553151","551427","543439"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["collaboration","digging","select","female","planting","gender","shovel","complete","hairstyle","group"]}
