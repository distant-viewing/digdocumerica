{"path":"549034.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a compelling natural landscape where a stark contrast between lush and arid terrains is visible. In the foreground, there's a vast expanse of cracked, parched earth, showing deep, dark crevices that create an almost mosaic-like pattern. The cracks provide a textured surface that appears brittle to the touch, perhaps indicative of a severe drought.\n\nLeading away from the foreground and bisecting the image is a strip of tall, golden-brown grass bending gently with the wind. This pathway of grass cuts through the drought-affected area, creating an interesting visual juxtaposition between the dry, lifeless soil and the resilient, living grass.\n\nIn the middle ground where the grass trail leads, the landscape continues to showcase vast, open fields that hint at agricultural use, given their flatness and the hints of similar vegetation at distant points. The horizon meets a clear, expansive sky that suggests a tranquil, rural setting. The lighting in this image is soft, indicating either early morning or late afternoon, which adds a warm tone to the photograph and highlights the textures of both the cracked earth and the windswept grass.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its contrasting textures and the linear path of grass leading into the horizon, evokes a sense of resilience in nature amidst harsh conditions. It provides a narrative about survival and adaptation in a changing environment.","title":"Cracked earth--a result of irrigation and intense dry heat","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["545724","549132","544184","549183","542863","549179","550397","549134","553994","548060","548673","545588","554817","545895","543658","544180"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["crack","grass","lead","survival","earth","adaptation","bisect","liive","crevice","linear"]}
