{"path":"552535.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image features a large, traditionally designed window of an old building with wooden siding painted white. The window itself is constructed with a pointed arch top, characteristic of a Gothic architectural style. The frame of the window is painted white and is divided into multiple panels. Each panel includes a different type of glass or is obscured in various colors, adding to its aesthetic appeal.\n\nFrom the top of the window, the arch section is segmented further into smaller panes, each holding clear glass. Below the arch, the rest of the window consists of nine rectangular panes arranged in three vertical columns. The glass in these panes varies: some appear frosted or textured, while others are tinted in colors like red and yellow, possibly due to lighting conditions inside the building or due to the glass itself. The lower part of the window has panes that appear to be lit from behind, radiating warm golden and reddish hues, suggesting that the interior lights are on.\n\nThe overall condition of the window and siding hints at a building that is well-maintained yet historical. The play of light and the textured glass suggest a serene, possibly evening time scenario where the interior lights cast a warm and welcoming glow through the varied textures and colors of the glass panes.","title":"Stained glass window in West Jersey Methodist Church","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["547299","543028","557093","542815","547295","552530","558025","546546","552510","557643","552492","557080","558392","550042","557082","548232"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["pane","glass","window","panel","radiate","appeal","paint","light","tint","scenario"]}
