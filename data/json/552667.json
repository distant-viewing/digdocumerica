{"path":"552667.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a young participant at a livestock show presenting a white calf. The child, who appears focused and attentive, is dressed in a formal black western-style outfit complemented by a large turquoise cowboy hat. The outfit includes a jacket with a small square tag displaying the number \"5\" attached to it. The child holds a lead attached to the calf's halter, suggesting they are either about to perform or are in the midst of a performance.\n\nThe calf is large, with a predominantly white body and distinctive facial coloration. Both the child and the calf stand on a sandy surface typical of an arena used for livestock exhibitions. In the background, you can see other participants and spectators, some seated and others standing. The setting is lively, with various individuals dressed in casual and western attire, and there seems to be a commotion typical of such events where multiple participants and onlookers gather around the arena. The overall ambiance suggests a community event focused on agricultural or livestock competition.","title":"Garfield county fair.
