{"path":"547992.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a body of water with a prominent \"No Dumping Allowed Under Penalty of Law\" sign mounted on a weathered wooden post in the foreground. The sign is hand-lettered with black marker on a dirty, white background, showing signs of wear and tear.\n\nThe background reveals a canal-like waterway lined on both sides with various structures and debris. The structures varying in their appearances suggest a semi-industrial or rundown residential area. Some of the buildings appear dilapidated, with visible damage and debris around them. The water reflects these structures, creating a mirror image on its calm surface.\n\nTo the left of the frame, the canal is bordered by a ragged shoreline littered with bricks and other rubble, indicating neglect or recent destruction. Small boats are moored along the waterway, further emphasizing the utilitarian usage of this area.\n\nThe setting appears somewhat desolate and neglected, invoking a sense of abandonment or disregard for environmental regulations, despite the displayed sign's warning. The overall atmosphere is tranquil yet melancholic, with natural lighting that suggests this photo was taken during the day under clear skies.","title":"Dumping prohibition is ignored on this Hunter's Point Creek adjacent to the John F.
