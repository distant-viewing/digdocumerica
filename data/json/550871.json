{"path":"550871.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by a large, cylindrical smokestack from which a heavy plume of dark smoke is billowing into the sky. The smoke is dense and voluminous, filling the upper part of the image with its thick, grey mass against a pale blue sky. Below the smokestack, the rooftop of a building is visible, characterized by a dark, box-like structure and a smaller chimney releasing a much fainter trail of smoke. The industrial nature of the area is underscored by the plain design and functional appearance of the building and the smokestack. The overall mood of the image may evoke thoughts on environmental pollution and industrial impact.","title":"Main chimney of the charmin paper company on green bay going full blast.
