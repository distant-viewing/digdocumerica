{"path":"552704.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene where a woman is walking a dog on a large set of dark wooden stairs. The stairs fill nearly the entire frame of the image, creating a visual pattern of horizontal lines. The woman, appearing in casual clothing—a sleeveless top, jeans, and sneakers—walks to the left side of the frame, holding a leash that connects her to a small, agile dog, possibly a terrier, which is actively moving ahead of her. The setting seems somewhat isolated and serene, with no other people or distractions in the immediate surroundings. The stairs show signs of weathering and minimal vegetation growth, suggesting they are outdoors and not frequently maintained. The overall atmosphere is calm, focusing on the casual activity of walking the dog.","title":"On the steps of the Philadelphia museum of art","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["546501","554559","554532","554627","549928","556165","547100","557637","546529","551712","543500","543394","546528","543083","554126","553089"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["stair","dog","leash","distraction","sneaker","walk","weathering","woman","growth","jeans"]}
