{"path":"554834.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph features a subdued rural or semi-rural landscape focused on a railway scene. In the foreground, there is a scattering of wild vegetation and dried grass, which seems characteristic of late autumn. The mid-ground predominantly showcases a set of railroad tracks flanked by gravel. On these tracks, a series of dark, presumably coal-filled, hopper cars extend into the background, suggesting the image captures a moment when these railcars are either parked or moving very slowly. No locomotive is visible, indicating that the train might be waiting on a siding.\n\nThe right-middle of the image includes a hopper car prominently displayed, marked with readable numbers and letters indicating its specifications and ownership, enhancing the industrial aspect of the scene. To the far left of the photograph, the tracks curve out of view, adding a sense of depth and direction.\n\nThe background is framed by a line of barren trees marking a forest edge or a dense hedgerow which encapsulates the scene in a natural boundary. No human activity is visible, enhancing a sense of quiet isolation that is typical for such industrial settings in non-urban areas. The lighting is flat, perhaps indicative of an overcast day, which mutes the colors to a palette of grays, browns, and dark greens, resonating with a late autumn or winter season atmosphere.","title":"Coal cars are loaded and ready for hauling, off route 9 near Cadiz, Ohio, and Steubenville","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["545541","556382","549131","547050","556836","555887","556407","550790","556783","545503","556003","554632","543725","556853","543826","556009"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["hopper","autumn","ownership","railcar","track","scattering","locomotive","tracks","mark","coal"]}
