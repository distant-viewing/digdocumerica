{"path":"545753.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a solitary figure seated on a rocky outcrop, overlooking a vast, rugged landscape of arid mountains. The terrain consists of jagged peaks and deeply eroded valleys, showcasing a mixture of earth tones such as reds, browns, and whites. The person, clad in a muted blue jacket and jeans, appears contemplative, gazing into the distance. They are sitting near what seems like a backpack, emphasizing the sense of a hiking or exploring venture. The entire scene is bathed in natural light, which highlights the textured details and colors of the rocky surface and contributes to the feeling of wilderness and isolation. This expansive, natural setting suggests a remote location, possibly in a desert or mountainous region known for its geological features. There is a clear sky above, enhancing the starkness and barren beauty of the landscape. The composition uses a wide-angle perspective that emphasizes the grand scale of the surroundings relative to the human figure.","title":"Upheaval dome, perhaps the most interesting geological feature of the canyonlands.  It is a crater, more than a mile across formed when a salt dome thrust itself up from the earth.  The rocks thrown up in the middle are the oldest.  Since they came from deepest in the earth.  This is said to be the best example of a salt dome in the world","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["554460","545755","545300","545696","543838","545762","545571","554500","554507","544946","543846","554514","544341","543503","543378","545759"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["starkness","erod","outcrop","hiking","figure","whites","backpack","mountains","explore","know"]}
