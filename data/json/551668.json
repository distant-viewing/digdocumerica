{"path":"551668.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and colorful outdoor scene at a public park. In the foreground, two women, each pushing a young child in a stroller, are the central figures. The woman on the left is adorned in a vibrant floral shirt, and the child in her stroller appears cheerful, looking directly at the camera while clutching the sides of the stroller. The woman on the right is dressed in a white, short-sleeved top and white pants, pushing a stroller where a child sits attentively.\n\nIn the middle ground, a man in a red shirt is interacting with one of the four fountains visible in the image. He appears to be touching or adjusting something on the fountain. Each fountain sprays water gracefully into the air, creating a dynamic and refreshing element within the serene park setting.\n\nIn the background, lush greenery frames residential buildings, with a large, flowering bush contributing to the park's tranquility and aesthetic appeal. The environment suggests a well-maintained urban park, offering a peaceful retreat from the surrounding city. The overall scene is a pleasant depiction of daily life and leisure in an urban park, emphasizing familial activities and enjoyment of nature.","title":"A vacant lot at 22nd Street and 10th Avenue was transformed by the Chelsea Neighborhood Association into this charming playground.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551667","556296","544808","551713","550302","551712","552737","551449","550752","551772","557257","551736","550072","555947","550074","551815"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["stroller","park","fountain","child","woman","retreat","spray","appeal","depiction","enjoyment"]}
