{"path":"548412.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph showcases an aerial view of a densely populated urban area, featuring a curved waterfront and a background filled with a silhouette of skyscrapers under a hazy sky. The scene is likely taken from a high vantage point looking over a river that gently curves in the foreground. Adjacent to the river, a shoreline road dotted with cars follows the contour of the water. Several large, high-rise residential and possibly commercial buildings line the road, enclosed in blocks structured amidst smaller buildings and spacious areas that appear to be parking lots or undeveloped plots.\n\nIn the distance, the densely packed cityscape partly obscured by atmospheric haze or smog, comprises a variety of taller buildings. Their shapes are mostly rectangular, typical of mid- to late-20th-century skyscraper designs, suggesting the image might be a few decades old given the color tone and quality.\n\nNo people are discernible in the image due to the altitude and angle of the shot. The overall color palette is dominated by a mix of greyish-blue and muted earth tones, imparting a slightly somber or serene mood to the urban environment. The hues combined with the haze give an impression of early morning or a cloudy day. The bottom part of the frame includes a section of the guardrail, indicating the photo might have been taken from a bridge or another elevated structure.","title":"Manhattan and the East River, looking south","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549480","552394","548334","553790","546690","548390","551509","549477","548365","548344","549478","555720","556952","550198","548317","552233"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["skyscraper","haze","guardrail","smog","plot","river","decade","block","altitude","road"]}
