{"path":"550979.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures the serene beauty of a natural outdoor setting dominated by a waterfall. In the foreground, there is a calm, dark-hued waterbody which spans the lower third of the image. Rising from this waterbody is a multi-tiered waterfall, the falls cascading over broad, flat rock formations which extend horizontally across the middle of the frame. The waterfall appears vibrant and white, contrasting sharply with the rocky textures.\n\nSeveral people are visible near the base of the waterfall. They seem to be enjoying leisure activities, possibly watching the water or wading close to it. The presence of these individuals offers a sense of scale and human connection to the nature.\n\nDominating the background, behind the waterfall, is a dense forest of trees on a hillside. The trees are lush and create a rich tapestry of dark green shades, suggesting this photo might be taken during late spring or summer. Above the trees, peeking through selectively, are parts of what appear to be rooftops, hinting at a nearby residential area.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, combining elements of water, rock, human activity, and dense forest, seamlessly blends the tranquility of a natural retreat with hints of human habitation, presenting a balanced and peaceful scene.","title":"Fishing at Kanawha Falls, Glen Ferris","placename":"Charleston (W.
