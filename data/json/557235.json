{"path":"557235.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This image captures a river scene where a large barge is being towed by a tugboat. The barge, laden with multiple containers or cargo, is heading downriver, leaving a noticeable wake in the still waters. The tugboat, prominently visible at the front, is white and appears robust, designed for powerful towing capability.\n\nThe river itself reflects a mix of blues and greens, likely indicating its depth and the reflections from the overcast sky. The photograph shows the riverbank on the right, featuring lush green foliage that suggests a temperate climate.\n\nIn the background, an old steel bridge spans the river. This bridge, showing elements of rust and age, adds an industrial or historical ambiance to the scene. The bridge appears to be a truss bridge, typical of earlier 20th-century construction, and is indicative of the infrastructure often found in river towns or cities that rely on the river for transport and commerce. \n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is serene yet industrially nostalgic, emphasizing the continuing role of river transport in commerce and industry amidst a natural landscape.","title":"Barge on the Monongahela River shows effects of pollution caused by an oil spill at the Duquesne Works of the United States Steel Corporation at Duquesne, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.
