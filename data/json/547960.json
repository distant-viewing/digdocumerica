{"path":"547960.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features a body of water, likely a river, taking up the lower half of the frame. Its surface is mostly calm with subtle ripples and minor disturbance, possibly from a faint current or breeze. The water carries a somber gray-blue tint.\n\nIn the background, the opposite shore is visible, characterized by a stretch of barren, sandy beach flanked by patches of tall dried grass and low vegetation, possibly reeds or rushes. This scene suggests a transitional area between water and urban development.\n\nBeyond the natural elements, the background prominently displays an urban skyline consisting of high-rise buildings, seemingly apartment blocks, fading into a misty or foggy atmosphere. The buildings are modern in style, with flat roofs and uniform rectangular windows, typical of mid-20th century urban architecture.\n\nThe overall atmosphere evoked by the image is one of quiet and isolation, underscored by the muted colors and the lack of visible human activity, creating a somewhat eerie or desolate mood. The photo may have been taken on an overcast day, as suggested by the diffuse lighting and the general lack of shadows, contributing to the subdued and chilly ambiance. The color palette used is predominantly shades of blue and gray, reinforcing the cold and tranquil setting observed.","title":"Overflow of untreated water increases Jamaica Bay pollution.
