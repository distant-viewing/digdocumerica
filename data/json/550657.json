{"path":"550657.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and adventurous outdoor scene of two kayakers on a river. The river appears fairly turbulent with visible rapids and ripples in the water.\n\nOn the left side of the image, one kayaker is actively paddling. This individual is wearing a red jacket, a blue helmet, and is using a yellow paddle. They are seated in a white kayak, and their posture and facial expression suggest a focus on maneuvering through the water effectively.\n\nTo the right, there is another kayaker who appears to have capsized and is partially submerged in the water. This person is wearing a yellow helmet and a life jacket. Only the upper part of their body is visible above the water, and their red kayak is overturned next to them. The expression on the kayakerâ€™s face looks calm, possibly indicating experience or confidence in handling such situations.\n\nThe background of the photograph is somewhat obscured by the overcast lighting but shows densely packed trees lining the riverbanks, suggesting a remote or natural area. The overall composition of the photograph conveys a sense of action and the challenging nature of river kayaking, with a focus on the resilience and preparedness of the kayakers.","title":"Kayaks on the upper reaches of the androscoggin river, just below the bridge at errol","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["558070","558071","553333","554465","553335","550661","558069","550659","553336","549439","550653","550663","558068","545733","552333","549440"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["kayak","paddle","helmet","river","preparedness","jacket","situation","obscured","expression","handling"]}
