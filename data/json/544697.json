{"path":"544697.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a seascape with two sailboats on sparkling water, captured from a distance against a backdrop of a dimly silhouetted city skyline. The foreground shows the choppy, glistening surface of the sea under bright sunlight, with the shimmering effect of the water creating numerous highlights and reflective patterns. The two sailboats, positioned toward the center and the right of the image, each have their sails fully hoisted, suggesting a breezy day ideal for sailing.\n\nIn the background, the city skyline is visible, though it appears hazy and slightly obscured, possibly due to atmospheric conditions like fog or smog. The buildings are block-shaped with distinct silhouettes, indicating a typical urban skyline. Prominent among these is a tall building that could be a notable landmark, given its height relative to the others. The overall mood of the image is serene and somewhat tranquil, emphasized by the vast, open water and the leisure activity of sailing juxtaposed against the distant, quiet cityscape.","title":"Water-to-land photo shows smog over San Francisco","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["556190","550754","543305","550758","544669","544665","547781","551540","552345","552234","552351","544667","550034","548498","542903","552355"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["skyline","sailing","sailboat","smog","hoist","seascape","city","ideal","landmark","glisten"]}
