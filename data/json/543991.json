{"path":"543991.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures two young boys engaged in playful interaction outdoors on a sunlit day. The boy on the left is smiling joyfully and is dressed in a long sleeve blue shirt with dark trousers, holding an old, metallic milk can with a handle filled with what appear to be leaves and twigs. The boy on the right, who is shirtless and wearing light-colored trousers, is seated on a thick, horizontal wooden beam. He holds a similar old, metallic milk can and is engaging with the other boy, possibly sharing or comparing the contents of their cans.\n\nThe setting is rustic and natural with dry, sparsely vegetated ground. In the background, there are wooden structures which may be part of a rural or semi-rural homestead, alongside tall thin trees and leafy bushes under a clear sky. The interaction suggests a moment of simple, imaginative play, common in pastoral or rural settings where children often incorporate everyday objects and natural elements into their games. The boys' expressions and gestures hint at a moment of sharing and enjoyment in each other's company amid a peaceful natural environment.","title":"Boys with scrap iron near phelps dodge corp.
