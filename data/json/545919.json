{"path":"545919.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing and shadow-filled scene likely taken during the winter, around a body of water partially covered with ice and snow. The composition emphasizes strong vertical and diagonal elements created by the sun's position in the sky.\n\nThe foreground and middle part of the image show snow-covered ground with sunlight casting vivid, angular shadows. The shadows are created by multiple vertical, possibly metal bars which are part of a fence or barrier seen on the right side of the frame. The fence appears to extend towards a body of water, which is partially obscured by shadow but reflects light strongly, suggesting that parts of it are icy or have some collections of meltwater on the surface.\n\nThe light and the quality of the reflections in the water create a vibrant contrast to the darker, shadowed areas and introduce a bit of sparkle to the image. The atmosphere of the photograph is quiet and perhaps slightly mysterious due to the play of light and shadow, providing a strong visual interest stemming from its composition of natural features and man-made elements. The overall mood is serene, highlighted by natural winter beauty and simple, effective framing.","title":"Scum beneath dock on Lake Tahoe","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["557180","545923","543550","543770","542526","557200","557199","546899","550389","547127","547526","543619","543755","543656","546896","547180"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["shadow","winter","snow","fence","sparkle","show","bar","ice","part","framing"]}
