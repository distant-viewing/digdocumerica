{"path":"550203.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph portrays a vivid industrial urban scene, taken from behind a chain-link fence, possibly symbolizing a physical or metaphorical barrier. The foreground is marked by overgrown grass before the fence, beyond which lies a busy thoroughfare congested with vintage-style cars and traffic cones indicating either ongoing or needed construction.\n\nDirectly beyond the road, a sequence of old, eclectic buildings captures attention. The focus shifts from residential to commercial architecture seamlessly. A noticeable feature in this setting is a yellow two-story building, distinctive among its peers due to its bright color and residential style, contrasting sharply with the grays and reds of the surrounding commercial structures. Beside it, other buildings, likely shops and local businesses, display faded signs and advertisements giving a lived-in, utilitarian feel to the landscape.\n\nAdding an industrial touch to the scene is a large smokestack in the middle distance, actively emitting a plume of dark smoke, contributing to the gritty aesthetic of the setting. This element underscores the environmental and possibly health impacts associated with industrial activities in populated areas.\n\nOverall, the composition encapsulates a snapshot of a past era, characterized by a mixture of residential, commercial, and industrial elements that coexist within a confined urban landscape. The scene captured represents everyday life framed by human industry and urban development.","title":"Smoke from Republic Steel seen from Lester Avenue, west of Gallup","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546866","557224","548326","545388","550171","550153","550175","551072","551033","550187","545437","550167","545988","545382","551074","548330"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["sequence","fence","thoroughfare","cone","confine","peer","health","symbolize","coexist","need"]}
