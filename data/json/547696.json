{"path":"547696.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a wide, panoramic view of an industrial landscape as seen from across a body of water. The foreground features a calm, expansive stretch of water that reflects some of the colors and elements of the scene above it. The industrial backdrop consists of numerous large factories and steel mills, characterized by multiple tall chimneys emitting plumes of smoke and steam into the sky.\n\nThe sky above is somewhat overcast, with patches of blue peeking through the cloud cover, indicating either early morning or late afternoon light. The chimneys vary in height and are densely packed across the industrial complex, suggesting a highly industrialized area focused perhaps on steel production or similar heavy industries.\n\nThe right side of the image shows a more concentrated area of smoke emissions, which are thicker and more voluminous, perhaps indicating heavier activity or different processing units within the factory setup. The overall color palette includes muted shades of blue, grey, and rusty red, typical of industrial environments.\n\nThe composition is balanced with the tranquility of the water in contrast to the busy, smoke-filled industrial skyline, providing a stark depiction of industrial impact on the environment.","title":"Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrows Point","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["552179","547084","550344","546908","544328","546769","548068","552194","546705","557225","550868","548070","551567","546808","548340","555769"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["smoke","steel","chimney","factory","industrialize","peek","mill","depiction","production","emission"]}
