{"path":"546643.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a rainy urban scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the ambient lighting. It features a street lined with trees and old buildings, with a wet pavement that reflects the lights and colors of the environment, adding to the moody atmosphere.\n\nA significant portion of the photo is occupied by a busy street scene filled with vehicles. In the foreground, there are two buses; the closer one is marked with a \"52 BETHESDA\" destination sign. Alongside these buses, there is a mix of cars, predominantly older models which suggest the photo might be from a few decades ago. Notably, there are several Volkswagen Beetles among the cars, recognizable by their distinctive rounded shapes.\n\nForegrounding the vehicles is a person wearing a raincoat and a peaked cap standing in the middle of the street. This person, whom one might assume to be a traffic officer or a crossing guard due to their attire and positioning, is facing towards the oncoming buses and has their arms raised, suggesting they might be either directing traffic or signalling.\n\nIn the background, the environment is lush with trees and the architecture typical of an urban setting, potentially indicating this scene is set in a city. The lighting of street lamps adds a glowing effect to the wet surfaces and provides a soft illumination to the overall scene. This photograph beautifully combines elements of daily urban life with atmospheric weather conditions, creating a vivid tableau of a rain-soaked city street.","title":"Traffic officer directs traffic on a rainy spring evening.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546660","551863","546639","546656","556681","556734","546742","551933","551478","546738","551868","551873","553188","556807","556983","549832"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["bus","street","raincoat","guard","traffic","officer","tableau","destination","positioning","city"]}
