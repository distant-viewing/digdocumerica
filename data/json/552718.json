{"path":"552718.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a lively, historical setting featuring an impressive colonial-style brick building with a tall, white steeple illuminated against a blue sky. The architecture suggests it could be a prominent structure, possibly a church or a government building, adorned with numerous windows and a central clock, hinting at its importance and functionality.\n\nIn the foreground, the scene is vibrant with life and activity inside a shaded plaza or park-like area. People are seen engaging casually; some are walking, while others are standing and conversing in small groups. There are several individuals in the shade cast by mature trees, which have dense foliage at the top and indicate a bright, sunny day.\n\nA shadow of a person, likely capturing this photograph or a scene therein, stretches toward the building, integrating a sense of the photographer's presence in the scene. This shadow adds a dynamic touch, intersecting the bright and shadowed areas of the floor, emphasizing the vivid sunlight.\n\nThe interaction among people and the serene setting suggest a peaceful day out in a public space possibly designed for relaxation and social interaction, adjacent to a place of historical or civic significance.","title":"Independence Hall","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549974","551823","550003","544808","557257","553324","546452","553162","549991","550751","552736","550076","556046","558030","545870","547006"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["government","steeple","photographer","clock","plaza","importance","significance","church","functionality","interaction"]}
