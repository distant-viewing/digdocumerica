{"path":"553021.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a hazy cityscape during what appears to be the early hours of evening or morning, when the light is dim and diffuse. The dominant feature in the image is the heavy, orange-brown atmospheric haze that blankets the city, likely indicating air pollution or smog.\n\nIn the middle ground of the image, slightly off center to the left, two prominent high-rise buildings emerge through the haze, their forms indistinct and shadowy due to the poor visibility. These buildings somewhat tower over the surrounding area, though details of their architecture are obscured by the smog.\n\nThe foreground of the photograph shows a busy highway or main road, filled with a line of cars displaying headlights as glimmering streaks of light. This indicates heavy traffic, common in urban settings during rush hours. The road bends slightly as it moves from the bottom right of the frame to the middle left, guiding the viewer's eye towards the hazy city center.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somber and subdued, with the haze imparting a sense of gloom over the urban environment. The lighting conditions and air quality create an impression of tension between the vibrancy of city life and environmental impact, highlighting complex urban issues.","title":"(From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
