{"path":"546105.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man standing next to a tall, narrow window. The man is well-dressed in a layered outfit consisting of a plaid shirt in shades of yellow, blue, and white, and a dark-colored necktie with a distinctive pattern featuring a downward-pointing red element resembling a flame or petal shape. Over his shirt, he wears a brown leather blazer which adds a touch of classic style to his attire.\n\nThe man’s expression is composed yet inviting, with a hint of a smile. His silver-gray hair is neatly combed, and his features reflect his age. The background is simple, with a focus on a plain gray wall that contrasts with the window frame which is painted white.\n\nThe usage of natural light coming from the window strikes part of his face and shoulder, creating a soft illumination that highlights his facial features while casting the other side of his face in shadow. This lighting technique enhances the texture of his skin and clothing, adding depth to the portrait.\n\nOverall, the photograph appears to be a carefully composed portrait that captures not just the man’s physical appearance but a bit of his personality and demeanor, set against a minimally distracting background that focuses attention on him.","title":"Robert Ambrose Sone, 79, is the county attorney.","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["556452","557056","548616","543701","557144","552872","556563","552103","557648","552871","556443","548226","547282","554857","556084","552104"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["portrait","window","face","man","flame","leather","blazer","technique","usage","illumination"]}
