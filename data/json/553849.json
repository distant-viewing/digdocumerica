{"path":"553849.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly couple standing side-by-side in what appears to be a living room. The woman on the left wears a floral patterned blouse and has her gray hair styled short. The man on the right has thinning white hair and is wearing a light blue button-up shirt, held up by suspenders.\n\nBoth are standing next to a piece of medical equipment that seems to be an old-fashioned respiratory assistance device, possibly an oxygen concentrator or ventilator. This device includes a metal frame on wheels, tubes, and a box-shaped mechanism with dials and switches. The man holds something connected to the device, perhaps a control or a part of the respiratory apparatus.\n\nThe living room setting is furnished with a floral patterned carpet and traditional decor. In the background, the walls are adorned with various framed certificates and there appears to be a small piece of furniture like a console table. The color tones throughout the room, along with the choice of furniture and decor, suggest a time-setting from the mid-20th century. The photograph itself has a grainy texture typical of film cameras used during that period.","title":"Robert B. Jones, retired worker, is totally dependent on his home oxygen machine for survival.
