{"path":"543782.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a pink flower emerging from a circular hole in what appears to be a rusted and weathered metal surface. The flower, which has visible petals and central stamen, is accompanied by small leaves and stems, suggesting it might be growing directly through the hole. The metal around the hole is textured and carries an earthy rust color with patches of dark spots and faded white markings that might be remnants of paint or possibly mineral deposits.\n\nThe surrounding metal is rough, providing a stark, textural contrast to the delicate and soft appearance of the flower. The light source appears to be natural, casting shadows and highlighting the textures of the rust and the petals of the flower. The focus is sharp around the edge of the metal and the parts of the flower facing the camera, fading softly into the background and parts of the foreground, adding depth to the composition. The overall mood evoked is one of resilience and unexpected beauty in an industrial or decayed setting.","title":"Flower grows through rusted autoMobile body","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["555082","553361","544875","542969","557545","550462","554595","543597","557167","554843","543623","545718","553366","547815","554840","555188"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["hole","flower","petal","metal","rust","stamen","deposit","marking","mineral","resilience"]}
