{"path":"550103.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image captures a scene of an apparently abandoned gas station during the daytime under a cloudy sky. The station is located in a wide, open area with no visible vegetation nearby, contributing to a somewhat desolate feel.\n\nThe main focus is the gas station, which features a prominent structure with white and brown vertical paneling. The station has multiple covered bays where cars would typically be serviced, although there are no vehicles present. A noticeable feature of the service station is the large, rectangular, boarded-up windows, indicating it is no longer in operation.\n\nFront and center is a vertical sign reading \"GAS\" in bold, red letters, with the top part of the sign showing \"SUPER PAR\" in white letters set against a red background. Close to the building, there are signs displaying messages like \"FOR SALE OR LEASE,\" \"SORRY! CLOSED! DUE TO GASOLINE SHORTAGE.\" These signs reflect an economic or operational struggle, specifically mentioning a gasoline shortage as the reason for closure.\n\nThere are utility poles and power lines visible across the top of the image. In the background, another flat-roofed building can be seen, but it has no distinguishing features.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of abandonment and economic downturn, likely during a period of fuel shortage. The setting appears to be a typical urban or suburban environment in the United States, with the architecture and signage styles common in such areas.","title":"Brook Park Road gas station - for sale or lease","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["544028","555509","546973","548173","555405","554784","555415","548169","548053","555506","555414","548047","555510","555489","555484","558053"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["station","gas","shortage","letter","sign","service","reason","struggle","gasoline","paneling"]}
