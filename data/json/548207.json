{"path":"548207.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive, industrial bridge with intricate steel structures towering over a body of water. Shot from a shore-like viewpoint, the image shows the bridge's detailed metallic framework creating a dramatic silhouette against the sky. Underneath the bridge, parts of its understructure are visible, characteristically supported by beams that anchor into vast concrete or stone pillars at the water’s edge.\n\nThe foreground of the photo features rocky terrain leading into the water. There are rough, uneven boulders and smaller stones scattered around. Notably, there’s a patch of white, foamy substance floating on the water among the rocks, possibly a pollutant or natural foam, which draws attention due to its contrast with the darker surroundings.\n\nThe lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, given the softness and angle of the sunlight, which sparkles on the water and creates gleaming highlights on the moist surfaces and the metallic parts of the bridge. The background suggests a relatively clear sky with possible hints of distant terrain or water bodies, contributing a sense of depth and breadth to the scene. The overall composition encapsulates themes of human engineering juxtaposed with natural elements, possibly hinting at environmental concerns or the intersection of man-made structures with nature.","title":"Detergent wastes near the interstate bridge at vancouver empty into the Columbia River in pools of froth","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552247","546203","549547","550955","550189","555730","552064","552846","546139","547703","543087","546810","546870","546865","543313","549068"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","water","stone","breadth","pollutant","softness","sparkle","shoot","anchor","pillar"]}
