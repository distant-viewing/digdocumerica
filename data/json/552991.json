{"path":"552991.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a series of large, rectangular ponds arranged in a staggered formation. The ponds are surrounded by levees or embankments, and they contain water which appears in varying shades of blue, indicating different depths or materials suspended in the water. A striking feature of the photograph is the reflection of the sun in one of the larger ponds, creating a bright flare effect that enhances the contrast between the dark water and the lighter surrounding areas.\n\nTo the left and right of the ponds are areas with dense tree cover, suggesting that this location is near a forested area. Alongside the ponds on one side, there is a dirt road, hinting at possible human activity such as maintenance or monitoring of the site. Additionally, there seems to be a smaller path or access road between some of the ponds.\n\nThe top right corner of the image shows a developed area with structures that could be related to the industrial or processing facilities managing the ponds, possibly for water treatment or aquaculture.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image is balanced between the man-made elements (ponds and roads) and the natural surroundings (forested areas), offering insight into the interaction of human activities with the environment.","title":"Holding pond at uranium processing mill.
