{"path":"558053.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph features a large, industrial-style building in the background with a vast parking lot, partially visible along its front. The building has a distinctive architectural style with a series of upright, narrow, windowless panels that seem to form its facade. These panels are separated by thinner vertical lines, possibly windows or gaps, giving the structure a ribbed appearance. The building's overall color is a muted, light gray or beige.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a wire and wooden post fence enclosing a grassy area. A prominent sign placed right in front of this fenced area reads \"AVAILABLE, GULF OIL COMPANY, Call or See John Fancy, Phone 216 AH2-9295.\" Below this, the sign also states \"43 Acres\" indicating the size of the land or property for sale or lease. The sign is noticeable with a white background and red and black lettering, mounted on two wooden posts.\n\nThe scene is set against a tranquil, broad expanse that includes patches of greenery and a tree to the far left. Additionally, in the distant background beyond the parking lot and to the right, you can observe a water tower, suggesting that this location might be on the outskirts of a town or in a suburban area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere implies a somewhat empty, abandoned or unused commercial space with available real estate opportunities. The image likely captures a moment in a transitional phase of the areaâ€™s development or usage.","title":"Property across from the coliseum fronting Ohio highway 303 a short distance from the ramps of interstate 271, south of Cleveland.
