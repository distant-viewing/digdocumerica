{"path":"557940.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene set in a park during autumn. The image is dominated by a path lined with trees that have dense foliage in various shades of autumn colors, including rich browns, ambers, and hints of green. The ground is covered with fallen leaves, enhancing the seasonal atmosphere.\n\nIn the mid-ground, two figures (likely adults, though their specifics are indistinct due to their distance from the camera) are walking away from the viewer. They are closely positioned, suggesting they might be engaged in a conversation or enjoying a peaceful walk together. Their presence adds a human element to the scene, invoking a sense of companionship or leisurely exploration.\n\nThe trees alongside the path create a natural archway, leading the viewerâ€™s eye toward these two figures. On the right side of the path, a rustic, wooden fence is partially visible, bordering one side of the park and adding to the rural or countrified feel of the setting.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is soft and diffuse, likely filtered through the tree canopy, which casts gentle shadows across the path and contributes to the overall calm and serene mood of the setting. The focus and soft lighting technique give the scene a slightly dreamlike or nostalgic quality.","title":"Elderly couple stroll down a tree-lined road which leads to the sawmill at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Akron, Ohio.
