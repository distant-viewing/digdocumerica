{"path":"555483.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a vintage car, heavily frosted or covered with snow, situated in a dreary industrial setting during what appears to be winter. The car is parked in a lot that is pooled with water and slush, indicating recent precipitation or melting snow. The car itself emits steam or smoke, suggesting it might still be operational or was recently turned off. It is encrusted with ice and snow, emphasizing the cold conditions.\n\nIn the background, there is an industrial building with large windows and a slightly opened garage door, through which dark interiors can be glimpsed. Adjacent to this building is a bright red fire truck that contrasts starkly with the gray and white tones dominating the scene. This juxtaposition adds a dynamic element to the otherwise monochromatic setting. The environment is bleak, with no visible vegetation, and the sky is overcast, enhancing the chilly ambiance of the photograph. The setting gives a strong industrial and utilitarian vibe, possibly depicting a scene from a facility or service area that deals with vehicles.","title":"Actual demonstration by the fire department training station showing what would happen after a rear end accident if a five gallon can of gasoline was carried in the trunk of an auto (picture number six in a series of six.)","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["550683","547587","555480","553488","554291","542862","547481","546230","549779","549107","545540","547917","552995","555748","543680","547771"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["snow","car","garage","ice","fire","vibe","steam","winter","lot","service"]}
