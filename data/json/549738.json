{"path":"549738.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling and dynamic scene focused on a large flock of gulls in flight over a litter-strewn landscape. The foreground is filled with numerous gulls, captured in various stages of motion, creating a chaotic and densely populated image of white feathers, flapping wings, and blurred bodies. These elements collectively give a sense of rapid movement and a somewhat disordered atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, amidst the flurry of bird activity, one can discern a dilapidated wooden structure, possibly a pier or a similar waterfront installation, suggesting that this scene is at a coastal or riverside location. The ground beneath the birds is covered with assorted debris and trash, indicating a human-impacted or polluted area, which might be attracting the birds for feeding.\n\nThe overall composition and the flurry of the gulls emphasize the interaction between wildlife and human-altered landscapes, portraying a vivid example of how animals adapt to and exploit human environments. The image captures a moment full of movement and life, set against the backdrop of environmental neglect.","title":"Seagulls feed on the Hackensack dump. In time this landfill will be used for recreation by the Bergen County residents whom it now serves as garbage dump.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["549744","549758","549742","553347","549757","552238","552146","554542","549952","554600","546759","557125","549953","557123","549772","549951"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","human","example","flock","feather","movement","wing","litter","installation","riverside"]}
