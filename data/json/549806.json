{"path":"549806.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This is a vibrant street scene photograph capturing various individuals and architectural elements on a sunny day. In the foreground, the focus is on two individuals: one with their back to the camera, wearing a patterned white and black blouse and dark pants, and the other facing the camera, sporting sunglasses, a striped pink shirt, dark pants, and carrying multiple shopping bags. This second individual is using a coin-operated newsstand device labeled \"NOISE ANNOYS,\" which also features an advertisement for Alka-Seltzer, including a graphic of a fizzing glass.\n\nIn the background, several more people can be seen walking, including a couple dressed in neutral tones directly behind the two main individuals. The architectural setting includes a large, imposing building adorned with flags, including the American flag, which provides a patriotic backdrop. The scene suggests a bustling urban environment, possibly in a historical or business district given the style of the architecture and the formal attire of the passersby. The overall composition, with its candid capture of urban life and commercial elements, vividly portrays the dynamic nature of city life during what appears to be the late 20th century.","title":"Cement litter baskets--a Keep-New York-Clean innovation on Fifth Avenue.
