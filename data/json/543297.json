{"path":"543297.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged and picturesque coastal landscape, likely taken on a sunny day given the bright exposure and deep shadows. The scene is dominated by a view of a rocky coastline with a series of jagged cliffs and inlets.\n\nIn the forefront, there is a secluded cove with turquoise and green water, surrounded by rocky borders covered in sparse green vegetation. This cove appears calm and is contrasted by darker ocean waters visible in channels cutting through the rocky coast.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is adorned with various shades of green, yellow, and brown flora which could be indicative of coastal shrubs and grasses adapted to the salt-spray environment. These plants seem to be thriving despite the apparent harsh conditions.\n\nThe coastline extends into the distance, where the land forms more dramatic cliffs and hills that fade into the horizon under a bright blue sky. Parts of the distant land are a warmer shade, possibly due to soil erosion or different types of vegetation, providing a visual contrast to the cooler colors of the sea and sky. A series of waves can be seen breaking against the outer edges of the inlets, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—with its focus on nature’s textures and the interplay between land and water—creates a breathtaking representation of a rugged coastal ecosystem.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543289","543291","545122","543299","543061","543184","545230","543243","543300","545129","542917","553775","543309","543328","545125","543067"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cove","inlet","coastline","land","cliff","series","salt","coast","representation","spray"]}
