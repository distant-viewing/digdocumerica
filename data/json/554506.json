{"path":"554506.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a happy, outdoor family scene. There are four individuals portrayed in the image: a man, a woman, and two young boys, all enjoying an outing near a body of water. \n\nThe man, appearing on the left, is wearing a red and dark long-sleeved t-shirt with dark pants and is outfitted with hiking boots. He is carrying a large camera with a strap around his neck and has a child perched on his shoulders. The child on his shoulders, a young boy, is dressed in a striped red and grey long-sleeve top with shorter khaki pants, also wearing light-toned shoes.\n\nThe woman, positioned to the right in the photo, is smiling brightly, indicating movement or walking. She wears a green, sleeveless button-up shirt paired with dark khaki shorts and hiking boots. She is carrying binoculars around her neck and another child on her back in a child-carrier backpack. This child, slightly younger, has very light blond hair and is dressed in a dark jacket over a grey shirt and khaki pants.\n\nThe group is pictured on a wooden bridge with metal railings, indicating they might be in a park or natural reserve. The lush green trees in the background, along with a tranquil body of water and a hint of a mountain in the far distance, adds a serene and picturesque quality to the setting. The weather seems pleasant and conducive for outdoor activities, likely captured during late spring or summer given the lushness of the vegetation and the attire of the individuals. The joyful expressions and active postures suggest a day of leisure, exploration, and family bonding in a natural environment.","title":"Backpacking family with children on their backs crosses the bridge at marcy dam, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552975","546167","554517","543233","543455","543515","543530","556531","552821","544739","543234","552295","545177","557983","547135","551027"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["khaki","child","hiking","neck","boot","family","pant","shoulder","boy","bonding"]}
