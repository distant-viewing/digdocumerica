{"path":"549258.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural scene centered around a red tractor actively engaged in hay baling. The landscape is broad and open, primarily characterized by a field covered with freshly cut hay organized in long, curving rows. The background features a gently rolling hill dotted with sparse trees, likely conifers judging by their silhouette. A clear sky with few clouds indicates it might be either late spring or summer.\n\nThe field is partially bounded by a wire fence, visible to the left and the distant center, suggesting it is a managed agricultural area. The tractor, which appears to be an older model, is equipped with a hay baler, and it's currently in the process of either collecting or arranging the hay. The patterns made by the sorted hay and the tractorâ€™s path give an aesthetic rhythm to the scene, displaying the blend of functionality and unplanned beauty of agricultural work.\n\nIn the far background, beyond the fences and the field, is a dense line of trees which serves as a natural barrier for the field and adds a contrast of color and texture to the landscape. The overall composition conveys a sense of solitude and the scale of the open land, emphasizing the vastness and the labor involved in farming.","title":"The John Redding ranch in Sarpy is threatened by strip-mining activities of the Westmoreland Coal Company.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["544888","552577","551167","551158","552578","557753","551168","557754","551169","557752","549137","549149","551333","549237","543667","555619"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hay","tractor","field","fence","rhythm","conifer","functionality","farming","barrier","wire"]}
