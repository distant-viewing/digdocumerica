{"path":"543134.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic coastal landscape. In the foreground, there is a gnarled, weather-beaten tree with a complex network of bare, twisting branches, which seems to be a cypress or similar species known for its resilience in harsh coastal environments. The texture of the tree bark appears rough and moss-covered, hinting at the humid climate.\n\nThe mid-ground reveals a rugged coastline with choppy sea waters lapping against the rocky shores. The cliffs are steep and covered with patches of greenery indicating robust vegetation despite the salty and windy conditions. \n\nThe background shows a broader perspective of the coastline, extending into a hazy horizon under a cloudy sky, which suggests overcast weather conditions, possibly typical of this location. The overall color palette of the scene is a mix of earthy tones, dark greens, and grays, giving the impression of a cool, moist climate. \n\nThis setting likely represents a natural reserve or a similarly protected coastal area, offering a view that emphasizes the rough beauty and isolation of such landscapes. The image evokes a feeling of solitude and the enduring strength of nature in the face of challenging environmental conditions.","title":"Rocky seashore and gnarled tree","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543153","543307","542884","543090","543061","545122","543297","543301","545173","545130","543068","543080","543433","543291","545934","545129"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["coastline","climate","twist","condition","beat","strength","reserve","endure","lap","know"]}
