{"path":"548368.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph depicts a bustling urban street scene, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s, capturing a mix of people and vehicles in the midst of daily activity. The image shows a crowd of pedestrians crossing a street crowded with a variety of vehicles, including cars and a van. The van, prominently in view, is red with text on it that reads \"Shade Co. Inc.\" suggesting it might be a company vehicle related to window shades or similar products.\n\nThe crowd is diverse in terms of age and attire, suggesting a typical workday scenario with people likely going about their regular routines. Some individuals are dressed in business suits and coats, while others sport more casual attire. One notable fashion includes a person in a patterned jacket with a large motif, walking alongside another in a red jacket, indicating a variety in personal style preferences of the era.\n\nThe background features large, imposing buildings typical of a downtown area in a major city, with facades made of stone and modern materials. Traffic lights and signs are visible, adding to the metropolitan feel of the scene. The environment seems slightly overcast, and the overall color palette of the photo is a blend of city tonesâ€”grays, browns, and pops of color from vehicles and clothing.\n\nThis image effectively captures the dynamic flow of life in a city, highlighting both the communal nature of urban spaces and the individuality of its inhabitants as they navigate the complexities of a busy street.","title":"Downtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549906","548369","556199","549923","546626","548388","553184","547788","556710","549882","548399","554314","556808","550142","546743","556734"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["crowd","van","vehicle","city","street","preference","inhabitant","workday","pop","jacket"]}
