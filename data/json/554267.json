{"path":"554267.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene at a ski resort. In the image, several people are engaged in various activities, primarily centered around a ski shop. The background of the photograph shows the exterior of the shop, which has large glass windows displaying various ski apparel and equipment. The building appears cozy and inviting, typical of ski resort architecture with its sturdy wooden construction and casual design.\n\nIn the foreground, there are five individuals, likely skiers, each dressed in distinct, colorful ski outfits that represent typical ski fashion. One person on the left side of the frame is dressed in a navy blue jacket and ski pants, carrying skis on his shoulder, seemingly walking away from the shop. Next to him, a person in a beige hat and a plaid coat is also carrying skis and walking in the opposite direction. In the center, we see a person in a bright red jacket conversing with another person dressed in orange pants and a yellow jacket and hat, who also carries skis. The red-jacketed individual is gesturing, possibly explaining something or pointing.\n\nAround these individuals, the ambiance is lively and filled with the chill of a bright winter day. The snowy setting and clear skies suggest good weather for skiing. The scene encapsulates a typical busy day at a ski resort with skiers preparing for or returning from their adventures on the slopes.","title":"In the village","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554275","554238","554235","554242","554276","554279","554245","554237","554259","554269","554221","554243","554234","554244","554236","554228"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ski","resort","shop","skier","person","jacket","chill","apparel","skiing","pointing"]}
