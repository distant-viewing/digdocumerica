{"path":"548612.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a hanging wooden sign, distinctively shaped with two cut-off corners at the top and anchored on a metal bracket attached to a vertical surface, possibly a post or the side of a building. The background is slightly blurred but shows a soft, possibly overcast sky.\n\nThe sign is painted in muted tones – the base color of the sign is a matte white, with inscriptions and decorative accents in a contrasting black and dark red. The text on the sign is styled in a straightforward, easily-readable font without serif decorations. The contents of the text are arranged in a hierarchical fashion, likely to draw attention to the variety and nature of the services offered. It reads:\n\n- \"USED BOOKS\"\n- \"GRANNY'S\"\n- \"SUNDRIES\"\n- \"LETTER WRITING\"\n- \"REFRESHMENTS\"\n\nEach line is centered and uses a different color for emphasis – \"USED BOOKS\" and \"REFRESHMENTS\" are in black, while the remaining lines are in dark red, visually separating the offerings into likely related groups (e.g., books and readings and personal correspondences and eating/drinking).\n\nThe sign's overall rustic style, including its hand-painted look and traditional hanging format, suggests a setting that favors a quaint or vintage aesthetic, possibly indicating a local business with a personalized, welcoming atmosphere.","title":"The South Beach area of Miami Beach attracts large numbers of people of retirement age.
