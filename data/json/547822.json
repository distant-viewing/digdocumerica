{"path":"547822.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid streetscape under a clear blue sky. It features a prominent, distinctive, castle-like stone building situated on the right side of the image. This building has steeply pitched gable roofs, arched doorways, and multiple decorative elements that suggest a Gothic Revival architectural style. The building's fa√ßade displays some partial weathering and discoloration, indicating age and exposure to the elements.\n\nTo the left of this stone structure are more utilitarian commercial buildings, including a one-story brick building with visible signage that reads \"Davis Supply Company.\" These buildings have a more straightforward, functional design typical of mid-twentieth-century commercial architecture.\n\nThe street in the foreground is a wide, paved road marked with white dashed lines, suggesting it is a main thoroughfare. On the road, a few cars are visible, ostensibly from the 1960s or 1970s, giving a hint to the era in which the photograph was likely taken.\n\nElectrical and telephone poles line the road, running parallel on either side, equipped with multiple lines which cut across the clear sky. The overall ambiance is a blend of historical charm and practical business function, typical of an older, mixed-use urban area.","title":"Old church now provides storage for autoMobile tires","placename":"Fort Worth (Tex.)","location":"Fort Worth, Texas","nn1":["546440","550107","557156","550111","546436","550108","545333","557643","550024","550138","558030","546428","549991","552526","555920","545610"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["building","streetscape","dash","stone","road","thoroughfare","discoloration","gable","telephone","line"]}
