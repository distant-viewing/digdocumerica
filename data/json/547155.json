{"path":"547155.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic moment along a coast where the forces of nature are prominently displayed. A large, turbulent wave is shown crashing against a wooden building and a protective seawall or bulkhead. The wooden structure, possibly a pier or part of a coastal establishment, features a dark-colored roof with notable wear, suggesting exposure to harsh weather conditions. \n\nThe wave, which is the focal point of the image, erupts into a massive spray of water that soars high above the roof, creating a dynamic and almost violent interaction with the man-made structures. The water appears frothy and chaotic, indicating strong currents or storm conditions.\n\nIn the foreground, partially visible wooden planks or beams, potentially remnants of other coastal defenses or debris, add to the rugged coastal environment depicted in the shot. The sky in the background is partly cloudy with hints of blue, suggesting that the weather might be clearing or that the storm intensity is variable.\n\nThe color saturation and quality of the image suggest it was taken with film, giving it a somewhat historical or dated feel. Overall, the photograph vividly captures a moment of natural power and the ongoing interaction between the sea and human attempts to live and build alongside it.","title":"Winter storm on lake Michigan","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547118","547071","551953","548079","543251","547609","547114","547119","543288","543253","543309","552955","543298","543092","547091","546378"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["storm","wave","soar","remnants","attempt","coast","clear","live","weather","current"]}
