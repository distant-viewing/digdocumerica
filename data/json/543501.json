{"path":"543501.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a row of tightly packed, colorful backpacks neatly arranged on a wooden beam. Most of the backpacks are vibrant red, interspersed with a few in green, tan, and darker shades. Each backpack is equipped with external straps and pockets, typical of outdoor hiking gear designed for functionality and durability.\n\nBelow the beam, there is a wooden sign attached that reads \"PARK PARALLEL 5 MIN. LIMIT,\" seemingly indicating a brief parking permission, perhaps humorous in this context as it applies to the backpacks set up as if they are 'parked'. The background features the dark wooden exterior of a rustic building with a sloped roof covered in grey shingles, likely a cabin or related structure in a natural reserve or park area.\n\nThe overall setting implies that this scene is situated in a wilderness area, possibly near a trailhead or camping site where hikers would assemble to start or end their journeys. The meticulous arrangement of the packs suggests preparation or completion of a group outdoor activity, highlighting a sense of organization and readiness for adventure in a wilderness setting.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["554539","543379","554509","543371","554508","554464","554513","545225","554463","554667","554672","554666","545776","545766","543383","543382"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["backpack","beam","wilderness","completion","apply","pack","hiker","assemble","readiness","strap"]}
