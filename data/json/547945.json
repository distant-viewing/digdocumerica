{"path":"547945.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a sunny residential scene, likely from the mid-20th century, showcasing a row of townhouses with a brick facade. The architecture of the townhouses is uniform, featuring a two-story design with pairs of white-framed windows on both levels and small white doors that are likely entries to individual units.\n\nIn front of the townhouses, there's a neatly maintained street with a vintage car parked along the curb. The car is large, likely an American make from the 1950s or 1960s, with a distinctive shiny, metallic body and prominent tailfins.\n\nThe landscaping includes well-manicured lawns and vibrant flower beds with a variety of blooms in pinks, yellows, and whites. A centrally placed rectangular flower bed is closer to the foreground, with a flower-lined curved path leading around it. In the background, a street lamp and more greenery are visible, suggesting a community-focused, pedestrian-friendly environment.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a quiet, residential area with attention to gardening and exterior upkeep, reflecting suburban life in this era.","title":"Yacht Club Cove on Staten Island: an \"environmental\" community of cluster housing around a central open space designed to preserve land values","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547859","557288","557365","555920","558157","547433","555912","551102","555900","557840","549287","556435","547837","551629","553550","556448"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["townhouse","flower","bed","white","1950","upkeep","entry","gardening","landscaping","pink"]}
