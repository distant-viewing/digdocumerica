{"path":"553993.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural scene dominated by an expansive sky at sunset or sunrise. The primary focus is on dramatic clouds and radiant sunlight. A thick layer of clouds runs horizontally across the middle of the frame, appearing dense and textured. These clouds obscure the sun directly, which is positioned behind them, creating a bold silhouette.\n\nThe sunlight, diffused by the clouds, bursts through in vivid rays, creating a phenomenon often referred to as \"crepuscular rays\" or \"God rays.\" These rays of light extend upward and downward, casting a warm, golden glow that contrasts strikingly with the darker clouds and the deeper colors of the intervening sky.\n\nThe surrounding sky transitions from a dark, almost stormy hue at the top to a brighter, more serene yellow-orange glow near the horizon. There are no terrestrial landscapes or other discernible objects in the frame; the composition is entirely filled with the celestial display. The atmosphere conveyed is one of awe and tranquility, typical of moments when natural light dramatically transforms the sky during transitional times of day.","title":"Sunset at Manele Bay","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["547356","545375","552896","547352","553992","542680","544944","554396","550390","542678","552337","555070","550429","546100","552335","550295"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["ray","cloud","glow","phenomenon","awe","sunlight","sunrise","transition","display","orange"]}
