{"path":"551768.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively scene in an urban park, featuring a group of children and adults engaged in a game of baseball. The park is characterized by open, grassy areas with some patches of dirt, suggesting regular use for sports and recreational activities. In the foreground, a makeshift baseball diamond is visible with some cones marking the layout. A soccer ball also lies on the grass near the baseball playing area, indicating a multi-sport use of the space.\n\nThe children and adults in the image are actively participating in the game or watching. The attire of the participants varies, with some wearing shorts and casual t-shirts suitable for warm weather, and others slightly more dressed up.\n\nIn the background, the urban context is clearly defined by the towering skyscrapers that loom over the park, giving a stark contrast between the green, leisure space and the bustling city life. These buildings have a modern architectural style, with reflective surfaces and a mixture of rectilinear forms.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is balanced, with natural elements like trees framing the scene on either side, and the cityscape creating a backdrop that encapsulates the essence of an urban park where nature and urbanity meet. The atmosphere appears sunny and pleasant, enhancing the vibrancy and dynamic nature of the scene.","title":"Girls playing kickball in central park","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551721","552024","553512","548395","550075","551769","556296","549318","553903","552755","547201","557410","549271","550074","557780","544808"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["baseball","game","park","adult","diamond","cone","child","ball","loom","participate"]}
