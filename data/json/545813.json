{"path":"545813.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph captures an old, weathered building that appears to be a church, located in a sparse desert environment. The church, positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame, has a faded exterior with patches of plaster peeling off to reveal brick beneath, and the wood details around the windows and roof are worn and deteriorated.\n\nThe structure is equipped with a metal-roofed bell tower, which is centrally positioned on the roofline and includes a simple cross at the top, above the opening where a bell once likely hung. This tower design suggests it was used both for summoning people and as a watchtower. The roof of the building appears to be metal and is in relatively good condition compared to the walls.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is a vast arid desert dotted with small shrubs and dry bushes. The terrain is gently undulating, and distant hills or low mountains form the horizon under a clear sky. To the right of the church, further into the background, are remnants of other buildings similar in construction style but in various stages of decay.\n\nThe area looks deserted with no visible human activity or presence. The overall scene conveys a sense of abandonment and the passage of time, illustrating a place once possibly bustling and now standing silent against a rugged landscape.","title":"Old church in Terlingua","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["543353","545366","554000","543349","553999","544137","556480","545826","543339","554035","547439","543367","558034","543171","550376","545817"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["church","bell","desert","tower","roofline","cross","roof","opening","metal","passage"]}
