{"path":"553277.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features an architectural scene possibly in an urban area. The composition is framed by large concrete structures with an almost brutalist design. Dominating the foreground, a concrete overpass runs horizontally across the frame, beneath which a yellow truck is seen driving out from an underpass, its headlights and roof lights illuminated.\n\nThe middle ground shows various levels and layers of the building, with people visible at different heights, likely pedestrians walking along pathways or standing in groups. Some greenery is spotted, indicating landscaped areas within these architectural layers.\n\nIn the background, other high-rise buildings can be seen, suggesting a densely populated city environment. The overall lighting is somewhat dim, possibly indicative of either dawn or dusk, which adds moodiness to the scene. The glimpse of natural light at the back and top right further emphasizes the depth of the urban canyon created by the surrounding buildings.","title":"Overhead walkway above Convention Way.
