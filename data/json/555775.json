{"path":"555775.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of an industrial area, likely a petroleum refinery or chemical plant, situated near a large body of water that extends into the horizon. The image features a collection of massive, cylindrical storage tanks predominantly in white, dominating the scene. These tanks are of various sizes and are symmetrically arranged within a complex network of roads and small structures, likely for operations and administrative purposes.\n\nThe foreground shows denser industrial installations including what might be processing units with visible piping and possibly smokestacks emitting no vapors or smoke, suggesting either non-operational status at the moment the photo was taken or efficient containment systems. A series of roads, populated with several cars, winds through the facility, enhancing connectivity within the plant.\n\nRainwater or process water ponds are visible near some of the tanks, reflecting environmental management practices. The surrounding landscape is relatively flat, punctuated by more industrial and infrastructure elements extending into the distance. In the far background, beyond the industrial complex, a more urban area can be glimpsed, suggesting proximity to a city or residential areas.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the large scale and organized complexity of industrial operations that are typical of refineries or chemical plants, highlighting both the industrial activity and its extensive use of surrounding land.","title":"American Cyanamid Company in the Linden, New Jersey industrial complex of metropolitan New York on the Arthur Kill River.
