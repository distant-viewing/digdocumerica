{"path":"551866.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque, rain-soaked square flanked by ornate, Gothic-style buildings that contribute a historical and majestic ambiance to the scene. These buildings are highly detailed, featuring intricate facades, with the one on the left exhibiting a series of arches at ground level that house various shops lit warmly from within. The cobblestone pavement of the square reflects the city lights, adding a shiny veneer to the scene which suggests recent rainfall.\n\nOn the right side of the square stands a prominent, larger building adorned with towering spires and numerous architectural decorations that enhance its gothic appeal. The architecture includes statues, carved windows, and detailed stonework, elements that give depth and character to the cityscape.\n\nIn the center of the square, there’s a very small, well-lit area with what appears to be a seating arrangement, possibly a café's outdoor seating left empty due to the weather. A vintage orange and white van is traveling through the square, its headlights and the reflection they cast on the wet pavement adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene setting.\n\nThere are no people visible in the scene, which when combined with the grey sky and wet surfaces, conveys a mood of quiet and calm in what might otherwise be a bustling city center. The entire composition — with its historic buildings, reflective wet surfaces, empty café, and lone moving vehicle — lends a sense of timelessness and a touch of mystery to the setting.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. On this rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire Fussgangerzone is thoroughly cleaned. This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551864","551870","551873","549680","546606","551867","549659","549681","558030","555902","557277","553188","553295","556249","550319","551791"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["square","café","seating","pavement","cobblestone","timelessness","stonework","spire","statue","city"]}
