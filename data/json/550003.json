{"path":"550003.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph provides a high-angle view over a cityscape, focusing on an outdoor plaza area. The plaza is clad in deep red or brick-color tiling, creating a warm and vibrant aesthetic that contrasts with the surrounding darker buildings. Central to the image is a rectangular structure supported by robust, rectangular columns. The structure creates shade for individuals on park benches below, many of whom appear to be relaxing or socializing.\n\nThe plaza is bustling with people; some are walking across it, others are gathered in groups or sitting down. There is a small, colorful market setup on the edge of the plaza, featuring what looks like striped umbrellas or canopies over stalls.\n\nIn the background, one can see a part of a modern, dark-toned building, probably an office building. In front of this building, prominently mounted on stone blocks and spreading across a stone arch with three openings, are bright American flags that add a dynamic element to the otherwise static urban environment.\n\nOverall, the composition suggests this is a public gathering space in an urban setting, designed to offer both a place for respite and community activity within the city. The strong geometric architectural elements and the vibrancy of engaged people coalesce to depict a lively urban scene, highlighting themes of community and daily city life.","title":"City hall plaza","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550759","553324","553162","551795","549999","551651","557267","551792","551797","550751","550755","551800","549988","550076","551823","553317"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["plaza","respite","socialize","stone","stall","community","umbrella","city","building","market"]}
