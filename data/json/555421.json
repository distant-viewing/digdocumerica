{"path":"555421.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a moment on a highway under a cloudy sky. In the foreground, a large sign mounted on a single pole prominently displays a message to drivers. It reads, \"LESS HIGHWAY LIGHTING DUE TO ENERGY CONSERVATION DRIVE CAREFULLY\" in bold, black letters against a yellow background. The command \"DRIVE CAREFULLY\" is especially emphasized with a larger font size.\n\nBeside the road, thereâ€™s lush green grass and a few scattered small white objects that could possibly be litter or small stones. The highway itself is multi-lane and appears wet, suggesting recent rain. Vehicles, including a yellow car nearest to the camera, are in motion on the slick road surface, traveling away from the viewpoint of the camera.\n\nThe overall conditions, such as the dark, cloudy sky and the wet road, along with the content of the sign, suggest caution is needed when driving. The area is expansive, with no buildings or obstacles obstructing the open view of the road stretching into a wooded distance, reflecting a typical highway scene found in many rural or semi-rural settings.","title":"Posted highway sign along Interstate #5 explains lack of highway lighting is due to energy conservation.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547298","547302","545875","543874","547811","546644","553894","557430","546738","557471","546747","544598","549890","546242","555437","554566"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","road","obstacle","command","caution","camera","conservation","driver","message","content"]}
