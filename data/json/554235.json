{"path":"554235.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a lively winter scene at a ski resort. In the foreground, numerous skiers, clad in colorful winter attire, are seen either skiing or walking across snow-covered slopes. A variety of ski equipment, primarily skis and poles, is propped up against wooden stands lining the perimeter of the activity area.\n\nIn the middle ground, a bustling ski lodge or a complex of lodges can be observed. The architecture of the buildings is rustic, primarily made of stone and wood, with roofs heavily laden with snow, indicating recent snowfall. The lodge features outdoor terraces where several people are congregated, likely enjoying a break or a meal.\n\nBehind the lodges, a mountainous terrain acts as the backdrop to the scene, partially covered with snow and dotted with bare trees. The atmosphere suggests a crisp, clear winter day, and the overall ambiance is vibrant and festive, typical of a popular ski destination during peak season. The photograph captures both the recreational and social aspects of ski culture.","title":"Noontime at the timber line restaurant and bar on snowmass mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554236","554242","554234","554292","550017","554237","554275","554279","554276","550004","554245","554267","554269","554244","554238","554257"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["ski","lodge","winter","snow","congregate","skis","snowfall","skier","prop","perimeter"]}
