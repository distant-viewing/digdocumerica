{"path":"547619.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a commercial dock scene featuring a large cargo ship moored to a quay. The ship, bearing the name \"TIGER FAMAGUSTA\" on its hull, exhibits a robust and somewhat weathered appearance, with a faded yellow and white paint job. It features multiple deck structures and several cranes or hoists positioned along its length, indicative of its use for loading and unloading goods.\n\nThe dock area itself includes several elements characteristic of a working industrial port. There are multiple cranes visible in the background, used for moving large cargo. The quayside is constructed from concrete, with metal hatches and a prominent bollard in the foreground—used for securing ships with mooring lines—showing rust and wear.\n\nThe background also shows a large industrial building, possibly a warehouse or storage facility, which is typical for dockside areas where goods might be temporarily housed. The sky is clear, suggesting a calm day with good weather conditions for port operations.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image captures the busy, utilitarian nature of a commercial port, focused on trade and transportation, marked by the tools and infrastructure essential for its function.","title":"Scrap metal is a major export commodity of Providence.","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547474","548127","546828","551558","548126","546934","552244","551582","550944","555260","553740","546881","555270","546860","552200","546804"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["port","ship","cargo","good","crane","dock","bollard","hatch","job","mooring"]}
