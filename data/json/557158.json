{"path":"557158.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph features four elderly women standing side by side on a street during daytime. From left to right, the first woman is dressed in a traditional Native American outfit, which includes a black dress decorated with floral patterns and fringe, and she adorns a feathered headpiece. The second woman wears a gold-colored shawl with fringe over a dark top. The third woman is wearing a black shawl and a light-colored scarf wrapped around her neck, her expression somewhat stern. The fourth woman sports a purple shawl with fringe over a dark outfit and a patterned scarf around her head.\n\nThe background shows a rural setting with low buildings, one of which has a bricked facade, and a bare tree. The road they are standing on appears quiet and unfrequented, leading towards a small bridge crossing a body of water visible in the far background. The lighting suggests it's either morning or afternoon with clear skies, given the shadows cast on the road. Overall, the setting feels quiet and serene, likely in a small town or village.","title":"Four women of the Iowa Indian tribe are shown wearing a modern version of their costumes on the main street of White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy.
