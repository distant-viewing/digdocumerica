{"path":"544770.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene centered around a body of water, likely a lake or large pond, surrounded by a rugged, mountainous landscape. The mountains in the background have relatively flat tops and gentle slopes, indicative of a plateau-like region, and they cast reflections onto the calm waterâ€™s surface, enhancing the stillness of the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a shore covered with dark, muddy debris that appears to be saturated logs and driftwood, suggesting recent fluctuations in water level or the aftermath of a flood. On this muddy shore, abutting the water, is a small motorboat. The boat holds three individuals; two are focused on something inside the boat, perhaps engaging with equipment or preparing for an activity, while the other person appears to be either entering or stabilizing the boat. The person's posture suggests movement and interaction with the boat rather than passive sitting.\n\nThe overall composition, including the tranquil water, rugged landscape, and human activity, suggests an exploration or scientific venture, possibly related to environmental study or leisure exploration in a natural setting. The setting is illuminated by natural daylight, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the natural environment and the reflective quality of the water.","title":"Area of small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["545654","552982","545666","546976","551350","544260","551538","544980","545932","555694","555693","549417","544763","553411","554198","552283"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","exploration","water","plateau","shore","flood","driftwood","motorboat","aftermath","person"]}
