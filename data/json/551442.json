{"path":"551442.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene featuring architectural contrasts between old and modern buildings. In the foreground on the left, there's a classic brick building with pointed roofs and several bay windows. The architecture appears aged but charming, indicative of an earlier architectural era. This older building has ivy or climbing plants draped over portions of its walls, adding a touch of greenery to the brick facade.\n\nIn stark contrast, the background prominently features a modern, tall building with a smooth, reflective facade that appears to be glass or metal, giving it a cylindrical appearance. This skyscraper stands out due to its size and contemporary design.\n\nThe scene is completed with a cityscape that includes a few more buildings of various designs and heights, and a street scene visible at the bottom. There's a visible \"One Way\" road sign on a post at the street corner, hinting at the direction of traffic. Several cars, typical of what might be found in the mid to late 20th century based on their designs, are parked and driving on the road, suggesting this photo was taken several decades ago. The overall composition juxtaposes the architectural evolution of urban environments, captured under a bright, blue sky with some clouds.","title":"Former rooming house at South 9th Street and Fifth Avenue is slated for demolition.
