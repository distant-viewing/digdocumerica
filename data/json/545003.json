{"path":"545003.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, a young boy is featured prominently, holding a clear plastic bag filled with bright red tomatoes. He appears cheerful, displaying a broad smile and squinting slightly in what seems to be bright sunlight. The boy has blond hair and is wearing a yellow T-shirt and a dark green knitted cap, which is slightly pulled back on his head.\n\nThe tomatoes in the bag are densely packed; droplets of water or condensation can be seen clinging to the inside surface of the bag, emphasizing the freshness of the tomatoes. The boy is gripping the top of the bag near its knot, and it appears somewhat heavy given the way it is stretching at the top.\n\nThe background behind the boy is mostly a plain, light-colored wall, with a partial view of what appears to be a blue and white striped element, possibly a part of another object or structure not fully visible in the frame.\n\nThe setting suggests a sunny, outdoor environment possibly during a casual day out or while engaging in a simple daily activity such as shopping or visiting a market. The joy and pride the boy exhibits possibly suggest that he either helped pick or is excited to share the tomatoes.","title":"Oregon--near Astoria","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["544275","544217","553168","557937","543324","555337","555363","556558","544261","544357","551765","543871","553221","544192","551624","547787"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["tomato","boy","bag","freshness","pride","shopping","droplet","market","joy","top"]}
