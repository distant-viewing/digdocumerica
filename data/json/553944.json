{"path":"553944.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a sweeping aerial view of a landscape that contrasts an urban area with adjacent agricultural fields. The scene is dominated by a large, complex highway interchange in the foreground with multiple lanes and connecting ramps that facilitate traffic flow in various directions. The interplay of curves and linear pathways is prominent, and there are several vehicles visible on the roads, suggesting a moment captured during a busy period.\n\nTo the left of the highway, there are extensive agricultural fields featuring rich, dark soil, possibly indicating recent plowing or harvesting activities. The fields are segmented into rectangular plots, each varying slightly in hue from dark brown to a rust-like red, possibly due to different crop types or stages of field management.\n\nMoving towards the right side of the image, the urban area is densely packed with buildings spanning from low-rise structures to more dense residential or commercial blocks. This urban setup extends into the far background, fading under a sky partly covered with fluffy clouds.\n\nThe overall composition is vivid, marked by a natural color palette dominated by the earthy tones of the fields, the grey of the highway infrastructure, and the organic greens of sporadic vegetation. The background is comprised of a mountain range with some cloud cover adding depth and a dynamic element to the sky. This dichotomy between human development and agricultural land use characterizes the scene, providing visual insights into land management and urban expansion.","title":"Area of h-1 freeway and northeast corner of kuneo road near waipahu.  316 acres of cleared land here, once growing sugar has awaited development since 1968, when it was rezoned from agriculture to urban use","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["553947","553943","548827","553015","552594","558055","552719","557461","551205","548411","547770","542517","555630","546709","553059","544642"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","fields","field","management","plowing","insight","interchange","ramp","expansion","harvest"]}
