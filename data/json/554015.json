{"path":"554015.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an expansive agricultural scene at dusk, cast in the warm glow of the setting sun. The landscape is divided into large, neatly arranged patches, each demarcated by precise rows which suggest various types of crops being cultivated. Significantly, the left side of the image shows a field with richly hued, possibly reddish soil and an adjacent area that appears to be planted with a crop forming an orderly pattern, hinting at a possibly irrigated land.\n\nA prominent dirt path bisects the fields, running from the foreground into the distance. This road is reddish in tone, standing out from the verdant and earthen colors of the fields. Along this path, an agricultural vehicle is discernible, perhaps in motion, indicating ongoing farm activities such as plowing, or heading to or from a task.\n\nThe vast expanse of the area suggests a large-scale commercial farming operation. The horizon is flat and stretches wide across the image, meeting a clear sky that subtly shifts in color from a deep blue at the top to a softer hue toward the horizon, indicating the image was taken during late afternoon or early evening.\n\nThe overall mood is quiet and serene highlighting the rural beauty and the magnitude of agricultural endeavors. This scene exemplifies the interaction between human-made agricultural infrastructure and the natural landscape, illustrated through the cultivation patterns and the use of machinery in farming.","title":"Pineapple fields of Lanai.
