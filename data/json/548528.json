{"path":"548528.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic marina filled with several sailing boats, predominantly featuring masts that rise into the clear, blue sky. The focal point is a red-hulled sailboat named \"KAI BABY\" from Baltimore, MD, which is moored at a dock. A person appears to be actively involved in a maintenance or preparation task on this boat, bending over the deck amid various sailing equipment and gear. Surrounding boats also vary in color and size, their sails furled, reflecting a calm day at port.\n\nThe reflections of the sailboats shimmer lightly on the water's surface, suggesting subtle movements in the body of water. The background is dense with vertically soaring masts, creating a patterned texture against the blue sky. The overall setting is peaceful and leisurely, with elements indicating typical marina activities. The appearance and attire of the individual suggest a warm, sunny day conducive to outdoor activities.","title":"Chesapeake bay marina","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["544244","542902","544248","556191","542904","546877","542871","543545","544021","542912","552028","542875","556192","544130","546807","543246"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","mast","sailing","sailboat","boat","soar","shimmer","port","preparation","sail"]}
