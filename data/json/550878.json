{"path":"550878.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures an almost surreal scene underwater, focusing on a dead fish lying at the bottom of what appears to be a shallow body of water. The fish, with its dull golden-brown scales, contrasts against the dark and murky water around it. This deceased fish rests amid a bed of debris consisting of wet leaves, twigs, and other organic matter, indicating a natural freshwater environment. \n\nThe image has a soir√©e of bubbles scattered across the surface of the water, possibly due to decomposition gases escaping from the fish or other organic material around it. The richness of the surrounding colors is subdued, reflecting low visibility and minimal light penetration through the water, which adds an eerie and somber tone to the scene.\n\nThe capture is detailed, showing the texture of the scales on the fish and the slimy surfaces of wet leaves and muck. Overall, the photograph delivers a poignant reminder of the cycle of life and death in aquatic ecosystems, portrayed through the lens of underwater photography.","title":"Dead carp in heavy algae in the Fox River near Kaukauna. Rough fish such as carp are plentiful in the heavily industrialized stretch of the Fox between Lake Winnebago and Green Bay. Game fish, however, cannot survive in the oxygen-depleted water.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546779","546185","547704","555560","547737","552067","546782","545161","548973","555543","546846","546138","546784","547687","548713","546898"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","underwater","bubble","deliver","reminder","richness","cycle","matter","escape","lens"]}
