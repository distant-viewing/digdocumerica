{"path":"554531.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural landscape that includes a prominent mountain, dense forest areas, and a clear sky. In the foreground, verdant evergreen trees, predominantly conifers, display lush, green foliage. Prominently in this section, there is also a dead tree, distinguishable by its bare, timbered branches and lack of leaves, which stands in contrast to the verdant trees around it.\n\nThe middle ground showcases a thick band of dense forest primarily composed of these green, needle-leaved trees. This lush forest appears to extend upward gradually as the terrain begins to slope toward the mountain.\n\nThe mountain itself forms the central focus of the background. It is a large, rounded summit with a barren, rocky surface that appears devoid of vegetation. The color of the mountain is a mix of earthy tones, and it rises distinctly above the tree line.\n\nAbove all, the sky is visible with a very soft gradient from a light to a deeper blue, indicating clear weather conditions.\n\nIn sum, the composition captures a serene wilderness scene, with no human presence or man-made structures visible, emphasizing the natural beauty and tranquility of the location.","title":"Stunted firs near the timBerline at the summit of algonquin mountain (elevation 5,114 feet) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York state","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548025","543582","544852","554459","550602","555657","555656","554461","555110","554530","542604","552143","555698","542842","555662","554398"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","forest","summit","tree","begin","conifer","needle","band","gradient","lack"]}
