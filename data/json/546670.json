{"path":"546670.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban expressway from a high aerial perspective. The image shows multiple lanes of traffic, densely packed with cars, indicating either rush hour or a traffic jam. The vehicles include a variety of cars and buses, mostly facing forward, suggesting heavy yet organized traffic flow. Notable is a curve in the expressway that guides the vehicles in a gentle rightward arc, directing them towards an overpass or similar structure.\n\nTo the sides of the expressway, there are patches of greenery, featuring trees and grass that border the road and add a touch of nature to the urban setting. On the left side of the image, a parallel train track runs alongside the road, though no train is visible at this moment.\n\nIn the background, there are large buildings which appear to be institutional or possibly large residential complexes, characterized by their uniform architecture and numerous windows. The general atmosphere suggests a cloudy day, as indicated by the dull lighting and shadows, implying an overcast sky.\n\nThe expressway itself is equipped with basic road safety features such as lane markings, and barriers are visible between the opposite flows of traffic, enhancing safety along the route. The image captures the essence of urban transportation and the bustle of city life, encapsulated by the convergence of road, rail, and residential elements in a densely packed area.","title":"Rush hour traffic on 14th Street Bridge, between Virginia and the District","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556832","546608","546713","547780","546734","546686","546726","546612","547770","546681","556194","548332","546709","546617","546721","546707"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["traffic","road","lane","flow","train","safety","jam","arc","rush","bustle"]}
