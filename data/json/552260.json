{"path":"552260.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant view of a bustling city skyline seen from across a body of water. The water in the foreground appears dark and is agitated, with waves crashing onto visible rocks, creating white, foamy patterns. The skyline is characterized by a variety of buildings including tall skyscrapers, with one very pronounced tower that stands out due to its unique, futuristic shape.\n\nAbove the city, the sky is a striking blue, decorated with scattered fluffy clouds that add to the depth of the scene. The composition of the photograph balances the natural elements, like the water and sky, with the urban skyline, creating a dynamic contrast between nature and human-made structures. The clarity and brightness of the day make the buildings and the surrounding environment appear crisp and detailed. This image not only captures the physical beauty of the location but also suggests the bustling activity of urban life.","title":"Seattle's elliott bay, rated as having the cleanest water of any major industrial port in the united states","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552261","552265","552251","557273","547967","552252","552268","555716","552233","553677","552363","548387","557274","549477","548384","547932"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["skyline","bustle","pronounce","crash","city","brightness","decorate","clarity","skyscraper","make"]}
