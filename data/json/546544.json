{"path":"546544.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene featuring a concrete pathway lined by a white, wooden picket fence on which a small orange cat is perched. The fence curves gently away from the viewpoint, leading into a lush green lawn dotted with trees and shrubbery in the background. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light that enhances the tranquil atmosphere of the scene. The pathway itself appears damp, possibly due to recent rain, and is bordered on the other side by the fence, beyond which the expanse of the well-manicured grass extends. No people are visible in the shot, contributing to the peaceful, quiet mood of the photograph. The focus and composition subtly emphasize the solitude and calmness of the setting, marking it as a quiet moment captured in a probably suburban landscape.","title":"Sure, the corrected caption is: 'Kitten on ledge near Lincoln Elementary School'","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["549154","546559","542895","557212","547404","543660","552723","558104","546435","545041","557018","555215","551104","547536","557087","556950"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["fence","pathway","picket","shrubbery","calmness","rain","viewpoint","lawn","shot","solitude"]}
