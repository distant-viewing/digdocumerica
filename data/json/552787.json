{"path":"552787.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph captures a striking red sports car, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s, viewed from a slightly raised angle. The car features a sleek, streamlined body and is characterized by its sporty coupe design, with a long hood and a short rear deck.\n\nInside the car, there are two people visible through the windshield. They appear to be wearing dark suits and have dark hair. One individual is in the driver's seat, seemingly focused on the task of driving, while the other is a passenger sitting next to the driver. Both individuals have a serious demeanor.\n\nThe background and surroundings of the car are slightly out of focus, putting the emphasis on the vehicle itself. The general ambiance suggests an urban setting with diffuse lighting, likely overcast or shaded conditions which soften the sharpness and color intensity in the photo.\n\nOverall, this image portrays a moment of modern mobility characterized by the distinct style of the car and the setting which indicates day-to-day usage or possibly the start of a journey.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the Marriott Motor Inn, Ann Arbor.
