{"path":"545906.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a natural scene where a large amount of small, pale rounded hailstones are scattered across a bed of green grass and thin branches. The hailstones vary slightly in size, and their pale color contrasts sharply with the dark green and brown hues of the grass and branches. The image conveys a textured appearance due to the mix of smooth hailstones and the more chaotic, intertwined grass and branches. The lighting seems soft, possibly due to overcast conditions typical after a hailstorm, which also enhances the muted color palette of whites, greens, and browns. The focus is on the interplay of natural elements following a weather event, emphasizing the density and spread of the hailstones entangled among the natural vegetation.","title":"Hail storm","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["545891","557200","557196","557201","543562","557191","547312","552504","549134","557199","557192","549229","557194","557197","553853","549139"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["branch","grass","intertwine","bed","amount","density","follow","white","interplay","spread"]}
