{"path":"542624.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image depicts a forest scene with a logging operation. In the foreground, tall pine trees frame the view, hinting at dense forestation. The middle of the photograph reveals a clearing where a large, yellow logging machine is centrally positioned. This machine, resembling a bulldozer or a similar type of heavy equipment, appears to be either moving or processing logs.\n\nThe background shows a more dense forest, giving way to a mountainous area. These mountains are partly covered with snow, suggesting a high elevation or a colder season. The mountain peaks are visible through a light haze, possibly indicating distance or atmospheric conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a vivid contrast between the natural environment of the forest and the mechanical intrusion represented by the logging equipment. The setting is remote and rugged, characterized by the mountainous terrain and lush forestry typical of a wilderness area. The atmosphere evokes a sense of isolation, with human activity centered solely on the machinery involved in forestry operations.","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["554416","542851","542623","550354","552201","554419","542824","554418","542616","542947","555143","556922","555198","542852","553468","545011"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["forestry","logging","machine","forest","forestation","intrusion","covered","logg","operation","atmospheric"]}
