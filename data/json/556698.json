{"path":"556698.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a subway car, presumably during a commute. The image shows several passengers, mostly men seen in business attire like suits and coats, seated and engaged in various activities. The majority are reading newspapers, which was a common way to pass time during commutes before the rise of digital media. Both the newspapers and the attire suggest a setting that might be from several decades ago.\n\nThe subway car features a line of overhead advertisements and a detailed subway map that is visible in several sections of the car. The interior is furnished with simple seats, and the flooring appears utilitarian. Fluorescent lights illuminate the car, and the overall mood is quiet and focused, typical of a morning or evening commute. There is one person standing and holding onto a pole, possibly because the train is moving or about to stop.\n\nThe color tone and quality of the photograph, along with the style of clothing and the design of the interior, suggest this image might be from the mid to late 20th century. The scene is an ordinary, everyday moment yet it provides a nostalgic glimpse into the routines and aesthetics of past commuting environments.","title":"Lexington Avenue Line subway riders aboard a New York City Transit Authority car. There has been a decrease in ridership since 1960. At that time the subway handled 2.2 million people a day, which was 51 percent of the work force. In 1970 the number had decreased to 2.1 million per day and 47 percent of the work force. The system is of crucial importance to the city, but voters have refused to authorize any more improvements or a fare increase.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556780","556691","556813","556665","554370","548256","556669","556661","556818","556656","554328","549893","556659","548261","556653","556811"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["commute","subway","newspaper","car","furnish","medium","commuting","flooring","map","majority"]}
