{"path":"545772.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures two people hiking on a rugged trail in a natural rocky environment, possibly during the late afternoon or early evening, given the warm, dusky lighting. The landscape is characterized by large red rock formations with a smooth, undulating surface, reflective of a desert setting, likely in a location similar to the landscapes found in the Southwestern United States.\n\nThe two hikers, a man and a woman, are walking up a steep rocky trail. The man, in the foreground, is dressed in dark clothes and appears to be in mid-step, looking down, possibly to navigate the terrain. The woman, following him, is wearing a white tank top and shorts, walking with her head turned slightly to the side, looking forward.\n\nThe surrounding rocks are steep and dominate the background, rising abruptly from the trail and casting shadows onto the path. These rock formations, combined with the trail they are on, create a corridor-like effect, focusing attention along the path they are ascending. The natural color palette is rich with deep red and orange hues, typical of sedimentary rock formations rich in iron oxide. The lighting highlights the texture of the terrain, emphasizing the rough, uneven surface and the challenges of the hike.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of outdoor adventure and exploration, set against a dramatic and rugged landscape that is both imposing and beautiful.","title":"Hikers Terry McGaw and Glen Denny on the trail to Delicate Arch in Arches National Park, remarkable for extraordinary products of erosion in the form of giant arches, pinnacles, windows and pedestals.","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545751","544903","545768","544305","545781","544301","545700","554503","545759","545762","544928","545785","545758","544906","543248","544902"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["trail","rock","formation","path","hike","corridor","hiker","iron","challenge","clothe"]}
