{"path":"555299.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features an indoor gardening space, presumably inside a greenhouse or garden room, characterized by its elevated structure and abundant plantation. The image captures an aisle flanked by wooden tables or planting boxes, densely populated with a variety of plants in different types of containersâ€”including pots, trays, and some small handmade vessels. The tables are labeled, with the closest one prominently displaying a sign that reads \"Vegetables,\" suggesting that the plants are organized by category and possibly include an assortment of vegetable plantings.\n\nDirectly above these tables, the ceiling is composed of translucent material, likely glass or plastic, which allows natural light to flood the interior, essential for plant growth. The image also shows the interior structure, including pipes and other underlying fittings, hinting at a possible irrigation system or other functional equipment necessary for maintaining the plants.\n\nDecorative elements, such as hanging plants and small accessories, can be seen around the space, adding to the functional yet aesthetic purpose of the area. Notably, the ambient lighting and the focused organization of the plants suggest a well-maintained and thriving environment conducive for horticulture. The general atmosphere is one of a calm, controlled, and nurturing space dedicated to the cultivation of various plants.","title":"A highly efficient solar greenhouse at a school in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
