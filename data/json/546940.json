{"path":"546940.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts four young boys engaged in activities on a muddy, reddish-brown shoreline. The area appears to be near a body of water, as evidenced by the wet, reflective surface that mirrors part of the scene and the occasional pieces of floating debris. The background is almost completely obscured by a hazy, pinkish-grey overlay, possibly indicating fog or air pollution.\n\nFrom left to right: the first boy is walking, looking down, wearing a striped pink-and-white tank top and matching shorts, with black knee-high boots. He holds a dark bottle in one hand. The second boy is bending over, wearing orange shorts and a red T-shirt, closely examining something on the ground. The third boy, standing upright, wears green shorts and a khaki shirt, holding a fishing rod directed towards the ground. The fourth boy, also upright, dressed in white shorts and a white T-shirt, holds a similar fishing rod.\n\nThe foreground features scattered rocks, some debris such as a small box and a white plastic container, and sections of dried land that stand out against the wet, muddy surface. The environment conveys a sense of quiet isolation and casual exploration, typical of childhood outdoor activities in a semi-wild setting.","title":"Fishing at Back River near the sewage treatment plant","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["544221","544299","548116","552828","551392","552591","553431","551225","552118","545539","550231","543685","544805","552257","548837","544229"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["boy","short","rod","fishing","overlay","matching","khaki","shirt","childhood","debris"]}
