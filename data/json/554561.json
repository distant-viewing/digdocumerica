{"path":"554561.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph features an outdoor rustic scene where a dilapidated wooden structure plays a key role. This building, seemingly a barn or an old shed, is seriously damaged and collapsing. Some wooden beams and planks are falling apart, leaning against what remains standing of the walls.\n\nPositioned prominently in front of this structure is an old white pickup truck. The truck is parked and appears to be from a mid-20th century design, showing signs of neglect with its faded and possibly peeling paint. It adds to the overall feeling of abandonment in the scene.\n\nTo the right of the image, there is a piece of agricultural machinery, possibly a hay rake, with its curved metal teeth exposed. This piece is also rusty, merging with the scene's worn-out and neglected theme.\n\nThe grass around these objects is tall and overgrown, dotted with wildflowers, indicating that the area has not been maintained for some time. Behind the immediate scene, the backdrop consists of lush, dense trees and a mountain in the far distance, partly obscured by mist or fog, suggesting a quiet and remote location.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of quiet decay and a sense of being frozen in time, away from busy urban life. The cool, subdued color palette emphasizes a mood of tranquil neglect and nature slowly reclaiming the man-made objects and structures.","title":"Abandoned farm equipment on a farm which did not succeed near Elizabethtown, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552673","552515","552997","555612","550279","547771","551111","557701","556330","543354","543344","556313","552087","545295","554782","543339"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["neglect","rake","truck","freeze","hay","reclaim","piece","collapse","wildflowers","objects"]}
