{"path":"549167.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive open-pit mine surrounded by natural landscape. The mining area features large, exposed earth formations with visible layers and textures, suggesting significant excavation activities. The terrain has various gray and brown tones, indicative of different soil and rock types being unearthed. \n\nSurrounding the mine, there are patches of lush green terrain, primarily grassland and densely wooded areas with evergreen trees, contrasting sharply against the stark, barren excavation site. This juxtaposition highlights the impact of mining operations on the natural environment.\n\nThe topography is uneven, with elevated areas providing vantage points over the mining pit. In the distance, one can see a flat, open field, which might serve as a buffer zone or additional operational space related to the mining activities. The absence of visible machinery or people suggests the photo might have been taken during a non-operational period or from a distance that does not capture such detail. The overall composition offers a vivid depiction of industrial activity embedded within a natural setting, emphasizing the scale and depth of human alteration to the landscape.","title":"Peabody Coal Company strip mine, south of Colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549242","555621","549177","544054","549172","549241","544111","543758","544112","554768","549174","552177","543857","544785","544100","550568"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","pit","mine","excavation","buffer","embed","alteration","grassland","topography","depiction"]}
