{"path":"551284.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This image appears to be an aerial or satellite photograph showcasing rugged terrain with a dynamic geological structure. The central feature of the image is a volcanic crater, evident from the circular shape and the distinct crater colorations including browns, tans, and darker tones that suggest volcanic rock and possibly ash. The texture within the crater is uneven, implying rough, possibly recently active volcanic terrain.\n\nTowards the right side of the crater, an area is much darker, which might be a water body or a shadowed part of the crater. Various ridges and formations radiate outward from the crater, marked by darker lines and patches, suggesting older lava flows or significant geological shaping over time.\n\nThe overall landscape surrounding the crater is rugged and mountainous, displaying a mixture of dark and lighter tones that indicate various rock formations and possibly vegetation depending on the altitude and ecology of the area. The photograph captures the grand scale and isolation of the volcanic feature, emphasizing the power and unpredictability of natural geological processes. The composition has no visible human activity, underscoring the remote and possibly inhospitable nature of this terrain.","title":"Carp, seen from \"the clown\", a floating restaurant at osage beach","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["550813","544694","552424","552426","543148","554140","554090","555793","555158","552423","550585","550442","550396","554141","555885","549244"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["lava","ash","depend","formation","terrain","tan","radiate","rock","coloration","ridge"]}
