{"path":"554691.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene that seems to evoke a sense of community and everyday life. It features several groups of people engaged in conversation and leisure activities on a sunny sidewalk, suggesting a setting in a town or suburban area.\n\nOn the left of the image, a group of elderly women is standing on the sidewalk, conversing with each other. They are dressed in coats and dresses appropriate for cooler weather, and two of them have hats. The ladies appear to be enjoying their interaction, each holding what looks like a handbag.\n\nMoving to the right side of the frame, in front of a store labeled â€œDavy Jones Locker\" which features an awning, there are people in various activities. A woman and a younger girl in colorful clothes are walking by the store, where a small display of goods can be seen outside, hinting at a local business perhaps selling groceries or household items.\n\nThe setting is lined with various stores and a clear view of the street can be seen extending in the background, populated by some cars and further groups of people strolling or engaging with each other. Overhead, utility wires run parallel to the street, and a beautifully colored autumn tree adds vibrant red and orange hues to the scene, contrasting with the otherwise calm tones of the buildings and street.\n\nThe atmosphere conveys a busy, yet relaxed weekday vibe, showcasing a slice of life in this community where social interactions and local commerce form a significant part of daily routines.","title":"Ladies shopping on a fall sunday in Lake George village, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557272","556214","551084","551742","548625","551815","558118","557803","545350","551686","551829","555895","545372","556223","551699","550115"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["store","street","sidewalk","group","grocery","handbag","stroll","awning","sell","household"]}
