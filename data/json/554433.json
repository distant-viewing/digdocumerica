{"path":"554433.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting under an overcast sky. It shows a large factory complex composed of multiple buildings, including tall storage silos and facilities characterized by flat roofs. Prominent in the scene are several large chimneys emitting white smoke, which blends into the gray clouds above.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a parking area filled with vehicles from what appears to be the 1960s or 1970s, judging by the design of the cars, which are mostly sedans in various colors. The parking lot is bordered by a grassy area, and the whole scene is enclosed by a chain-link fence, enhancing the industrial and utilitarian vibe of the environment.\n\nThere are no visible people in the scene, and the focus is on the industrial operations and the cars parked outside. The overall atmosphere is somewhat gloomy due to the stormy sky and the industrial setting. The color palette is subdued, with the blues and grays of the sky and the industrial structures dominating the scene.","title":"New, $90 million international paper company mill on lake champlain near ticonderoga, New York","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["545443","550328","551033","545445","550344","550868","549967","557390","550676","546908","546866","545987","557214","548070","548336","546968"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["parking","silo","chain","judge","link","sedan","car","1960","enclose","vibe"]}
