The sign also includes a graphic of an oil derrick and pipeline system, and provides contact information for the Ohio Pipe Line Company stationed in Woodbury, New Jersey, along with a phone number.\n\nIn the background, a residential setting is visible with a modest two-story house with gray siding. There is a small porch with stairs leading to a fenced yard. Two people are seen, one ascending the stairs to the porch. The yard is green with grass and there are other residential structures visible further in the background. The overall atmosphere feels like a suburban neighborhood.","title":"Sign on pipe set in lawn reads: \"Warning. Petroleum pipeline.\" The Woodbridge community strongly objected to having these pipelines running through private residential property and started an investigation which resulted in the jailing of two city officials.","placename":"New Jersey","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557546","545949","544227","545997","552432","552005","549000","546402","549129","545615","544212","558053","547910","547571","544245","546240"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["stair","yard","porch","graphic","pipeline","contact","phone","warning","information","oil"]}
