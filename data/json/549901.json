{"path":"549901.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This is a photo capturing a compelling moment shared by two people gazing at a cityscape from a ferry or a similar viewpoint. The skyline is likely that of Manhattan, identifiable by its distinctive tall buildings and dense arrangement of skyscrapers. The photograph features a couple from behind, sitting close together, looking out towards this urban landscape. The woman has long hair and is wearing a floral shirt, while the man, slightly leaning towards her, is dressed in a casual, earth-toned shirt.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a railing with signs, including one that notably says \"NO SMOKING,\" which is attached to a fence guarding the edge of the ferry or viewing platform. The water body in front of them could be a river, given its width and the way it reflects light, adding a serene quality to the image with the bustling city in the background.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a private moment of urban contemplation or sightseeing, with the vast city panorama in the background suggesting both the enormity of the urban environment and a moment of introspection or shared connection between the two individuals.","title":"On the Staten Island Ferry, looking back toward the skyline of lower Manhattan.
