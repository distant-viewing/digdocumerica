{"path":"550217.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene centered around a body of water, possibly a river or lake, surrounded by natural vegetation. The water is a deep blue, reflecting light that creates a sparkling effect on its surface.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's an individual standing on a large rock jutting into the water. The person appears to be fishing, as they are holding a fishing rod with their attention focused on the water. They are dressed in dark clothing, which contrasts with the bright sunlight reflecting off the water.\n\nThe background features lush, green trees that line the banks of the water body, enhancing the tranquility of the setting. The right bank is more obscured in shadow, suggesting that the sun is positioned in the opposite direction, possibly to the west.\n\nIn the foreground, there are some plant debris and branches floating on the water, which adds a touch of naturalness and detail to the scene, indicating a generally calm and lightly-visited natural area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the solitary figure of the fisher amid a quiet and possibly secluded natural landscape, evokes a sense of peace and solitude.","title":"Fishing the Rocky River at Columbia Township","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550666","551024","550313","555576","542509","543628","550665","554520","553070","554519","551025","543753","553082","542529","542651","545968"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["water","bank","peace","rod","direction","fishing","body","solitude","touch","branch"]}
