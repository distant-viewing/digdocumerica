{"path":"557340.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a layered urban landscape leading to a mountainous backdrop. In the foreground, there's a busy parking lot filled with cars of various models and colors, indicative of a bygone era in automotive design. Notably diverse, the cars feature designs typical of the mid-20th century. A utility pole stands prominently on the left, its lines drawing the eye upward and across the composition.\n\nBeyond the parking area, the middle ground reveals residential buildings and smaller structures, probably part of a neighborhood. These buildings are somewhat obscured by a fence, and there's notable architectural variety, and hints of greenery suggest small backyard spaces.\n\nIn stark contrast to the packed foreground, the background opens expansively to reveal a striking mountain range capped with snow. This scenic beauty offers a natural, serene counterpoint to the dense urban environment in the foreground. The mountains appear majestic and might be part of a larger chain, adding a sense of depth and grandeur to the scene.\n\nAbove, the sky is slightly overcast, lit in a way that suggests either early morning or late afternoon light, casting a gentle glow and softening the overall appearance of the image. The overall composition juxtaposes human activity and natural splendor, highlighting the intersection of urban life and natural landscapes.","title":"View of Colorado's Front Range beyond urban and industrial sprawl","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["554284","557341","543961","552603","542674","544791","549310","552186","543714","547206","553131","551071","550149","555861","544783","549875"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["parking","backyard","mountain","intersection","chain","design","car","grandeur","way","lot"]}
