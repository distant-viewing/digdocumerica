{"path":"544546.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of an alligator partially submerged in water. The alligator's head and part of its back are visible above the water's surface. Its skin appears rugged and textured, a characteristic feature of alligators, with patterns of dark and light scales that provide natural camouflage. \n\nThe alligator's eyes are open and on the sides of its head, a typical trait that allows for a wider field of vision. Its snout is pointed and slightly turned towards the camera, suggesting alertness or curiosity. Small, droplet-like water specks are noticeable on the alligator’s skin, possibly from recently surfacing.\n\nThe water is dark and appears quite still, hinting that the photograph might have been taken in a calm section of a lake, pond, or marsh. Underwater vegetation can be seen beneath the surface, providing a murky, textured backdrop that blends with the shadowed parts of the alligator's body.\n\nThe lighting focuses on the alligator’s head and the foreground, while the background fades into shadows, creating a dramatic and moody effect. This composition highlights the alligator as the central subject of interest, potentially underscoring the solitary and primal nature of this creature within its natural habitat.","title":"Small alligator near taMiami canal at s-12a structure","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544528","550219","555197","557606","549145","551375","545169","555066","543778","551374","544904","544543","551363","551362","555065","544900"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["head","skin","alertness","murky","eyes","camouflage","creature","marsh","speck","shadowed"]}
