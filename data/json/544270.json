{"path":"544270.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph showcases an outdoor aquatic scene where two individuals, a young boy and an older man, are sitting in a metal rowboat equipped with an outboard motor. The boat is floating in a large body of water, possibly a lake or a calm sea area.\n\nThe young boy, seated at the bow of the boat, has his back to the camera. He is wearing a pair of dark swim shorts and appears to be interacting with the water with his hand. The older man, seated towards the stern and operating the boat's motor, is wearing a patterned shirt and dark shorts. His attention is directed towards the front of the boat, likely navigating or steering.\n\nThe water surrounding the boat is relatively calm with light ripples, indicating gentle movement. In the background, parallel rows of partially submerged posts extend into the water, possibly remains of a broken-down pier or docking structure.\n\nThe sky is overcast, giving the scene a muted lighting that suggests a tranquil, overcast day. The environment is natural and serene, devoid of any visible signs of other boats or people, suggesting a private or isolated setting. The overall mood of the image speaks of a quiet moment in nature, shared between two persons enjoying the peacefulness of the setting.","title":"Crab fishermen","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["548553","546352","553411","546976","552123","550835","546356","544980","550841","554196","549417","548554","543940","552317","547557","551309"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","motor","boy","short","stern","rowboat","swim","docking","steering","bow"]}
