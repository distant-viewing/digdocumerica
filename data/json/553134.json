{"path":"553134.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph capturing a rugged outdoor scene includes large rocks, a colorful object, and a vast landscape backdrop. The foreground prominently features rocky terrain with a variety of stones and boulders, some covered in moss, amid sparse grassy patches. Notably, nestled among these rocks, there is an out-of-place object: a bright, multicolored, curved slide, reminiscent of typical playground equipment.\n\nIn addition to this striking contrast, the middle ground extends to a calm body of water, most likely a lake, underlining the serenity of the scene. This tranquil water is set against gentle undulating hills on the far side, adding depth and a sense of vastness to the composition.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dramatic sky filled with fluffy, textured clouds that cover most of the upper frame, hinting at a large, open environment. This sky adds a dynamic element to the otherwise serene landscape.\n\nOverall, the contrast between the playful, man-made slide and the natural roughness of the wilderness creates a curious juxtaposition, suggesting themes of nature versus human influence or the integration of human elements into natural settings. The setting appears quiet, and there are no visible people or animals, emphasizing the stillness and remoteness of the location.","title":"Man-painted rock, found on a rise at the south end of Pyramid Lake, blends into the natural landscape","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["553135","552900","543721","551520","542583","555592","551553","552685","544341","558083","544392","553994","552894","544750","543552","549151"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["slide","playground","remoteness","integration","addition","serenity","object","rock","boulder","underline"]}
