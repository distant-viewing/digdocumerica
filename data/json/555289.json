{"path":"555289.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The image captures a corner of a room characterized by minimalist and rustic aesthetics. The focus of the photograph is a large wooden structure that appears to be either shelving or ladder-like, leaning against or mounted on a wall. This structure is made of unfinished, raw wood planks and logs, giving it a rugged, handcrafted look. It spans from the floor to the ceiling of the room.\n\nThe room's walls are painted in a light, neutral color, possibly white or a light cream, which contrasts with the natural wood color. The lighting in the room suggests a soft, diffused natural light coming from two visible windows. One window is small and placed near the ceiling on the same wall as the wooden structure, and the other is larger, located on the wall that is perpendicular to the wooden structure. Both windows allow light but not a direct view outside.\n\nThe floor is not completely visible but seems to be in a matching light color, contributing to the room's overall soft and serene ambiance. There are no other furnishings or objects visible in the photograph, which enhances the sense of spaciousness and focus on the architectural and structural elements in the room.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements in the photograph provide a sense of calm and simplicity, focusing on the interplay of light, natural materials, and minimalistic design.","title":"Interior view of an adobe house in Santa Fe, New Mexico converted to solar heating, looking up inside a triangular section of the roof.
