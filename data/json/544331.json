{"path":"544331.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph shows a dramatic and visually engaging scene of industrial work, possibly in a factory or workshop setting. It features two workers in action, both wearing helmets, intensifying the sense of a heavy-duty working environment.\n\nOn the left side, one worker is actively engaged with a large piece of machinery, generating bright, fiery sparks that illuminate the area. This gives the scene a dynamic feel, as the sparks fly with intense oranges and yellows against the overall dark setting. The worker’s face and upper body are mostly hidden by the machinery and darkness, focusing attention on the action of the work being performed.\n\nThe right side of the image shows another worker observing or waiting, positioned further in the background, adding depth to the scene. This worker is also partially shadowed and less distinct, reinforcing the focus on the active work in the foreground.\n\nThe environment is rugged and industrial, as evidenced by the visible grunge on the walls, speckled with rivets and metallic structures. The lighting is moody and atmospheric, dominated by dark tones with hints of red and orange hues from the sparks and machinery, contributing to an almost cinematic quality.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively captures the essence of industrial labor—focused, intense, and enveloped in the rough textures and dramatic lighting of a challenging working environment.","title":"Arizona--near Page","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544316","544018","554918","556866","549695","554931","544001","556269","546023","549693","558304","549694","546036","556391","544053","555955"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["spark","worker","work","machinery","action","rivet","intensify","hide","generate","speckle"]}
