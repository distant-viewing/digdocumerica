{"path":"546546.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a multi-story building framed by silhouetted tree branches during what appears to be twilight. The building has a modern architectural style with a regular grid of balconies and windows; it is primarily horizontal in construction with several vertical elements providing structure. One window in particular stands out, glowing brightly with an internal light, contrasting with the mostly shadowed facade of the rest of the building.\n\nThe sky behind the building has a gradient from a darker bluish hue at the top to a lighter, warmer tone near the horizon, suggesting that the sun has either just set or is close to setting. The foreground is dominated by dark outlines of tree branches and leaves, creating a natural frame around the building and offering an organic contrast to the building's geometric lines. This choice of composition might convey a sense of isolation or highlight the single illuminated window, suggesting occupancy or human presence in an otherwise impersonal structure. \n\nOverall, the image evokes a mood of quiet and solitude, with the warm light from the window serving as a beacon in the encroaching dusk.","title":"Cummins Engine Company, built in 1967","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["553255","550011","545406","553744","555736","555426","549490","550007","548383","556174","546470","546533","549880","546542","548649","543028"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["window","building","branch","choice","balcony","rest","gradient","grid","twilight","outline"]}
