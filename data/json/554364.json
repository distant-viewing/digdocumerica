{"path":"554364.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph features a highly stylized sports car, specifically a Chevrolet Corvette, viewed from the side and slightly angled to show the front. The car has a distinctive paint job: predominantly white, with intricate designs incorporating orange, red, and other colors. There are several decals and logos, including one noticeable \"STP\" logo on the front hood, contributing to a racing aesthetic.\n\nThe hood of the car includes a large black area that seems to be a graphic depiction of an eagle, adding a dynamic element to the vehicle's appearance. Additional graphical elements mimic flames and speed lines, enhancing the sporty and high-energy feel of the car.\n\nThe composition focuses primarily on the car itself. It's parked on what appears to be a street, evident from a portion of another car visible in the background, and a typical street setting visible faintly in the darker areas of the image. The environment is slightly blurred, directing all attention to the brilliantly decorated Corvette.\n\nThe license plate on the back shows \"New York\" indicating the possible location or registration of the vehicle. The overall setting and the car's position suggest that it might be displayed or prepared for an event, likely related to automotive show or race given the car's embellished appearance.","title":"Corvette with decals and swinging paint job","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554384","542640","547494","555922","547722","552803","557052","552787","557709","547797","550152","557847","557878","547954","545328","552804"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","hood","logo","decal","embellish","mimic","job","racing","incorporate","race"]}
