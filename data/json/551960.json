{"path":"551960.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat moody seascape, rendered in hues of purple and pink, suggesting it may be taken at either sunrise or sunset. The scene is maritime in nature, with a large body of water dominating the foreground, its surface gently rippling.\n\nIn the middle distance, a small group of people is engaged in leisurely water activities. Three individuals (two adults and a child) are standing on what appears to be a submerged or floating structure, possibly a walkway or pier, which is mostly covered by the water. The child, on the right side, seems to be cautiously moving along this submerged structure, holding what looks like a line or railing for support. The atmosphere appears casual and recreational.\n\nFurther away, at varying distances on the water, there are several small watercraft. On the left-hand side, there is a speedboat actively moving, creating a slight wake behind it. In the far distance, partially obscured by mist or fog, a larger vessel is visible, hinting at busier water traffic beyond this tranquil scene.\n\nThe sky and the distant horizon blend into a misty expanse, indicating either early morning fog or evening mist, which adds a sense of quiet isolation and beauty to the scene.","title":"Lake Michigan's water is at a record high this year.
