{"path":"544693.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a visually striking scene where a silhouette of a person is set against the glittering, textured surface of a large body of water. The individual is positioned in the lower center of the frame, standing in the water, which stretches out extensively towards a horizon dominated by an urban landscape.\n\nThe water is shimmering, reflecting sunlight, and is textured with waves and ripples, suggesting a windy day or current movements. The foreground of the image shows rougher textures, possibly indicative of debris or foam on the shoreline.\n\nThe background features a distant cityscape which includes a prominent bridge structure that spans across the frame horizontally. This bridge is partially blocked by another structure, adding layers to the cityscape's outline visible against a bright, clear sky.\n\nOverall, the composition uses a contrast of dark and light elements, with the human figure and some parts of the water depicted in dark silhouette which starkly contrasts with the brightly lit water and sky. The image evokes a sense of solitude and the grandeur of nature juxtaposed with urban development.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay Area","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["553788","544709","550237","550937","547960","546865","552261","552717","547112","547147","547217","543893","552263","542804","555731","542981"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["cityscape","bridge","water","silhouette","shimmer","foam","grandeur","block","texture","span"]}
