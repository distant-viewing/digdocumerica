{"path":"555440.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a series of old-fashioned oil lamps arranged in a row. There are four lamps visible, each featuring clear glass chimneys that taper towards their top. The glass chimneys have a slightly yellow tint, enhancing the vintage appearance of the lamps. Below the chimneys, the lamps have metal attachments which connect to the colored glass bases. The bases themselves are notably textured, possibly indicating a crackled glass effect, and filled with oilâ€”three lamps showcase a red-colored oil, while the one on the far left shows a golden hue.\n\nThe lamps are set against a blurry background that hints at an interior setting, most likely a window sill, as suggested by the presence of indistinct architectural forms and light hues that may be buildings or daylight reflecting on other surfaces. The image exudes a warm, nostalgic vibe, possibly evoking memories of times when such lamps were commonly used for lighting before the advent of electric lighting. The mood is quaint and serene, emphasized by the soft focus and gentle lighting.","title":"Kerosene lamps such as these in a business window, became best sellers during the energy crisis in the pacific northwest during the fall and winter of 1973-1974","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555441","555471","555429","555428","543702","543696","556016","558025","546496","557134","550031","557756","549709","554784","543041","548561"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["lamps","oil","chimney","glass","lamp","sill","attachment","basis","memory","taper"]}
