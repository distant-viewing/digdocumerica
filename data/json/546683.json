{"path":"546683.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts two men standing in front of a helicopter on an asphalt surface. The background features a large hangar building with the number \"8\" prominently displayed. Overhead, the rotor blades of the helicopter slightly cross the top frame of the image.\n\nThe man on the left is dressed in a police uniform, consisting of a light blue shirt with shoulder epaulets and a black tie. He has a badge on his left chest and a name tag on the right. His belt holds various equipment including a holster, and he wears tall black boots. His expression is serious and his posture is upright.\n\nThe man on the right wears civilian clothes: a white turtleneck sweater under a light beige sweater and black trousers. His style is casual yet neat, and he carries a pair of sunglasses in his left hand and a cigarette in the other. He has a more relaxed posture and a slight smile.\n\nThe helicopter situated between them appears to be small, possibly a two-seater, with a visible metallic frame and partially see-through canopy. It looks utilitarian and compact, likely used for patrol or surveillance given its context and the presence of the police officer.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of professional interaction, possibly between a police officer and a civilian collaborator or guest, set against the functional backdrop of a helicopter used in law enforcement activities.","title":"Police helicopter officers prepare to take off for regular traffic broadcast.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546688","552383","555825","552366","542576","548911","545642","552370","545638","552393","552365","545637","542757","556847","546675","546637"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["helicopter","police","officer","sweater","guest","surveillance","rotor","enforcement","turtleneck","law"]}
