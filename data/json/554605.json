{"path":"554605.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene natural scene, showcasing a dam built by beavers in a wooded wetland area. In the foreground, there is a body of water reflecting the sky and trees, bordered by dense vegetation and overhanging grass. The dam itself is constructed from an array of sticks, branches, and mud, stretching across the image from the left to the right-hand side, partially submerged and bisecting the watery landscape.\n\nThe background features a variety of trees, primarily conifers, with rich green foliage which provides a lush backdrop to the scene. The environment appears to be relatively undisturbed, suggesting a remote or protected natural area. The sky is overcast, giving the image a soft, diffuse light which enhances the tranquility and natural beauty of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is balanced, with natural elements such as water, flora, and the handiwork of beavers combining to create a harmonious and peaceful woodland scene. The image captures the quiet and industrious life of beavers and the pristine condition of their habitat.","title":"Small beaver dam in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554607","554606","549486","550222","553137","547526","545008","553465","550786","554525","550351","550654","558009","549639","548870","544765"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["dam","stick","conifer","mud","flora","wetland","habitat","array","branch","tranquility"]}
