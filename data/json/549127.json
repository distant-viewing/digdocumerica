{"path":"549127.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The image features an expansive outdoor scene dominated by construction activity. In the foreground, there is a field of wild yellow flowering plants, possibly a type of mustard or wildflower, which contrasts with the industrial setting in the background. These wildflowers, growing sparsely among patches of dried grass and bare soil, add a touch of natural environment to the scene.\n\nThe middle and background areas are predominantly occupied by a large construction site. In the midst of this site, a massive skeletal framework of what appears to be a building or an industrial structure under construction is visible. The structure features multiple levels of steel girders and cross-beams, supported by scaffolding and temporary structures for construction aid. Two cranes are visible; one can be seen directly beside the building structure, possibly engaged in lifting materials while the construction progresses.\n\nThe horizon shows a flat and largely barren landscape typical of a large-scale construction or industrial zone. You can see some vehicles and equipment scattered around the site, hinting at ongoing construction work. The sky is partly cloudy, providing a vibrant blue backdrop with patches of white clouds that float lazily above the busy construction scene. This setting suggests a dynamic yet stark contrast between industry and nature.","title":"350 megawatt power plant under construction at Colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549166","549640","544167","549169","547235","543913","549128","544523","553391","550274","546170","553453","554809","545648","543109","545070"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","wildflower","site","girder","mustard","aid","scaffolding","midst","structure","patch"]}
