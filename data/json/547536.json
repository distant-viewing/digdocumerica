{"path":"547536.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph displays a serene natural scene centered on a calm body of water, likely a pond or lake. In the foreground, a pathway formed by a cut through tall, dense grass leads directly to the water. The vegetation is lush and probably wet, creating a rich texture and a feeling of denseness. At the vanishing point of the path, the water reflects the light, highlighting a small, round, bush-like formation on the water surface which could be aquatic plants or a tiny isle of vegetation.\n\nIn the middle ground, the water takes up most of the space and reflects the sky and surrounding trees on the opposite shore. The sky, not directly visible, hints at a bright, clear day from its reflection on the water’s surface. The tree line in the background encircles the pond, enhancing the secluded and tranquil feel of the scene. The trees have dense foliage, suggesting that the season is either late spring or summer. The overall composition of the image—leading lines of the grass pathway into the reflective water and solitary vegetation—creates a quiet, contemplative mood, typical of natural landscapes.","title":"Tiverton salt marsh","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["558094","546963","554776","550750","558093","553410","550345","550784","554603","543611","554623","555215","550778","543561","554527","550779"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pond","water","pathway","vegetation","cut","grass","line","spring","summer","surface"]}
