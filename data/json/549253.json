{"path":"549253.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph shows an aerial view of a landscape, which appears to be agricultural fields. The fields are segmented into long, narrow strips that run vertically in the frame. The strips are colored in varying shades of greens, browns, and mauves, indicating different types of crops or variations in soil or crop health. The textures within each strip suggest different stages of growth or types of agriculture practices. Some areas within the strips are darker, possibly indicating wetter soil or shadows cast by clouds overhead. The overall pattern created by the fields is rhythmic and exhibits a patchwork-like appearance. The image does not include any visible buildings, people, or machinery, emphasizing a natural and expansive agricultural environment. The colors are somewhat muted, adding to the serene, almost abstract quality of the composition.","title":"Farmlands such as these will be affected by strip-mining and the diversion of water required by the mines and power plants.","placename":"Montana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549094","557517","542517","558414","542708","553047","553977","552858","547684","548907","542710","554029","548908","553973","553972","553668"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["strip","crop","field","soil","type","patchwork","health","practice","agriculture","variation"]}
