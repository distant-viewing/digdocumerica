{"path":"549520.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph is an aerial shot that shows a scenic, narrow strip of land jutting into a large body of blue water. The landmass is surrounded by the water on both sides and consists of two main parts: a green, forested area on the left and a more structured area with pathways and constructed barriers on the right side.\n\nOn the right side of the strip, a long, narrow pathway extends towards the sea, likely a man-made pier or jetty, which is being used by several ships. There are ships positioned along this jetty, visible as small, dark figures against the lighter color of the sea. The jetty stretches into the water and has smaller perpendicular sections extending towards the open sea, possibly for docking or control purposes.\n\nThe surrounding water has varying shades of blue, indicating different depths or variations in the sea bottom. The green area is dense with trees and vegetation, showing no signs of human construction, providing a natural contrast to the developed right side of the strip.\n\nThe overall view is peaceful and serene, suggesting this could be a coastal location used for both leisure (given the natural preserve) and industrial (as indicated by the pier and ships) activities. The photograph encapsulates a balance between human activity and natural beauty.","title":"Niagara River, at GRand Isle across from North Tonowanda shows water discoloration from industrial wastes.","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["554022","552000","548604","556966","548638","548777","549504","545024","556924","556905","548779","545128","551574","543053","552234","550342"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["jetty","strip","sea","ship","pier","pathway","landmass","docking","side","balance"]}
