{"path":"551358.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph showcases an intricate array of cave formations. The primary features in the image are stalagmites and stalactites, captured in a cave environment. The formations are richly textured and appear rugged, with many ridges and grooves. The color palette is dominated by earth tones, ranging from deep browns to lighter beige and cream colors.\n\nIn the backdrop, there is a slightly illuminated cave wall which helps to enhance the depth and amplifies the contours of the formations. The foreground is dominated by a large, glossy stalagmite that has a bulbous and somewhat smooth surface compared to the sharper, more jagged features of the surrounding stalactites.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is focused and soft, casting gentle shadows and highlighting the moisture on the cave formations, which gives them a shimmering effect. This selective lighting adds a mysterious or exploration-themed ambiance to the image.\n\nOverall, the composition and the close-up perspective provide a detailed look at the natural beauty and complexity of geological formations within a cave, emphasizing texture, form, and color.","title":"Flowstone \"veils\" climb nearly 40 feet towards the ceiling in Bridal Cave near Camdenton.
