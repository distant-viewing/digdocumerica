{"path":"551671.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor music festival scene. In the foreground, a large crowd of people is gathered, most of whom are standing and facing a stage. The crowd appears diverse, with many people wearing casual summer attire. There is a noticeable density of individuals, suggesting a popular event.\n\nThe stage is set up in the middle ground of the photo. It is a large, covered platform with several musicians and performers visibly engaged in a performance, though the specific details of their activity cannot be discerned from this distance. The banner on the stage identifies the event as the \"Schaefer Music Festival.\"\n\nIn the background, the city skyline features prominently, providing a stark contrast to the foreground activity. The skyline includes several recognizable high-rise buildings, which suggest the event is likely occurring in a large urban setting. The architecture includes both historical and modern elements, indicative of a well-developed, densely populated area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, framed with the urban skyline in the backdrop and an active music event in the foreground, captures the vibrant energy typically encountered in such city-based festivals. The environment suggests it might be late afternoon or early evening given the soft lighting and shadows.","title":"Large audience at a concert by singer Judy Collins at the Schaefer Bandstand in Central Park.
