{"path":"544665.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene evening sailing scene. In the foreground, three sailboats are spread out across a calm body of water, each manned by a single individual. The sails are prominently displayed, catching the light of the setting sun, with visible inscriptions that include \"RUSS 746\" and \"SEARS 6844\".\n\nThe background features an industrial skyline with silhouettes of cranes and various structures, likely a dock or port area. This urban backdrop contrasts with the tranquility of the water activity.\n\nThe sky is dramatically painted with hues of orange, pink, and purple amidst patches of blue, suggesting it is either sunrise or sunset. This atmospheric condition adds a peaceful yet vibrant dimension to the scene. The overall composition blends elements of human activity, industrial life, and natural beauty, creating a compelling visual narrative.","title":"Sailboat race","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["550758","548117","544669","556190","552293","544697","543305","552346","544717","550754","552347","548118","552345","544661","543119","545026"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["inscription","dimension","sailing","port","sunrise","sail","sailboat","narrative","sunset","crane"]}
