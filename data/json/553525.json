{"path":"553525.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment between two young girls sharing a plate of cake. Both girls appear to be seated on a couch or a similar type of seating, deeply engaged in the act of eating the cake. The girl on the left, wearing a graphic white t-shirt and striped red-and-white pants, is holding the plate and also appears to be speaking or reacting with a slightly open mouth, her expression lively. The girl on the right, in a plain white t-shirt and dark pants, is focused intently on using a fork to eat the cake from the shared plate.\n\nThe background is minimally visible, showing a plain wall with a visible pipe and some imperfections on the wallâ€™s surface, possibly indicating an indoor, residential setting. The lighting is dim yet focuses effectively on the central activity and the subjects, enhancing the intimate and casual atmosphere of the scene. The overall feeling is one of a shared, everyday moment between two children, possibly siblings or close friends, enjoying a simple pleasure together.","title":"Sandy Watkins, 12, shares a piece of cake with her older sister Bertha, 14, in the living room of their Mulky Square house.
