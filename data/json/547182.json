{"path":"547182.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of destruction and isolation. A small child dressed in a striking red jacket and red hat is sitting on a pile of large, broken concrete slabs. The concrete appears heavily fractured and uneven, suggesting significant force was involved in their displacement, such as might occur during a natural disaster.\n\nThe child is alone, facing away from the camera towards a chaotic landscape. Bits of ice or debris are scattered across and around the slabs, reflecting the sunlight and adding to the overall stark and cold ambiance of the setting. In the background, partially blurred, there are remnants of buildings or structures, further communicating a sense of devastation. \n\nThe overall composition conveys a poignant contrast between the vivid red clothing of the child and the grey, desolate destruction surrounding them. It captures a moment that might suggest themes of resilience, vulnerability, or solitude amidst a landscape of chaos.","title":"Zion's lakefront road was washed out by waves from lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["552758","543496","552747","553476","552822","553495","556164","557351","555398","552960","551964","550263","545539","547982","542863","547653"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["slab","destruction","child","concrete","vulnerability","devastation","chaos","broken","disaster","ice"]}
