{"path":"554271.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a group of three men outdoors during a sunny winter day, evident from the snowy atmosphere around them. The man to the left is dressed in a black leather jacket adorned with patches, a striped shirt underneath, and sunglasses. His shaggy hair and rugged attire suggest a casual, possibly rock 'n' roll inspired style.\n\nThe middle man, next to him, wears a full black ensemble that includes a puffy winter coat and tinted goggles, giving him a sleek, slightly mysterious appearance. He appears to be in a conversation with the man on the left as he is gazing in his direction with his hands gesturing towards a silver flask he holds.\n\nThe man on the right stands out with his vibrant green skiing outfit complete with a matching green hat, which, along with his goggles, suggests he is prepared for skiing. His posture, hands on his hips and a somewhat displeased expression, conveys a sense of impatience or disagreement in the conversation or situation.\n\nThe background is blurred, but patches of snow, bare trees, and hints of architectural structures suggest an outdoor, probably mountainous location typical of a ski resort. The lighting is natural, with shadows indicating the sunâ€™s position high and possibly behind the subjects, giving a soft glow and highlighting the figures against the darker backdrop.","title":"Gathering at a pub for some apres ski refreshment","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["543506","555287","554228","548029","554259","548154","557145","548038","548032","554273","545088","545672","554277","554267","554221","554261"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["goggle","winter","man","roll","flask","ensemble","conversation","skiing","hip","ski"]}
