{"path":"550301.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph depicts a collection of old wooden barrels, jumbled and piled on top of each other in a disordered fashion. The barrels vary in size, color, and state of repair. Some are small and resemble buckets, while others are more elongated, typical of traditional barrels. Their colors range from light to dark tones of brown, and many show signs of wear and weathering, such as chipped wood and fading.\n\nOn the surfaces of several barrels, faded markings and stamps can be seen, suggesting that they were once used for commercial purposes, possibly for storing liquids like wine or spirits. The details on them are barely legible due to wear and age.\n\nThe barrels are stacked haphazardly, with some standing upright and others lying on their sides. The scene has a cluttered appearance, indicating they may be discarded or stored in a warehouse or similar location. There does not appear to be any active usage of the barrels in the scene, nor is there a specific structured arrangement visible.\n\nThe background is dark and nondescript, further emphasizing the barrels as the central subject of the photograph. The lighting is subdued, casting shadows and further accentuating the textures and aged character of the wood. This setting and composition evoke a sense of abandonment and the passage of time, reflecting objects that have seemingly outlived their original purpose.","title":"Herring Barrels at the packing plant in eastport","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["552884","546000","546004","552885","555277","546691","552883","543806","543762","542494","547506","556324","552248","557134","555167","555144"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["barrels","barrel","jumble","purpose","upright","wood","spirit","storing","cluttered","do"]}
