{"path":"552573.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic and pastoral scene likely taken at dusk, given the subdued and warm lighting conditions. The setting is an open field bordered by a wooden corral fence, typical of rural or farm landscapes. In the background, there is a lone yellow truck parked beside the fence and a single brown horse equipped with a saddle, standing calmly near some rustic wooden barrels.\n\nIn the foreground, three individuals wearing cowboy hats are engaged in an activity involving sheep. One of these individuals, centrally located, is squatting while holding onto a sheep lying on a red blanket. To the right, another individual, also squatting, appears to be assisting or learning, and is closely observing or handling the sheep. The third person, who is slightly bent over and partially obscured behind the other two, seems to be either guiding or instructing.\n\nThe environment looks lush with patches of grass and the overall ambience indicates a typical farm activity, possibly related to animal husbandry or veterinary care in a rural setting. The natural, cool tones of the grass contrast with the warmer tones emitted by the artificial lighting, creating a vivid and authentic rural tableau.","title":"Three generations of Oldlands have ranched on Piceance Creek. In the summer they move 15 miles south to their cow camp, and their cattle graze on higher lands owned by the Bureau of Land Management and private oil companies.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552568","554894","554885","553107","554880","544391","552575","543686","553106","553108","554882","554881","554949","554886","543779","552567"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["sheep","farm","fence","saddle","learning","tableau","individual","cowboy","ambience","blanket"]}
