{"path":"544310.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a warm, family moment outside a house. The setting is a sunny day with a partly cloudy sky.\n\nForeground:\n- In the lower part of the image, various children's playthings are scattered on a concrete surface. These include a yellow bicycle with a banana seat, a small red wagon, and a metal toy lantern resting beside a black ball. Just behind these toys is a curb that separates the paved area from a water body likely a canal or bay.\n\nMiddle ground:\n- A family of three is standing on the porch of a house. There is a young girl with long blonde hair and a smile, wearing a blue blouse. She stands next to a younger child whose face is partially obscured as the child looks away from the camera, held in the arms of a man. The man, presumably their father, is shirtless and wearing blue shorts. He has tanned skin and is grinning at the camera.\n\nBackground:\n- The house behind the family has a porch with white railings and a couple of chairs visible. There is a set of decorative hanging plants. The architectural style of the house suggests a warm, tropical location, possibly near the water given the presence of a dock-like structure in the right of the image.\n- Further in the background and to the right, another house is seen, showing that this setting might be part of a residential neighborhood near the water. \n\nOverall Atmosphere:\n- The scene is lively, colorful, and gives a sense of leisure and domestic happiness, with toys indicating the presence of children and the homes providing a comfortable, scenic living environment. The casual attire and toys suggest a relaxed, outdoor family life.","title":"Family living on houseboat","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["553498","548312","547135","547398","557361","557933","557677","547391","546897","556531","551129","543540","551130","543538","556525","551004"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["toy","family","house","child","porch","father","happiness","lantern","tan","ball"]}
