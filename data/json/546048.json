{"path":"546048.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph presents a somewhat somber and contemplative scene. The composition involves three key elements arranged in a vertical fashion. On the right side of the image, dominating the frame is the silhouette of a church spire or steeple, topped with a simple, unadorned cross. This structure is set against a dusky, possibly polluted sky, with hues ranging from dark purple to a muted pink and blue, suggesting it could either be dawn or twilight.\n\nTo the left, juxtaposing the church steeple, is a thick, billowing plume of dark smoke emitting from a tall, industrial chimney. The smoke rises robustly into the sky, spreading and dissipating as it ascends, contributing to the ominous or polluted appearance of the sky.\n\nThe silhouette of the church spire combined with the industrial chimney and the smoke suggests themes of contrast â€” possibly between nature and industry, or purity and pollution. The overall mood is quite dramatic and possibly carries a message about environmental impact or the intersection of human progress and nature. There is no visible human activity in the photograph, reinforcing the focus on these symbolic structures and their environmental and possibly spiritual implications.","title":"The Kaiser aluminum plant smokestack, behind the Catholic church, belches fumes over the residential area in the Chalmette section.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546047","546031","545250","552188","545239","545446","546042","557299","546466","547542","557381","546451","545439","547090","545873","550821"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["church","steeple","spire","smoke","chimney","implication","silhouette","cross","progress","pink"]}
