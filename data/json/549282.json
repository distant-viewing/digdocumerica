{"path":"549282.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a scene where three people are overlooking a panoramic view of a residential area from a grassy hilltop. The three individuals, all males, are dressed casually. The man on the right is clad in a pink long-sleeve shirt and jeans, while the two men on the left are wearing jackets, one in black and the other in dark blue, along with trousers.\n\nThe vantage point offers a sweeping view of a densely packed neighborhood consisting of rows of white houses with dark roofs, suggesting a suburban setting. Apart from the residential area, the background further extends to show a broad river or estuary with some industrial structures visible along the distant shore, including large buildings and smokestacks, indicating the presence of industrial activity.\n\nOn the horizon, the sky is overcast, casting a muted light over the scene, which complements the peaceful yet slightly somber mood conveyed by the men gazing into the distance. The entire setting suggests a moment of reflection or observation, as the individuals seem engrossed in the view before them. The foreground of the image includes patches of grass and wildflowers, adding a touch of natural beauty to the scene.","title":"From a hill at orient heights near the northern (revere) boundary of East Boston, anthony bruno, john briganti, and joseph porzio point out how Logan airport dominates the landscape","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["545088","556356","543657","557659","542579","549283","553909","551525","547217","555546","545511","557440","546803","555287","557429","548334"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["hilltop","black","wildflower","overlook","observation","male","man","view","complement","gaze"]}
