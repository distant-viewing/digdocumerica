{"path":"547726.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is a serene and beautifully colored photograph depicting two birds, likely wading birds such as storks or sandpipers, standing in shallow water. The entire scene is bathed in a deep, warm orange hue, suggesting it was taken during sunrise or sunset. The orange light beautifully reflects on the water, enhancing the silhouettes of the birds and adding a mirror-like effect where the birds' reflections are visible just below them.\n\nThe background is minimal, dominated by the orange gradient of the sky and water, which blends together almost seamlessly at the horizon. On the right side of the image, some delicate, thin grass or reeds are present, blurred and overlapping into the foreground, adding a sense of depth and a natural element framing the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition, with its focus on the form of the birds and the simplicity of the elements, creates a peaceful and contemplative mood. The use of silhouette and color are central to the picture's emotional and visual impact, capturing a quiet moment in nature with elegance and minimalism.","title":"Marshland birds at the Lake Havasu National Wildlife Refuge","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548832","557448","550388","543063","553777","557495","554069","547744","553776","544612","554067","550382","545991","544605","543284","544601"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","elegance","overlap","wade","silhouette","reed","sunrise","gradient","simplicity","bathe"]}
