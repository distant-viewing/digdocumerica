{"path":"553717.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In the photograph, a person and a horse are prominently featured. The person, appearing to be male, is dressed in a white long-sleeve shirt and white pants, complemented by a wide-brimmed hat adorned with greenery. They are also draped in a leafy garland around their neck. The individual is handling the reins of the horse and seems to be looking down slightly, his face partially obscured by the shadow of his hat.\n\nThe horse itself is gray with noticeable embellishments. It has ornate bridle accessories and a headpiece that matches the ceremonial look, decorated with similar leafy garlands adorning its head, neck, and mane. The saddle is not fully visible, but appears to be equipped with additional decorative elements, potentially white to match the rider's outfit.\n\nThe background of the image is unfocused but hints at a natural, outdoor setting with bright lighting, suggesting it could be a sunny day. The blurred greenery in the backdrop suggests a potentially tropical or lush setting. The overall composition and attire suggest that this might be part of a cultural or ceremonial event, where both horse and rider are formally presented or participating in a procession.","title":"Costumed for Aloha Day parade, one of many festivities during annual Aloha Week.
