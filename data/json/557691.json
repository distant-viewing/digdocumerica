{"path":"557691.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, somewhat misty rural or semi-rural scene, likely taken during or just after a rain given the wet surfaces visible. The main subject is a dark wooden cabin on the right, featuring a steep pitched roof and a visible front porch with what appears to be a small railing. The cabin is surrounded by lush green foliage and is set against a background of dense trees, adding a feeling of a secluded woodland retreat.\n\nTo the left of the cabin and in the background, there is a paved road with a sidewalk running alongside it. A red vintage car, possibly from the mid-20th century, is parked on the side of the road, adding a touch of historical or aesthetic interest to the scene. The road and sidewalk appear wet, reflecting the overcast sky and further contributing to the picture's moody ambiance.\n\nIn the foreground, the image is rich with greeneryâ€”an assortment of bushes, leaves, and possibly small plants, which appear thriving and healthy. The photo's left side shows a utility pole that adds a hint of human infrastructure, contrasted sharply against the natural elements dominating the composition. \n\nOverall, the scene is peaceful and quaint, evoking a sense of quiet and simplicity, possibly suggesting a moment paused in time away from the haste of modern life.","title":"One of the units of the alpine river lodge on river street in helen, Georgia, near robertstown.
