{"path":"545309.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a group of small, ball-shaped cacti, possibly belonging to the genus Mammillaria. The cactus bodies are densely covered with white spines, providing a stark contrast to the arid, somewhat sandy background typically seen in a desert environment. One prominent and vivid cactus flower, with layered red-orange petals surrounding a central cluster of yellow stamens, stands out amidst the spiny, greenish plant bodies. The bloom adds a splash of vibrant color to the otherwise muted tones of the scene. The lighting appears natural, indicating that the photo might have been taken outdoors under clear conditions, enhancing the details and colors of the cactus and its flower.","title":"Barrel cactus in bloom.
