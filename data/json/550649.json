{"path":"550649.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic, natural outdoor setting featuring a river landscape. In the foreground, there is a vintage green station wagon parked on a grassy area near the riverbank. Two individuals, likely a woman and a man, are near the car; the woman appears to be engaged in an activity with the car's hood open, possibly checking the engine or looking at something inside the car, while the man seems to be standing beside her, facing the river.\n\nThe river itself is wide and has visible currents, suggesting it may be a fast-flowing body of water. Surrounding the river are dense woods, indicating a remote or rural area. The trees are lush and green, implying that the photo was taken during spring or summer.\n\nIn the background, low hills or mountains can be seen, covered with similarly dense forestation, under a partly cloudy sky that suggests a bright, pleasant day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the interaction near the car juxtaposed against the backdrop of a natural landscape, creates a narrative that might suggest travel, exploration, or a pause in a journey to enjoy nature.","title":"Vacationers wax their car at the \"13-mile woods\" camping area near errol, close to the headwaters of the androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["544389","552119","546093","543716","553133","554684","548752","544641","542862","551538","542735","548185","548306","554835","545596","550977"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","car","forestation","pause","journey","hood","current","engine","wagon","check"]}
