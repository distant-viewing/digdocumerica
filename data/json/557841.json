{"path":"557841.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving a vintage car and two people. The car appears to be a classic model from the 1960s or 1970s, featuring a long, angular body and a shiny, dark paint job, possibly black or deep blue. It has a white roof that contrasts with the dark color of the main body. The car's rear features a distinctive, slightly protruding design around the taillights and a broad bumper.\n\nThere are two individuals interacting at the driver's side of the car. The person outside the car is a man, dressed in a light-colored uniform that suggests he might be a police officer or security personnel. He is standing and seems to be either conversing with the driver or checking something at the driver's side window. The driver, only partially visible through the car window, has light-colored hair and seems to be facing forward, likely engaging with the other man.\n\nThe setting appears to be a residential street, with a glimpse of a house visible in the background. The house, partially obstructed by the car, seems typical of mid-20th-century suburban architecture with a visible front porch. The environment suggests a serene, daylight setting with clear skies. The entire scene emanates a calm yet slightly official or formal air, possibly depicting a routine check or an amicable roadside discussion.","title":"City employee hired by the Norwood, Ohio, Public Works Department, greets a motorist ready to enter the safety lane at the auto emission inspection station.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557865","546661","555475","557874","552412","557900","551941","557850","557878","550152","552795","546611","546654","547185","557766","557864"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["driver","car","check","obstruct","job","personnel","security","bumper","officer","police"]}
