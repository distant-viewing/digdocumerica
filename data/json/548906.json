{"path":"548906.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast desert landscape dominated by a series of large sand dunes under a clear sky. The dunes are characterized by their smooth, undulating forms that create a textured and shadowed surface due to the low angle of the sunlight. The shadows accentuate the contours of the sand dunes, highlighting their soft, curvy nature.\n\nProminently featured in the image are railroad tracks that cut straight through the desert, contrasting dramatically with the natural, sinuous patterns of the sand dunes. The tracks are composed of two parallel steel rails mounted on wooden ties, stretching into the distance and disappearing at the horizon. This convergence creates a sense of depth and perspective in the image.\n\nThe background consists of a flat horizon line which meets a clear sky, suggesting the remote and uninhabited nature of the region. The overall color tone of the image is warm, with shades of orange, brown, and purple, likely due to the time of day during which the photo was takenâ€”a time that suggests either sunrise or sunset.\n\nThere are no people or moving objects visible in the scene, emphasizing the stillness and isolation of this desert environment. The composition and lighting of the photograph create a serene yet stark depiction of a desolate, natural landscape interrupted by the presence of human-made infrastructure.","title":"The all-american canal carries Colorado river water through the sand dunes of the western part of the imperial valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547717","548897","553058","545203","545199","550490","543097","549037","555883","544415","545575","545604","552923","545200","545207","555887"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["dune","desert","sand","track","disappear","interrupt","railroad","time","depiction","sunrise"]}
