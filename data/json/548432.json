{"path":"548432.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a large parking lot filled with numerous cars. The image showcases a diverse array of vehicle designs and colors, including shades of red, blue, white, black, and brown. The cars are mostly parked in organized rows, although some areas have vehicles arranged in a more scattered fashion.\n\nA prominent feature in the image is a small tower or booth located centrally among the cars, possibly serving as a parking attendant's booth or a hub for parking management.\n\nThe lot itself is made of concrete with visible cracks and patches, suggesting it is well-used. The layout of the parking area is designed to maximize the number of cars it can accommodate. There are no visible signs of people or activity apart from the stationary cars, and the photograph is taken during the daytime under clear, bright lighting conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on the geometric arrangement and variety of cars, providing a sense of orderly congestion typical of crowded parking spaces.","title":"Parking lot at Logan Airport.
