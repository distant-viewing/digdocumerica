{"path":"543221.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a busy day at Santa Cruz Public Fishing Pier, as indicated by the signage in the foreground of the image. The sign, in large bold letters, reads “Santa Cruz Public Fishing Pier” and includes further details such as the pier being rebuilt in 1962 by the Wildlife Conservation Board, Department of Fish and Game, State of California, and is operated by the City of Santa Cruz.\n\nIn front of the sign stands a conspicuously vibrant totem pole decorated with various figures and symbols including a fish and what appears to be faces or masks, rendered in bold and bright colors. Above the totem pole are clear blue skies.\n\nThe setting is a public area likely close to the pier, as suggested by the presence of bicycles, strollers, and public parking meters. Various people can be seen around the area engaging in different activities. Some are seated, talking or looking around, while others are walking or standing, possibly observing the totem pole or reading the information on the sign. The composition conveys a leisurely, bustling day by the pier with visitors and locals enjoying the open, scenic environment next to the ocean, which is visible in the background.\n\nThe environment is further characterized by modern features such as street lamps and other infrastructure, suggesting a well-maintained and frequented public space. The overall atmosphere is lively and sunny, reflective of a typical day out near the water in Santa Cruz.","title":"California--Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["545154","548529","551711","545176","548188","542812","543210","546928","548189","550850","545061","546998","543361","547836","548533","552291"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["pier","pole","stroller","local","mask","meter","sign","standing","symbol","information"]}
