{"path":"554950.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and pastoral scene, likely in a setting devoted to agricultural or farm activities. The image features two men and a cow. The man in the foreground, who seems older and wearing a cap, denim jacket, and plaid shirt, is engaged in grooming or treating the cow. This man holds a large tool, possibly for grooming or medical treatment, directed towards the head of the cow, which is secured with ropes. His expression is one of concentration and care.\n\nThe cow, prominently placed in the center, has a calm demeanor despite the treatment, showcasing a gentle interaction between man and animal. The cow's fur is predominantly dark with a white pattern around its nose and face.\n\nIn the background, another man, appearing slightly younger and also wearing a cap, observes the activity. He is partially framed by a wooden structure, perhaps serving as a pen or stable gate, lending an air of supportive oversight or awaiting his turn to assist.\n\nThe background environment indicates a rural setting with open spaces, suggested by the visible trees and softly lit surroundings, indicating either early morning or late evening light that adds a warm hue to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights not only agricultural labor but also the cooperation and care involved in managing livestock, presented within a serene, natural setting.","title":"Cow on a farm near Leakey, being de-horned.
