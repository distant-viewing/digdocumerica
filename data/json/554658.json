{"path":"554658.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view featuring a large paddle steamboat named \"MINNE-HA-HA\" docked at a pier on a body of water, likely a lake, given the calmness of the water and the natural landscape surrounding it. The steamboat is an elaborate multi-deck vessel adorned with multiple white railings, decorative elements and flags, including a prominent American flag at the stern. It exhibits a traditional design with a red paddle wheel visible on its side, which is characteristic of classic steam-powered boats. Smoke can be seen emitting from its small, black funnel, indicating that the boat is operational.\n\nIn the background, the landscape consists of lush, green hills or low mountains, suggesting a peaceful, natural setting. The sky is clear with some clouds, contributing to the vibrant, colorful backdrop. Along the shore, various structures and signs are visible; one sign reads \"Cruise Ship\" and another beneath it indicates \"NEXT BOAT 1:30.\" This suggests that the location is a commercial or touristic dock offering boat rides to visitors. There are also several people on and around the boat, likely passengers or crew, dressed in casual attire appropriate for a leisurely day out.\n\nOverall, the setting appears serene and picturesque, typical of a recreational boating area tailored for sightseeing and excursions in a natural environment. The steamboat adds a historical or traditional flavor to the scene, highlighting a form of transportation from a bygone era still cherished in modern times for its nostalgic appeal.","title":"Large sightseeing steamer \"minnehaha\" docked on Lake George","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["554657","545736","543972","543964","545917","543959","543971","543962","543967","543963","549509","543966","550825","543955","543954","545732"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","paddle","flag","sightseeing","tailor","emitting","dock","funnel","excursion","cruise"]}
