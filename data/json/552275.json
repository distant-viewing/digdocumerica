{"path":"552275.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph exhibits two inflatable boats on a body of water, which appears to be a lake or a calm sea. In the larger grey inflatable boat on the right, there are four individuals; two of them seem to be prepping or discussing something, while the other two are looking out towards the water, possibly observing the surrounding area or another boat. The smaller, orange inflatable boat on the left holds two individuals wearing dive suits and equipped with diving tanks, suggesting they are prepared for or returning from a dive.\n\nA significant aspect of the image is the presence of a warning sign posted on a wooden post emerging from the water. The sign reads \"UNDERWATER PARK, NO BOATING WITHIN 100 FEET,\" indicating that the area maybe a designated zone for underwater activities, likely explaining the presence of divers and special precautions in boating.\n\nThe background features a stretch of rocky shoreline that provides a natural boundary to the water body. The overall atmosphere is active yet serene, highlighted by the clear skies and the calm state of the water, creating a picturesque outdoor scene signaling a focus on water-related activities and possibly environmental conservation within an underwater park.","title":"Divers at underwater park near ferry dock at Edmonds","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["549939","548736","555833","544006","552316","552982","546352","544770","543881","552283","547548","545969","549934","548882","546349","548054"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","dive","precaution","water","diver","diving","boating","warning","stretch","foot"]}
