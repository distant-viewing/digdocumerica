{"path":"546900.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a large parking lot densely packed with hundreds of cars from an elevated perspective. The cars appear to be mostly sedans and station wagons typical of late 20th-century American design, ranging in color from bright yellows and reds to more subdued whites and blues. Several cars have prices marked on their windshields, suggesting that this may be a sales lot or an auction setting. \n\nThe vehicles are closely packed, filling nearly the entire frame of the photo. The background shows a glimpse of an industrial area with identifiable elements like cargo cranes, suggesting that this location might be near a port or shipping facility. A large spherical structure can also be seen in the distance, possibly a water tower or storage tank, typical of industrial areas.\n\nThe sky is overcast with a diffused light, casting soft shadows and contributing to the overall gray tone of the environment, emphasizing the multitude of cars. The uniformity and the vastness of the scene provide a strong visual impact, emphasizing the scale of the car lot and its industrial setting.","title":"AutoMobiles on the docks at dundalk marine terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["547480","547469","547686","542635","546813","546879","553303","548432","549696","546685","556790","554349","556721","556197","549875","547742"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["lot","car","uniformity","price","windshield","multitude","shipping","wagon","sale","port"]}
