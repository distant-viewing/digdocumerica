{"path":"554905.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a young woman in an outdoor setting, engaging in smoking. The woman is positioned in the center of the frame, looking directly at the camera with a serious expression, and she is smoking what appears to be a hand-rolled cigarette or a joint.\n\nShe has long, light brown hair that is casually styled, part of it falling over her right shoulder. Her attire includes a checkered, button-up flannel shirt. She is wearing at least two rings, visible on her left hand, which she uses to hold the cigarette.\n\nThe background suggests a serene, natural environment featuring large trees with dense foliage and a calm body of water, possibly a river or lake, slightly visible behind her. The soft, natural lighting combined with the tranquil setting conveys a relaxed, albeit moody atmosphere.","title":"Teenage girl smoking pot in cedar woods while on an outing with friends near Leakey, Texas.
