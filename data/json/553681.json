{"path":"553681.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling city street viewed from an elevated perspective. The shot captures multiple lanes of traffic, densely packed with a variety of vehicles including cars, buses, and trucks. The scene is bathed in the shadows and light contrasts typical of early morning or late afternoon, suggesting the image was either taken during rush hour or when the sun was positioned low in the sky.\n\nThe lanes are marked clearly with white lines, and the road is busy yet orderly, with all vehicles aligned neatly within their respective lanes. Each vehicle casts a long shadow, accentuating the direction of the light and adding depth to the image. The diversity of vehicle types and sizes adds a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nIn the background, the urban environment is hinted at by the presence of trees lining the street and what appear to be parking meters and other street furniture. There is also a glimpse of pedestrians, which provides a sense of scale and liveliness to the urban setting.\n\nThe composition's focus on the patterned arrangement of the vehicles and the play of light and shadow across the scene create a graphic, almost abstract quality. The image illustrates the busy rhythm of city life, capturing a moment of everyday urban activity in a way that feels both dynamic and structured.","title":"Kalakaua avenue is the main street of the waikiki beach area","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["552710","553845","551478","549902","549886","547776","556807","546370","553301","548419","549849","549874","552711","556732","546716","553721"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["lane","vehicle","street","rhythm","liveliness","meter","rush","city","trucks","furniture"]}
