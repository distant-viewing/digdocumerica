{"path":"554810.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph provides a view from inside a red vehicle, focusing outward onto a desolate landscape that features a winding dirt road. The perspective is framed by the vehicle's interior, specifically through the open driver's side window and includes a segment of the red hood towards the left side, highlighting a rugged, outdoor setting. \n\nThe side mirror of the vehicle is visible at the right, reflecting a muddy and unclear image, likely the rear view of the road or surrounding land. The road itself meanders through a scene with sparse vegetation and small, bare trees lining the way. Large piles of mud or dirt are seen along the sides of the road, suggesting recent excavation or construction activities. The sky looks overcast, contributing to the gray and muted tones of the environment, enhancing a sense of isolation or remoteness. The overall atmosphere appears quiet and somewhat bleak, likely emphasizing a theme of exploration or travel through less-traveled or underdeveloped regions.","title":"This hauling road is a bleak stretch with mile after mile of Barren and torn ground, off route 100","placename":"Ohio","location":"Ohio","nn1":["554805","542606","557468","544178","549013","554154","554802","553633","545604","545749","554131","554130","545596","553662","549002","553627"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","travel","vehicle","remoteness","dirt","side","hood","mud","muddy","driver"]}
