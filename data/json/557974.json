{"path":"557974.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph displays a serene view taken from a bridge, focusing primarily on the mid-section of the image which features two prominent containers of vibrant flowers. These containers are rectangular and white, placed symmetrically on the railings of the bridge. They burst with colorful blooms, including bright red and white flowers, that give a festive and lively contrast to the scene.\n\nThe railing of the bridge is constructed of metal painted in a teal color with a simple, somewhat ornate, pattern that includes a stylized floral cut-out design at the center of the pictured section.\n\nBeyond the railing, the background reveals a calm waterway, presumably a river or canal, bordered on both sides by lush green trees. The water reflects the sunlight and the colors of the foliage above, contributing to the peacefulness of the setting. The perspective from the bridge offers a view down the river, which gently curves away, disappearing into the distance under the canopy of trees. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph creates an inviting, picturesque scene enhanced by the burst of floral color on the bridge, the tranquil waterway, and the greenery framing the view.","title":"Local merchants of Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron, placed flower boxes on Ohio highway 303 bridge.
