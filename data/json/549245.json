{"path":"549245.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph depicts a mining operation scene. In the foreground, there is a large, yellow mining truck equipped with a substantial bed, possibly for hauling extracted materials. Adjacent to this truck, there is a large mechanical excavator with a prominent boom and bucket, engaged in either digging or depositing soil or minerals. The terrain is rugged and largely barren, with exposed earth and rock layers indicating recent excavation activity.\n\nThe setting is an expansive open pit mine characterized by broad, smooth paths and steep, terraced sides, which reveal various geological layers of the earth. The color palette of the scene is mostly dark with shades of gray, brown, and black, reflecting the natural colors of the unearthed materials and the heavy machinery. A small yellow object, possibly a storage container or equipment unit, can also be seen sitting isolated on the ground near the center of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of industrial scale and operation, focusing on the machinery and the environmental impact of the mining activity. There are no visible human figures in the photograph, emphasizing the scale and the mechanized nature of the site.","title":"Acme coal mine","placename":"Wyoming","location":"Wyoming","nn1":["544107","552416","545831","544099","555606","553049","554828","552418","544110","554765","544100","549171","547243","544112","544135","554826"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","haul","truck","earth","digge","machinery","terrace","excavator","layer","boom"]}
