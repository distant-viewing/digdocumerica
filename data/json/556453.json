{"path":"556453.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph shows a young woman standing on a suburban street. She is smiling at the camera and is dressed in a unique outfit: a bright green jumpsuit with a floral patterned collar and cuffs. The jumpsuit features an elasticated waist and wrist cuffs. She carries a brown purse with a woven texture in her left hand.\n\nThe background presents a small town or residential area. To the left, there's a row of modest houses with front porches, alongside parked cars and a narrow sidewalk that runs beside the road. Dense trees and a wooded hillside frame the background, indicating the location might be in a valley or rural setting. The road, appearing somewhat worn, runs through the middle of the photograph and extends into the distance, reinforcing the small-town vibe of the setting. The overall atmosphere is sunny and cheerful, suggested both by the brightness of the daylight and the verdant surroundings.","title":"Recess at a school in Chattaroy, West Virginia, near Williamson, finds a girl ready to play softball. The town is small enough so that many youngsters go home for lunch and even during recess. The town has no industry, and most of the families survive on welfare, pensions, Social Security and black lung benefits.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556495","554270","557039","553157","551821","556765","543853","549686","549888","553191","544747","556711","550079","557114","554615","551824"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["jumpsuit","cuff","town","wrist","purse","waist","collar","brightness","hillside","road"]}
