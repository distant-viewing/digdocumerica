{"path":"544784.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph depicts an environmental scene where a person is walking along a dirt embankment next to a body of water. In the foreground, we see a polluted waterway with debris and foam on the surface, suggesting contamination or wastewater runoff. The water's edge is confined by a row of wooden planks acting as a crude barrier against soil erosion, and tall grass can be seen peeking through the soil.\n\nThe person walking is wearing a yellow shirt and white pants, in a brisk walk or jog along the top of the embankment, seemingly focused on their path ahead. Their presence contrasts sharply with the industrial and unkempt environment.\n\nIn the background, industrial structures are visible, including tall smokestacks and various buildings that likely contribute to the scene's pollution. There are also utility poles running alongside the embankment, further underscoring the interaction between nature and human activity in the area.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, combined with a cloudy sky, underscores themes of environmental degradation and industrial impact on natural landscapes. The picture is shot with a perspective that leads the viewer's eye from the polluted water in the foreground along the embankment towards the industrial backdrop, effectively highlighting the environmental concerns portrayed.","title":"Drainage ditch","placename":"Greeley (Colo.)","location":"Greeley, Colorado","nn1":["557243","546116","555867","544779","552127","543819","551531","551562","550193","544775","544810","552019","547907","550205","550723","547897"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["embankment","wastewater","soil","runoff","contamination","walk","foam","person","degradation","concern"]}
