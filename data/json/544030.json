{"path":"544030.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic industrial scene, likely taken during twilight or sunset, which contributes to the contrast and mood of the imagery. The main focus is on molten material, possibly iron, being expelled in a vibrant stream from a slag dump operation. The molten material forms a glowing, fiery orange-red river which curves through the foreground before descending out of view towards the ground.\n\nThe background features a silhouette of an industrial plant with several large buildings and towering smokestacks, emphasizing the industrial nature of the scene. Smoke or steam lightly billows from the structures, blending into the dusky sky. The buildings and smokestacks are outlined against a sky that shifts in color from a deep blue at the top to a gradient of sunset hues near the horizon.\n\nThere is a notable atmospheric quality to the image, with the stark industrial elements contrasted sharply against the natural beauty of the skyâ€™s dwindling light. The photograph effectively portrays a moment of intense industrial activity and the harsh environment of such a setting, illustrating both the energy and the environmental impact of the industry.","title":"Hot slag pours from smelter of Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company.","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["543996","545438","544015","557395","544708","557399","547702","547060","545421","557402","548851","547084","550821","544684","545446","544173"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","sunset","imagery","dump","shift","iron","material","gradient","twilight","stream"]}
