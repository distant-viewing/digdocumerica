{"path":"553456.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The image shows a high-altitude aerial photograph focusing on a pair of large industrial waste ponds. These ponds are surrounded by earthen barriers and are located near a cluster of industrial buildings. The largest of the two ponds appears in the foreground and shows variegated colors of brown, beige, and green, indicating different substances or chemical reactions taking place. The smaller pond to the right is predominantly a dark color, possibly signifying different contents or less activity.\n\nThe surrounding area includes patches of dense green forest, emphasizing that the location is at the edge of a wooded area. There are roads running parallel and adjacent to the ponds, with some visible vehicular traffic on them, suggesting that this facility is active and accessible. The background features can be glimpsed and include buildings that likely support the industrial operations connected to these ponds. The overall tone of the image, taken under cloudy or overcast conditions, gives it a somber and utilitarian atmosphere.","title":"Primary settling lagoons in mine falls canal park","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["551556","542530","552991","546117","544058","544569","548196","549519","544788","545836","544689","544044","543872","551585","550193","550724"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pond","reaction","substance","signify","chemical","content","altitude","barrier","pair","waste"]}
