{"path":"555358.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up view of a gardening activity, primarily focused on a person tending to cucumber plants. The person's arms are visible, reaching into the dense greenery of the plants. One arm appears to be older, likely an adult's, showing some signs of aging with spots and wrinkles. This arm is interacting with the plants, possibly guiding a cucumber or examining the plant.\n\nThe cucumbers themselves are large and prominently hanging from the vine, which is supported by string or wire trellises that help maintain the structure and health of the plants. The cucumbers are uneven in shape, typical of homegrown produce, and are various shades of green, indicating different stages of ripeness or possibly different varieties of cucumber.\n\nThe surrounding foliage of the plants is lush and dense, with large leaves that have a slightly wilted appearance at the edges, possibly due to weather conditions or the lifecycle of the plant. Some leaves show yellowing, suggesting they might be older or that the plant could be experiencing stress, like nutrient deficiency or disease.\n\nThe background is mostly the dense greenery of other plants, making the actual location or setting indistinct but confirms an outdoor environment, likely a garden. Below, the soil is visible with a muted, earthy texture that blends into the natural setting.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of active gardening, emphasizing the interaction between the gardener and the plants, showcasing the natural beauty and challenges of growing vegetables.","title":"Closeup view of cucumbers inside one of the solar greenhouses at the university of Arizona environmental research laboratory at Tucson.
