{"path":"548480.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene combining urban and garden elements. In the foreground, there's a small patch of land enclosed by a white picket fence, suggesting a personal or community garden setting. The garden appears freshly tilled, with some areas of loose soil and a few small plants visible. A man, wearing a light-colored hat and darker clothing, is engaged in gardening activities; he is bending over, working the soil with a tool, possibly a hoe or spade.\n\nImmediately behind the garden, a public transit train marked with a \"T\" logo, indicating it is part of a transit system (possibly Boston's MBTA), is visible. The train is painted in shades of white and black, featuring large windows and running on tracks that are slightly elevated from the ground level of the garden.\n\nThe setting includes residential or commercial buildings to the right and in the background. These buildings have exteriors finished in siding, and there's a sense of dense urban living with limited open space. Overhead, assorted wires and poles suggest urban infrastructure, likely related to electricity and telecommunications.\n\nThe scene encapsulates a contrast between urban life and personal or community-driven efforts to maintain green spaces within a city environment. The overall mood mixes the hustle of urban transit with the tranquility and labor of gardening.","title":"MBTA (Metropolitan Boston Transit Authority) train roars past northeastern side of Neptune Road.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551620","550059","550055","548442","550764","551617","551630","551739","550063","551623","551625","551744","551780","551621","551619","551743"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["garden","transit","gardening","train","telecommunication","picket","soil","electricity","community","hustle"]}
