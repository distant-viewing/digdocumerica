{"path":"553087.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph depicts a man seated in an indoor setting. He appears to be middle-aged, with his hair slightly tousled and swept back. He is dressed in a light-colored, long-sleeve shirt that has a button down style, with the collar slightly open. The man is smiling warmly towards the camera, displaying an expression that suggests friendliness and approachability.\n\nHe is situated against a textured background that resembles a segmented stone or tiled wall with a rather clear, light-toned color scheme and discernible patterns of lines and some slight staining or shadows. It appears to be an informal shot, possibly taken in a domestic or casual professional environment given the relaxed attire and demeanor of the subject.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo focuses on the man's upper body and face, providing a clear view of his features and expression in a context that feels personal and unguarded. The lighting in the photograph softly illuminates his face, enhancing the congenial and open quality of his expression.","title":"Robert stitzer, tribe attorney of paiute indian tribe, Pyramid Lake indian reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["557648","555297","557144","552872","552104","557034","545471","556622","557056","544382","557035","553030","546105","556452","556563","553605"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["expression","sweep","tousl","down","ton","tile","collar","scheme","button","face"]}
