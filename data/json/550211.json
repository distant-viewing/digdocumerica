{"path":"550211.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph displays a rural scene centered on an old, white-painted building, which appears to be a mill, located adjacent to a flowing stream. The mill features a multi-storied structure with visible windows and a lean-to addition on one side. It is positioned directly over a small waterfall caused by a dam, suggesting it might be a water-powered facility.\n\nThe surrounding environment is lush with leaf-bare trees possibly indicating the season as either autumn or early spring. Other vegetation includes shrubs and smaller plants near the water's edge. \n\nOn the right side of the photo, a paved road runs parallel to the stream, along with utility poles carrying power lines, hinting at the integration of modern infrastructure into this otherwise tranquil and natural landscape. The sky is partly cloudy with some sunlight breaking through, adding a bright, airy feel to the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a serene yet somewhat nostalgic impression, highlighting a blend of natural beauty and historical industry.","title":"Wilson Mill on the polluted and ill-smelling Ohio Canal","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["558001","553393","550858","553462","547519","544796","554703","557745","544824","555535","555609","558005","545137","546126","543543","549555"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["mill","stream","integration","addition","dam","leaf","waterfall","white","autumn","spring"]}
