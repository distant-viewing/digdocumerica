{"path":"549711.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an amusement park ride, specifically a merry-go-round or carousel. A young girl with shoulder-length brown hair and bangs is sitting on a shiny, motorcycle-like ride unit, which is part of the merry-go-round. She wears a light blue dress with white polka dots and a white collar, and her feet are placed on the footrests of the motorcycle. Her expression is somewhat neutral with a hint of contemplation or distraction.\n\nThe carousel appears to have a canopy overhead made of dark material, supported by poles that have lights installed on them, lending a festive atmosphere to the ride. Other ride units, resembling cars and motorcycles, are partially visible nearby, suggesting a variety of options for children to choose from.\n\nIn the background, another child can be seen on a different ride unit, and there is a glimpse of the park environment including trees and other park facilities, indicating that the setting is outdoors in a recreational public area.\n\nThere is also another individual in the frame, partially silhouetted and out of focus, who seems to be engaged with one of the ride units, perhaps assisting or just enjoying the ride along with the children. The lighting in the photograph gives a vibrant, yet soft quality to the entire scene, typical of daylight with some shadowing from the ride's canopy. The overall vibe of the image is nostalgic and joyful, capturing a simple moment of childhood leisure.","title":"A ride at the amusement park on bob-lo island","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["543213","543218","547278","551299","546781","545458","547002","547192","549108","551295","551720","552950","543043","551298","551297","545464"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["ride","unit","motorcycle","go","child","canopy","park","option","install","amusement"]}
