{"path":"546735.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph portrays an urban scene where three people are in motion near a red transit bus labeled \"NYC\" indicating it's a New York City bus, specifically bus number 1129. This bus displays a destination sign reading \"18 X FARAGUT SQRE\" on its front, indicating its route.\n\nOn the bus, the side door is open and one person, possibly a passenger, is stepping onto the curb, while two other individuals (men) are seen walking next to the bus. Both are dressed in smart casual attire with coats and carrying briefcases, illustrating a likely weekday scenario possibly involving commuters.\n\nThe setting appears to be a bus stop located in a moderately built area. In the background, a large building with the text \"GRAND UNION\" on its fa√ßade suggests a supermarket or shopping plaza nearby, complemented by a parking lot in which several cars are visible, including a red car that stands out.\n\nThe scene is enveloped by a somewhat barren landscape with a glimpse of grassy areas, indicating either a transitional season or a less manicured part of the city. The overall atmosphere implies a routine urban life scene with people engaging in daily commuting activities.","title":"Catching \"pentagon special\" in a Virginia suburb","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546592","549921","556809","556203","546655","549891","546605","556786","556746","553796","546650","556804","545385","547195","556050","556762"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","commuting","briefcase","commuter","plaza","destination","shopping","curb","manicure","stop"]}
