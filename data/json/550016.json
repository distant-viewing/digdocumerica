{"path":"550016.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavily damaged black car, likely involved in an accident, stationed on a roadway. The vehicle features extensive damage to its side, with the passenger door severely smashed and the side panels crumpled, revealing the inner components and framework of the car. The windows appear to be either shattered or missing entirely from the impact.\n\nInside the car, a woman with red hair is visible, sitting in the driver's seat and looking out through what remains of the car's windshield. She seems to be either waiting or looking for assistance, and her posture and position suggest she remained inside the vehicle post-accident. Despite the extensive damage to the car, the driverâ€™s area seems less affected compared to the passenger side.\n\nIn the background, the scene shows part of a roadway, confined with walls that resemble a tunnel or underpass. Another vehicle can be seen in the lane adjacent to the wrecked car, moving away from the scene. This setting and the presence of the damaged car suggest an urban setting with active traffic, indicating that the accident occurred in a public and possibly frequently traveled area. The overall lighting conditions and clarity seem to indicate this event took place in daylight.","title":"Aftermath of an auto accident on Storrow Drive, nine o'clock in the morning","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["552083","550020","554303","544472","554321","554302","547484","554295","547706","552996","545304","555480","549107","553863","545316","547597"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["accident","damage","car","driver","roadway","remain","passenger","public","shatter","assistance"]}
