{"path":"546222.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaging in an activity by the waterside, most likely fishing or crabbing. A man and a woman, both partially submerged in calm water, are focused on a net that the woman is holding. The net contains some small aquatic creatures, possibly crabs or fish. The man, wearing a white t-shirt and blue shorts, stands beside the woman, who is dressed in a gray t-shirt and patterned red and white shorts. They appear to be examining the catch together closely.\n\nThe background features a tranquil water body, possibly a lake, stretching out to the horizon with dense foliage visible in the far distance under a hazy sky, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. A single wooden pole, perhaps used to mark a specific location or depth in the water, is planted in the water near the pair. The overall mood of the scene is serene and focused, with the only disturbance being the gentle ripples in the water around the subjects.","title":"Crabbing in polluted waters","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["546320","546330","554008","551408","543222","553081","546340","551393","545178","544274","552284","545208","553953","550851","546338","543240"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","short","woman","crab","waterside","creature","water","disturbance","t","plan"]}
