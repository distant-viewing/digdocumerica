{"path":"544255.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a river scene framed through what appears to be an overhanging Spanish moss. In the middle distance, a large multi-story riverboat or tugboat, marked with \"FNC\" on its structure, can be seen pushing a series barge units with markings 'BUN EB-7' along the reflective surface of the river. The watercraft and barges are painted in blue and white, which stand out against the natural backdrop.\n\nThe background shows a lush tree line across the river, suggesting a vibrant, natural setting. The sky is partly cloudy, providing a dynamic and textured appearance above the serene river. The overall atmosphere is tranquil, with a focus on the daily activities of river transportation and the interaction of human-made structures within a natural environment. This composition offers a glimpse into riverine logistics and the scenic landscapes along the waterway.","title":"Derelict boat","placename":"Lafitte (La.)","location":"Lafitte, Louisiana","nn1":["551148","557235","548187","550951","546019","544271","556481","546024","550953","548067","550901","551150","557309","548186","551179","555401"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["river","barge","bun","riverboat","watercraft","logistic","tugboat","marking","moss","unit"]}
