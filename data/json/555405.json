{"path":"555405.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a gas station, likely from the mid to late 20th century, given the style of vehicles and gas pumps. There are four gas pumps in the forefront, colored in red, yellow, and white, signifying different grades of Shell gasoline: Shell Regular, Super Regular, and Super Shell. A large sign prominently displayed in front of the pumps reads “PUMPS CLOSED” in bold, black, hand-painted letters. \n\nTo the right of the gas pumps, a tall white sign attached to one of the pumps includes a message encouraging car maintenance with the question, “When did you last change your oil?” This corner of the image also shows another white sign with safety instructions that reads, “STOP YOUR MOTOR PLEASE no smoking.”\n\nThe gas station itself has a simple, flat-roofed design typical of the era, with light-colored walls. A pickup truck is parked near the station, which hints at either the presence of customers or employees despite the pumps being closed.\n\nIn the background, there’s a semi-rural landscape with gentle hills and few scattered buildings, indicative of a setting outside a bustling urban area. The overall scene is quiet and somewhat desolate, highlighted by the signage indicating the gas station is not operational at the time of the photograph.","title":"Gasoline shortage hit the state of Oregon in the fall of 1973 by midday gasoline was becoming unaVailable along interstate highways.
