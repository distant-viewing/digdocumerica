{"path":"545693.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a scene within a rugged desert canyon. It depicts a narrow passageway through large, reddish-brown rock formations, characteristic of arid, rocky landscapes often found in regions like the American Southwest. The canyon walls are uneven and textured, showing various layers and patterns indicative of geological formations shaped over millennia. Thereâ€™s an arch visible in the background, framing a section of the open sky and further rock formations.\n\nA group of people, appearing small in scale compared to the imposing size of the canyon, is located towards the center of the image. They are walking through or standing in the passageway, dressed in casual outdoor attire suitable for hiking or exploring. The ground is covered in dusty, compacted soil mixed with small rocks and pebbles, typical of a trail frequently used by visitors.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken either in the late afternoon or under slightly overcast conditions, softening the shadows and highlights that play across the canyon surfaces. The overall composition demonstrates a profound interaction between human visitors and the vast, enduring landscape of the canyon, emphasizing the scale and beauty of natural geological structures.","title":"On the trail to Chesler Park","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545705","545305","544903","544899","544917","544895","545697","545585","544931","553962","544898","544301","545565","544928","545758","545702"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","formation","visitor","rock","millennium","scale","pebble","hiking","highlight","arch"]}
