{"path":"543326.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features two deer on a sloping hillside covered with lush, brightly lit grass and wildflowers that create a mosaic of warm tones, predominantly amber and orange hues, possibly due to a sunset or seasonal change. The hill occupies the majority of the image, gently sloping from the top right corner down towards the left, ending in a shaded area that forms a natural frame around the scene. The two deer are positioned towards the left side of the image; one stands alert and is looking towards the camera, while the other is slightly lower down the slope. This setting is likely a rural or wilderness area due to the natural landscape and absence of human-made structures. The lighting highlights the deer and the vividness of the natural scenery, giving the image a serene, picturesque quality.","title":"Sunset on deer","placename":"Little Sur (Calif.)","location":"Little Sur, California","nn1":["553808","544114","542955","544914","545902","549219","542963","543369","546088","546232","544571","544916","546163","558368","542959","545898"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["deer","majority","vividness","wildflower","hillside","absence","change","scenery","corner","wilderness"]}
