{"path":"552232.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a residential neighborhood adjacent to a body of water, perhaps a lake or a river. The landscape consists of neatly arranged houses with gardens, surrounded by numerous mature trees, suggesting a lush, green environment. Several docks extend into the water, each with boats moored to them, indicating a boating community.\n\nThe colors in the image are rich and vibrant; the water is a deep blue reflecting sunlight, while the vegetation has hues of green, and the roofs of the houses vary in color, mostly earth tones like reds and browns. The overall composition of the photograph highlights a tranquil, scenic area designed for residential comfort and recreational boating activities. Roads are visible crisscrossing the neighborhood, allowing for easy access between the homes and leading out of the photographed area. There is also a visible lack of commercial buildings, reinforcing the area's residential nature.","title":"Homes on Portage Bay, Lake Washington.
