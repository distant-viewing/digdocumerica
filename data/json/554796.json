{"path":"554796.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph presents a silhouette of a person's upper body, including the head and an arm raised with an index finger pointing upwards. The setting appears to be an interior room, somewhat dimly lit, characterized by a shadowy and somewhat blurred ambiance. A prominent source of natural light originates from a window with white curtains in the background, which casts soft light and creates a stark contrast with the silhouette. The walls are smooth but feature a few visible imperfections like small cracks or marks. The composition focuses on an abstract or conceptual portrayal, using light and shadow to emphasize shapes and forms rather than detailed features. The overall mood is introspective and slightly dramatic, highlighting the gesture of the raised finger which could suggest contemplation, instruction, or emphasizing a point.","title":"A resident of Oak Park points to cracks in her walls she claims were caused by blasting. Recently her well went dry, as have many in the area. She claims that blasting once nearly knocked her off a ladder.","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["548072","544437","556516","553226","556228","546486","553261","547763","555303","555009","556318","553223","546558","546580","546471","557648"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["finger","raise","imperfection","originate","instruction","silhouette","portrayal","crack","curtain","light"]}
