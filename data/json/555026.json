{"path":"555026.jpg","date":"April 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a natural setting focusing primarily on small plants and moss. The dominant feature of the image is the thick bed of bright green moss that covers nearly the entire frame. The moss has a soft, fine texture that appears lush and dense.\n\nScattered across the moss are several small plants with pale green, almost silvery leaves. These leaves are broad, slightly fluffy, and covered in a fine layer of hairs which gives them a frosted appearance. The plants seem to be a type of alpine or arctic species adapted to cold environments.\n\nAmongst the moss and these plants, there are bits of natural debris. This includes a few brown leaves that appear to be decomposing, and small sticks or bits of organic matter, contributing to the natural, untamed aspect of the scene. The lighting in the photograph is soft and diffuse, suggesting an overcast day or a shaded environment, which enhances the vibrancy of the green moss.\n\nThe overall composition of the image gives a serene, intimate look at the microcosm of the forest floor, emphasizing textures and the variety of life within a small ecosystem.","title":"Dry ground moss cover in a Douglas fir forest in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554571","555018","555025","543147","554991","555027","555058","554554","545271","554993","555183","554985","555040","555191","553358","555054"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","plant","bit","leave","decompose","matter","adapt","stick","vibrancy","specie"]}
