{"path":"551633.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people engaging in community gardening or urban beautification. The scene takes place on a sunny day in an urban setting with a busy street in the background, lined with various buildings and store fronts, including visible signage like \"HOâ€“USE\" and \"Broadway.\"\n\nThe main focus is on four individuals who are actively planting and taking care of newly planted areas along a row of park benches. These benches, which have metal frames and wooden slats, are surrounded by small, rectangular dirt patches where the planting is occurring. \n\nThe individuals appear focused and busy with their tasks. They represent a range of ages and are dressed in casual attire suitable for gardening. From left to right:\n- The first person, possibly a middle-aged woman, is bent over, touching the soil either planting or adjusting something in the earth.\n- The second person, an elderly woman, is also engaging closely with the planting, touching the soil.\n- The third person, a young girl in a denim jacket, is actively digging or planting.\n- The fourth person on the right, likely a woman, is also working with the soil, possibly smoothing it or planting.\n\nIn the background, amidst the street and sidewalks, passersby can be seen walking. There are cars parked along the side of the street, and further back, busier traffic can be observed. The presence of a traffic signal at an intersection adds to the urban setting. The overall atmosphere suggests a vibrant city life with a community engaging in efforts to beautify or upkeep their environment.","title":"Bench painting by members of the 76th Street Neighborhood Association","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551619","553423","551738","551620","551623","553424","551739","551621","551618","551617","550063","551705","543439","551700","550055","551780"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["planting","gardening","soil","person","bench","street","woman","traffic","slat","passersby"]}
