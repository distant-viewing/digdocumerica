{"path":"545932.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil lake scene with a focused view on a partially submerged boat and an individual working on a floating platform. The boat is tipped sideways, suggesting it might have started to sink or is in the process of being abandoned or salvaged. It is a relatively large boat with a windshield and frame that are clearly visible above the water's surface, reflecting clearly in the calm lake water.\n\nTo the right, another key element is a floating platform equipped with various cylindrical and rectangular containers, which could be used for either storage or part of a water-related activity such as fishing or maintenance. An individual, dressed in a red shirt, is bent over seemingly engaged in a task on this platform. This person reflects professionalism or urgency in their posture, focused intently on their work.\n\nThe background is serene, featuring a broad expanse of the lake with gentle ripples on the waterâ€™s surface and a muted reflection of the distant hills, which appear soft and hazy, possibly due to atmospheric conditions like fog or mist. The skyline is broad and mostly clear, hinting at an open, undisturbed natural setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its calm water, reflections, and the activities involving the boat and the individual, creates a narrative of marine work or perhaps a recovery operation in a peaceful, remote outdoor setting. This scene brings together elements of nature and human activity, marked by a sense of solitude and calmness.","title":"Truckee River","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["544770","547557","545940","544260","545926","550324","544266","557255","545936","545666","545969","549417","547548","544126","551313","546976"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["platform","boat","lake","float","professionalism","salvage","work","sink","recovery","reflection"]}
