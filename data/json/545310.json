{"path":"545310.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is an outdoor photograph featuring a man standing next to a large pile of oyster shells. The man, who is slightly off-center, is directing his gaze towards the camera, with a focused and slightly stern expression on his face. He is middle-aged, wears glasses, and is dressed in a green plaid shirt over a white undershirt.\n\nThe man is pointing toward the oyster shells with his right hand, indicating perhaps an explanation or a feature of interest about them. The oyster shells themselves are grayish-white and appear weathered, suggesting they have been exposed to the elements for some time. These shells are densely packed and form a textured, rugged backdrop that takes up most of the frame behind and beside the man.\n\nThe photo captures a moment likely intended to emphasize the man's relationship or role with the collection or processing of these oysters. The setting, judging by the light and the amount of oyster shells, suggests an industrial or harvesting area dedicated to oyster farming or processing. The overall composition highlights the scale of oyster shells compared to the human subject, underlining the extensive nature of the shell collection or the oyster cultivation industry.","title":"Dennis tufts, shell fish biologist with the Washington department of fisheries, with strings of oyster shells.
