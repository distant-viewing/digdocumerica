{"path":"552477.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a rustic and somewhat dilapidated urban scene that seems to capture a moment of quiet desolation. In the foreground, a dark metal post holds a prominent sign that reads \"MALTA\" in bold, black lettering on a white background. This sign is centrally positioned and sharply in focus, suggesting its importance in the context of the image, perhaps marking the name of a train station or location.\n\nBehind this sign, there are multiple train tracks, which add an industrial feel to the scene. Beyond the tracks, the background features a variety of old buildings in various states of disrepair. These structures appear weathered, with visible damage and peeling paint, emphasizing a sense of neglect and abandonment.\n\nThe closest building to the left is a residential type with red brick walls and a dark, pitched roof. Next to it, thereâ€™s another building with a brown, boarded-up facade that looks particularly worn. The right side of the image shows the side of a larger, beige building with exposed patches where the plaster has come away from the brickwork beneath.\n\nThere is no visible human activity in the image, which contributes to a somber, forgotten atmosphere. The natural light and overcast sky suggest it might be either early morning or late afternoon, casting a soft illumination that enhances the scene's moody aesthetic.","title":"Railroad tracks in mAlta","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547656","553548","556778","549785","554707","547580","556330","551330","552534","557345","555952","547782","549786","547622","544137","545233"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","plaster","track","brickwork","forget","sign","importance","building","illumination","pitch"]}
