{"path":"556408.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a busy railway scene centered around coal transportation. The image prominently features a yellow and red diesel locomotive labeled with \"4170\" and \"C&O\" (Chesapeake and Ohio Railway) along its side. Behind it, another locomotive with the distinctive \"Chessie System\" logo in black, orange, and yellow colors is partially seen; its number \"5868\" is visible perpendicular to \"4170\".\n\nThe setting is a railyard, as indicated by the multiple tracks filled with hoppers loaded with coal. The foreground of the image provides a close-up view of these coal-filled cars, emphasizing the industrial function of the railyard.\n\nThere's a worker visible beside the visible part of the \"Chessie System\" locomotive. He appears engaged with some components on the side of the train, perhaps checking or managing equipment.\n\nThe overall composition reveals a focus on the details and operations of freight rail transportation, conveying the scale and activity involved in the handling and movement of coal via railways. The industrial vibe is accentuated by the functional design of the locomotives and the visible bulk commodities they are transporting.","title":"Closeup of a railroad engine and coal cars loaded for shipment to customers at the Danville, West Virginia, near Charleston.
