{"path":"545099.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a balding man standing in a wet, muddy area covered with green algae or seaweed. The man, dressed in dark clothing including a navy blue jacket and black pants, is focused on examining or handling a clump of green seaweed or algae that he holds in his hands. The surrounding environment suggests a tidal flat or marshland, with uneven terrain that is rich in moisture, evident from the reflective puddles scattered across the image. The scene is captured during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft blue tones and cool lighting. This serene, natural environment portrays a moment of scientific or contemplative exploration. The backdrop consists of similar muddy and algae-filled textures that stretch across the image, without any visible structures or other people, emphasizing the solitude and focus of the individual.","title":"Bill Wick, professor of wildlife and head of the Marine Advisory Program at Oregon State University, gathers green algae and eel grass from Sally's Bend on","placename":"Newport (Or.)","location":"Newport, Oregon","nn1":["545032","552289","558108","545095","552290","546341","546307","554797","548956","552288","549012","551406","545103","552110","542556","546334"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["algae","seaweed","marshland","clump","puddle","moisture","examine","exploration","dawn","dusk"]}
