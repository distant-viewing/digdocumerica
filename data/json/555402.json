{"path":"555402.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and expansive beach scene under what appears to be an overcast sky. The beach is characterized by wide stretches of dark, wet sand, indicating that the tide might be low. Shallow water occupies various patches, reflecting light and possibly the sky, creating patterns and texture on the surface.\n\nSeveral individuals are scattered across the beach, engaging in different activities. On the left side, a woman in red walks near the water's edge, facing away from the camera. In the middle ground, three people can be seen: two are walking away from the water and one walking parallel to it. Among them, a boy wearing dark pants and a light shirt seems to be playing or walking leisurely. Another child far away is dressed in a white outfit and seems to be exploring near the water.\n\nTo the right, a man, distinct in a red top and dark trousers, walks methodically across the beach, leading the eye through the scene. Further right, near the shore, a group of people stand with one child seemingly entering or leaving the shallow water.\n\nThe backdrop might suggest a late afternoon setting due to the subdued lighting and the calm atmosphere. The scene gives off a tranquil vibe, with people enjoying a quiet day at the beach, either strolling or pausing to look at the sea. No significant structures or landmarks are visible in the background, emphasizing the natural and unspoiled nature of the setting.","title":"Lowest flow on record for the Columbia River in the fall of 1973 was the result of low precipitation the previous year.
