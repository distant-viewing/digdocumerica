{"path":"556205.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph features an adult man kneeling next to a bright red Mazda RX-2 car, focusing on some form of inspection or maintenance. The man is dressed in a light blue lab coat, dark trousers, and appears to be holding a tool or a device, possibly checking the carâ€™s tire or brakes. The car is parked outdoors and part of its distinctive chrome rear bumper and tail lights are visible, highlighting its vintage style. In the background, another individual is partially visible on the left side of the frame, seemingly engaged in a separate activity near another car. The environment includes other cars and hints of a parking lot setting with a natural, sunny daylight ambiance. The focus and sharpness of the image draw attention to the man and his interaction with the car, suggesting a context of either a professional inspection or a car enthusiast engaged in maintenance work.","title":"Inspector testing the exhaust of an auto at soldier's field one of nine auto pollution test sites conducted free by the city of Chicago's environmental control department.
