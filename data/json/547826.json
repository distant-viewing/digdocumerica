{"path":"547826.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a tightly packed parking lot filled with numerous cars. The vehicles, predominantly from what appears to be the late 1960s or early 1970s given their design, are organized in a somewhat haphazard pattern that fits as many cars as possible into the space provided. The cars showcase a variety of colors including black, white, red, blue, green, and yellow among others.\n\nThe parking lot is surrounded by high buildings on two sides, indicating an urban environment. The ground has directional arrows painted on it, guiding the flow of traffic within the lot. On the perimeter of the parking area, several other vehicles and trucks are visible, likely either entering or exiting the lot. There are also a few people, possibly drivers or pedestrians, visible near these vehicles.\n\nThe composition of the photo, being from an elevated angle, emphasizes the density and organized chaos of urban parking. The image provides a snapshot of automotive culture demonstrating the variety of car designs and colors popular at the time.","title":"Downtown Dallas parking area","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["546879","553303","556721","546685","556722","546813","556773","556204","548432","554349","547480","546731","556736","556790","556196","550100"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["lot","parking","car","vehicle","arrow","perimeter","chaos","variety","culture","driver"]}
