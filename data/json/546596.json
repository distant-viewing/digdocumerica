{"path":"546596.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph shows a scene involving three men and two cars in what appears to be a parking lot. The lighting suggests it could be either dawn or dusk, providing a somewhat moody atmosphere.\n\nThe cars are prominent in the image. The vehicle in the foreground is a dark-colored sedan, possibly from the 1960s based on its design, which is sleek with rectangular headlights and a noticeable grill. The second car, partially visible to the left, shares a similar vintage aesthetic with a conspicuous glossy and curved body.\n\nIn the photograph, one man is seated inside the car in the foreground, visible through the open driver-side window. He is wearing a dark suit and appears to be engaged in conversation or waiting. Another man, wearing a dark coat and suit, stands by the open driver-side door, leaning slightly into the car, indicating active interaction with the driver. The third man is closer to the back of the car, dressed in a dark suit and balding; he seems to be either entering or just closing the rear door, engaging with the others in a logistical or preparatory activity.\n\nIn the background, the environment appears quite open and sparse with a few leafless trees and a clear sky. The presence of a stop sign adjacent to the cars adds to the setting of a parking lot or a controlled traffic area within a possibly governmental or institutional complex, hinted at by the formal attire of the individuals and the nature of the vehicles.\n\nOverall, the scene might suggest a formal, possibly official gathering or departure, emphasizing a moment of preparation or brief discussion before moving on. The setting and composure of the subjects give the photograph a sense of importance and structured activity.","title":"Free fringe parking lot at montgomery mall, md.
