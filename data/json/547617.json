{"path":"547617.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image captures an abstract and visually intriguing scene of a polluted water surface. The water is tainted with swaths of vividly colored oil slicks, creating swirls in hues of rust, amber, deep blues, and purples, along with splotches that reflect a toxic mix of chemicals. Apparently floating amidst this oil-contaminated water are several dark, elongated items that seem to be industrial waste, perhaps metal rods or parts of machinery, contributing to the environmental degradation depicted. The photograph has an eerie beauty, illustrating the interplay of color and form atop a polluted water body, yet it concurrently sends a strong message about environmental neglect and the impacts of industrialization on natural bodies of water. The composition primarily focuses on the textural interplay and color variations caused by the pollution, offering a powerful visual commentary.","title":"Oil from tanker terminal floats on Providence River","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547614","550734","544175","546806","546015","544580","551560","551561","551559","553898","550690","547618","553858","555784","555848","547493"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["oil","contaminate","interplay","swath","slick","water","industrialization","commentary","swirl","degradation"]}
