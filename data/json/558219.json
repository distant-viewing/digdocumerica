{"path":"558219.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Stroble, David","caption":"This photograph shows a woman standing next to a framed painting of a religious figure that appears to be Jesus Christ. The painting depicts Jesus with a radiant halo around his head and his heart visible on his chest, surrounded by a glow. He is dressed in a red robe over a white garment and is gesturing towards his heart with both hands. The painting is housed in an ornate golden frame.\n\nThe woman next to the painting is smiling and looking towards the camera. She wears a white short-sleeved blouse, black skirt, and black shoes. Her dark hair is short and neatly styled, and she wears glasses.\n\nThe setting seems to be a hallway with light colored brick walls and a tiled floor, contributing to an institutional atmosphere. On the left side of the image, a part of a blue painted wall is visible, and there is a partially open door with beige and brown tones on the right side. A small exit sign and another placard are mounted on the wall near the door. The lighting in the scene is soft and diffused, adding a serene quality to the overall composition.","title":"The principal of Cathedral High School in New Ulm, Minnesota. The town is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe. Several manufacturing firms have located here since 1950 and have helped the town to grow. The business district was revitalized during the 1960s with community effort.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["556577","548289","548288","558164","558319","547332","551337","558335","554209","546558","552611","558383","547752","553503","556237","552680"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["painting","heart","wall","halo","door","exit","robe","garment","chest","skirt"]}
