{"path":"549527.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a section of highway running parallel to a body of water. The highway features two visible lanes in each direction, divided by a grassy median. On the land side of the highway are grass areas lined with intermittent trees and standard highway lampposts.\n\nAdjacent to the highway and separated by a line of trees and a grassy strip, there's a rocky shoreline buffering the water's edge. The water itself displays two distinct colors: a deeper blue in the further part and a lighter, almost turquoise color near the shore, indicating shallower water or different water conditions. A wave or small break in the water is visible near the shoreline, possibly from natural water movement or the presence of underwater structures.\n\nThere are a few vehicles visible on the highway, spaced out and seemingly in standard motion, without any visible congestion. The overall scene is tranquil with natural and built elements coexisting, captured from a high vantage point that provides a comprehensive view of the areaâ€™s layout.","title":"Aerial view of the Niagara River, showing discharge of wastes just two miles upstream from the falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["548143","548144","546603","549504","546607","546686","546720","550613","547294","548391","557465","546587","557471","545104","546733","546612"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["highway","water","shoreline","median","lamppost","congestion","break","strip","lane","vantage"]}
