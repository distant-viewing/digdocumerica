{"path":"547868.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of extensive debris and damage outside industrial buildings. The foreground is cluttered with various forms of wreckage including broken furniture, mangled metal pieces, overturned and broken boxes, and miscellaneous items strewn in a disorganized manner, submerged in patches of water which reflect some of the sky and objects, suggesting recent rainfall or flooding.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by two large, grey industrial buildings with wide doors, one of which is open. A few individuals are visible; some appear to be walking across the area, possibly assessing damage or beginning cleanup efforts. There are multiple vehicles, including a red pickup truck loaded with debris and a few other cars scattered across the scene that look undamaged, implying they might have been brought in post-event for recovery efforts.\n\nThe background features another building with a tall chimney, reinforcing the industrial setting of the photograph. Over the entire scene, the sky appears overcast with grey clouds, possibly indicating stormy or post-storm weather conditions, which could explain the extent of debris and disruption seen on the ground.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a dramatic aftermath of what could have been a natural disaster or an industrial accident, focusing on the impact on the infrastructure and the early stages of the response to the incident.","title":"Household trash has been dumped in front of the New York city incinerator plant at gravesend bay","placename":"Brooklyn (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Brooklyn, New York","nn1":["555780","555544","551089","553863","544464","555540","551088","546120","544583","553470","551087","544463","547888","544797","555872","547598"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["damage","effort","debris","mangle","incident","accident","assess","overturn","recovery","response"]}
