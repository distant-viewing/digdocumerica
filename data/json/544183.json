{"path":"544183.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an engaging scene by the water during what appears to be the later hours of the afternoon, given the strong backlight and reflections on the water. Two children are playing on a large rock submerged in a body of water, likely a lake or river, judging by the calm surface and expanse of water visible.\n\nThe child on the left, shown in silhouette, is standing and facing the viewer, their body slightly turned to the side. They are extending one arm out for balance, giving a sense of movement as if they are about to jump or are stabilizing themselves on the slippery surface. The child on the right is also in silhouette and is in a more exuberant pose, with both arms raised joyfully and legs partially visible in a squatting or seated position, suggesting they are either cheering or in mid-play.\n\nThe water around the rock sparkles with light reflected from the sun, creating a vivid contrast of light and shadow. This backlight casts the details of the children into shadow, emphasizing their outlines and movements rather than specific features.\n\nThe background is a simple horizon where the water meets a subtle line, suggesting a far shoreline or the opposite bank of a larger body of water. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of freedom and joy associated with childhood play in natural settings.","title":"Southeastern Louisiana--lake pontchartrain","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["544187","544200","551160","547692","551159","543473","553429","543466","551544","553430","551857","552331","543875","543692","552220","546333"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["backlight","child","water","arm","jump","play","silhouette","stabilize","freedom","movement"]}
