{"path":"548727.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a group of snorkelers in a vast, deep blue ocean. The water exhibits varying shades of blue, suggesting varying depths and the presence of undersea life. The snorkelers, spaced out along a single long line to which they seem tethered by smaller lines, swim on the surface. Their equipment—snorkels and fins—are visible, which supports their aquatic exploration.\n\nThe line appears to be a safety measure, possibly a guide line to keep the group together and safe or to lead them along a particular underwater trail. Each person is distinguished by differently colored swim caps, aiding in identifying individuals from a distance, likely for safety.\n\nIn the background, the horizon line is faint yet discernible, marking a clear, sunny day with few clouds in the sky. This setting indicates ideal conditions for snorkeling, with good visibility both in the air and in the water. The tranquility of the open water scene suggests an atmosphere of adventure and exploration in a natural maritime environment.","title":"Scientists from Shell Oil Company on a snorkeling expedition to study coral and coral formation beneath the waters of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553780","543065","557481","549347","555830","555834","544129","548675","554007","548714","544388","548683","548681","546306","553783","555833"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["line","exploration","safety","snorkel","guide","fin","measure","swim","maritime","group"]}
