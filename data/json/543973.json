{"path":"543973.jpg","date":"March 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and unique moment involving three individuals at an outdoor event, potentially a wedding, given the attire and context. There is a significant amount of theatrical smoke filling the scene, which adds a mystical or dynamic atmosphere to the image.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, a man in a dark naval officer's uniform with captain's insignia on his sleeves is operating a red lever on a large, complex machine, which appears to be the source of the smoke. Next to him, in the center of the image, stands a bride, smiling broadly. She is dressed traditionally in a white wedding gown and veil, and is holding a drink in a clear glass. She is looking joyfully at another individual, a man dressed in a light-colored suit, who appears to be adjusting or interacting with the lever or machinery alongside the naval officer. The background is obscured by the thick smoke, focusing viewer attention on the interaction around the machine.\n\nThe scene suggests a celebratory and possibly playful moment, perhaps a unique ritual or custom at the wedding, involving the activation of this smoke-producing machinery by the bride and the two men, adding an element of spectacle and fun to the occasion.","title":"Wedding on the \"Belle of Louisiana.\" The paddlewheel steamboat is owned by the city of Louisville and Jefferson County.","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["558240","558237","556247","557794","558405","545449","545728","558285","551935","547371","554913","554910","547317","558290","558239","558236"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["lever","smoke","officer","machine","gown","insignia","veil","fun","spectacle","machinery"]}
