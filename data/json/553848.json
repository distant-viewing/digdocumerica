{"path":"553848.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of a person holding a black porous stone, likely a type of volcanic rock, in their hand. The focus is primarily on the stone, which occupies most of the frame and is primarily characterized by its rugged, highly textured surface with many cavities and craggy features. The color of the rock transitions from deep black to areas of gray and subtle earthy tones.\n\nThe person is holding the stone such that only their fingers and thumb are visible, gently cradling the stone against a mostly plain, lightly blurred background that doesn't distract from the main subject. The backdrop is nondescript with a soft focus, suggesting a neutral outdoor space, possibly a sandy or dusty environment given the specks visible on the fingers.\n\nThe stone's intriguing texture and the way it is held suggest it might be an object of geological interest, possibly being examined for study or simply admired for its natural beauty. The lighting is natural, enhancing the intricate details and various shades of the rock's surface.","title":"Birmingham coal miner's lung showing effect of black lung disease.
