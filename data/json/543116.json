{"path":"543116.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene coastal pasture scene. In the foreground, a dark wooden fence runs diagonally from the lower left to the center right, guiding the viewer's eye towards the ocean. The fence contributes a strong linear element to the composition, adding depth and perspective.\n\nBeyond the fence, the middle ground is occupied by a grassy field dotted with grazing sheep. The field, appearing in varying shades of green and brown, stretches horizontally across the frame and is bordered on its far side by a rugged cliff that descends gently into the sea. The pastoral setting emits a peaceful, rural atmosphere.\n\nThe background consists of the open sea, merging with a clear sky on the horizon. The ocean is calm, with no visible waves, and the sky is almost cloudless, suggesting a bright, clear day. This vast expanse of water adds a sense of tranquility and isolation to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of nature—land, sea, and sky—with human-made structures, represented by the fence, creating a harmonious landscape that invites contemplation. The vibrant coloration, with vivid blues, greens, and the earthy tones of the field and sheep, enhances the visual appeal of this peaceful coastal scenery.","title":"California--Gold Bluff Beach","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542895","554453","549142","548220","554085","557747","545215","546154","549156","557946","546102","553805","557212","554928","547404","545040"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["fence","sheep","sea","field","ocean","pasture","green","coloration","appeal","contemplation"]}
