{"path":"556824.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This black and white photograph captures an indoor scene, likely set in a kitchen or a small food preparation area. The image features two individuals, one woman and one man, engaged in what appears to be activities related to food service.\n\nThe woman, who is in the foreground on the left side, wears a patterned sleeveless top and is concentrating on a task in front of her. She is leaning over slightly and appears to be either preparing or arranging something on the counter. Her hair is styled in a bob cut, and her expression is focused on her immediate task.\n\nAdjacent to her, the man appears slightly blurred, suggesting motion, and is also engaged in an activity that involves handling materials or utensils on the countertop. He is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and has his head turned downwards, observing his work.\n\nThe background and surroundings are indicative of a commercial kitchen or a similar setting, with what looks like stainless steel or metal fixtures and shelves stocked with various items. The overall atmosphere is one of a busy and utilitarian space. The photograph captures a moment of everyday labor, emphasizing a sense of movement and activity within a confined workspace.\n\nThe lighting is subdued and the use of black and white film adds a grainy, textured quality to the image, enhancing its candid and spontaneous feel. The close-up capture focuses on the actions and expressions of the individuals, giving a glimpse into the dynamic of their interaction in this environment.","title":"Passengers place tokens in the turnstiles on the Lexington avenue subway line operated by the New York city transit authority.  The system is of crucial importance to the city.  In 1970 it carried 2.1 million persons to and from work each day approximately 47 percent of the work force.  However, voters have refused to authorize new funds for any more improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be increased to cover operating costs","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553531","553651","550316","558378","548439","558298","554896","548860","552105","544233","554895","545065","556676","552635","550320","558350"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["kitchen","food","confin","task","stock","utensil","grainy","counter","fixture","concentrate"]}
