{"path":"546101.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man standing in what appears to be a small store or shop, densely stocked with a variety of products. The man is wearing glasses and a white short-sleeved shirt with a name tag and a pen in one of the shirt's pockets. He has a mild, passive expression and is slightly smiling.\n\nThe background is richly filled with shelves that carry multiple products, mostly tobacco-related such as packets of different cigarette brands. Each shelf is tightly packed with boxes neatly arranged and prominently displayed. Overhead, dangling vertically from the ceiling, are more cigarette advertisements and packages, emphasizing the narrow and congested nature of the store. The overall environment suggests a specialized tobacco shop, evoking a bygone era largely due to the vintage packaging designs and the older brands showcased. Despite the congestion, the store presents a certain organized chaos with each item given its distinct space on the shelves.","title":"Morris fisher, owner of the local grocery and drugstore","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["557688","557686","556369","552637","551832","556209","546225","554945","558281","546226","547805","557808","557763","556207","548219","551342"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["shelf","package","store","brand","product","shop","boxe","stock","tag","arran"]}
