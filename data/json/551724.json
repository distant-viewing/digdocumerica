{"path":"551724.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid urban scene marked by a striking contrast between a classic piece of urban architecture and everyday life in a neighborhood setting. In the background, the Empire State Building stands tall, a prominent example of Art Deco architecture, towering over the cityscape of New York. Its familiar silhouette and antennas on the top make it easily recognizable.\n\nForegrounded are older, much smaller residential buildings, seemingly modest and aged, with exposed exteriors and fire escapes clinging to the sides. The focus of the photograph is on a public or recreational space nestled between these buildings. This area includes a series of wide concrete steps and a play structure made out of wooden planks and barrels, suggesting a playground or community gathering spot. The area is bustling with life, featuring several individuals engaged in various activities.\n\nThere are children and adults visible in the shot. A few children are seen playing—one on the steps, potentially playing with a red and white toy vehicle, another climbing on the wooden play structure. An adult holding papers or a book can be seen interacting or watching over the children. The people add a dynamic element to the otherwise still architectural backdrop.\n\nThe way the scene is composed brings together elements of urban decay and community life, suggesting themes of resilience and daily life continuing in the shadow of iconic landmarks. It’s a snapshot of an ordinary day that captures the essence of a particular time and place within the urban landscape of New York City.","title":"Park at 29th Street and Second Avenue--a good example of an attractive park whose basis is stone rather than grass.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551725","548345","548421","548319","553557","548408","549317","557256","555741","548360","555928","549764","549958","549918","557260","555902"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["play","child","step","life","adult","climbing","example","toy","playground","escape"]}
