{"path":"544615.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a nighttime scene where an individual wearing a yellow long-sleeve shirt and glasses is seen closely inspecting or interacting with a cluster of turtle eggs on a sandy beach. The person's body is leaning forward with one hand stretched out towards the eggs, suggesting a gesture of either placing or examining them closely.\n\nThe eggs themselves are numerous, white, and spherical, partially buried in the sand, illuminating slightly under the ambient or artificial light present during the capture. Surrounding the eggs and the person are sparse vegetation and some debris, which indicates a natural, outdoor beach environment.\n\nThe darkness of the night plays a significant role in the mood and visual composition of the photo, with the focus mainly centered around the lit area where the person and the eggs are located. The lighting creates a high contrast between the subject and the surrounding darkness, emphasizing the solitary and intimate nature of the activity being depicted. The person's focus and careful handling suggest a scientific or conservation-related activity, possibly involving the study or protection of turtle eggs.","title":"Jim Walters, naturalist with the Everglades National Park, counts loggerhead turtle eggs and re-sets the nest.","placename":"East Cape (Fla.)","location":"East Cape, Florida","nn1":["544626","544630","548282","545095","544513","546350","547504","558108","543225","552304","546308","549231","545208","552289","552290","547167"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["person","darkness","beach","capture","protection","gesture","handling","conservation","study","night"]}
