{"path":"545082.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a collection of shells on a wet sandy beach. The shells, likely razor clams, are mostly clustered together near the center of the image, with a few more scattered around. These elongated, light brown shells with dark striations appear slightly opened, possibly indicating they are no longer alive or are empty.\n\nThe sandy surface they lie on is dark gray and appears moist, with fine grains visible and subtle textures that suggest a recent interaction with water, perhaps left by a receding wave. The lighting on the shells creates gentle highlights and shadows, enhancing their three-dimensional form and the natural patterns on their surfaces.\n\nNo other elements, such as additional beach debris or wildlife, are visible in the frame, leading to a simple and focused image primarily centered on the shells and their interaction with the beach environment.","title":"Razor clams on quinault beach.
