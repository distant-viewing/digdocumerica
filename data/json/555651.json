{"path":"555651.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a grocery store. The image predominantly features an aisle with multiple shoppers. A woman in the foreground, dressed in a denim shirt, is seen pushing a shopping cart filled with various grocery items including packs of bottled beverages and bagged goods. Her expression appears focused as she navigates the cart.\n\nTo the right of the image is the checkout area, where another woman (partly visible) stands behind a cash register, seemingly in the process of arranging or scanning items. There are other shoppers in the background, one of whom is standing by the deli counter that is minimally visible at the right edge of the photo. Another male shopper with a cart is partially seen in the middle right.\n\nThe shelves along the aisle are stocked with a variety of products. Prominently displayed are several large, red cans labeled \"Gasol,\" positioned next to an assortment of jars and cans that seem to contain food items. The upper sign says \"FOODS\" in a straightforward, large font, likely indicating the general merchandise of the aisle.\n\nAmbient lighting and interior design elements suggest a typical grocery setting from a previous era, marked by simple décor and practical shelving arrangements. The overall atmosphere indicates everyday shopping activity, with individuals engaged in selecting and purchasing groceries.","title":"Shopping for groceries in a Washington, District of Columbia supermarket.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["555652","557763","546216","554869","556369","555650","547805","546226","557808","558281","558255","557686","546101","550041","557688","556207"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Commercial Activities"],"terms":["grocery","shopper","aisle","cart","shopping","can","food","item","cash","décor"]}
