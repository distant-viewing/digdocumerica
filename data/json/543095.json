{"path":"543095.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures the entrance of \"Confusion Hill,\" a roadside attraction noted for its quirky and mysterious allure. The entrance features a large, horizontally-oriented banner hung between two trees, vividly declaring \"ENTRANCE CONFUSION HILL\" in large, block yellow letters on a dark background. Underneath the main text, a smaller line reads \"MYSTERY?\" and mentions \"Mountain Train Ride\" and \"Two Separate Attractions,\" emphasizing the site’s offerings.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a classic red Coca-Cola vending machine and a chain-link fence gate that serves as an entrance. Adjacent to this, there's a quirky, cabin-like structure labeled \"GRAVITY GOOFED\" in playful, uneven lettering, hinting at the whimsical and gravity-defying experiences available inside.\n\nTo the right, there’s what appears to be an office, nestled under the expanse of the banner. The office area is slightly shadowed, creating a mysterious ambiance. Around the structure, the environment is wooded, with tall trees and a natural, rustic setting that adds to the offbeat charm of the location.\n\nOverall, the composition and objects within the photograph suggest a classic, mid-20th-century American roadside attraction designed to intrigue and amuse visitors with its themed entertainment and peculiar gravitational illusions.","title":"Klamath River","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["543094","554457","554454","545221","545448","554185","549008","553120","554456","551323","557336","551241","555439","557660","548674","549113"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["gravity","entrance","attraction","banner","roadside","office","vending","allure","offering","entertainment"]}
