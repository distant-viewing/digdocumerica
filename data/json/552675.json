{"path":"552675.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rural, wintery scene where a man is working outdoors with two horses. The man is standing on a wooden flatbed of a traditional horse-drawn cart. He appears to be engaged in either loading or unloading hay, as he handles a pitchfork digging into a large hay bale.\n\nThe man is dressed warmly for winter weather, wearing a hat, gloves, a long-sleeve shirt, and a denim jacket. His attire suggests he is accustomed to outdoor labor in cold conditions. The two sturdy horses harnessed to the cart have thick coats and are equipped with bridles and heavy harnesses, indicating their use for work. They are attentively facing forward, likely waiting for the next command or movement of the cart.\n\nThe background features a broad, snow-covered landscape with rolling hills and sparse vegetation. There are trees dotted around, and the distant hills have a light dusting of snow, enhancing the serene and chilly atmosphere of the scene. The sky is overcast, suggesting a typical grey, cold winter day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph reveals a moment of rural life that is both picturesque and indicative of the regular duties in farm life, especially in a wintery setting.","title":"Frank Starbuck, last of the old time ranchers near Fairview, manages a spread of 1300 acres and 400 head of cattle. He does it alone because it is too difficult and expensive to get help. Starbuck finds it easier to feed his livestock from a horse drawn wagon or sled than from a truck or tractor.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552679","552676","555538","552557","546996","546986","549198","552562","555539","552677","551158","552678","552564","555534","557751","553114"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cart","wintery","horse","hay","harness","dusting","snow","bridle","bale","command"]}
