{"path":"544620.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic wetland scene rich with wildlife activity. The setting is a calm body of shallow water that reflects the soft blues and greys of the sky. Perched on a muddy landform in the center are a variety of bird species, primarily white in color, including what appear to be egrets and perhaps a couple of spoonbills, recognizable by their distinctive pinkish hue and spoon-shaped bills.\n\nSeveral of these birds are standing upright, surveying their surroundings, while a few are engaged in searching for food in the muddy bank. This dynamic adds an element of liveliness to the tranquil waterscape. In the sceneâ€™s background and to the right, lush green mangrove trees can be seen projecting out over the water, increasing the sense of a rich, biodiverse habitat.\n\nThe backdrop features more extended greenery and large expanses of water under an expansive sky, hinting at a remote, undisturbed location. The upper right portion of the image captures a bird in mid-flight, enhancing the overall dynamic of wildlife activity and contributing to the narrative of this vibrant ecosystem. \n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests late afternoon or early evening, with softer light casting subtle shadows and enriching the color palette. The composition successfully captures both the serene beauty and the abundant life typical of a wetland ecosystem.","title":"Chokoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545991","544838","548729","545967","557123","552910","544493","550388","547500","547489","544506","557121","557495","547488","550670","544624"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","dynamic","wetland","wildlife","ecosystem","egret","mangrove","waterscape","liveliness","landform"]}
