{"path":"547183.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a residential street, likely taken in the fall or winter as the trees are bare. Central in the image is an older model, dark green pickup truck driving down the street towards the viewer. The truck has a square body typical of older vehicle designs and shows no visible signs of occupants from this angle.\n\nOn both sides of the street, large trees with bare branches line the view, indicating a cooler season. The sky is slightly overcast, casting a diffuse light over the scene without strong shadows.\n\nTo the right of the photo, there is noticeable smoke rising from a pile of what appears to be leaves at the roadside, suggesting seasonal yard cleanup activities such as leaf burning. The smoke is dense and white, drifting across the road and partially enveloping the area.\n\nA stop sign is visible on the left side of the road, positioned at a corner where another road intersects the one on which the truck is traveling. The environment suggests a quiet, suburban neighborhood with well-established trees and homes set back from the road, barely visible in the background behind the blanket of smoke and the trees.","title":"Burning leaves near Bass Lake","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["545419","556986","556429","558039","544262","545062","552079","554832","556435","550315","550101","544061","544767","550187","550173","552077"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["truck","smoke","road","street","burning","cleanup","occupant","stop","pickup","leaf"]}
