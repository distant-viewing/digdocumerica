{"path":"549340.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph displays an older man in the foreground with a serious expression. He is wearing a white shirt, and his hair is partially grey, swept to the side. The background is particularly striking and features an elaborate, densely populated array of fish species illustrated on a chart. The chart includes a variety of fish in different shapes, colors, and sizes, arranged in seemingly systematic rows. The fishes appear to be scientifically categorized, given the presence of labels and some text which are not distinctly visible. The overall ambiance of the image suggests it might depict a scholar, scientist, or enthusiast in the field of marine biology or a similar discipline, reflecting an educational or research-based setting.","title":"Dr.  Sergije kvender, chief of the laboratory for organic production and biochemistry at the rovenj branch of the ruder boskovic institute","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["551589","549346","547856","546353","553095","550297","545169","554096","551598","546285","552878","553657","552273","543484","546308","546270"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["chart","fish","biology","sweep","scientist","enthusiast","strik","species","marine","research"]}
