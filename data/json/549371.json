{"path":"549371.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph shows a sizable boat named \"M/V VELEBITA\" navigating on the water. The vessel has a white and navy blue color scheme, and prominently displays its name at the front on the hull. The boat features a cabin with windows on the deck area and has additional structures possibly for navigation and communication purposes, with visible antennas and lights mounted on the top. There is an individual visible on the deck, adding a human element to the scene.\n\nIn the background, there is a calm shore lined with dense green trees and a few visible buildings that blend with the natural environment, suggesting a serene, possibly coastal setting. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a muted tone, which contrasts with the vibrant greens of the trees and the color details on the ship.\n\nThe water around the boat appears calm, with gentle ripples indicating movement. The overall composition of the photograph captures a peaceful maritime scene, focusing on the boat as it moves through the water near the shore.","title":"The Vila Velebita II, research ship of the Ruder Boskovic Institute, heads out to sea.","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["549263","549266","549264","549380","545057","549383","552050","549374","542908","552292","552296","549411","555693","549613","548247","551222"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","deck","name","v","shore","antenna","communication","navigation","scheme","hull"]}
