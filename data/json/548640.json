{"path":"548640.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of a coastal or island area, featuring a prominently structured land formation. The land is divided into multiple rectangular compartments or sections that seem paved or barren, surrounded by what appears to be water channels or shallow waterways. These divisions create a geometric pattern that could be interpreted as part of a salt evaporation pond, aquaculture farm, or some sort of water treatment facility.\n\nThe overall color tone of these areas is a stark white or very light gray, contrasting sharply with the dark blue and green hues of the surrounding waters. There is no visible vegetation on the divided land parts, suggesting a non-agricultural use.\n\nAround the structured area, there is a natural landscape that includes more lush greenery, indicating some vegetation and possibly a more fertile land outside the segmented zones. To one side of the image, there appears to be a built-up area with structures that could be residential or commercial, located alongside a road. The background extends to more natural, undeveloped land interspersed with bodies of water and patches of greenery. The vast expanse of water surrounding the structured land suggests that this might be situated near the coast or on a large lake.","title":"Land development on Rampod Key near the western tip of the Florida Keys. View shows the typical scraped land and \"plugged\" canals of the developers. Permits to dig waterways to the sea are hard to get. Hence the practice of digging the canals just short of open water.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548635","550405","548602","545024","548779","544782","548631","555863","548600","544670","543697","548601","544572","544635","555860","551575"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["land","aquaculture","division","water","salt","compartment","coast","treatment","sort","channel"]}
