{"path":"545619.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial operation at the base of an imposing red rock cliff. The cliff dominates the background, displaying distinctive horizontal strata and appearing robust and monumental in the landscape. Below the cliff, at the base, there is a stretch of land being used for what seems to be salt evaporation ponds. These ponds are arranged in a series of parallel lines that have a light hue, likely due to the saltwater within them. \n\nA large yellow bulldozer is visible, actively engaged in work, situated near a cluster of dark, possibly muddy or wet ground, suggesting recent activity or movement. This machinery adds a dynamic, industrial element to the otherwise natural and stationary background.\n\nThe landscape around the ponds is arid, with tones of red and brown that match the cliff, suggesting a desert environment. The overall setting gives the impression of a harsh, dry area being utilized for industrial purposes. The contrast between the natural, ancient cliff formations and the mechanical, modern human activity creates a striking visual narrative about the use of natural landscapes for industrial processes.","title":"Potash plants form the most visible alteration of the natural environment between Moab and the canyonlands.
