{"path":"555245.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a man working inside a storage area, likely a warehouse or similar industrial setting. The man is dressed in protective work attire, which includes a yellow hard hat, a mask with a filter (covering his nose and mouth), a short sleeve shirt, and an apron. He is wearing gloves and handling a hose from which a liquid is being transferred into a large, dark drum. The drum features prominent warning labels, including a skull and crossbones symbol indicative of hazardous content, and additional hazard identification markings and text.\n\nThe background reveals rows of similar drums, organized in shelves and filled with variously labeled chemicals. This setting suggests an environment where chemical handling or similar activities are conducted. The lighting is somewhat dim with a focus on the man and the drum he is working with, suggesting a careful operation possibly involving hazardous materials.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a scene from a workplace focused on safety and proper handling of potentially dangerous substances. The use of protective gear underscores the hazardous nature of the tasks being performed.","title":"An Environmental Protection Agency pesticides inspector wears a protective mask and apron as he draws a bulk sample of toxic liquid (methyl parathion) from a container during a routine inspection at the Valley Chemical Company, Greenville, Mississippi.
