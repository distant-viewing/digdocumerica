{"path":"549692.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside what appears to be a vehicle testing or research facility. The foreground is dominated by a silhouette of a person, probably a man, with the back of his head and shoulders in view. This silhouette is leaning slightly forward, observing something in the middle ground, which contains complex machinery and a large control panel with various buttons and dials, possibly used for monitoring or controlling the testing process.\n\nIn the middle ground, through a large window or viewing area, another individual wearing a white lab coat is seen attending to a white car mounted on a testing platform. The car is a four-door sedan, likely from the mid-20th century, identifiable by its boxy shape and prominent features typical of the era's automotive design. The setting includes various mechanical and diagnostic equipment surrounding the vehicle, suggesting a focus on automotive performance or safety testing.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is dimly lit, with a focus on the brightly illuminated testing area seen through the window, creating a contrast that centers attention on the activities involving the car. The setting conveys a sense of industrial or scientific rigor, with attention to detail and precision.","title":"In the evaluation and development control room at the EPA motor vehicle emission laboratory at Ann Arbor, a technician evaluates a catalytic converter--one type of emission control device.","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["557855","549689","557850","542762","557859","542763","557851","557897","557891","557848","549690","557906","557905","553895","557889","553329"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["testing","control","car","silhouette","precision","dial","lab","attend","monitor","attention"]}
