{"path":"547887.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photo shows a man engaged in the whimsical activity of admiring a very large and colorful ice cream sundae. The sundae is held with both hands and appears towering with multiple scoops of ice cream in different colors - predominantly green, white, and pink. Topping the sundae is a red cherry. The man is drinking from the sundae using straws, and he looks amused and engrossed by it.\n\nHe is dressed in a dark blue jacket over a striped yellow and white shirt, and his attire seems casual, slightly disheveled even, which contrasts playfully with the careful presentation of the dessert. His expression is focused, almost comedic, as he closely eyes the sundae.\n\nThe setting appears to be an outdoor area, with a water body visible in the background that suggests a seaside or lakeside location. Part of a railing and some cards or photographs displayed for sale on the railing are visible, hinting that this might be a tourist or popular public area.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the joyful, slightly humorous interaction between the man and the oversized dessert in a casual public setting, enhancing the playful and indulgent nature of the event.","title":"Sustenance for the inner man at the sheepshead bay annual art show","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554495","558349","548540","555390","553161","558183","556213","551845","553211","553212","554268","553204","557764","558190","548544","545452"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["cream","ice","railing","dishevel","scoop","card","presentation","seaside","straw","engross"]}
