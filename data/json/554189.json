{"path":"554189.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene onboard a crowded river tour boat. The view is from the rear of the boat, looking forward toward the bow, showcasing rows of passengers seated in black lattice-backed chairs. The passengers, a diverse group of adults and children, are mostly facing forward, suggesting they are observing or listening to something at the front of the boat. A few individuals are turned sideways, engaged in conversation or looking out towards the river.\n\nThe interior of the boat has a white roof supported by metal beams, which provides shade to the passengers. Natural light filters in, illuminating the area and highlighting the details of everyone aboard. The environment outside the window suggests a scenic riverside setting, with visible trees and rocky outcrops, reflecting a relaxed or touristic atmosphere.\n\nClothing styles indicate a mix of casual and leisure wear, typical of a sightseeing excursion, and the era suggested by the hairstyles and clothing styles seems to be from the late 20th century. Overall, the atmosphere is one of relaxed observation and social interaction, typical of a sightseeing boat tour.","title":"Near the town of Wisconsin dells the Wisconsin river channels through deep, soft sandstone cliffs, cutting the rock into fantastic shapes.  These natural splendors have given rise to a booming tourist industry.  People come in droves, often in campers and trailers.
