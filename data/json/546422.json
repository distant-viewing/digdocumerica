{"path":"546422.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This image captures a commercial construction site in progress. The scene is largely dominated by large buildings under construction. In the foreground, there are scattered construction materials, including several piles of long, metal structural beams that are laid out on the ground. Loose wooden planks and dirt piles are also visible.\n\nIn the background, the main focus is on two partially constructed buildings. The building to the left features a large cylindrical structure adjacent to a rectangular building with exposed steel frameworks, showing no external walls yet. Seemingly, it has a complex, possibly multi-purpose design. The building on the right seems to be in a later stage of construction, cloaked mostly in dark protective mesh or netting, with scaffolding visible along its curved structure.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, suggesting variability in the construction conditions, and there are no visible workers, which might imply the picture was taken during a non-working moment or from a distance to focus on the site itself without human activity. The overall setting appears to be a busy but currently inactive construction zone with much work still to be done.","title":"Construction of Fodrea Community School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["549640","549128","547977","548552","547829","547235","544167","555373","548551","547833","546418","546414","549912","547914","556642","543583"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["construction","netting","variability","pile","building","site","scaffolding","mesh","progress","plank"]}
