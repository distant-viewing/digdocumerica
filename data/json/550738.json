{"path":"550738.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a broad, tumultuous waterfall cascading over a series of ledges in a lush landscape. The roaring falls create a dramatic foreground, with foamy water churning over rocky outcrops and spreading out into a wide river. The water is a muddy brown, suggesting either high sediment content or a recent rainfall swelling the river.\n\nIn the background, a tree-lined bank on the far side of the river supports several buildings, including a prominent red brick building with a distinctive white cupola. This building, along with others, suggests a small town setting. The green foliage of the trees contrasts with the urban architecture, providing a scenic blend of natural and man-made environments.\n\nThe sky is cloudy, casting an overcast light which saturates the colors of the landscape—deep greens of the trees and the rich brown of the river—enhancing the moody and powerful scene of natural forces at play. The overall composition frames the waterfall as the central subject, supported by the serene yet lively backdrop of the town, all enveloped in a tranquil, slightly somber atmospheric light.","title":"Lower falls at the town of Livermore Falls on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550736","553389","557745","550697","553354","542699","553349","549563","549562","558087","544456","553386","553387","545874","542594","555699"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","river","town","brown","saturate","churn","support","ledge","outcrop","rainfall"]}
