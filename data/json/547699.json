{"path":"547699.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph features an iconic view of the Chrysler Building, a classic example of Art Deco architecture located in New York City. The building is captured close to the frame's left border, showcasing its distinctive tiered crown and sleek, pointed spire. Its metallic facades gleam subtly as they ascend skywards, ending in an array of curved, overlapping arches near the top.\n\nIn the background to the right, a murky, haze-filled skyline is visible, possibly indicative of smog or fog over the city. Through the haze, the silhouettes of three smokestacks stand out, emitting no visible smoke, aligned vertically in the photograph. They are part of a distant structure, possibly a power plant or industrial facility, which contrasts with the elegant lines of the Chrysler Building.\n\nBeneath the haze, parts of other buildings can be seen, though details are obscured by the atmospheric conditions and the quality of light. The overall atmosphere of the image is somewhat somber due to the muted colors and the obscured, foggy skyline, emphasizing the Chrysler Building's prominence and distinct architectural beauty amidst less distinct surroundings. The image has an overall vintage feel, possibly from an older photograph, as suggested by the grain and color saturation typical of film from earlier decades.","title":"Chrysler building","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548337","548345","548319","548378","548386","548360","548408","555735","548421","550011","555741","549856","550198","552395","550186","550007"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["haze","skyline","crown","example","smog","gleam","overlap","prominence","spire","ascend"]}
