{"path":"557097.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals outdoors engaged in an activity that appears to be either plant collection or environmental study. The scene is set in a natural grassland area punctuated by a mix of dense and scattered trees under clear skies. The terrain is gently rolling hills providing a distant horizon lined with more trees.\n\nOn the left, there is a young man with light hair, dressed in a green short-sleeve shirt and blue jeans. He is bending over, looking closely at something on the ground, possibly examining or collecting a specimen.\n\nTo the right, another man with dark hair tied back into a ponytail is also bent over. He is wearing a white or light-colored long-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and is holding something, likely a tool or a container, perhaps for collecting samples.\n\nThe overall composition and the presence of portable equipment suggest that their activity is methodical and related to fieldwork, possibly scientific or educational. The area appears serene and isolated, ideal for detailed environmental or biological studies.","title":"Ken Babcock, right, a native of Doniphan County Kansas, and a youth examine some of the plants in an overgrazed prairie area bordered by forest. A biology teacher at Highland Community College in Highland, near Troy, Kansas, Babcock is well versed in the area's natural history. Northeast Kansas is unique because it contains the only hardwood forest in the state in addition to tallgrass prairie.","placename":"Highland (Kan.)","location":"Highland, Kansas","nn1":["556991","546312","546345","558108","553638","546300","554049","544821","558078","545493","549059","544003","543802","547718","546307","546346"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["study","ponytail","sleeve","jean","specimen","fieldwork","grassland","sample","hair","collection"]}
