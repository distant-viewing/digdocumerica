{"path":"543761.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph shows an elevated aerial view of a striking landscape. At the forefront is a large body of water, which appears as a deep blue reflecting the sky above, perhaps a lake. It is surrounded by a fairly barren terrain; the fields vary in shades from olive green to brown, suggesting sparse vegetation or agricultural activity. \n\nA winding road runs adjacent to the lake, enhancing the image's depth by leading the eye across the terrain. Several smaller paths and possibly a smaller body of water can also be seen in the vicinity of the main lake, contributing to a complex yet organic composition of land and water.\n\nIn the background, a majestic mountain rises prominently. Its top is capped with snow, indicating a higher altitude and climatic variation from the surrounding region. The mountain's slopes exhibit hues of dark and light brown, suggesting rocky and possibly grass-covered areas.\n\nThe sky above is mostly clear with few scattered clouds, casting natural light that vividly enhances the colors and features of the landscape. This lighting, along with the deep blues of the lake and the stark contrast between the earthly tones, paints a serene yet rugged natural scenery. The composition of the photograph, with its vast skyscape, rugged terrain, reflective water, and dominant mountain, evokes a sense of tranquility and vastness.","title":"Miramonte reservoir","placename":"Colorado","location":"Colorado","nn1":["550599","555712","550641","555692","555683","555695","543643","550611","555690","552904","552894","550413","543816","548974","552906","555669"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["lake","mountain","paths","forefro","terrain","bry","blu","rug","water","variation"]}
