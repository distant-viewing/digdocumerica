{"path":"557384.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures the imposing and industrial structure of a power plant or a similar heavy industrial facility. The image focuses on the side of the building showing several large, ribbed smokestacks rising prominently. These smokestacks, four in total, are cylindrical with distinct narrowing bands and widening sections, each capped with what appears to be mesh or grid-like structures possibly for emission control or dispersal.\n\nThe smokestacks are supported and connected to a massive, dark-colored building that exhibits a series of rectangular and sloped architectural features, which could function as part of the air intake or exhaust system. The side of this building shows some visible openings and framed structures suggesting heavy machinery or installation points.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there is a complex network of electrical infrastructure. This includes multiple high-voltage transmission towers constructed of metal, with cross-arms supporting a number of wires and insulators. This set-up is typical for distributing electricity generated at the plant to the grid.\n\nThe background of the image is relatively simple and sky-dominated, showing a clear or slightly overcast day, providing a contrast that highlights the industrial silhouette of the plant facility. The composition of the photograph underscores the industrial might and technological complexity of the facility, emphasizing the scale and importance of infrastructure in energy production.","title":"Union Carbide power plant is equipped with precipitators and smokes very little. The metallurgical furnaces' emissions have been decreased 97.7 percent since 1967. The corporation and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission reached an agreement on a compliance schedule on the furnaces in 1970 and on the powerhouse in 1969. EPA stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards. (see fiche)","placename":"Alloy (W.
