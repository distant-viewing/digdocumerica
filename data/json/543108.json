{"path":"543108.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph appears to depict a rural, coastal setting under an overcast sky. There is a wooden post prominently displayed in the left foreground with the inscriptions \"Sea Way\" and \"Cypress Loop\", suggesting the location is near the sea and possibly part of a walking or hiking trail. The path is made of dirt and runs horizontally across the photo from the left to the right side, leading towards a coastal area.\n\nTo the right, behind the post and along the trail, there are a number of poles with yellow and orange plastic ribbons tied around them, perhaps indicating some sort of boundary or demarcated area for conservation. Further down along the path, thereâ€™s what looks like a makeshift billboard or stand displaying numerous placards, with illegible content. This could be a signboard for local events, maps, or conservation information related to the area.\n\nTo the right of the dirt path and slightly in the background, a small structure with a roof that extends over what appears to be a large spool and other unidentified items can be seen. This setup might be used for storage or functional purposes related to local activities or maintenance.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate vicinity of the trail, there is a glimpse of a flat, tranquil water body, which could be a lagoon or a quiet segment of the sea. Adjacent to this water body, there are lush green fields and low-lying trees sporadically scattered, adding to the scenic, peaceful environment. The combination of sea, field, and vegetation suggests a secluded, natural location designed for leisure or mild outdoor activities.","title":"California--Marin County","placename":"Marin County (Calif.)","location":"Marin County, California","nn1":["547660","554085","548670","545294","546109","542870","545008","543420","547602","544220","544284","543270","550345","545141","545224","544554"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["trail","conservation","path","sea","post","signboard","lagoon","walking","ribbon","inscription"]}
