{"path":"550822.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lake scene featuring two individuals canoeing. The scene is bathed in a soft, dim light that suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon. The image is dominated by dark, calming tones, with glints of sunlight reflecting on the water's surface.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, a large, rugged rock formation juts out from the water, partially shadowed and covered with dark-green foliage, suggesting it might be mossy or wet. This rocky element adds a textural contrast to the otherwise smooth surface of the lake.\n\nAt the center and toward the right of the image, two people are visible in a small, dark canoe. They are paddling gently, with one person in the front and the other in the back, both wielding paddles. They appear relaxed, sporting informal outdoor attire and hats, which could be for protection against the sun.\n\nThe background features a line of densely wooded area, likely a forest that borders the lake. The trees are lush and create a thick natural barrier, contributing to the secluded and tucked-away feeling of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition and mood are tranquil and leisurely, emphasizing a connection with nature and a moment of peaceful exploration on the water. The lighting and focus lend a slightly mysterious or intimate quality to the photograph.","title":"Canoeing on the Wisconsin River at Wisconsin Dells, a popular recreation area","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544031","557563","547550","553806","550768","554474","554609","554466","553409","549996","545229","550324","550769","543951","552982","553345"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","paddle","lake","wield","glint","mossy","tuck","jut","protection","calm"]}
