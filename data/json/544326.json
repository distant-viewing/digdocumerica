{"path":"544326.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a man sitting at a small desk in a room with a playful and slightly disorganized ambiance. He has a joyful expression and is leaning on the desk with one elbow, resting his chin on his hand. He is wearing glasses and a t-shirt featuring a graphic design, suggesting a casual setting.\n\nThe background of the image is notable for its stark and eclectic decoration. There is a wall covered with colorful, oversized alphabet letters scattered in a random pattern, contributing to an artistic or educational vibe. Above this display is a simple wall clock showing the time, adding a practical element to the space.\n\nThe overall lighting in the room is dim, with subtle illumination coming from above, possibly from fluorescent lights. This setting, along with the presence of a paper bag and plastic cup on the desk, hints at a workspace possibly used for creative or informal academic activities. The dado and beams painted in different colors along the wall's edges and the visible ceiling infrastructure add to the room's casual, utilitarian feel.\n\nThis image captures a moment that seems both spontaneous and intimate, showcasing a personality-filled environment and a moment of relaxed engagement from the individual in the frame.","title":"An above-average home","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["553088","555297","557317","556250","547353","551897","546572","542690","547366","546580","548864","553517","552104","557695","556551","555417"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["desk","room","wall","playful","random","elbow","ching","clock","cup","workspace"]}
