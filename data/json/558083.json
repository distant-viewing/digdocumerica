{"path":"558083.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural setting with geological features prominently displayed. The scene is set in a forested area, with sunlight filtering through an abundance of trees featuring dense green foliage. The composition focuses on large, layered rock formations which dominate the foreground. These rock formations are flat-topped and have vertical striations indicating sedimentary layers, suggesting they are sandstone or a similar type of rock.\n\nThe rocks appear rugged and slightly mossy, blending naturally with the surrounding vegetation. Small bushes and leafy undergrowth partially obscure the base of the rocks and fill gaps between them. The background, illuminated by natural light, reveals further wooded areas, enhancing the depth and wild character of the setting.\n\nIn the distance, there appears to be a glimpse of a person loosely interacting with the environment, perhaps walking or seated, though they are mostly obscured by the landscape and foliage, emphasizing the scale and untouched nature of the environment. The photograph has a mix of shadow and light, offering a dynamic range of tones that highlight the textured surfaces of the rocks and the organic shapes of the trees.","title":"Rock ledges and trees offer beauty and solitude for hikers in the Virginia Kendall Park, part of the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system. The park is within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. The recreation area contains 30,000 acres of largely undeveloped land within a 20-mile stretch between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron. The National Park Service is working on a master plan for the area and must submit it by June, 1976.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["544341","558086","544898","552891","554596","554410","555592","545797","549197","552685","545589","544902","549228","543549","543838","553135"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","formation","mossy","striation","abundance","gap","layer","foliage","character","filter"]}
