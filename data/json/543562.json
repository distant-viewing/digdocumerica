{"path":"543562.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of several thin grass blades or similar plants covered in frost. The intricate details of frost crystals are clearly visible, clinging tightly along the slender lengths of each stalk. This phenomenon often occurs when the dew on the plants freezes, giving each blade a delicate, sugary coating.\n\nThe grass blades are positioned vertically, ascending from the bottom to the top of the image, creating a textured and dynamic visual. Lighting accents the frost crystals, highlighting their geometric forms and making them sparkle against a dim, blurred background. This background lacks definitive shapes, providing a stark, dark contrast that enhances the visibility and impact of the frost-covered blades in the foreground.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on the interaction between the light and the frost, the delicate balance of natureâ€™s artistry, showcasing the beauty in everyday natural phenomena. There is a sense of calmness and quiet in the image, indicative of a cold, early morning when such frost is most commonly found.","title":"Frost - touched grass","placename":"Tahoe National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe National Forest, California","nn1":["557200","555005","557197","555184","557199","543565","543564","543560","553853","543167","557201","547312","543098","557196","557198","552485"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["frost","blade","artistry","phenomena","phenomenon","freeze","dew","stalk","cling","sparkle"]}
