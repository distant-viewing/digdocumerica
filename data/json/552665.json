{"path":"552665.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a cattle show or livestock competition. The setting is an outdoor arena with sandy ground, surrounded by metal railings, and partially covered by a large, roofed structure that extends towards a bright outdoor area visible in the background.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, three young participants are handling their respective cattle, each wearing distinct outfits typically worn at such events. Two of the individuals are on the left side, handling a large cow with a white and brown spotted coat. The third participant, on the right, is managing a solid black cow. These participants are dressed in western-style attire, including cowboy hats, collared shirts, and jeans, with belts featuring large buckles and numbers on their backs (30 and 214), which likely serve as identifiers for the competition.\n\nThe background is bustling with other competitors and spectators. People of various ages can be seen watching the events, some standing and some seated on bleachers partially visible beyond the metal railings. Most individuals wear casual or semi-casual wear, and many also sport cowboy hats, reflecting the cultural setting of the event.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph suggests a vibrant community event focused on livestock handling, with a strong sense of competition and tradition evident in the attire and engagement of the participants and audience.","title":"Garfield County Fair.
