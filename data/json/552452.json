{"path":"552452.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This is a photograph of a cemetery during the daytime. The focus of the image is a gravestone that features an engraved inscription. The gravestone is relatively traditional, with a base supporting a large, horizontal rectangular stone laid atop an upright rectangular pillar. The engraved inscription on the pillar reads, \"CLARA E. / WIFE OF / I.L. CRIST / DIED JAN. 8, 1886 / AGED 24 YEARS.\"\n\nAround the gravestone, there is dense vegetation, primarily large, leafy plants with no visible flowers, suggesting it might be an overgrown part or less frequently maintained section of the cemetery. Beyond the immediate area of the gravestone, the landscape opens up to a grassy area with gentle undulations. The horizon shows more greenery and there is a sparse distribution of other gravestones around, indicating that it's a rather calm, solitary, and peaceful setting typical of many rural cemeteries. The sky is clear and blue, making the overall ambiance serene and reflective.","title":"Graveyard in Hermon","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["547417","554210","546098","554206","557942","557941","550365","547801","546147","555566","545357","544267","552683","552451","545314","550364"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["gravestone","cemetery","inscription","pillar","undulation","distribution","year","daytime","base","flower"]}
