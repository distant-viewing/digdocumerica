{"path":"558319.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"McTaggart, James","caption":"The photograph features an elderly woman in a contemplative or prayerful pose. She appears deep in thought or possibly praying, with her hands clasped in front of her chin. Her attire includes thick, black-rimmed glasses and a warm, dark green cardigan over a patterned blouse. The image is taken in profile with the woman's face partly lit, enhancing the contours and wrinkles that mark her experiences and age.\n\nHer hair is gray and styled in a soft, voluminous manner, typical of an older woman. The lighting is moody and dim, focusing on her face and hands, leaving the background dark and indistinct which helps to isolate her as the central figure and draws attention to her expression and activity. This kind of lighting and composition emphasizes the solemn and introspective nature of the moment captured in the image.","title":"Older citizens, retired persons and those unable to take care of themselves physically are taken care of in two community centers. This woman lives at the Alexander Home adjacent to Loretto Hospital, both Catholic-supported facilities. New Ulm is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["556594","556414","555530","545373","553499","554051","558320","553484","556452","551439","558327","543701","555975","553482","543864","552871"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["woman","face","chin","cardigan","kind","hand","manner","thought","profile","experience"]}
