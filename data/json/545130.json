{"path":"545130.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic coastal scene, most likely taken from an elevated viewpoint. The main focus is a series of tall, jagged rock formations or sea stacks that rise sharply from the ocean. These rocks are scattered throughout the water, creating a rugged, textured landscape against the sea.\n\nIn the foreground, the largest rock formation dominates the view. It features sharp, angular slopes and is covered with what appears to be a light coat of moss or similar vegetation, suggesting a slightly darker color than the bare rock surfaces. Smaller rocks and formations are scattered around it, contributing to the scene's wild and natural appearance.\n\nTo the left, the coast tapers into a sandy beach framed by dense, evergreen forest on rising cliffs. The trees look lush, indicating a possibly temperate climate. The coastline curves gracefully into the distance, where further forested hills can be observed fading into the horizon under a pale sky.\n\nThe ocean itself is relatively calm but shows some gentle wave activity around the base of the rock formations, emphasizing their ruggedness. The sky above is cloudy, casting a diffuse light that softens the shadows and colors of the landscape, creating a serene yet formidable natural scene. The overall mood is one of tranquil isolation and the raw beauty of an untouched coastal environment.","title":"Rocky coastline","placename":"Seaside (Or.)","location":"Seaside, Oregon","nn1":["545122","542917","545173","543060","543307","543068","543250","543295","543243","553775","543061","543291","553771","543092","545126","543289"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rock","formation","coastal","ocean","taper","sea","coast","fading","rise","ruggedness"]}
