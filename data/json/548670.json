{"path":"548670.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor, seemingly tropical scene that includes a mix of natural and man-made elements. The foreground prominently features a wooden sign with the words \"SNOOK LANE\" painted in yellow on a dark background. The sign is inserted into a sandy ground, highlighted by a few clusters of red flowers near its base.\n\nBehind the sign, a young palm tree stands to the left, its fronds slightly weathered, contributing to a slightly rugged, natural ambiance. The background extends into an area covered with white sand and sparse vegetation, including more palm trees and small shrubby plants, which populate the landscape in a scattered formation. The area includes a few wooden picnic tables, suggesting a recreational or picnic spot.\n\nThe sky overhead is partly cloudy, hinting at an overcast day, which casts a soft, diffuse light over the scene, enhancing the tranquil and serene mood of a quiet outdoor setting. Overall, the composition of this photograph, with its blend of natural scenery and a quaint man-made signpost, evokes a sense of peaceful isolation, likely in a coastal or island environment.","title":"Campsite at Ohio, or \"sunshine\" key.
