{"path":"544124.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene focused on the operation of mining or processing raw materials. The view is taken from the middle of a long conveyor belt system that stretches into the distance, transporting a large quantity of coal or similar black mineral. The conveyor is framed by green handrails and is lined on both sides with high concrete barriers to contain the material.\n\nTo the left of the conveyor belt are large piles of the black material, and beyond that, the structure continues with more conveyor systems and machinery, integral to the processing or transportation of the mined product. The industrial setting is barren; no vegetation is visible and the ground around is mostly barren and covered in the same black material. \n\nIn the background, the sky is slightly overcast, blending with the industrial atmosphere. Another prominent element in the scene is a large industrial vehicle to the right in the distance, resembling a hauling truck or a mobile crane, contributing to the operational landscape.\n\nThe entire photograph communicates a sense of ongoing, heavy industrial activity, focusing on the extraction or movement of natural resources with little or no human presence visible, emphasizing the scale and mechanization of the operation.","title":"Strip mining at Black Mesa in hopi territory has raised question of run-off and possible destruction of hopi agriculture","placename":"Black Mesa (Navajo County and Apache County, Ariz.)","location":"Black Mesa, Arizona","nn1":["544120","551035","553013","551037","549168","543169","554764","544048","556387","556466","556602","546055","546255","557403","556520","551036"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["conveyor","material","belt","system","around","handrail","quantity","operation","extraction","coal"]}
