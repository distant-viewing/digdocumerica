{"path":"544650.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view that captures a coastal industrial landscape, likely related to water or land management given the infrastructure visible.\n\n**Foreground and Middle Ground:**\nIn the lower portion of the image and extending towards the center, there is a large body of water that appears calm, showcasing different shades of blue and green. A dredging operation is evident in the water, with one large vessel linked by pipes to a smaller structure. Yellow discharges, possibly sand, silt, or another substance, emerge from the dredger and form swirling patterns in the water, tracing the path of the operation.\n\n**Infrastructure:**\nRunning diagonally from the bottom right to the middle of the image, a raised narrow pathway, likely a pier or jetty, is built over the water. It has some machinery and parked cars, indicating ongoing activities and access for vehicles. Parallel to this, another similar structure can be seen, contributing further to the sense of an active industrial site.\n\n**Background:**\nThe far background shows a flat, expansive area with additional water bodies, interconnected through narrow channels that might be man-made for water management purposes. Sparse vegetation dots the landscape, and a few buildings can be seen in the distance, suggesting some form of human habitation or industrial facilities.\n\n**Sky and Lighting:**\nThe sky is clear with a few scattered clouds, suggesting it's a bright sunny day. The clarity of the sky contributes to the visibility and vivid colors in the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph blends industrial activity with a coastal environment, focusing on human intervention in a natural setting, possibly for resource extraction or land development. The perspective is broad, giving an overview of the scale and scope of the operations as well as the surrounding environment.","title":"Reclaiming land Marco Island","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551606","551612","551607","544636","544639","551574","552206","551976","556912","548774","549470","550890","551609","552167","548346","544635"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["water","operation","management","dredging","discharge","silt","scope","jetty","overview","land"]}
