{"path":"547174.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in an urban alleyway. In the foreground, a shiny, silver car is parked, with its trunk slightly facing the camera, displaying a license plate that reads \"DR 7116\". On the right side of the image, a truck is parked with its back open, revealing bales or sacks that appear to be full of some material.\n\nThere are three individuals engaging in different activities: one individual is climbing a ladder at the back of the truck, seemingly arranging or securing the bales. This person is dressed in a maroon shirt and dark pants. Another individual, wearing a dark uniform and cap, possibly a worker or guard, is standing on the ground near the truck, observing the first person's activities. The third individual, a woman with blonde hair wearing a black coat with fur trim and red shoes, is seen walking away from the scene towards the left.\n\nThe alleyway is flanked by tall, aged buildings with exposed brickwork, adding to the gritty, industrial or old-town feel of the setting. Thereâ€™s minimal vegetation, enhancing the stark, urban environment captured in this moment. The lighting suggests it might be a cloudy day, providing a soft but clear visibility. The photograph conveys a sense of everyday urban activity, possibly related to delivery or transport, set in a less-glamorous but character-rich environment.","title":"Paper collection truck in rogers park holds up traffic","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["555940","547075","549850","549866","549837","549832","546653","545321","549867","545343","544087","555817","552800","553488","555944","554309"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["alleyway","bale","truck","individual","back","guard","sack","delivery","brickwork","ladder"]}
