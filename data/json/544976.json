{"path":"544976.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a captivating coastal scene, likely from an elevated vantage point on a rugged hillside, offering a glimpse of maritime activity. In the foreground is a sloping, rocky terrain interspersed with grass and small shrubbery, indicative of a somewhat arid environment. The dry, brown and orange hues of the grass blend into the dark rocks, emphasizing a natural, untouched landscape.\n\nNear the bottom of the image, partially obscured by the terrain and vegetation, is a rusted piece of machinery, resembling an old car or tractor. This adds a hint of historical or abandoned human activity amid the natural setting.\n\nDominating the midground are two lone trees, weathered yet resilient, standing against the wind with branches pointing in a direction that suggests regular exposure to sea breezes. These trees serve as a striking natural feature against the coastal backdrop.\n\nThe background showcases the main activity in the photographâ€”an industrial boat towing a barge, navigating through calm blue waters. The boat, equipped with what appears to be a crane and other heavy machinery, suggests operations linked to either fishing, cargo transport, or possibly marine construction. The wake created by the boat adds a dynamic element to the otherwise serene water surface.\n\nThis scene juxtaposes elements of industry and nature, highlighting human influence on a rugged coastline while showing the persistence of the natural environment in the face of development. The composition of the photograph, from the arid front to the industrious back, paints a picture of geographical and functional contrasts.","title":"Along the coast of San Juan Island","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552000","545277","552167","543298","542870","543405","547109","552192","555694","544650","544383","543175","556923","544670","545191","547572"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["boat","tow","machinery","tractor","breeze","shrubbery","barge","wake","grass","point"]}
