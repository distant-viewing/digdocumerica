{"path":"550349.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape, likely associated with a lumber or pulp processing facility. The foreground is filled with piles of wood chips, bark, and other byproducts of forestry operations, interspersed with patches of white residue, possibly sawdust or chemical deposits. The texture of these materials is rough, and the piles vary in color from dark brown to beige.\n\nIn the midground, we see what appears to be a body of water, stretching horizontally across the image, which suggests that this site could be near a river or large lake. This location might be used for transportation of logs or as a coolant source for factory operations.\n\nThe background features industrial structures, including silos and buildings with visible vents and stacks, probably part of the processing plant. There is also construction or handling equipment visible, hinting at ongoing operations or expansions. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting an open, expansive rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a working industrial area deeply involved in the processing of forest products, emphasizing the intersection of natural resource extraction and industrial activity. The environment suggests ongoing human intervention in a natural landscape, primarily for resource processing purposes.","title":"Waste bark and chemicals from the Georgia Pacific Paper Co piled alongside the St. Croix River.
