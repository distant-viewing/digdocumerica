{"path":"556139.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph captures a joyful young girl, possibly around 5 to 7 years old, bending towards the camera with a playful and bright smile. She has dark skin and her black hair is styled in two neat, side-parted ponytails secured with large white bows. The girl is wearing a dark navy or black cardigan over a pink turtleneck with patterned detailing. \n\nThe background is soft and blurred, primarily green, suggesting it might be a grassy area in a park or a garden, conveying a serene and natural setting. The lighting is natural, highlighting the girl's face and expressions vividly, with a touch of sunshine possibly enhancing the warmth of the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is cheerful and lively, capturing a moment of innocent playfulness in a pleasant outdoor environment. The focus is closely cropped around the girl, emphasizing her expression and making her the clear subject of the image.","title":"A young Black child, one of the nearly 1.2 million people of her race who make up over one third of Chicago's population. It is one of many Black faces in this project that portray life in all its seasons. The photos are portraits that reflect pride, love, beauty, hope, struggle, joy, hate, frustration, discontent, worship and faithâ€”in short, portraits of people who feel they are individuals and are proud of their heritage.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["553509","547813","556142","557843","555941","556143","556140","556301","558184","556138","556144","556135","549299","555979","543863","555436"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["girl","ponytail","playfulness","turtleneck","sunshine","navy","cardigan","bow","secure","expression"]}
