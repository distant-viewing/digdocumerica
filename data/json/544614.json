{"path":"544614.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph features two butterflies engaging with a flower. The main focal point is one butterfly that is perched directly atop a pale yellow flower, which appears to be a part of a cluster of small daisy-like blossoms. This butterfly has visible wear on its wings, with colorations in brown and hints of orange, as well as areas where the wing appears slightly tattered.\n\nThe second butterfly is captured in motion, primarily blurred, suggesting it is either landing on or taking off from the flower. This butterfly is positioned in the background, creating a dynamic sense of movement within the image.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly focused, hinting at a natural, outdoor setting with additional out-of-focus greenery that suggests these flowers are part of a larger field or garden. The overall lighting is soft, possibly indicating an overcast day, enhancing the delicate textures and subtle colors of the scene. The photograph has a somewhat vintage, grainy quality, adding to its naturalistic and serene feel.","title":"Butterflies and wild flowers in Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["544618","544619","544553","543603","544479","547818","544514","551381","544517","544566","544603","554839","554842","548283","545699","543623"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","flower","wing","daisy","grainy","landing","blossom","coloration","perch","orange"]}
