{"path":"552679.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural winter scene, featuring a person actively engaged in farm work. The individual, wearing a blue jacket and dark pants, is seen tossing a forkful of hay. The action is captured with a sense of movement as the hay is in mid-air between the pitchfork and a large pile of bales.\n\nThe backdrop of the scene is a snow-covered landscape with a hilly terrain. The gray, overcast sky suggests a cold, wintry day. Adjacent to the person working are hay bales stacked tall, forming a structured wall of hay. In the foreground, a wooden cart loaded with hay bales is visible, harnessed to two horses that appear ready to move. The cart wheels are equipped with modern-looking yellow rims, contrasting with the otherwise rustic setting.\n\nThe ground is partially covered with snow and hay, indicating recent activity in the area. A wooden fence aligns partially along the side with more hay scattered around, and some outbuildings or structures are faintly visible in the hazy background.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of winter farm life, emphasizing on manual labor and the maintenance of livestock, conveying a sense of cold yet active rural life.","title":"Rancher starbuck, working along, finds it easier to feed his livestock from a horse drawn wagon or sled than from a truck or tractor","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552675","552676","552678","552576","552578","551158","557754","551168","551167","557751","551169","552677","544888","555538","549258","552557"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hay","bale","cart","winter","snow","outbuilding","covered","rim","livestock","person"]}
