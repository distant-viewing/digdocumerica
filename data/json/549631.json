{"path":"549631.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph shows an interior view of a laboratory captured through a fisheye lens, which gives a wide, hemispherical image of the scene. The lab is equipped with various scientific apparatuses and equipment, including what appears to be glass containers, stands, tubes, gas cylinders, and operational machinery possibly for experiments. The lab has a series of ceiling-mounted lights which evenly illuminate the room.\n\nA central figure in the image is a person, dressed in a white lab coat, standing near the center, facing slightly towards the left of the frame. The person's attire suggests they might be a scientist, technician, or researcher. \n\nThe background, viewed in a curved perspective due to the lens, shows more of the laboratory environment, with counters lined with various other instruments and laboratory paraphernalia. The curved architecture of the roomâ€™s perimeter further enhances the effect of the fisheye lens, encapsulating the room in a dome-like view. The overall atmosphere is one of professional scientific research, with attention to detail and a well-equipped facility designed for advanced studies or experiments.","title":"EPA Gulf Coast Water Supply Research Laboratory at Dauphin Island","placename":"Mobile (Ala.)","location":"Mobile, Alabama","nn1":["549332","546284","555249","555250","555265","555281","546278","546344","548862","546277","555248","549607","549342","542666","549333","555280"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["lab","lens","laboratory","experiment","room","researcher","technician","cylinder","scientist","perimeter"]}
