{"path":"543396.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an energetic and happy scene at a beach. Three people, two of whom appear to be young women and one child, are immersed in the shallow waters of the ocean, enjoying the waves and the sunshine. They look lively, with one of the women and the child seeming to play or run through the water, creating splashes around them. Accompanying them is a large, happy-looking dog who is also enjoying the water, slightly ahead of the two closest to the viewer.\n\nThe beach setting is picturesque, with gentle waves coming in from the ocean. In the background, there are rocky outcrops along the coastline and a number of houses or structures are visible, nestled among dense greenery and trees. This suggests the beach might be near a residential area. The setting is sunny with a clear blue sky, giving a feel of a warm, pleasant day perfect for beach activities.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["545218","543395","543390","543463","553072","548695","544191","555923","553951","543458","543225","548697","553952","543072","550929","555892"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["beach","ocean","wave","sunshine","child","outcrop","dog","splash","woman","coastline"]}
