{"path":"544220.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a landscape dominated by a large sign at the forefront which reads \"NO PICNICKING ALLOWED,\" marked by weathering and wear, with rust and scratches on its surface. The sign is planted on a metal pole that is securely grounded into a dirt path. This path appears somewhat worn and leads towards a grassy field.\n\nIn the background, there is a vast open field covered with green grass, which gently slopes towards a large body of water, visible on the horizon. A lone figure, wearing yellow, stands in the distance facing the water. The figure adds a human element to the scene, suggesting solitude or contemplation. The overall ambiance is quiet and tranquil, enhanced by the overcast sky which casts a soft, diffused light over the scene, indicating it might be either early morning or later in the afternoon. The tree line to the right marginally frames the landscape, guiding the viewer's eye towards the expansive, open sky and water.","title":"Louisiana--Lake Pontchartrain","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["548248","545109","548672","553860","556943","550268","545224","549453","557659","543104","554453","544522","552211","555385","547049","556990"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["path","scratch","figure","field","weathering","guide","contemplation","rust","forefront","diffuse"]}
