{"path":"546748.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts a hazy, atmospheric landscape, primarily focusing on a serene, hilltop setting. Set against a backdrop of what appears to be a smog-filled skyline, probably from a distant urban center, the central feature is a large and elegant house positioned on a raised, lush green hill. The house is of substantial size, featuring multiple levels and large windows, typical of luxurious residential architecture.\n\nA winding driveway leads up to this hilltop residence, enhancing the secluded and exclusive feel of the location. The drive is bordered by meticulously maintained grass and some carefully placed smaller trees or bushes, adding to the aesthetic appeal of the approach.\n\nThe foreground and the area surrounding the hill are dotted with dense vegetation, predominantly trees and possibly some smaller shrubs or undergrowth, suggesting the area is well-vegetated and possibly part of a larger estate or parkland. In areas, this vegetation is thick, providing a contrast in texture and color to the built environments of both the house and the distant city. \n\nThe overall coloring of the photo is quite muted, with a dominance of blues and greens tinged with the haze of pollution, giving it a somewhat ethereal or moody quality. This might suggest environmental commentary or simply reflect the lighting conditions when the photo was taken. The sky above shows very gentle gradients from cooler to warmer tones, likely due to the time of day and atmospheric conditions. \n\nThis scene importantly captures a juxtaposition between natural beauty and urban development, emphasizing the isolation and prominent position of the residence within its environment.","title":"Smog over Phoenix","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["553458","556999","546367","552464","554721","550311","543106","558110","557669","557547","542967","556426","554787","556962","557552","553931"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["residence","house","estate","dominance","hilltop","smog","driveway","coloring","tinge","commentary"]}
