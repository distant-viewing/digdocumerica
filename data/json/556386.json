{"path":"556386.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a dimly lit industrial setting, likely within a warehouse or large workshop. The composition of the image centers on a large piece of machinery, labeled \"NORDBERG.\" The machine is robust and cylindrical with a light-colored exterior, probably metallic. It appears to be mounted on a sturdy framework or platform, suggesting that it is either in storage or undergoing maintenance.\n\nIn the background and to the sides of the main machinery, other similar machines or industrial components can be observed, although they are less distinct and fall partly into shadows, enhancing the focus on the central machine. The warehouse itself has a high ceiling with metal construction elements and very sparse lighting. There is a large open window or possibly a skylight on the roof, adding a natural light source which contrasts with the otherwise artificial illumination provided by hanging lamps. The general atmosphere conveyed is one of a working, utilitarian space dedicated to heavy machinery or industrial use.","title":"Pulleys that transport coal from below ground to the conveyor belts moving between the storage silo and the cleaning plant at the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia.
