{"path":"544519.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph showcases a scene that appears to balance elements of nature and man-made structures. In the foreground, there is a dense growth of tall wild grasses and assorted vegetation, creating a textured and wild natural landscape. The grasses vary in height and type, intermixed with small yellow wildflowers and other greenery, seemingly undisturbed and thriving. The natural setting has an untamed, rustic quality, almost reminiscent of an overgrown field.\n\nIn contrast, the background features large, imposing buildings that appear to be part of an industrial or scientific facility. There are several large structures with flat, boxy appearances, predominantly in shades of gray and brown. These buildings look severe and functional, with few visible windows and surrounded by minimal additional landscaping or decorative elements.\n\nThe overall composition contrasts the organic, disorderly forms of nature in the foreground against the geometric, orderly structures of the human-made environment in the background. The sky above is partly cloudy with noticeable fluffy white clouds floating in a bright blue sky, adding a level of depth and openness to the top part of the image. The photograph thus captures a striking juxtaposition between the natural world and human development, potentially hinting at themes of environmental impact, development, or coexistence.","title":"Florida International University of TaMiami Trail, U.S. 41","placename":"Dade County (Fla.)","location":"Dade County, Florida","nn1":["544523","544676","545989","555542","546170","548194","557530","545993","546534","545112","545998","546056","551134","552091","550764","545971"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["development","landscaping","openness","grass","wildflower","coexistence","world","growth","height","structure"]}
