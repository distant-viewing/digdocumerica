{"path":"552088.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph portrays a scene that appears to be on the banks of a river, with several activities and elements visible. On the left, there is a man with his arms crossed, wearing a white sleeveless shirt, dark pants, and a dark baseball cap. He has a watch on his left wrist and a tattoo on his left arm. He stands in a grassy area and appears to be observing something out of the frame.\n\nIn the middle and background of the image, one can see the river, which occupies the upper part of the composition with trees lining the opposite shore under a blue sky scattered with clouds. Notably, there are several small fires or burn piles along the bank, emitting smoke and flames, suggesting a clean-up activity or land clearing process.\n\nTo the right, an old, rusted tractor is partially visible, adding to the rural or industrial feel of the scene. It seems to be involved in the work happening in the area, possibly related to the fires and clearing being done.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere of the photograph blends natural beauty with human activity, possibly suggesting themes of land management, environmental modification, or rural life. The presence of the man and the tractor points to active human involvement and observation in this environment.","title":"Lawrence resident filled his pickup truck with debris, dumped it at river's edge and there set a match to it.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552085","550733","552087","547807","546916","552110","542543","551423","553380","548839","546338","551332","544994","545531","551519","543781"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["tractor","clearing","fire","bank","arm","modification","wrist","watch","flame","land"]}
