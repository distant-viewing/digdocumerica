{"path":"556634.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image captures two men engaged in a discussion over a set of blueprints or plans, which are placed on a light-colored, large concrete block outdoors under a clear sky. Both men appear focused on the documents, with the one on the left kneeling to get a closer look. They are depicted in a rugged terrain, characterized by low shrubs and dry grass.\n\nIn the background, the land stretches out into the distance with mountains partially visible under a vast, blue sky. An interesting aspect of the scene is the heap of piled white materials in the mid-ground, which contrasts sharply against the natural earth tones of the landscape. Itâ€™s a setting that suggests a construction site or a fieldwork scenario in a semi-arid region. The attire of the men, consisting of casual shirts and jeans, aligns with a work setting involving physical or outdoor activity.","title":"The owner of the third experimental house and architect Michael Reynolds, right, go over plans of the Taos, New Mexico, area house after the foundation is finished. This is the first of the houses to use aluminum beer and soft drink cans; the other two used empty steel cans. Reynolds switched because more aluminum beer and soft drink cans are aVailable now. The architect believes that can houses can be built for as much as 20% less than conventional structures.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["557727","556643","552781","555563","552366","555287","556635","542546","544969","552390","556642","547382","545672","542547","542607","548761"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["plan","fieldwork","document","heap","discussion","scenario","set","man","one","block"]}
