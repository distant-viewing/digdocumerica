{"path":"543202.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant coastal scene rich with flora and rocky topography. In the foreground, a dense spread of pink flowering plants covers the hillside, providing a lively splash of color. Among the pink blooms, patches of white flowering plants and green foliage can be seen, adding contrast and variety to the verdant expanse.\n\nBeyond the immediate blanket of flowers, the terrain transitions into a more rugged landscape characterized by sharply angled rock formations and scattered boulders. These rocks form a dramatic cliff face that descends towards the water. The coastline itself is rugged and dotted with numerous small rocks and islets, which punctuate the relatively calm, blue sea.\n\nThe background holds a slightly more subdued color palette, composed of mixed greenery that presumably covers more of the coastline and possibly the higher elevation land forms. The overall composition is a dynamic blend of natural textures and colors, combining the softness of the blossoms with the harshness of the rocky cliffs, all set against the vastness of the sea. This scene is likely captured during late spring or early summer, indicated by the blooming flowers and the vigorous natural growth.","title":"California--Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543401","543196","543399","543404","543199","542968","547592","543066","554081","554082","543352","543346","542917","543074","543419","555666"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["coastline","cliff","rock","flower","islet","harshness","sea","blossom","softness","spread"]}
