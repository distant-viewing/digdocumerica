{"path":"553743.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a large, modern building prominently located in the background under a cloudy sky. The building exhibits a strong architectural presence, characterized by its tall rectangular shape and long horizontal lines formed by rows of vertical pillars. The building has a flat roof and is crafted from materials that give it a stark, monolithic appearance.\n\nIn the foreground, sharply contrasting with the architecture, are bright yellow hibiscus flowers. These flowers are central and lower in the frame, adding a natural, softer element to the scene. The view is partially obstructed by the foliage, suggesting that the photo is taken from behind or within a bush of these flowers, adding a layer of depth and focus on nature in front of the man-made structure.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is somewhat moody and dramatic, largely due to the overcast sky with hints of pink and blue hues that potentially indicate either early morning or late evening. This combination of nature and architecture could evoke themes of harmony or contrast between the natural world and human constructions.","title":"Hawaii--Hawaiian State Capitol, Honolulu (Oahu I)","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["546542","544523","546481","553744","546539","546464","546463","546473","546534","544519","546472","548649","546468","544565","551653","546485"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["flower","obstruct","harmony","architecture","pillar","craft","world","combination","building","bush"]}
