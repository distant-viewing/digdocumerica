{"path":"549538.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view featuring a natural scene. At the forefront, there's a partly wooded area with barren trees that suggest it might be either winter or early spring, as the trees appear leafless. This vegetation buffers between rocky terrain and the water body visible in the image.\n\nThe water body occupies a significant portion of the photograph, exhibiting a rich, dark green color that contrasts with the adjacent land features. Notably, within the water, there's a remarkable formation of sand or sediment creating a winding, sediment-laden sandbar. This sandbar curiously meanders and forms what looks like an 'S' shape or a sinusoidal pattern. It is lighter in color, ranging from sandy yellow to light grey, differing distinctly from the darker shades of the surrounding water.\n\nThe top right corner of the image shows a rocky ledge, providing a rugged texture that stands in contrast to the smoother surface of the water and the sandbar. The edge of this rocky area demarcates the boundary between the terrestrial and aquatic environments sharply.\n\nThis scene is devoid of any visible human activity or man-made structures, offering a raw and somewhat serene glimpse into a natural landscape, potentially near a river or a lake where sediment deposition is evident. The composition and elements suggest a harmony between water and land, shaped by natural processes.","title":"Outfall from the city of Niagara Falls sewage plant flows into the Niagara River below the falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["552922","555705","550527","550601","553452","545904","543789","542882","544772","550393","552838","543652","550545","552548","542537","544744"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sediment","deposition","buffer","laden","water","harmony","land","ledge","yellow","boundary"]}
