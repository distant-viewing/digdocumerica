{"path":"552131.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This aerial photograph captures an industrial waterfront area. Multiple large, circular storage tanks dominate the foreground; these tanks are possibly for oil, gas, or chemicals and are situated on structures with surrounding barricades. To the right of these tanks, several buildings, possibly warehouses or industrial facilities, are aligned in orderly rows. In these areas, numerous cars are parked, suggesting the presence of workers or ongoing operations.\n\nThe area is on the edge of a body of water, which presumably is a lake or sea, as indicated by the dark blue water peppered with a few small boats sailing nearby. A pier extends into the water, parallel to the shoreline, lined with more industrial structures.\n\nBetween the tanks and the waterfront facilities, some tree-covered areas suggest that this location is on the outskirts of a town or in a semi-urban area. The presence of roads and pathways around the tanks and buildings facilitates the movement of vehicles and personnel around the site. This site might be involved in the storage, processing, or transport of industrial materials, highlighted by the orderly and dense setup typical of such facilities. There appear to be more industrial structures and possibly some open areas towards the other end of the facility, indicating a large industrial complex. The photo shows a clear day with good visibility, enhancing the details of the industrial site and its surroundings.","title":"Oil tank farm and yacht basin at edmonds","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["549978","555786","552245","555775","551982","547505","552025","549977","552835","551987","555777","550886","547958","549526","552009","551977"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["tank","facility","waterfro","site","barricade","storage","personnel","pepper","chemical","outskirt"]}
