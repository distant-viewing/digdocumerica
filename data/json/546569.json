{"path":"546569.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph presents a bird's eye view of a bustling urban area, capturing a complex of roads and a bridge over a body of water, which appears to be a river. The key architectural feature visible is a large, multi-arched bridge, likely constructed from concrete, spanning the river beneath it. This bridge, notable for its series of sizable arches and robust structure, supports numerous lanes of traffic, which are filled with cars, indicating the photo was taken during a busy traffic hour.\n\nAdjacent to the river and bridge on the viewer's right side, there is an industrial area characterized by sparse vegetation, various warehouses, and what appears to be construction or storage sites with containers and machinery. This area is compressed between the river and a highway.\n\nOn the opposite side of the river, there is a more mixed urban setting with both residential and commercial buildings densely packed, illustrating typical urban sprawl. The buildings vary in design and height but are mostly low-rise and include what seems to be a reddish-brick building complex.\n\nIn the background, extending from the middle to the far end of the image, there is a vast area covered with greenery which might be a mix of residential zones and parks or recreational areasâ€”the skyline lacks high-rise buildings, giving the landscape a more horizontal emphasis.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, likely taken from a high vantage point, offers a glimpse into the daily dynamics of urban traffic and infrastructure, set against a backdrop of both industrial and residential zones within a metropolis. The representation of dense traffic and a mixture of architectural styles provides insight into the bustling nature of city life.","title":"The Key Bridge to Virginia crosses the Potomac at Georgetown.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546704","548344","546689","546581","548414","548418","546588","550157","555745","546616","551189","555733","555744","548427","555762","546574"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","traffic","river","zone","complex","rise","metropolis","sprawl","insight","dynamic"]}
