{"path":"554395.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense and dimly lit forest scene during twilight or early evening. The main focus is the array of slender tree trunks that densely populate the image. They stand vertical and are captured in silhouetted forms against a soft, ambient light possibly emanating from the setting sun or the moon, which is partially visible through the trees. This light creates a mystical and slightly eerie mood, emphasizing blues and dark shadows.\n\nThe forest floor is not clearly visible but appears to be covered with leaves or small undergrowth, typical of a woodland environment. Large boulders or rocks are hinted at in the foreground, blending into the shadowed ground. The overall atmosphere is quiet and serene, with a strong sense of natural solitude and the wilderness. The composition uses natural lines of the trees and the subtle light to draw the viewer's gaze centrally towards the brighter spot in the backdrop, magnifying the effect of depth and the penetrating look into the woods. The image predominantly showcases natureâ€™s texture and depth, highlighting the complexity and tranquility of a forest setting at dusk.","title":"Setting sun seen through early foliage of hardwood trees near Forestport (on Route 28)","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["555112","555128","553574","554976","554393","542849","542932","554394","555119","542931","542926","553578","542725","543021","554981","553579"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["forest","magnify","moon","undergrowth","emanate","boulder","light","depth","complexity","twilight"]}
