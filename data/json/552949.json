{"path":"552949.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a moment on the side of a sunny, rural road. A young woman, dressed in a long-sleeved red sweater and an apron-like orange garment, leans over slightly to converse with a young boy. The boy, who appears to be roughly around four or five years old, wears an expression of attentiveness and is dressed in a red shirt that matches the woman's sweater.\n\nIn the woman's hands, she holds a dark brown leather bag that appears heavy, suggested by how she grips the handle. There is also a beige cloth or disheveled sack sprawled on the grassy ground beside them, perhaps something they were carrying.\n\nThe background shows a clear sky and a predominantly green environment with patches of brown earth. A road extends parallel to the scene, where we see two vehicles—a brown and a silver car—moving away in the distance. Behind the figures are a smattering of trees that offer sporadic shade, hinting at a rural or less-populated area. \n\nThe overall scene depicts a moment of interaction or pause in activity, perhaps on a journey or during a task, characterized by the casual yet engaged postures and expressions of the individuals involved.","title":"Roadside litter clean-up.
