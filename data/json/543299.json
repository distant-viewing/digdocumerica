{"path":"543299.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a coastal landscape capturing a beautiful view of a secluded beach and cove. The scene is filled with vibrant natural elements. In the foreground, a rugged, rocky cliff covered with dense foliage, including shrubs and grasses, overlooks a small sandy beach below. The cove appears calm, with turquoise and light green waters that contrast sharply with the dark seaweed or kelp scattered across the sand and into the shallows.\n\nTowards the background, the view extends to a larger hill of beige and white color, which is likely covered in dry, rocky soil or sand. This hill separates the cove from the ocean visible in the distance, hinting at a more expansive seascape beyond. The bright blue sky is clear, indicating a sunny day without visible clouds.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with its steep cliffs in the foreground leading down to the serene beach and water, framed by the larger environmental context, emphasizes the tranquility and isolation of the location. It's a picturesque spot that conveys peacefulness and natural beauty. The image is vibrant with colors that are well saturated, enhancing the vividness of the natural scene. The photograph likely aims to capture the essence of coastal beauty, possibly for purposes related to travel, nature studies, or landscape photography.","title":"California--point lobos reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["543297","543289","545106","543287","545173","543080","553805","542917","543300","543250","545125","543184","543061","545122","545129","545230"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cove","beach","cliff","sand","seaweed","seascape","peacefulness","hill","photography","vividness"]}
