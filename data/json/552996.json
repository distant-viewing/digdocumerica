{"path":"552996.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph shows a deserted and damaged station wagon in a mountainous desert environment. The car, primarily white with red accents, appears severely wrecked with significant damages: the hood is partly detached and bent upwards, the doors on one side are flung open, and its body is severely dented and rusted. Debris surrounds the vehicle, including various car parts, a scattered array of what looks to be personal items and trash.\n\nThe area is rocky, with sparse vegetation, mainly small bushes and a few trees in the distance. The background features tall, rugged mountains under a clear blue sky, indicating a remote or less trafficked region. The setting and the condition of the car together provide a sense of abandonment and perhaps a long period since the car was left to decay in this isolated place.","title":"Abandoned car in Clear Creek Canon.
