{"path":"548683.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an underwater scene that is both serene and dynamic. It features a person, dressed in snorkeling gear, including a mask and snorkel, hovering horizontally just beneath the water's surface. The person's arms are spread outward, and they appear to be calmly floating or gently swimming above a coral reef.\n\nThe water is clear, allowing for a deep view into the underwater environment. Below the person, the seabed is visible, dominated by a large, textured coral formation that rises prominently towards the surface. The coral is rugged with various bumps and hollows, and it is accompanied by smaller pieces of similar marine flora around it.\n\nLight plays an essential role in this photograph. Sunlight pierces through the gently rippled surface of the ocean, creating an intricate pattern of reflections and light patches on the person and underwater. This lighting adds a dynamic quality to the scene and highlights the texture and detail of the coral reef.\n\nThe backdrop is the deeper, darker hue of the underwater environment, which contrasts sharply with the brightly lit foreground where the person and coral reef are positioned. This contrast enhances the sense of depth and isolation of the scene. The overall composition, with the person in a spread-eagle pose above the coral, conveys a feeling of harmony and peaceful interaction with the natural underwater world.","title":"Snorkeling at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548681","548676","548675","548680","548721","548714","548722","557481","548719","548713","548682","548677","555834","548712","548678","554007"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["reef","person","coral","underwater","snorkel","mask","harmony","surface","spread","world"]}
