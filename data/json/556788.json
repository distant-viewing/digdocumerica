{"path":"556788.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a sign on a public transportation vehicle, likely a bus. The sign is predominantly black with white lettering. It states: \"Only Exact Fare Cash or Token Will Be Accepted\" and below, in a smaller font: \"Drivers Carry No Cash or Tokens.\" The sign is designed to inform passengers of the payment policy on the bus.\n\nTo the left of the sign, part of the interior structure of the vehicle is visible, highlighting a slim vertical strip possibly part of a door or a divider, along with a mirrored surface. To the right, a brushed metal bar, possibly a handrail, adds a reflective quality to the image. The overall lighting and composition focus attention on the textual information, emphasizing the clear, concise message about fare requirements. Bright spots, possibly caused by lights or reflections, dot the darker areas of the sign, giving texture to the image. The photograph captures the practical aspect of everyday public transit operations.","title":"Sign on a Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) bus notes that only exact change or a token will be accepted by the driver. Ridership increased 27 percent from 1970 to 1974 in Atlanta, Georgia, when it reached 73,727,000 passengers. The increase occurred for a number of reasons, including a decrease in fare from 40 to 15 cents, new buses, new routes, night service 100-passenger waiting shelters and fringe parking.","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["551875","556739","556683","556203","556789","549860","548175","556793","546244","556802","556794","556743","546619","557879","556747","546601"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["cash","sign","bus","handrail","font","bar","information","transit","driver","lettering"]}
