{"path":"552011.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a basketball court, featuring three individuals engaging in a game. The basketball court appears to be well-maintained, with visible white boundary lines, and is equipped with a single basketball hoop with a metal backboard and a net that hangs freely.\n\nIn action, one individual, wearing a white T-shirt and red shorts, has just thrown the basketball, which is now in mid-air, headed towards the basket. The other two players, with one wearing a black tank top and the other in a light-colored tank top and light shorts, appear to be in motion, possibly anticipating the ball's next move or preparing to rebound.\n\nThe backdrop of the scene is quite industrial, featuring several tall structures such as chemical plants or refining towers. This industrial setting contrasts with the leisure activity foreground, providing a unique juxtaposition within the image. The sky is fairly clear with a few clouds, suggesting a nice day for outdoor activities. The image encapsulates a casual yet vibrant moment of everyday recreation, likely in an urban or suburban environment close to industrial facilities.","title":"Boys play in mini-park, part of the \"Bowtie\" development at Port Reading on the Arthur Kill.
