{"path":"553983.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a stunning coastal landscape, likely from a tropical or subtropical region. The image foreground features a curved, sandy beach bordered by rocky, uneven coastline. The beach is adjacent to a cluster of large buildings, which appear to be part of a resort or a communal complex, given their organized layout and prominent roofs.\n\nThe ocean is a deep blue with whitecaps breaking near the shore, indicating active wave movement. Beyond the immediate coastal area, the landscape transitions into a flatter, open field that gradually rises into densely forested hills. The hills in the middle distance form a dramatic backdrop with their lush greenery and rugged contours. \n\nOn the horizon, the terrain flattens out again into what appears to be extensive plains or fields, leading up to more distant mountains under a partly cloudy sky. The sky itself is bright and dynamic, with puffy, white clouds casting shadows over some parts of the landscape, suggesting a vibrant yet calm weather scenario.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its combination of oceanic, architectural, and natural elements, along with the play of light and shadow, creates a vivid and captivating aerial view of this diverse landscape.","title":"The poipu beach area has the most desirable ocean frontage on the island, and hotels are rapidly taking over the remaining beach land.
