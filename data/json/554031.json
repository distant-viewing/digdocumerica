{"path":"554031.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic, countryside road, possibly on a rural island landscape or in a remote location, characterized by rolling hills and an expansive horizon. The road, a prominent asphalt path, runs vertically down the center of the image, dividing two very different landscapes. On one side of the road, there are cultivated fields marked by reddish brown soil and sparse greenery, suggesting farm lands. On the opposite side, the terrain is rougher, with wild shrubs and undefined green spaces.\n\nDriving on the road is an old convertible car with at least two passengers, giving a sense of motion to the otherwise still landscape. The car and its vintage style add a nostalgic touch to the scene. The car has a visible license plate and possibly some luggage or cargo tied to its back, hinting at a journey or travel theme.\n\nIn the background, aside from the sweeping hills, there are scant structural elementsâ€” a few clustered houses or farm buildings and isolated, small-scale industrial or storage units. Telephone poles line the road, fading into the distance and providing a linear perspective that draws the eye through the photograph.\n\nNoticeable are the contrasting earthy tones and the deep blue of the sky above, which might suggest this photo was taken on a clear, sunny day. The entire composition of the photograph presents a serene rural vista juxtaposed with the energy of human travel and activity, offering a snapshot of life in a remote yet vibrant landscape.","title":"Highway in remote area of Molokai","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["554130","547354","549002","551240","556405","554131","547300","554127","554070","545367","549235","549182","547316","554805","547659","556432"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","travel","farm","car","luggage","telephone","vista","countryside","license","asphalt"]}
