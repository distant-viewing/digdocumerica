{"path":"557134.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph displays an array of various types and sizes of bottles, each seemingly vintage, placed closely together on what appears to be a table. The bottles have diverse shapes, tints, and materials, ranging from clear to brown and green glass. Several bottles have remnants of old labels or paper tags, suggesting they may have been used for different purposes or contents, likely in a historical or collection context. Some bottles seem to contain residues or dirt, highlighting their aged and possibly unearthed status.\n\nIn the background, there is a somewhat cluttered setting that includes additional objects like a cardboard box, other unidentifiable items, and objects partially out of focus. The setting suggests an outdoor environment, possibly a market, a collecting site, or an expedition area, with diffuse lighting that brightens the entire scene. The arrangement and variety of bottles, along with the backdrop, provide a sense of searching through or displaying historical artifacts.","title":"Old bottles for sale at a flea market in White Cloud, Kansas near Troy. The market is sponsored by the Ma Hush Ka (White Cloud) Historical Society to raise money for the local museum housed in the 100-year-old schoolhouse. Two buildings were placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some people would like to see the place restored as an example of a 19th century Kansas River town.","placename":"White Cloud (Kan.)","location":"White Cloud, Kansas","nn1":["543696","543702","543711","543698","552529","550301","543706","548041","553658","557174","552512","547506","555268","555253","543699","552884"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bottle","status","residue","expedition","artifact","tag","tint","cardboard","object","label"]}
