{"path":"543201.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and diverse array of wildflowers and plants growing directly from a rugged, rocky soil surface. The image is rich in botanical detail, displaying several clusters of plants with varying textures and colors.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, there are small flowers with bright yellow centers and white petals, surrounded by green leaves, suggesting they might be a type of daisy. Next to them is a group of plants with rusty orange flowers set against dark green foliage, creating a stark contrast in color.\n\nThe center and towards the right of the frame is dominated by a large cluster of succulents. These plants have thick, fleshy leaves that are a dusty green color, tinged with purple edges, giving them a unique and striking appearance. The layout and interspersion of the plants suggest a natural, possibly alpine or coastal environment where vegetation adapts to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes nature's resilience and diversity, focusing solely on the plants without any human elements or animals visible. The background and peripheral areas are blurred slightly, drawing the viewerâ€™s focus more on the plant details in the foreground. The image likely serves as a study in botanical diversity or a snapshot of a specific ecological niche.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553074","545718","544451","543205","544894","545724","545723","545703","544938","544443","544875","544887","555884","555019","549228","548739"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","diversity","daisy","flower","cluster","tinge","adapt","petal","leave","wildflower"]}
