{"path":"556894.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling railroad maintenance scene, likely captured from an elevated perspective or bridge. The image shows a group of approximately two dozen workers engaged in various activities around multiple pieces of railroad equipment, which suggests a major repair or construction effort.\n\nIn the center foreground of the image, a large, complex, orange machine equipped with multiple arms and parts sits on the tracks, appearing ready for use or in the process of being operated. Behind this machine, there are additional pieces of equipment; particularly notable is a red vehicle with similar mechanical components, and further in the background, there are more machines and workers scattered around.\n\nThe people are predominantly wearing work clothes, including hard hats and bright safety vests, indicating they are taking safety precautions. Most of the workers are standing in small groups, possibly discussing their tasks or coordinating efforts. A few individuals are walking between the equipment or actively engaging with the machines, possibly adjusting settings or performing manual tasks.\n\nThe background shows additional sets of railway tracks that converge in the distance, and a few industrial vehicles are parked at the far end. The landscape around the tracks is gravelly with sparse grass, indicative of a typical railway right-of-way area. The focus and activity in the scene suggest a significant moment of labor, possibly during an upgrade or maintenance check on the railway system.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a detailed and active moment in railway maintenance, highlighting the teamwork and machinery involved in maintaining and constructing railway infrastructure.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, laying new quarter mile long sections of rail to replace the old shorter track. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews of 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556895","556899","556878","556879","556897","556886","556872","556889","556871","556869","556885","556901","556881","556883","556900","556862"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","machine","worker","maintenance","track","railroad","effort","equipment","safety","precaution"]}
