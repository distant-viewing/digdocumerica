{"path":"548710.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene underwater scene featuring a diverse coral reef ecosystem. In the foreground, prominent staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) dominates the image with its branch-like structures creating an intricate and dense network. The coral is mostly light beige in color, contrasting with the darker blues of the deep water in the background.\n\nAmong the staghorn coral are other types of coral, including some that have smoother, more mound-like appearances. These corals add variety to the texture and depth of the scene, displaying hues of dark green and brown. The seafloor is visible and appears to be composed mostly of sand and small fragments of dead coral, contributing to a light tan coloring overall.\n\nSmall fish, likely reef fish, are visible amongst the coral branches. These fish seem to be casually swimming about, contributing to the dynamic yet peaceful life within this marine habitat. The water is clear, suggesting that this area might be well-preserved or in a healthy state.\n\nOverall, the composition and color palette of this photograph—ranging from the soft beige and brown tones of the coral to the deep blues of the water—highlight the natural beauty and tranquility of underwater reef environments. The focus on the complex structure of the staghorn coral with minimal human interference offers viewers a glimpse into the delicate and vibrant underwater biodiversity.","title":"One of the 40 or more species of coral at john pennekamp coral reef state park, a few miles off key largo","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548712","548711","548682","548678","548679","548719","548677","548717","548723","548676","548722","548721","548681","548716","548718","548683"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["coral","reef","fish","interference","biodiversity","branch","coloring","blue","dark","beige"]}
