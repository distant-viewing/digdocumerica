{"path":"555174.jpg","date":"September 1970","photographer":"","caption":"This image depicts an abstract composition of intersecting, colorful, translucent forms resembling fragments of glass or crystalline structures. The dynamic arrangement features a dominant cross shape in deep red tones in the center, overlaying deep blue and lighter blue shades in the surrounding objects. The interplay of light and color creates an intense and visually striking pattern, with textures that appear both rugged and glossy, hinting at reflective, possibly illuminated surfaces. The overall effect is vibrant, complex, and visually layered, suggesting depth and varying translucency among the forms. The background is obscured by the overlapping colored elements, contributing to the image's focus on texture, color, and the interaction of these vivid fragments.","title":"Phase contrast microphotograph of stained Douglas fir fibers.
