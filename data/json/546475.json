{"path":"546475.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features an interior space, likely a corridor inside a building. The walls are painted in light and neutral colors, enhancing the modern and clean aesthetic of the space. Prominently displayed on the wall is a large, rectangular art piece featuring an array of geometric patterns and a variety of colors, primarily shades of blue, white, and beige. This artwork consists of several panels, each containing different abstract patterns that range from rigid grids to more open, sparse configurations.\n\nThe lighting in the corridor casts a gentle illumination on the artwork, producing soft shadows that suggest an ambient, internal lighting setup rather than natural sunlight. Further down the corridor, there is another portion of the space visible, showing a glimpse of what appears to be a room or another section with green accents on the wall. The floor is covered with a dark carpet, which contrasts with the lighter wall colors and complements the overall minimalist and polished atmosphere of the setting. The image evokes a sense of quiet and orderly sophistication, typically found in corporate or gallery environments.","title":"Interior of Cummins corporate offices","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546471","546482","546576","546517","546462","555317","546498","546510","546487","557391","546558","558322","546526","546511","546531","551487"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["corridor","artwork","wall","space","configuration","carpet","accent","art","illumination","pattern"]}
