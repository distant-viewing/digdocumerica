{"path":"543742.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic aerial view of a steep, mountainous landscape. The scene is dominated by a large meandering river, which cuts through the valley floor, reflecting light and giving a silvery appearance amidst the surrounding dark terrain. Alongside the river, there are developed areas visible, inclusive of roads that swirl alongside the river banks, conforming to the landscape's natural contours.\n\nThe small buildings or structures can be seen near the river, likely indicative of a small human settlement or industrial activity. Large portions of the adjacent land are occupied by what appear to be tailing ponds, potentially related to mining or other industrial processes, given their structured and unnatural shapes.\n\nSurrounding the valley are steep mountain slopes, heavily shadowed, suggesting the picture was taken either early in the morning or late in the evening. These mountains are rugged and largely barren of vegetation at the higher elevations, with snow patches indicating lingering winter conditions or a high-altitude environment. The overall atmosphere is one of isolation and the stark contrast between natural and human-altered landscapes. The composition of the photo, with its sharp angles and dramatic natural lighting, adds to the sense of wilderness despite signs of human impact.","title":"Settling pond, where wastes are allowed to \"settle out\" from milling process at Idarado Mill.","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["543750","550590","550526","550498","550518","550507","550593","542700","550633","555685","543739","550509","550524","550523","550508","550561"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","valley","mountain","settlement","elevation","altitude","pond","contour","winter","mining"]}
