{"path":"543358.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and colorful harbor scene. In the foreground, there are wooden docks with several boats moored to them, including one named \"STORMY.\" The boats vary in size and appear to be mostly fishing or recreational vessels. Attached to the docks are small waterfront structures, possibly serving as boat houses or marine-related businesses.\n\nThe water is calm and reflects the boats and structures, adding a serene quality to the image. There is a clear sky contributing to the bright and vivid colors visible in the photograph.\n\nBeyond the immediate harbor area, the background features a gentle slope covered with residential houses and different types of vegetation, primarily tall trees. The houses are closely packed but each retains a distinct style and color. Notably, there is a church with a red façade and white trim, standing out due to its size and color contrast against the predominantly green and earth-toned surroundings.\n\nThe scene is lively yet peaceful, suggesting a small coastal community where marine and daily life is closely intertwined.","title":"California -- Rocky Point","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542905","542876","542872","542878","542907","548249","546998","542871","547565","548228","548229","548235","548763","542911","546937","548078"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","harbor","house","dock","size","façade","church","waterfront","vessel","business"]}
