{"path":"547882.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image captures an urban rooftop scene displaying a clear and sunny day. In the foreground, there are three people casually relaxing and sunbathing. Two individuals, possibly male, recline in foldable lounge chairs; one is reading a newspaper while the other appears to be resting or napping with a book on his lap. A third person, who seems to be a woman, is engaging with a magazine and seated directly on the surface of the rooftop. Nearby, a large cooler and a radio or cassette player can be seen on the ground.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by a fenced-off area, indicating either maintenance works or designated boundaries on the rooftop. In the background, there's a tall residential building prominently displayed with several visible balconies and fire escapes, characteristic of many urban apartment complexes. Architectural details include red brick walls and multiple windows which add a utilitarian feel to the scene. Additional buildings trace the skyline, suggesting a densely populated city environment.\n\nThe scene is framed to the right by what seems to be a rounded lamp post, which helps focus attention back into the central activities of the people on the rooftop. The lighting indicates it's either late morning or early afternoon, based on the shadows cast and the brightness of the day.","title":"Luxury highrise on Sheepshead Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546452","548085","549926","548329","546795","550071","543796","550232","553222","550228","555296","550751","546443","548548","553218","551823"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["rooftop","lounge","sunbathing","radio","magazine","player","lap","newspaper","apartment","balcony"]}
