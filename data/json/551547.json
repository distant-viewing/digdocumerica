{"path":"551547.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts a stack of discarded and crushed cars piled atop one another. The cars, which vary in type and color, are heavily damaged and mangled, some layered horizontally while others lean at different angles, creating an irregular, jagged structure. The pile of cars appears to be on a natural, uneven terrain, possibly a hillside, speckled with green vegetation including small bushes and grasses peeking through the cracks and crevices of the stacked vehicles and debris.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a body of water reflecting sunlight, possibly a river or a stream, bordered by rough, fragmented concrete slabs and large stones that might be part of a derelict structure or dumping ground. The water and its glistening surface add a contrasting natural element to the scene dominated by the man-made wreckage.\n\nThe scene is set under a clear blue sky, suggesting a sunny day which brightens the metallic finishes of the cars despite their ruined state. This juxtaposition of nature and mechanical decay provides a strong visual statement about environmental pollution and the impact of human waste on natural settings. There is no presence of people or animals in the image, emphasizing the abandonment and desolation of the area.","title":"On the west side of the Mississippi River junked autos are compressed and then shipped to steel mills for recycling.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553006","552738","542656","554352","545545","545303","546172","551517","553005","555851","554320","542590","555869","554348","555850","547476"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","slab","statement","wreckage","crack","finish","crevice","desolation","hillside","stream"]}
