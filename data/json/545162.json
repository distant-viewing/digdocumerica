{"path":"545162.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a serene beach scene filled with various elements of leisure and natural beauty. In the foreground, four elderly individuals (three men and one woman) are seated looking out over a wide sandy beach from an elevated, shaded viewing area. The woman appears to be jotting down notes or drawing in a small notebook.\n\nThe beach itself stretches across the frame with soft, white sand and a calm ocean in the background under a clear blue sky. The shore is populated with several beachgoers engaging in different activities. Some individuals are strolling along the beach, while others are sitting or playing in the sand. Notably, there are kites flying in the distance, adding a playful element to the tranquil setting.\n\nThe right side of the image features a lifeguard tower surrounded by informational signs, indicating a monitored swimming area. In the backdrop, a prominent mountain or large hill looms, giving a dramatic edge to the otherwise peaceful coastal landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with people enjoying a relaxed day on a sunlit beach, conveys a sense of leisure and tranquility. The scene is framed by architectural elements like a curving brick wall and columns, which guide the viewer's eye towards the beach and the natural scenery beyond.","title":"Washington--Westport","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543089","546982","543072","557507","547009","543254","543303","547503","555402","546928","553882","553952","546874","554159","548541","546408"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","notebook","leisure","beachgoer","note","swimming","woman","column","scenery"]}
