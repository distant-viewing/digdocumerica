{"path":"546162.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene centered around an upward view of a clear blue sky framed by various types of vegetation. The foreground shows silhouetted and partially silhouetted leaves and branches of several plants and trees, creating a contrasting natural border around the edges of the photo. The plant life includes what appears to be a mix of deciduous leaves and possibly pine needles, suggesting a diversified plant habitat.\n\nThe leaves and branches are scattered across the frame with varying degrees of light filtering through them, highlighting the intricate details and different textures of the foliage. The silhouette effect accentuates the organic forms of the leaves against the bright sky. The composition focuses on the interplay of light and shadow, and the contrast between the dark, detailed foreground and the simple, luminous blue sky in the background. The overall mood of the image is calm and serene, showcasing the beauty of natural environments and the play of light within them.","title":"Reflection in an oil pool in the middle of a forest near Palestine, Texas.
