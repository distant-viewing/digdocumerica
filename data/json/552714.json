{"path":"552714.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a complex railway scene filled with multiple sets of train tracks crisscrossing and extending into the distance. A central focus is a dark locomotive with a \"Penn Central\" logo, suggesting the train belongs to the Penn Central Transportation Company, a railroad operating in the northeastern United States during the late 20th century. The locomotive, numbered 5029, is moving along one of the tracks, with various electricity lines and signaling equipment overhead. The entire scene is framed by numerous overhead wires that add texture and linearity to the composition.\n\nA mist or haze softly blankets the area, creating a somewhat muted backdrop which obscures distant details but enhances the industrial ambiance of the scene. Vegetation is visible at the sides of the railway lines, and some small buildings or possibly other railroad-related structures can be seen as well. The image conveys a busy, functional railway environment, capturing the essence of rail transport and infrastructure.","title":"Railroad switching yards just west of Center City, along the Schuylkill Expressway.","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556850","556120","556783","556382","556692","556841","547140","554834","546069","545541","552063","547050","551007","556854","556759","555564"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","locomotive","railroad","train","track","electricity","belong","overhead","signal","crisscross"]}
