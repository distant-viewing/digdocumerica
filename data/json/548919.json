{"path":"548919.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a stunning view of a rugged and mountainous landscape, partly shadowed by the foreboding presence of large mountains in the background. These mountains display intricate folds and undulations, indicative of severe geological processes. The landform is arid, with dark, jagged rocks and very sparse vegetation visible, suggesting an environment that endures extreme weather conditions.\n\nIn contrast to the rough terrain, the foreground features a tranquil and shimmering body of water, seemingly a lake or reservoir, distinguished by its rich blue color. The surface of the water is animated with activity, including several boats moving at high speeds, creating white trails as they cut through the water. These trails suggest recreational or transport activities, with boats possibly carrying passengers or engaged in sports.\n\nThe composition of the image is divided roughly into two planes â€“ the dark, imposing mountains forming the upper two-thirds, and the vibrant, lively water occupying the bottom third. Light plays a significant role in this scene, with the brightness of the water emphasizing its importance as a life-giving contrast to the arid mountains. The overall mood conveys both a sense of wilderness and recreational enjoyment, capturing a blend of natural majesty and human interaction with the landscape.","title":"Boating on lake mead","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["552921","555704","543761","555709","552222","544170","555712","555703","548974","544142","550507","552894","552904","555693","555710","544383"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["third","mountain","trail","animate","undulation","reservoir","majesty","water","landform","plane"]}
