{"path":"545397.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a moment in a residential neighborhood, most likely in the evening or under lower light conditions which add a slightly dusky and serene atmosphere to the scene. It shows a series of brick townhouses aligned side by side, characterized by their two-story design and pitched roofs. Each townhouse has a small, covered porch area at the entrance.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a group of individuals stands on and near the porch of the closest townhouse. These include both adults and children, engaging in casual conversation or interaction. A man in light-colored clothing leans against one of the brick columns of the porch. Nearby, a young child and a couple of women are visible. One woman in a dark blouse and trousers stands facing the camera, while another peers over what seems to be a railing, looking towards the left side of the frame.\n\nThe background includes a misty or smoke-filled environment with the houses partially obscured, lending an air of mystery or haziness to the setting. The presence of green bushes and a well-maintained lawn adds to the residential feel. There's a walkway leading through the grass, bordered by smaller shrubs, enhancing the orderly layout of the neighborhood.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph, combined with the architecture and the interactions among the people, suggests a cohesive community setting, possibly capturing a typical evening where residents relax and socialize after the day's activities. The lighting and atmospheric conditions contribute heavily to the mood, presenting a peaceful yet somewhat ambiguous scene.","title":"Day becomes night when industrial smog is heavy in north Birmingham.
