{"path":"543427.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal landscape. The top and central portion of the image is dominated by the ocean, which appears vibrant and textured with different shades of turquoise, blue, and white, indicating waves and possibly shallow waters near the shoreline. The coast shows white waves crashing onto the shore, adding a dynamic element to the seascape.\n\nThe shoreline curves smoothly from the top left to the middle right of the image. Along the coast, sandy beaches alternate with rocky outcrops, creating a rugged and natural coastline. The adjacent land is a mix of natural and developed areas.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, a winding road snakes through the landscape, connecting various sections of what appears to be a residential area. The houses and buildings are interspersed with lots of greenery, including trees and lawns, suggesting a well-integrated human settlement in a natural environment. Some structures have large yards or fields adjacent to them, and the overall layout suggests a suburban or semi-rural setting.\n\nThroughout the landscape, there are patches of darker soil or sand and areas covered with vegetation, showing diversity in the terrain and land use. In the bottom section of the image, there are several larger buildings, possibly community centers, larger homes, or public buildings, set apart by their size and distinct roofing.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the interplay between natural beauty and human habitation by the sea, focusing on the textures and colors of the coastal environment while showcasing how the community is nestled into this picturesque setting.","title":"California -- beach roads","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["557453","554057","554156","547629","543088","554018","543435","545121","543337","557429","543308","557466","557504","553983","545110","543362"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["coast","shoreline","wave","section","roofing","community","seascape","land","crash","outcrop"]}
