{"path":"546992.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph displays a rural scene featuring a small brick house with a backdrop of a clear sky and lush greenery. The house is of simple, modest construction with a pitched roof and is predominantly made of yellowish bricks. It features four windows and a main entrance partially obscured by a front porch or stoop, which appears to be in a state of slight disrepair as suggested by the skewed steps leading up to the door.\n\nAdjacent to the house, on the right side, stands a person who is involved in an outdoor activity, possibly gardening or cleaning on an old wooden trestle table. This individual is dressed in a casual, light-colored outfit suitable for outdoor work.\n\nTo the left of the house, various objects contribute to a lived-in or functional ambience: there's a dog lying down, watching the surroundings, and further left a makeshift fence that partially encloses the area. Also visible is an open, upright door that seems to be standalone or part of a small structure not fully visible in the frame.\n\nIn the foreground, the grass is somewhat uneven and overgrown, indicating a natural, less-manicured setting. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, rural domestic environment during a bright, sunny day with the focus on everyday outdoor tasks.","title":"A Black's house on Hilton Head Island","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["557746","548295","550704","551091","555581","547861","555611","547792","551000","547658","555615","558110","544353","558153","554084","551076"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","brick","door","in","ambience","dog","disrepair","step","entrance","porch"]}
