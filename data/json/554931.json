{"path":"554931.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures the intense and gritty environment of a workshop where a welding operation is underway. A welder, wearing a protective welding helmet and gloves, is carefully conducting a welding process on a metal frame. Bright sparks fly from the point of welding, illuminated against the dimly lit backdrop of the workshop. The welder’s face is mostly obscured by the large, protective helmet, focusing attention on the craftsmanship and physical activity involved in metalworking.\n\nIn the foreground, another individual's head and shoulder can be seen, observing or supervising the work, but the viewer's focus is drawn to the active welding scene. The image is filled with hues of dark grays and blues, punctuated by the orange and yellow light from the sparks, creating a compelling visual contrast. This not only highlights the intensity of the work but also adds a dramatic effect to the scene.\n\nThe background is indistinct with some diffuse light filtering through what appears to be a window or gap in the structure, softly illuminating parts of the workshop’s interior. The setting suggests a robust industrial environment typical of workshops where heavy and precise manual work is carried out. This photograph effectively captures a moment of skilled labor highlighting the focus and expertise required in the welding profession.","title":"Welder at a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558303","554918","556269","558304","555955","556267","544331","556863","544316","546023","549695","554864","544004","549694","544001","549693"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["workshop","spark","helmet","work","expertise","profession","craftsmanship","gap","filtering","glove"]}
