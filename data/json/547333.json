{"path":"547333.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic view focusing on a charming white church situated on an elevated hill. The church, which appears to be a traditional structure, has a steep gabled roof and a prominent steeple, complete with a bell tower and arched windows. The front facade of the church features a large pointed-arch window and a smaller entrance below it.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows a paved road leading directly towards the church. This road splits just below the frame, with one branch curving to the right and the main road continuing uphill toward the church. The road is marked with fading double yellow lines indicating a no-passing zone and sporadic patches showing repair work. Road signs, including a speed limit sign and directional arrows, are visible beside the road, providing guidance to motorists.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes lush green grass and shrubs, which contrasts with the stark white of the church. The sky above is bright and clear, suggesting a sunny day. The overall composition of the image, with the road leading the eye directly to the church and the clear, simple sky, gives it a serene and inviting feel. The scene is devoid of people, adding to its tranquil and untouched atmosphere.","title":"The Immanuel Lutheran Church marks the state line between Kansas and Nebraska.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["554035","556480","554033","554207","546455","547346","558163","550287","558034","558024","558019","557088","554208","558023","547440","557952"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["church","road","guidance","limit","steeple","arrow","bell","repair","speed","arch"]}
