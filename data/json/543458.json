{"path":"543458.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and dynamic beach scene featuring four individuals engaged in playful activities in the shallow waters. The waves at their feet add a dynamic element to the scene, emphasizing the sense of motion.\n\nFrom left to right:\n- The first person, partially crouching, is dressed in yellow shorts and is actively splashing his hand in the water, creating a spray around him.\n- Next to him, a person wearing a black swimsuit with a light-colored hat on his head is running through the water. His posture suggests movement and energy.\n- The third individual, positioned more to the right and facing outward, wears dark shorts. He is depicted in the midst of running, with one leg elevated behind him.\n- The fourth person, to the far right, is dressed in a burgundy garment and is poised in a squatting position with his arms outstretched, likely stabilizing himself against the push of the wave.\n\nThe ocean in the background presents soothing waves under a clear, bright sky, enhancing the sense of a joyful, sunny day on the beach. This photo captures joyful, carefree moments of youth, kinship, and a natural interaction with the environment. The composition, with the individuals spread across the frame and engaging with the water distinctively, contributes to the lively and spontaneous essence of this beachside snapshot.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543397","545218","547688","543216","556295","555923","553072","543395","547009","551931","555892","550929","553449","543225","553781","543391"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["wave","outstretche","short","person","beach","burgundy","run","squat","poise","stabilize"]}
