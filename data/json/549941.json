{"path":"549941.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a landfill, with a focus on two large pieces of heavy machinery working amidst a sprawling expanse of waste. In the foreground, a bulldozer with the brand name \"Allis-Chalmers\" visibly inscribed and the number \"21,\" is advancing directly towards the camera. The bulldozer, painted in a yellowish hue, features tank tracks and a large blade at the front. It emits a plume of black smoke from a stack on the top, indicating active operation.\n\nTo the right of this bulldozer, slightly further in the background, is another similar piece of equipment, also painted in a yellowish hue but with different machinery attachments that suggest it may be used for leveling or moving larger quantities of debris. This second machine is parked, with no visible emissions or movement.\n\nThe landscape around the machinery is overwhelmingly filled with debris and waste materials, which vary from domestic garbage to pieces of wood and unidentifiable rubble, covering the ground as far as the eye can see. The background beyond the waste is less distinct, suggesting a tree line or forested area under a clear, blue sky. The overall scene presents a stark portrayal of waste management, highlighting the scale and environmental implications of landfill operations.","title":"Garbage is spread and compacted in landfill operation at croton dump","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["549796","549807","549797","546247","549937","546251","549938","546231","549794","546257","549795","546239","548322","548348","546250","543828"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bulldozer","waste","machinery","piece","inscribe","attachment","implication","quantity","blade","paint"]}
