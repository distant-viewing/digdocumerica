{"path":"542703.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene in which a young girl is sitting amidst a vibrant and lush field of yellow flowers. The girl, who appears to be around eight to ten years old, is wearing a long-sleeve green top and a red skirt decorated with colorful circles and crescent shapes. She holds a bowl from which she is eating, using a spoon. \n\nHer expression is one of quiet contentment as she focuses on her meal, oblivious or accustomed to the natural beauty surrounding her. The yellow flowers bloom profusely around her, filling the frame with bright color and texture, creating a lively yet soothing backdrop. The lighting is natural, suggesting it is likely outdoor daylight, which enhances the vividness of the flowers and softly illuminates the girlâ€™s features. The setting is peaceful and idyllic, evoking a sense of tranquility and simplicity.","title":"Kathy martin carrying a plant home from school through a field of yellow poppies","placename":"Lompoc (Calif.)","location":"Lompoc, California","nn1":["543655","553529","551826","543319","545307","543835","558184","553524","544439","546566","543979","556139","551458","558183","542704","544747"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["girl","contentment","flower","bowl","circle","eat","meal","flowers","year","vividness"]}
