{"path":"554735.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil autumnal scene focused on a variety of trees showing seasonal colors. In the foreground, several branches of a tree with golden yellow leaves fill much of the frame, illuminated by sunlight, which enhances their vibrant hue against a darker, shady backdrop. The leaves are thin and somewhat heart-shaped, indicating they could be from an aspen or a similar species.\n\nSlightly offset to the right and behind the foreground leaves stands a tall, coniferous tree. Its dark green needles and triangular shape contrast starkly with the warm tones and softer textures of the surrounding deciduous leaves.\n\nFurther in the background, the composition softly blurs into a misty scene where muted colors hint at distant forest-covered hills, contributing to the depth and peaceful ambiance of the setting. The overall effect is one of layered natural textures and serene wilderness, typical of a temperate forest in the fall season.","title":"Trembling Aspen leaves and a balsam fir spire on blue ridge road","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["550603","554739","554737","554668","554736","554727","546011","554738","554730","554715","554718","557821","558074","557127","546090","557822"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["leave","heart","shape","needle","forest","specie","texture","wilderness","season","tree"]}
