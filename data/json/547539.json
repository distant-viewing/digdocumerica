{"path":"547539.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial landscape under a hazy sky, possibly during sunrise or sunset, given the soft lighting and warm tones. The foreground is dominated by a rough, grassy terrain interspersed with some shrubs and a bare tree on the left. This natural, somewhat unkempt vegetation contrasts sharply with the industrial activity seen in the background.\n\nIn the middle distance, there are numerous smoke or steam clouds rising and spreading across the scene, contributing to the atmospheric haze. This pollution likely originates from the variety of visible structures in the background that suggest industrial operations. Notable among these structures is a tall chimney emitting a significant amount of smoke or steam.\n\nA body of water, reflecting sunlight, is visible amidst the industrial setting, and there are patches of muddy or bare earth around it, possible due to industrial impact. The overall scene portrays a juxtaposition of natural landscapes against human industrial activity, emphasizing themes of environmental impact and industrialization. The mood is somewhat somber and contemplative, accentuated by the dim lighting and expansive clouds of emissions.","title":"Open burning at city dump","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["545268","545239","551555","550181","551026","552188","549965","545020","544173","543813","551054","557225","557220","552194","547084","543668"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["steam","smoke","industrialization","impact","cloud","sunrise","emission","amount","chimney","haze"]}
