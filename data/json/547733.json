{"path":"547733.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a scene of trees silhouetted against a vibrant, orange-hued sky, which might suggest a sunset or the effect of a filter. The trees, dense with branches and perhaps early spring or late autumn foliage, fill much of the frame, creating a textured mosaic of natural forms. The branches are intricately intertwined and overlap extensively, increasing the complexity of the visual. The intensity of the orange color in the background gives a warm, almost surreal atmosphere to the image. Additionally, the light seems to vary in intensity across different areas of the sky, with some parts near the center appearing almost white as if the sun might be positioned there, further enhancing the sunset-like impression. There are no distinct human figures or artificial structures visible; the focus is entirely on the natural elements.","title":"Sun shines through the trees on the Colorado river indian reservation","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["542625","543621","543137","547705","554731","543410","543400","557588","554956","543145","555164","543415","546533","547719","554954","542618"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["intensity","sunset","mosaic","visual","increase","branch","overlap","intertwine","complexity","autumn"]}
