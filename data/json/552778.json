{"path":"552778.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph captures an unusual scene involving a bright red, futuristic-looking car with a large, black, clamshell-style canopy that is open. Two men are seated in the car, appearing cheerful and spirited. The man on the left, with brown hair and wearing a beige jacket, excitedly raises both of his hands in the air. The man on the right, with darker hair, also seems to be in a joyful mood, and wears a dark blue suit with a light blue shirt.\n\nBehind them, an older man is standing outside the car, to the left, dressed in a dark suit and tie, observing and perhaps supervising the situation. The background features a commercial or office building with a stone facade and large windows reflecting the surrounding, including a canopy labeled \"CLEARANCE 8'4\"\".\n\nThe setting has a distinctly vintage or retro flavor, indicated by the architecture and the style of clothing. The overall ambiance of the image suggests a special event or demonstration possibly related to the unique car, featuring excitement and engagement from the participants.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the marriott motor inn, ann arbor vehicles and hardware were assembled at the epa ann arbor laboratory.
