{"path":"543620.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of two young leaves, likely from a species of nettle or similar plant, basking in sunlight. The leaves are rich in detail, showing intricate vein patterns and a slightly serrated edge. One leaf, taking prominence in the foreground, is viewed from the top and cast in a dark green shade accentuated by the sunlight creating bright, creamy green highlights along its veins. The other leaf, partially obscured and positioned slightly behind the first, is angled in such a way that the sunlight filters through, giving it a luminescent, lighter green appearance.\n\nThe background is softly blurred and mostly comprises earthy brown tones, likely the forest floor or underbrush, which provides a natural, unobtrusive backdrop that emphasizes the vivid greenery of the leaves. The focus and lighting in the image highlight the texture and delicate structures of the leaves, celebrating their natural beauty and intricate design. The overall composition is serene, with the play of light and shadow adding depth and a sense of tranquility.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["557593","542688","557539","551356","542686","551357","558077","555040","544731","551372","555038","554993","555041","558080","554744","553361"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["vein","leaf","leave","sunlight","celebrat","ligh","first","angl","underbrush","prominence"]}
