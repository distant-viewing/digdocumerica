{"path":"547986.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a large pile of various types of discarded vehicle tires and some wheels, accumulated in a junkyard setting. Among the tires, there are both small car tires and larger ones likely from trucks, many with visible treads and rims. Some tires are stacked on top of each other, while others are haphazardly thrown into the heap. The background is somewhat overcast, giving a gloomy overture to the scene. Visible in the background to the right, there is a partial view of a red structure with the text \"-EAT.\" This could be part of a sign, possibly indicating a nearby establishment. The ground is littered with broken parts and debris, enhancing the overall disorganized and discarded appearance of the scene.","title":"Old tires heaped up at site of controversial landfill operation in the spring creek area of Jamaica bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["542531","555521","554335","553006","549773","546268","552999","549776","554348","549023","557973","542656","558257","553004","546893","552738"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["tire","junkyard","accumulate","discarded","throw","gloomy","rim","broken","heap","establishment"]}
