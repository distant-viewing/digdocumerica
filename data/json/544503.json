{"path":"544503.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph displays an aerial view of a rural or semi-rural area, featuring several distinct elements. Below, a sizable body of water -- possibly a pond or small lake -- anchors the forefront. Adjacent to this is a large, modern building complex that includes several interconnected structures, some with flat roofs and others with slightly pitched roofs. This complex seems to be a facility of some kind, possibly commercial or institutional, as suggested by its design and isolated location.\n\nTo the left of the building, a paved road running parallel hosts a few cars, indicating some traffic but not a busy thoroughfare. Across the road from this establishment, a smaller and more traditional building can be seen, possibly a residential home.\n\nBehind the main structure, the landscape unfolds into a vast expanse of flat, undeveloped land, covered with scrub and scattered trees, stretching toward the horizon. The area is ringed by more forest or woodland, giving it a secluded feel. Additionally, there are other paved paths and smaller structures scattered throughout the property, alongside neatly parked cars, suggesting functional usage areas possibly for staff or visitors.\n\nThe setting appears serene, with the natural landscape dominating most of the view, hinting at either a conservation, research facility, or a retreat located away from urban centers. The photograph captures a moment of calm, with clear skies and an expansive view that conveys a sense of isolation and tranquility.","title":"National Park headquarters","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556994","545896","556972","558061","557748","556931","551613","548022","557750","558054","556971","558056","556993","551304","556968","547248"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["complex","staff","scrub","thoroughfare","retreat","facility","usage","woodland","roof","establishment"]}
