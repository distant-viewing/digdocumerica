{"path":"544431.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph showcases two individuals engaged in the craft of weaving inside a rustic, wood-paneled room, suggesting a traditional workshop setting. The room is characterized by a substantial presence of wood both in structure and furnishings, conveying a warm, aged atmosphere typically seen in artisan workspaces.\n\nIn the foreground, a woman is seated on a colorful woven rug, meticulously working on a similarly intricate large weaving loom that displays a bold, geometric design. Next to her, various weaving tools and materials, such as yarns and possibly spools, are scattered about, emphasizing the ongoing nature of her work.\n\nAnother individual, also working on a weaving project, is visible towards the back of the room. Positioned similarly on the floor, this person adds to the sense of industry and traditional craftsmanship that permeates the scene.\n\nThe space itself is illuminated dimly by natural light filtering through a window and augmented by overhead industrial-style lamps, highlighting the dust motes in the air and casting shadows that accentuate the wooden beams and floors. Shelves filled with boxes and other items line walls, enhancing the storeroom feel of the workshop. The atmosphere is one of focused productivity intertwined with cultural preservation, likely emphasizing the continuation of a traditional art form.","title":"Navajo weavers at Hubbel Trading Post, the first such post on the Navajo reservation","placename":"Ganado (Ariz.)","location":"Ganado, Arizona","nn1":["544416","544360","557153","558325","552649","551654","557151","555533","551659","555290","543928","557945","558327","554432","558341","552114"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["room","workshop","floor","productivity","furnishing","wood","preservation","craftsmanship","continuation","craft"]}
