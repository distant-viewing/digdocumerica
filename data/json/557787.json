{"path":"557787.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at what appears to be a cultural or folk festival under a large striped tent, predominately red and white. Inside the tent, a group of senior dancers is entertaining an audience. The performers and some members of the audience are dressed in traditional European, possibly German or Austrian, folk costumes, which include knee-length breeches, embroidered vests, and dirndl dresses.\n\nTwo musicians, one with a guitar and the other with an accordion, both wearing similar folk attire with suspenders, are playing music. These musicians are framed in the foreground on either side of the image, providing a sense of being in the midst of the event, looking out across the performers to the watchers. The audience is seated at long tables covered with red tablecloths. They appear engaged and delighted, watching the dancers and clapping along.\n\nIn the background, we can see more of the tent structure and some natural landscape outside, suggesting that the event is held in a scenic outdoor location. The image conveys a warm, communal atmosphere, with a focus on tradition and entertainment.","title":"Visitors to the annual Oktoberfest at Helen dance to authentic Bavarian style music provided by two German ski instructors on leave from a nearby North Georgia ski resort. The small mountain community of some 270 people was typical of villages in the area until 1969. At that time businessmen, officials and residents endorsed the Renovation of the business district with a Bavarian Alpine theme. The project has increased business and tourism.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557789","557791","557790","557792","547371","557786","557794","557802","553232","558284","547317","558286","557784","551019","547403","553235"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Community Gatherings"],"terms":["folk","tent","audience","dancer","performer","musician","tablecloth","guitar","costume","entertainment"]}
