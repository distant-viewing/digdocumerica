{"path":"557719.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph shows a vivid outdoor scene centered around the activity of hot air ballooning. There are two main hot air balloons in focus; one is fully inflated and upright, featuring a colorful design with vertical stripes of blue, red, yellow, and other colors, along with a speckled pattern near the top. The other balloon is still partially inflated and lies more horizontally across the ground, showcasing a purple and white striped design.\n\nAround these balloons, there are several people involved in managing the setup and inflation process. These individuals appear scattered, with some holding the ropes or fabric of the balloons, and others simply observing or conversing. Additionally, there is a variety of vehicles, including a couple of trucks and a vintage black car adorned with a sign, suggesting it might be part of an official crew or a sponsor.\n\nThe landscape is open and grassy, with a background of rolling hills and dense forest. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a soft light without harsh shadows. There is a relaxed, yet busy atmosphere as people work together towards launching these impressive balloons. The overall composition of the photograph captures both a sense of activity and the serene environment in which this event is taking place.","title":"Hot air balloons being inflated with propane burners outside of helen, Georgia, near robertstown for the second annual helen to atlantic ocean balloon race.
