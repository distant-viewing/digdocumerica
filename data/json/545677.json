{"path":"545677.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic yet industrial scene set in what appears to be a desert or arid landscape. The central focus of the image is a large construction site where land-moving activities are evident. There is a large industrial dump truck or possibly a loader in the middle-right section of the frame, with its bed lifted, suggesting the depositing or unloading of material. The soil around this area is heavily disturbed, characterized by deep ruts and tracks indicating recent heavy machinery movement.\n\nAround the construction activity, the land is barren with no visible vegetation, emphasizing the stark, natural beauty typical of desert environments. The background features dramatic ridges and plateaus, elements typical of a rugged desert landscape. The overcast sky adds a moody, somber tone to the scene, with cloud cover that suggests a cool or possibly inclement weather setting.\n\nOverall, the image juxtaposes the rough mechanical intervention against a vast, tranquil wilderness, underlined by the cool tones and the remote setting. It illustrates human impact in a natural landscape, potentially for development or resource extraction.","title":"Unloading oil laden debris: part of epa supervised clean-up of the San Juan river oil spill.  285,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a burst pipeline and flowed 200 miles downstream before it was contained by a log boom.
