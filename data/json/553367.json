{"path":"553367.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene where a man is lying on his stomach on the ground in a forest, taking a close-up photo of a plant. The man, sporting a thick beard and long hair partially obscured by the camera, holds a black Canon SLR camera, focusing intently on his subject. He wears a dark green shirt which blends subtly with the natural surroundings. \n\nIn the foreground, the subject of his photography appears to be a Showy Orchis plant, characterized by its vibrant purple flowers arranged in a dense cluster atop broad, green leaves. The plant stands out against the forest floor covered in brown leaf litter, tiny sprigs of green grass, and various other small plants.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but shows a typical dense forest environment filled with various shades of green vegetation, suggesting it might be either late spring or early summer. The lighting in the scene is natural, with dapples of sunlight filtering through the trees, enhancing the tranquil and focused mood of the scene.","title":"\"fern freaks\" follow the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553365","544632","554797","545616","543615","555040","554991","554743","558108","542615","558088","552688","544236","554993","542716","543319"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","forest","subject","dapple","beard","camera","leaf","photography","dense","close"]}
