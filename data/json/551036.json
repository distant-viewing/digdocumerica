{"path":"551036.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by a coal processing facility. The foreground of the image is cluttered with piles of rocks and rubble, indicative of mining activity. The colors here are mainly shades of brown and grey, blending with some scattered debris and small, vegetative growths that appear to be struggling to survive in the harsh environment.\n\nIn the middle of the frame stands the main structure of the facility, which is a large, multistory building composed of several blocks connected by pipes and covered conveyors. The building has a stark, utilitarian design typical of industrial architecture, with visible wear and some signs of rust that suggest it is not new.\n\nFurther back, the background is composed of a densely forested mountain, providing a stark contrast to the industrial activity in the foreground. This juxtaposition emphasizes the encroachment of industrialization into natural landscapes. The sky is overcast, casting an even, diffused light over the entire scene and contributing to a somber mood.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph can be described as a depiction of industrial grit against a natural backdrop, highlighting themes of exploitation and the environmental footprint of heavy industry. There are no people visible in the image, which may suggest the absence of immediate human activity or the depersonalization often associated with large-scale industrial operations.","title":"The large slag pile in foreground has been covered with dirt to keep down the dust at the Valley Camp Coal Company.","placename":"Shrewsbury (W.
