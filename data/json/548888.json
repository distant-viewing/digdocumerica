{"path":"548888.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a middle-aged man standing outdoors. He has a stern expression with his arms crossed in front of him. The man is well-dressed in a brown suit paired with a blue and brown striped tie. His hair is neatly combed back, showing signs of graying.\n\nIn the background, there's a simple, modern building, possibly an office or institutional structure with visible windows and a part of another similar building adjacent to it. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting it might be a sunny day.\n\nOverall, the setting appears to be a business or corporate environment, and the man's serious demeanor and professional attire seem to underscore a formal or authoritative role or situation.","title":"Dr. Melvin Carter, director of EPA's National Research Center at Las Vegas","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["557144","549114","557648","552864","545087","557078","550739","552872","557032","545520","554845","556443","546636","546419","547277","552781"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["situation","tie","man","demeanor","office","role","suit","business","arm","front"]}
