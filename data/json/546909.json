{"path":"546909.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a busy maritime scene involving a large cargo ship and several tugboats. The prominent ship in the image, named \"Chevron Hawaii,\" is painted in striking red and black colors, with its name clearly visible on the bow. The ship is adorned with a string of flags extending from its bow to stern, suggesting a special occasion or a ceremonial context. Several tugboats surround the vessel, actively assisting in maneuvering or docking procedures. The tugboats create dynamic water disturbances, indicating they are in motion.\n\nThe background features a busy industrial port area with multiple cranes and additional cargo ships, suggesting a bustling harbor environment. The sky appears cloudy, casting a soft light over the scene, and the water reflects this diffused lighting. The viewpoint is from an elevated position, possibly from a bridge or another ship, giving a wide overview of the operations and emphasizing the scale of the ship and its industrial surroundings. The overall impression is one of organized, large-scale maritime activity.","title":"Tugboats move the newly launched tanker, \"Chevron Hawaii,\" to its berth.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546919","546751","550896","550892","546845","546832","551990","546834","550895","546843","546766","550894","550906","550893","549892","546828"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["ship","tugboat","bow","cargo","procedure","string","docking","overview","occasion","scale"]}
