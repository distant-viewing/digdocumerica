{"path":"543283.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and bustling marine scene at sunset or sunrise, characterized by vibrant, moody lighting and a rich array of colors, primarily in hues of deep blue and orange. In the foreground, the ocean is teeming with a large flock of birds, likely seagulls, engaged in frenetic activity. The water appears choppy and is scattered with reflections and glimmers of light, which enhance the sense of movement.\n\nIn the middle distance, a sailboat sails calmly, contrasting with the dynamic activity of the birds. Notably, there is a sizable smoke plume emitting from the craft, trailing into the sky and mixing with the dusky tones of the horizon. This striking visual element adds a hint of mystery or concern, depending on the viewer's interpretation, about why the boat is producing such smoke amidst a natural setting.\n\nThe background is dominated by the sunset, with the sky transitioning from shades of blue at the top to warmer oranges and yellows near the horizon. Few clouds are visible, suggesting a clear day. Additionally, a few birds are scattered in flight higher up in the sky, isolated from the main flock, adding depth and layers to the composition.\n\nOverall, the photograph is packed with action and contrastsâ€”the tranquility of the sailing boat against the wild flurry of the birds, and the serene yet potent colors of the sky contrasting with the harsh smoke plume from the boat.","title":"California--zmudowski state beach","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"Zmudowski Beach State Park, California","nn1":["544609","553991","552238","547008","543003","545026","543059","544661","544655","548247","553875","550888","553857","553992","550304","544251"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["bird","flock","smoke","plume","boat","orange","sunset","glimmer","depend","interpretation"]}
