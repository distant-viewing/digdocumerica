{"path":"556671.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts the interior of a passenger train, capturing a busy and somewhat dimly lit scene. The image conveys a sense of movement through the corridor among seated passengers. In the middle ground, two men are standing in the aisle; one seems to be moving towards the rear of the train, while the other is engaging with or assisting him in some manner.\n\nSeated passengers are arranged to either side of the aisle. The seats are upholstered in a patterned fabric of warm red and orange tones, and the passengers exhibit a variety of expressions, some looking directly at the camera, others engaged in activity like reading a newspaper. The trainâ€™s overhead compartments are visible, indicative of travel activity with storage for luggage.\n\nThe image also features atmospheric lighting, with overhead lights casting a soft illumination over the passengers, which contributes to the warm, enclosed feel of the train car. The photograph has a pronounced vintage aesthetic, suggested by the style of the passengers' clothing and the interior design of the train. Overall, the scene presents a snapshot of travel, capturing a diverse group of individuals in transit.","title":"Passengers aboard a metroliner enroute from Washington district of Columbia, to New York city","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556061","556656","555974","556095","556781","556834","556833","555977","556080","556081","556062","549893","556094","556097","556117","555982"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","passenger","aisle","passengers","travel","upholster","pronounced","corridor","luggage","compartment"]}
