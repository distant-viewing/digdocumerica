{"path":"556791.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant urban street scene, presumably taken in the mid-20th century based on the style of the vehicles and architecture. The image shows a busy roadway lined with a variety of vehicles, including buses and cars. In the foreground, an older model bus with a distinctive white body and a striped design is visible; it is marked with the number \"120.\" It is accompanied by a classic American car from the 1960s or 1970s, identifiable by its sleek, long body and large front grille.\n\nAlso evident in the scene is a second bus with the number \"4172,\" sporting a similar design but with a different color stripe. There are several other vehicles, including another bus and a vintage van, providing a glimpse into the diverse traffic of the era.\n\nThe setting is an urban street with tall buildings. One of the buildings has a clear sign reading \"FIDELITY,\" suggesting itâ€™s possibly a bank or financial institution. There are mature trees along the sidewalk, and multiple pedestrians are visible. A man in a suit is just stepping off the curb, and a few other pedestrians appear to be waiting or walking near the buses.\n\nThe photograph is likely taken from the perspective of another vehicle or a stationary point on the street, as evidenced by part of a tree trunk and its foliage framing the right side of the image. This all combines to provide a lively snapshot of city life, showcasing the transportation and architecture of the time.","title":"Metropolitan Atlanta rapid transit authority (marta) buses in downtown Atlanta, Georgia.
