The logs are scattered across the foreground and middle-ground of the image with some forming loose clusters. The background features a densely wooded area with various types of trees, including both coniferous and deciduous species. The sky appears to be somewhat cloudy, suggesting overcast weather conditions. The overall setting suggests a serene, natural environment potentially used for log transportation or storage in a forested lake region. The image composition focuses on the interaction between the natural wooded landscape and the man-made aspect of the logging activity.","title":"Logs clog shoreline of St. Croix River above Georgia Pacific paper mill","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["550326","545036","552178","548004","552197","552161","550338","545037","548162","545028","548018","552163","555079","545266","552176","550321"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["log","quantity","lake","logging","specie","aspect","transportation","cluster","storage","type"]}
