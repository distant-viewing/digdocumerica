{"path":"553473.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures an urban setting, dominated by a complex network of multi-level highway interchanges and ramps. At the heart of the image, a pale-colored car travels alone on one of these elevated ramps. Below and around the ramps, segments of grass and undeveloped land hint at a city still adapting to or under construction around the highway infrastructure.\n\nIn the background, a city skyline with various buildings presents itself. Some buildings are tall, likely commercial types, while others have a more historical architecture, indicating an older part of the city. Notably featured on one of the buildings is a sign for \"Serta,\" prominent and visible even from this distance.\n\nThe sky is clear and a bright blue, suggesting a sunny day without clouds. The scene offers a snapshot of mid-20th century American urban design, highlighting both the motor-centric development and the juxtaposition of new infrastructure with older urban elements.","title":"Mulky square is a neighborhood in the west side of Kansas City, an area of low-income dwellings.
