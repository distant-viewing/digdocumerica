{"path":"549623.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a vivid and abstract scene achieved through a long exposure or motion blur technique. It primarily features an array of colorful, swirling light patterns against a predominantly dark background. Various hues of red and white dominate the image. These swirling patterns give a sense of dynamic motion, resembling spinning neon lights or possibly illuminated signs at night.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, there is a noticeable blur of urban elements, which might include fragments of signs, streetlights, or other cityscape components. However, the blurring makes it difficult to identify specific details accurately.\n\nThe overall effect is an artistic, impressionistic representation of a lively, urban nightlife scene or a carnival, where lights and movement blend into a tapestry of color and energy. The composition focuses heavily on the interplay of light and motion, capturing a moment that feels both chaotic and harmonious.","title":"Light patterns created by multi-colored casino displays in downtown Las Vegas","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["553024","549111","551297","554360","555213","557610","555804","555431","553298","553883","555446","549543","547051","555714","542766","551239"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["blur","motion","carnival","streetlight","neon","tapestry","technique","fragment","representation","pattern"]}
