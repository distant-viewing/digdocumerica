{"path":"548012.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This image presents an aerial view of a dam infrastructure. The dam cuts across a wide river, flanked by towering barren mountain slopes that display various shades of brown, tan, and muted gray, indicative of rocky or sandy terrains with scant vegetation. The dam itself is a substantial structure, featuring a series of arches along its length and adjoining roads or paths that run parallel on both the upper and lower levels.\n\nAt the bottom part of the dam, several built structures can be seen, likely operational facilities for dam maintenance and operation. Directly adjacent to the dam, on its upper side, is a body of water that appears calm and expansive. There are various protruding sections into the water, possibly for control, monitoring activities, or small docking areas. Additional smaller structures are visible on the dam, which could house control equipment or serve as checkpoints.\n\nAcross the dam, an extensive, smoothly surfaced road runs parallel to the water, following the contour of the rugged terrain. No vehicles or people are discernible in this image, emphasizing the stillness and isolation of the location.\n\nThe photograph captures the scale and engineering complexity of the dam infrastructure within a natural, albeit stark, scenic setting. The overall tone of the image suggests a blend of human ingenuity and the raw, undeveloped character of the natural landscape.","title":"Rock Island Dam is the oldest dam on the Columbia River.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548920","548947","548927","548013","548975","548938","548003","549004","548925","544166","548936","548940","549024","548007","544141","548016"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["dam","control","docking","infrastructure","engineering","arch","stillness","road","complexity","terrain"]}
