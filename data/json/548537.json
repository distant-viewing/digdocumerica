{"path":"548537.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene day at a waterfront location, showing a scene of leisure and relaxation. There are three primary elements in the picture that contribute to its peaceful atmosphere.\n\n1. **Person Sunbathing:** In the foreground, on a wide concrete pier, there is a person lying on their back. This person is sunbathing, dressed in what appears to be a two-piece swimsuit, suggesting a warm sunny day. The individual is positioned near the edge of the pier, with their head close to a set of rusty metal handrails that would typically assist in entering the water.\n\n2. **Boating Activity:** Midway in the photo, further out into the calm blue water, there is a small boat. This boat appears to be a rowboat occupied by two people, indicating recreational or leisure activity. Their presence adds a dynamic element to an otherwise still scene.\n\n3. **Background and Environment:** The expansive body of water stretches outward, meeting the clear blue sky at the horizon which effectively conveys a sense of openness and tranquility. The water is calm with very mild ripples, reflecting a gentle breeze perhaps, and further enhancing the relaxing mood of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—with the person lying down in the foreground, the boat with occupants in the middle distance, and the vast water and sky in the background—forms a layered perspective on leisurely outdoor activities by the water. The photo evokes a feeling of peacefulness and a leisurely pace of life, inviting the viewer to enjoy a moment of calm and relaxation.","title":"Enjoying the Atlantic Ocean from the southernmost swimming pier of the United States","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["545293","544260","543951","550324","553403","543059","550232","546856","552978","543881","543143","550228","552038","547781","550826","544266"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["relaxation","pier","boat","person","water","sunbathing","handrail","leisure","rowboat","pace"]}
