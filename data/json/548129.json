{"path":"548129.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a vast, sweeping landscape centered around a prominent body of water resembling a river or large lake. The picture is taken from a high vantage point, overlooking the scene. A striking element is the shadow of the photographer projected onto the grassy terrain in the foreground, suggesting the photo was taken in the late afternoon when shadows are elongated.\n\nOn the left, the river curves around a bend, surrounded by barren hills with minimal vegetation that are typical of arid or semi-arid regions. The colors of the hills are a mix of earthy tones, primarily browns and muted greens, reflecting a dry environment.\n\nDirectly beneath the viewing point, there is a railway line with a long freight train moving along it. The train, consisting of numerous red and other dark-colored cars, appears small due to the perspective but adds a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nThe landscape is sparsely vegetated but includes patches of yellow flowering plants close to the photographer, adding bursts of color to the otherwise muted natural palette. The water body itself shimmers under the clear sky, with gentle ripples suggesting a light breeze.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a serene yet isolated moment in a sparsely populated, rugged terrain with human elements like the train subtly included, indicating the intersection of natural beauty and human activity.","title":"Columbia River Gorge at Wishram, Washington, overlooking railroad","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555887","557503","548167","548010","557958","543826","549131","550433","543716","550598","550586","545636","542653","556009","543793","552548"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["photographer","train","bend","burst","freight","point","breeze","hill","intersection","river"]}
