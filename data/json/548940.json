{"path":"548940.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a river with a dam. The river flows through a predominantly arid landscape, characterized by bare, sandy, and rocky terrain with minimal vegetation. The dam is located in the lower part of the image, with water visibly flowing over its spillways, creating a frothy white pattern on the surface where the water lands. This body of water appears as a reflective, vibrant blue color, contrasting sharply with the dull brown and tan colors of the surrounding land.\n\nThe river spans from the top right corner to the bottom left corner of the image, curving gently and divided by the structure of the dam. The dam itself is a significant but compact structure in this wide landscape, suggesting its robustness and engineered precision.\n\nIn the background, distant mountains can be seen under a clear blue sky, adding a sense of depth and vastness to the scene. The influence of the sun is evident as it creates shimmering reflections on the water and casts shadows that define the contours of the terrain and dam structure. No people or moving objects are visible in the scene, which underscores the tranquility and isolation of this engineered environment nested within a natural setting.","title":"Diversion dam on the Colorado River below Parker, Arizona","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548925","548927","548938","548947","548012","548007","548975","548013","548936","549004","548920","548915","548003","548016","553660","548024"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","corner","river","spillway","precision","land","influence","water","terrain","contour"]}
