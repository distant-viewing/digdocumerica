{"path":"557368.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a tender family moment outside a house. It features three individuals: a woman holding a baby and a man looking at them. The baby, appearing lively and expressive, is in mid-yawn or cry, dressed in a light striped onesie. The woman, holding the baby, is smiling gently at the baby with affection and amusement. She has dark hair, partially pulled back, and wears a white blouse. On the right side of the frame, the man, presumably the father, is observing the scene. He has dark, tousled hair, glasses, and also wears a white shirt.\n\nThe background sets a humble, homey scene with the door of a simple, stone-built house slightly visible. The lighting suggests it might be daytime due to the natural light illuminating their faces and creating soft shadows. The overall mood is familial and intimate, focusing on the interaction between the child and the adults.","title":"Ernest Watkins looks at one of his gRandchildren held by his daughter, Sandy (not her child), at the new family home. The Watkins were forced to move from their house in the Mulkey Square area of Kansas City, Missouri (across town). It took the family two months to find rental housing within their price range ($80 per month). Many of their neighbors from the old low income neighborhood were not as lucky in finding other housing after their dwellings were condemned for a highway project.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["556235","553496","558405","556294","557369","547398","543866","558409","544230","556233","547135","553094","553523","553543","551027","553500"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["baby","father","affection","amusement","house","hair","woman","family","blouse","adult"]}
