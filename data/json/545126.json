{"path":"545126.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph showcases a spectacular natural sea landscape featuring a large, rugged rock formation with sharp cliffs in the foreground, situated in the middle of a body of water. The rock is impressive with layers of sediment and a flat plateau on top, suggestive of erosion by the sea. The water surrounding the rock is deep blue with white waves crashing against the rock, indicating strong ocean currents or tides.\n\nIn the background, there is a panoramic view of a coastal landscape that includes mountains, which are softly lit by sunlight, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. The mountains have a gentle slope and are covered with greenery, trees or grass, presenting a serene, undisturbed natural environment. The sky above is partly cloudy with flecks of blue visible, suggesting calm weather.\n\nOverall, the image presents a stunning natural scene, emphasizing the contrast between the enduring, steadfast rock formation and the dynamic, ever-moving sea. The backdrop provides a sense of tranquility and grandeur, enhancing the majestic feel of the seascape.","title":"Rocky coastline","placename":"Seaside (Or.)","location":"Seaside, Oregon","nn1":["543250","545122","545173","545130","542917","543139","543307","553775","543289","553771","543092","543295","543080","543309","543306","543328"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rock","sea","plateau","formation","tide","seascape","mountain","current","sediment","grandeur"]}
