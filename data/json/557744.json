{"path":"557744.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in a natural, serene setting. A young man is standing on rocks in the middle of a shallow, gently flowing river. He is wearing casual clothing: a yellow t-shirt, blue jeans, and dark-colored boots. The man is looking downwards, possibly at something in his hands, seemingly absorbed in his task.\n\nThe background features a robust, arching stone bridge with a simple yet elegant balustrade, spanning across the river. The bridge is partially surrounded by lush green trees and vegetation, indicative of a temperate climate. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, possibly secluded area, evoking a sense of tranquility and immersion in nature.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests that it is either early morning or late afternoon, given the softness and angle of the light that highlights the person and the bridge. The photograph overall has a vibrant, yet slightly muted color palette typical of film photography from past decades, which adds a nostalgic quality to the scene.","title":"Tourist pauses for a moment of solitude at the Chattahoochee River south of the Georgia Highway 17/75 bridge at the western entrance to Helen, a small mountain community of some 270 people. It was a typical village in the area until 1969 when local officials, businessmen, and residents endorsed the Renovation of the business district with a Bavarian alpine theme. Success of the project attracted new businesses and a surge of tourists between May and October.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544994","542555","542509","550235","557971","543628","543829","547251","557996","542556","558015","554520","554848","552976","553070","549012"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["bridge","immersion","balustrade","softness","overall","photography","t","river","film","boot"]}
