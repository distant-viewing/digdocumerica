{"path":"550859.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial outdoor scene with a mix of natural and man-made elements. In the foreground, there is a small stone building with a gabled roof; this structure houses a water wheel, partially visible and integrated with the building. A stream of water cascades from the building into a creek lined by stone walls.\n\nTwo people, possibly children due to their size compared to the environment, are walking along the edge of the creek, exploring or playing near the water. The individuals are wearing dark clothes.\n\nIn the background, an industrial facility with multiple tall smokestacks dominates the scene. This plant is actively emitting smoke, which blends into the cloud-filled sky. The factory's presence introduces a stark contrast to the relatively pastoral feel of the foreground with the grassy banks and tranquil water.\n\nThis scene captures a juxtaposition of industrial development and natural landscape, possibly hinting at themes of environmental impact, recreation, or coexistence between human industry and nature.","title":"Thilmany Pulp and Paper Company (background) overlooks the Grignon House water wheel at the Kaukauna locks on the Fox River just above Appleton. Originally built by the Army Corps of Engineers, the locks are no longer employed for commercial navigation. They are used only to permit small boat traffic between Lake Winnebago and Green Bay.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554630","557377","543813","550857","544328","543009","550684","545996","557376","552194","550672","550673","550995","552210","550694","551156"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["creek","stone","cascade","recreation","coexistence","clothe","water","wheel","stream","smokestack"]}
