{"path":"550148.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph features a vintage scene with a residential setting. In the foreground, there's a red, vintage car – possibly from the 1960s or 1970s – parked on a driveway. A man stands to the side of the car, holding its door open and looking towards the camera. He's dressed in a light-colored shirt and dark pants. Behind him, a woman can be seen standing by the doorway of a white house, watching the scene; she appears to be wearing a light-colored dress.\n\nThe garage door behind the car is strikingly painted with the American flag, covering the entire area of the door with its red, white, and blue stripes and white stars on a blue background. The house itself is traditional, possibly made of wood, and suggests a suburban American environment from the mid-20th century. There are trees and shrubs around, contributing to a serene and homely atmosphere. This setting and the objects provide a nostalgic view of American life in that era, with the flag adding a strong nationalistic or patriotic element to the scene.","title":"The Staley's, residents of suburban Lakewood, recently spruced up the doors of their 50-year-old garage with red, white and blue paint.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550152","546817","555922","551119","551021","557873","557900","557692","557667","557841","551090","557878","547494","551109","557766","557840"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["door","flag","car","driveway","house","star","garage","doorway","1960","stripe"]}
