{"path":"548922.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of the Hoover Dam, surrounded by its distinctive geological and infrastructural features. The dam itself is a massive curved structure, made from concrete, showcasing its enormous scale and engineering prowess. Its surface is pale in color, providing a stark contrast to the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe dam holds back the dark blue waters of Lake Mead, which extends into the distance against a backdrop of mountainous terrain with various shades of brown and sparse vegetation, suggesting a rugged, arid environment. In front of the dam, on the downstream side, four large cylindrical structures (penstocks) are seen protruding from the water, likely associated with the dam's hydroelectric capabilities.\n\nOn the top of the dam, a road is visible, curving gently and lined with what appears to be safety barriers. This road connects the rocky hills that flank either side of the dam, emphasizing the challenging topography of the area. The terrain around the dam is a blend of jagged rocks and sparse, dry land, characteristic of the desolate beauty of this region.\n\nNo people, vehicles, or moving objects are discernible in the image, portraying a static yet awe-inspiring scene of this iconic American infrastructure project. The overall composition and vantage point offer a comprehensive view of the Hoover Damâ€™s engineering magnitude, its relationship with the natural environment, and its role in water management and electricity supply.","title":"Hoover Dam impounds Lake Mead and supplies electricity to Los Angeles","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548930","548913","548947","548920","548927","544141","548938","553828","548003","548013","549024","549004","548936","548975","544166","548012"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","engineering","magnitude","capability","electricity","relationship","awe","supply","topography","protrude"]}
