{"path":"547387.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a social gathering, likely a dance or ballroom event, with multiple participants involved in dancing and socializing on a large, dimly lit dance floor. The setting appears to be an indoor arena or auditorium, characterized by minimalistic architecture with bare, broad walls, and overall low lighting that casts a slightly nostalgic or evening ambiance.\n\nIn the image, various couples and small groups are either standing or dancing. The attire of the attendees suggests a casual to semi-formal event, characterized by a mix of patterns and styles. Many of the women are wearing dresses, some adorned with florals and vivid colors like red and blue, while others opt for simpler, lighter hues. Men are generally dressed in long-sleeve shirts, some paired with sweaters and pants. The styles and hairdos hint at vintage fashion, suggesting the era might be from a few decades ago.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is from an elevated angle, possibly taken from a balcony or upper tier, looking down onto the dance floor. This perspective allows a broad view of the activities below and provides an intimate glimpse into the interactions among the participants. The lighting focuses primarily on the center of the floor, leaving the edges of the room and background slightly shadowed, drawing the viewer's attention principally to the individuals and their movements in the middle portion of the image.","title":"Between sets at the 33rd annual square dance festival of Lincoln, held in Pershing Memorial Auditorium","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547403","558284","547386","547334","547371","547317","558286","547274","558285","547383","551710","547271","553304","553241","545868","551019"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dance","floor","participant","arena","socialize","tier","event","attendee","characterize","balcony"]}
