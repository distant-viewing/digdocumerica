{"path":"548891.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a woman in a scientific or laboratory setting. She is holding a circular object directly in front of the camera, which she seems to be examining. The object appears to be a petri dish or a similar scientific apparatus containing a sample or culture. The focus on the object slightly blurs the womanâ€™s profile in the background.\n\nThe woman is wearing a white lab coat, suggesting she is a scientist or lab technician. Her hairstyle, featuring volume and possibly pinned-back bangs, along with her makeup, reflects styles perhaps from the 1970s or 1980s. She is wearing a ring on the finger holding up the petri dish, indicating she might be married.\n\nThe background is softly focused but shows a typical laboratory environment with equipment and what appears to be a line of switches or controls along a wall, indicating a setting equipped for technical or scientific work.\n\nOverall, the composition centers on the woman's action of examining or presenting the object in her hand, set against the backdrop of the lab, which hints at research or scientific analysis. The lighting is soft, giving the photograph an almost intimate feel, drawing the viewer's attention to the object and her engagement with it.","title":"Laboratory at epa's Las Vegas national research center technician holds up an air filter","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548860","546288","546323","546327","548856","542737","549342","549354","548858","548862","548861","549608","546283","546285","546282","543834"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["lab","object","dish","woman","examine","switch","scientist","analysis","finger","ring"]}
