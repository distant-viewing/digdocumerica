{"path":"548003.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a large dam, illustrating its massive structure and surrounding environment. The dam, constructed from what appears to be concrete, dominates the lower left portion of the image, curving slightly as it spans the width of the river or lake. It features a series of large, rounded spillways along its crest, which are instrumental in managing water flow.\n\nThe water body contained by the dam is visible to the right of the dam, reflecting a deep blue color which contrasts starkly with the pale hue of the concrete. Below the dam, the textured, rocky terrain is visible and appears to be relatively barren, indicating this might be a remote or arid area.\n\nOn the far side of the dam (the upper right of the photograph), there is a series of terraced, cleared areas that might be used for additional development or maintenance related to the dam's operations. There are a few small structures and vehicles noticeable, suggesting human activity and possibly the ongoing management or monitoring of the facility.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a powerful example of human engineering and its interaction with the natural environment, emphasizing both the scale of the dam and its isolated setting.","title":"GRand coulee dam","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548920","548947","548936","548927","548938","544166","549004","548016","548007","548013","548975","553828","548012","548020","544141","548008"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","spillway","example","series","related","crest","terrace","cleared","width","monitoring"]}
