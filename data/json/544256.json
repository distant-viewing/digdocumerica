{"path":"544256.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a man engaging in a fishing activity on a boat. The man is positioned bending over at the waist, actively removing several fish from a net that he's holding. He is garbed in a relaxed, outdoor ensemble consisting of a white baseball cap, a white t-shirt, and patterned, plaid shorts. His focus is on the task as he works to transfer the fish from the net to a large, open cardboard box placed on the boat's floor, which already contains several other fish.\n\nThe general setting appears to be in a wide-open water body, likely a lake or a calm sea, under bright, sunny conditions given the vivid blue sky and the visibility of gentle waves on the water's surface in the background. The calmness of the scene suggests a peaceful day for fishing.\n\nNear the man, on the boat, are other items indicative of fishing and boating activities; these include a sizeable red gas can and a small outboard motor mounted at the stern of the boat. The motor, labeled \"18,\" looks well-used, suggesting regular activity or work done using this boat.\n\nThe composition of the photograph and the placement of objects within the frame invites the viewer into this serene, routine moment in the manâ€™s day, portraying a slice of life from a fisherman's experiences.","title":"'Crabbing'","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["552298","552273","545093","545185","546301","552122","545306","554200","552323","549334","552320","543484","545178","552282","546053","552324"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","fish","motor","fishing","net","ensemble","fisherman","stern","man","waist"]}
