{"path":"555968.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an older man dressed in a vivid red blazer and wearing a striped tie. He is speaking on a public payphone mounted on a wooden pylon. The scene is set at a train station with a dark-colored passenger train visible in the background, featuring reflective windows and a stripe design on the side.\n\nThe man appears focused on his conversation, holding the receiver tightly to his ear. His expression suggests seriousness or perhaps concentration. To his side, there is an orange baggage cart marked with the number \"8\" and the word \"REJECT\" printed toward its lower edge, suggesting it might be out of regular use.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph is industrial and somewhat dated, with visible wear and rustic elements on the wooden pylon and the somewhat aged appearance of the train and surroundings. The setting is outdoor, and the lighting seems naturally diffused, probably indicative of an overcast day. The colors red and orange of the man's attire and baggage cart stand out brightly against the more muted background.","title":"Amtrak employee checks with the station at the Los Angeles union passenger terminal.
