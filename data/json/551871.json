{"path":"551871.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This is a vibrant street scene, possibly captured in a German city, judging by the signage and architectural style. The photograph depicts a busy market or outdoor public area, bustling with various activities under an overcast sky. In the foreground, an array of white barrels (likely beer kegs) is neatly arranged, creating a dynamic yet chaotic visual layer. Behind these barrels, a woman in a traditional outfit, possibly a dirndl, is attending a vending machine, engaging with another individual dressed in casual modern clothing.\n\nTo her right, another man, dressed in a smart jacket and trousers, is walking past with an umbrella, suggesting recent or ongoing rain. This element adds a sense of urgency or briskness to the atmosphere. Further in the background, the scene continues to unfold with more people. One person in a red jacket appears lost in thought or perhaps navigating through the market.\n\nThe environment is filled with commercial activity; there are numerous crates and boxes, possibly containing goods for sale or delivery, stacked near a vintage green truck labeled \"136\". Above, the signage reads \"FRANZISKUS â€“ vergleicht die Zeit\", hinting at a store or advertisement. Various umbrellas are visible, held by passersby, underscoring the rainy weather.\n\nBuildings in the backdrop have a typical European architectural style with visible stonework and large windows. The entire composition captures the vibrant, bustling life of a cityscape, rich with social interactions and commercial exchange, enveloped in a typical urban European setting.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. On the rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire Fussgangerzone is thoroughly cleaned. This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551874","551847","551789","551873","551840","551788","551790","551862","550045","551842","551849","549671","551877","551839","557656","557663"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["umbrella","barrel","market","signage","vending","exchange","stonework","delivery","passersby","crate"]}
