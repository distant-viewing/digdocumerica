{"path":"552090.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene comprised of multiple elements that contribute to a pastoral and somewhat industrial atmosphere. In the foreground, there is a metal and wooden fence that extends across the image. Attached to this fence, there's a weathered 'For Sale or Trade' sign that indicates a real estate opportunity. The sign shows the contact information of a realty company along with a price.\n\nBeyond the fence, there is a lush field overgrown with grass and some wild plants, highlighting the rustic and unmanicured nature of the area. To the left in the midground, industrial structures can be seen. These include large cylindrical storage tanks and a facility with several smokestacks emitting white smoke, which suggests that this might be a small factory or processing plant.\n\nTo the right in the midground, there are residential or farm structures, including a house and a large barn or church-like building with a prominent steep roof and what appears to be a steeple or bell tower. These buildings seem to be well-maintained and typical of rural architecture.\n\nThe background features an expanse of blue sky dotted with a few clouds and a treeline that suggests the boundaries of farmed fields or managed land. Overall, the composition of the photograph provides a juxtaposition between agricultural life and industrial activity within a rural community.","title":"No takers for farm adjoining the smoking, smelly Lawrence Co-op (in left rear)","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552091","555609","553831","543012","557946","552448","555542","543668","558054","555635","547304","547404","544481","551333","547658","553933"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["fence","midground","estate","contact","treeline","bell","price","field","company","plant"]}
