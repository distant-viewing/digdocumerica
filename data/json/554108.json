{"path":"554108.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural or agricultural setting where several people are engaged in farming activities. The image shows four individuals working in a field that appears rocky and uneven, likely prepared for planting.\n\nThe person on the far left is bending over, planting something in the ground. This individual is wearing a white long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, boots, and a wide-brimmed straw hat, which suggests protection from the sun.\n\nNext to this individual, there is a tractor with another person seated under an umbrella, contributing to the work by either operating the tractor or overseeing the activity. This indicates that the task might involve some mechanization.\n\nTo the right, two more individuals are actively using tools to work the soil. One, wearing a long-sleeve white shirt and dark pants, is handling a tool, possibly a shovel, to dig or move the soil. The other person, in a red-checkered shirt and dark pants, is also using a similar tool for the soil.\n\nThe background of the photo shows a cloudy sky with patches of blue, suggesting variability in weather conditions, which might affect the dayâ€™s work. The overall impression is that of a labor-intensive agricultural activity involving teamwork and modest mechanization. This scene likely captures a moment of concerted effort in either preparing the soil or planting a crop, essential for farming.","title":"10,000 acres of the island of Hawaii is devoted to growing macadamia nuts, and production is increasing.
