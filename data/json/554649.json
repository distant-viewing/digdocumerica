{"path":"554649.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque autumnal scene, focusing on a vast forest area as it blankets both sides of a calm, reflective lake. The trees are in full display of fall colors, with hues of deep red, bright orange, golden yellow, and some remaining greens. This dense canopy of colorful foliage spans across the majority of the image, hinting at a variety of tree species, possibly including maples, oaks, and evergreens.\n\nThe lake itself acts as a central feature in the photograph, mirroring the vibrant colors of the trees along its smooth, undisturbed surface, suggesting a quiet, windless day. There are visible meanders along the edges where the forest meets the water's edge, enhancing the natural beauty of the landscape.\n\nIn the distance, the landscape rises in elevation, forming a gentle hill or mountain that extends the forest far beyond the lakeâ€™s opposite shore, continuing the spread of autumn colors. The overall composition of the shot is balanced with the water centrally placed, giving a sense of depth and the grand scale of the natural setting.\n\nThere are no signs of human activity or development directly visible in this remote tranquility, allowing the viewer to focus entirely on the natural elements. The photograph appears to be taken from a high vantage point, perhaps from a hill or another part of the terrain not visible in the frame, giving an encompassing view over the forest and reflecting lake.","title":"Hardwood trees show their fall color at seventh lake, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554758","554648","554751","554757","554711","554749","554737","554750","554712","554714","554761","554738","554715","554713","554635","552599"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","forest","oak","evergreen","encompass","majority","hill","specie","act","elevation"]}
