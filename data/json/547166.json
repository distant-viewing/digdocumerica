{"path":"547166.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The image displays a chilly, winter scene focusing on icicles formed on thin, delicate branches of a tree. These icicles are detailed, hanging downwards in a dense cluster, covering the branches completely and reflecting some light that makes them glisten. Below the hanging icicles, there is a pile of jagged rocks, also partly covered in ice, reflecting light and adding a rugged texture to the scene. The background is dark and blurry, making the ice-covered elements in the forefront more pronounced. The overall atmosphere is wintry and the lighting suggests that it is either dawn or dusk, adding a touch of gloominess to the scene.","title":"Ice-encrusted plants inside the seawall of Michigan City","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["557607","557200","543656","543098","547145","557199","543770","543167","543766","543619","547153","557197","543755","555071","557180","543607"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["ice","branch","winter","forefront","dawn","dusk","pile","cluster","touch","light"]}
