{"path":"555798.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph features a maritime scene with a tugboat in the foreground, navigating on what appears to be a river. The tugboat, which has a white hull and a green upper structure, creates a white wake as it moves through the water, indicating motion.\n\nIn the background, an urban skyline stretches across the entire photograph, densely packed with a variety of buildings. The architecture includes older, ornate high-rise buildings near the left side and more modern, boxy apartment complexes towards the right. Some of the modern buildings are quite tall, layered close together, showing patterns of numerous small windows and balconies.\n\nThe atmosphere of the scene suggests late afternoon or early evening light, with vibrant colors and some shadows casting over the buildings, giving a warm but urban feel to the overall environment. The water has a dark blue tone, contrasting against the lively city facade and the functional, sturdy appearance of the tugboat in the river.","title":"\"Owl's Head,\" one of four vessels owned by the city of New York which carry sludge into the bight for dumping. The ships work around the clock collecting sludge at metropolitan sewage treatment plants and take it offshore for dumping. The sludge is mixed with water so it will flow through the pipes. The round trip to the sludge dumping site takes approximately six hours.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550901","548067","546938","549783","547061","550043","550893","550894","549892","550900","550913","550892","549313","555800","546845","557309"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Waterfront Development"],"terms":["tugboat","building","wake","apartment","balcony","river","hull","complex","rise","skyline"]}
