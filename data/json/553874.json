{"path":"553874.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a spider positioned in the center of its web. This spider has striking features, with a colorful abdomen showing yellow, black, and white patterns, and long, banded legs that are predominantly black with regular white markings. The spider's orientation in the web shows it facing downward, with its legs symmetrically spread out in alignment with the web's radial structure.\n\nThe web itself is intricately designed, featuring a noticeable zigzag pattern of silk known as stabilimenta, which is more opaque and forms a bold line directly above the spider. This structure in the web is not only decorative but is also thought to provide stability and visibility to the web, potentially warding off larger animals.\n\nThe background is softly blurred with green and blue hues, suggesting that this scene is set outdoors, possibly in a garden or a forested area. The shallow depth of field focuses sharply on the spider and portions of the web while gently blurring the surrounding environment to emphasize the subject. Overall, the image is well-composed, highlighting the delicate and methodical aspects of the spider's web construction against a serene natural background.","title":"Spider.
