{"path":"551865.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image captures a dynamic street scene dominated by a vivid orange street cleaning vehicle in motion. The vehicle, possibly from the mid to late 20th century, has a compact and utilitarian design, typical of municipal service vehicles of the time. Its prominent feature is the large storage unit mounted on the back, likely housing machinery and supplies related to its cleaning functions. On the side facing the camera, a coat of arms or logo is visible, suggesting it is a government-operated vehicle.\n\nThe scene is set in an urban environment. The blurred background suggests a wet, possibly rain-slicked city street lined with buildings, which have a typical mid-century architectural style. The lighting conditions and wet surfaces indicate this may be an early morning scenario, which is common for street-cleaning activities to minimize disruption in busy areas.\n\nThe photograph itself has a candid, action-oriented quality with a focus on the moving vehicle, employing a slower shutter speed that blurs the background and enhances the sense of motion. This effectively conveys the routine yet vital task of street maintenance within the city.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. On this rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire Fussgangerzone is thoroughly cleaned. This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["549771","549832","549830","551936","551869","549837","550147","554309","553040","550150","550162","549765","546743","549898","549759","549831"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["cleaning","street","vehicle","motion","government","century","disruption","city","supply","routine"]}
