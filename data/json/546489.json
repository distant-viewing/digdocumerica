{"path":"546489.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph depicts a modern architectural building with a noticeable facade of dark bricks and a high, broad glass window with a reflective surface. The main focus is on two individuals, both female, who are entering or near the entrance of the building. One of the females, wearing a pink top, is facing towards the door, possibly in the middle of an action like entering or leaving, while the other, in an orange top, seems to be following her companion.\n\nThe building has a large, arched doorway bordered by a simpler, straight frame, and the glass reflects some of the trees and sky outside, indicating a bright, clear day. There are multiple layers of steps leading up to this entrance, adding a formal, grandiose quality to the approach. The overall scene is quiet and ordinary, capturing a moment of everyday life with a background that gives a sense of open, public space, possibly an educational or corporate facility given the building's design and materials.","title":"Cleo rogers memorial library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546493","546506","546526","546462","546515","548240","546532","546531","548462","556276","546518","558402","546464","546461","557281","546456"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["female","enter","entrance","companion","glass","building","approach","doorway","top","follow"]}
