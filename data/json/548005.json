{"path":"548005.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a river port. The port is located along a wide river with dense tree-covered hills on either side, suggesting a rural or semi-urban setting. There are several docks extending into the river, with two large ships moored at one of them. Close to another dock, a smaller boat is also visible in the water.\n\nAdjacent to the water, there's a large parking area that seems to be primarily used for the storage of vehicles, as indicated by neatly organized rows of colorful cars. This suggests that the port might be used for importing or exporting vehicles.\n\nNear the parking area, thereâ€™s an industrial area with multiple low-rise buildings, including some with white spherical tanks, possibly for storing liquid or gas. The built environment is interspersed with open ground and some storage or processing facilities with wooden logs visible alongside the riverbank.\n\nThe surrounding area beyond the immediate industrial and port facilities features roads, smaller buildings likely residential, and some areas of patchy vegetation and undeveloped land. Overall, the scene captures a blend of industrial activity at a river port, integrated into a broader rural landscape with residential and natural elements.","title":"Shipping terminal area on the willamette river","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["552200","547998","551609","547214","555764","546828","552244","551577","552195","555760","549495","548320","551203","547994","550886","550890"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["port","river","parking","dock","storage","built","storing","facility","integrate","liquid"]}
