{"path":"551925.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a work scene by a body of water, likely a river or lake, with a somber and industrial atmosphere. In the foreground, a man with his back to the camera is standing on a concrete pathway next to a rocky shoreline. He is dressed in dark clothing, including a long coat and a hard hat, indicating he might be a worker or supervisor associated with the activity occurring in the image.\n\nDominating the composition is a large mechanical grapple suspended from unseen machinery above. The grapple is open and secures a large mass of what appears to be waste or scrap materials, possibly cleaning up or managing natural debris or pollution.\n\nThe background shows a calming, though overcast, scene of the water body which stretches to the horizon, lined by distant shores that have sparse vegetation and some residential or small structures. The overall mood is slightly gloomy due to overcast skies and the industrial activity depicted, contrasting with the natural elements of the landscape.","title":"Constructing a seawall in Lake Michigan.
