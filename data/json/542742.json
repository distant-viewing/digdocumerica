{"path":"542742.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures the dynamic movement of turbulent water, likely from a river or rapid. The water is shown in various shades of blue and white, indicating the presence of froth and bubbles, a sign of the water's swift movement. The image's focus is almost entirely on the churning water, providing a sense of motion and force.\n\nThe rapid water creates a pattern of swirling textures and a chaotic mixture of darker and lighter patches, representing the varying depths and speed of the flow. The sunlight casts a gentle glow on the water, highlighting the whiteness of the foam and giving the water a shimmering appearance.\n\nThere are no visible objects or living creatures in the water, nor are there indications of human presence or activity. The frame is devoid of any background or foreground elements that could provide context, such as riverbanks or sky, focusing exclusively on the water itself. This creates an immersive view that captures the essence of moving water, conveying both its beauty and its power.","title":"Sequoia and kings canyon national parks","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["544854","550651","553416","553388","544856","543563","544862","552061","544867","542743","550742","549442","545882","544871","553855","557252"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["water","churning","swift","froth","bubble","swirling","rapid","creature","indication","movement"]}
