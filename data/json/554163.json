{"path":"554163.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a landscape that appears to be a mining or extraction site. The photograph captures a variety of hues and textures that indicate different types of land use and disturbances.\n\nKey elements in the image include:\n\n1. **Red-Pink Areas**: These areas are vividly colored in pink and red tones and are irregularly shaped. They are likely exposed earth or tailings from mining activities, which contrast starkly with the natural landscape.\n\n2. **Curving Dirt Roads**: A network of curving, dark dirt roads snake through the photograph, connecting different parts of the site. Some of these roads encircle the reddish areas, while others connect more distant parts of the landscape.\n\n3. **Sparse Vegetation**: The vegetation is sparse and scrubby, indicating a dry or semi-arid environment. The natural ground appears rocky and uneven, typical of undeveloped terrains in such climates.\n\n4. **Isolated Structures**: Scattered throughout the image are small, isolated structures which could be equipment used for mining operations or temporary shelters/storage for workers.\n\n5. **Background**: The background shows a flat horizon that suggests a wide, open landscape, possibly near a coastal area given the hint of a distant water body under a cloudy sky.\n\nThe overall composition and the man-made alterations suggest significant industrial activity, likely related to resource extraction, which has visibly impacted the natural environment in this area. The color and pattern distinctions provide a visual cue about the extensive nature of these operations.","title":"Most recent and most controversial land speculation in Hawaii centers on this area near Kamuela. Land Use Commission staff recommended total denial of developers' petition for rezoning. The commission, however, permitted 3,414 acres of the 5,000 requested to pass over to urban use. Since then, 900 lots have been sold but little building has been done, leaving an empty subdivision to be protected by county services.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["553051","542513","543669","556467","554768","551611","549174","554804","555812","550568","544418","555859","543857","552004","543758","555610"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["mining","extraction","site","alteration","snake","operation","shelter","disturbance","resource","landscape"]}
