{"path":"545548.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man standing beside a car in a suburban setting. The man, who appears to be in his sixties or seventies, has short grey hair and is wearing glasses along with a dark short-sleeved shirt. He is looking directly at the camera with a serious expression and has one hand resting on the roof of a light-colored car, notably showing an arc-streak of dirt or a similar substance that has been smeared by his hand.\n\nThe car has a classic design possibly from the 1970s or 1980s, judging by its boxy shape and chrome details. It is parked on a driveway next to a residential road. The setting includes other suburban elements like a quiet street, well-maintained lawns, and a few other parked cars in the background. Further in the background, there appears to be billowing smoke, suggesting a distant fire or industrial activity, adding an unusual contrast to the otherwise serene suburban landscape.\n\nThe overall mood of the scene is a mix of calm suburban life with an underlying note of concern or curiosity, possibly related to the distant smoke. The photograph has an aged quality, indicated by its color saturation and composition, reminiscent of snapshot photography common in the mid to late 20th century.","title":"A resident of Fairfield which borders on U.S. Steel's plant shows the black soot wiped from his car.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["553036","557878","550152","552780","545391","555475","557840","557370","551021","557841","553488","557144","551108","557900","554025","551119"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["car","arc","smoke","driveway","streak","note","chrome","substance","saturation","photography"]}
