{"path":"551263.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph displays a rustic and serene outdoor setting featuring a person standing beside a building with distinct architectural elements. The building, likely a residence, has walls constructed from rough-hewn stone, contributing an earthy and robust character to the scene. An imposing stone tower part anchors one side of the building, soaring skyward past the roofline. It is partially veiled by the lush greenery of mature trees, which also partially cover the house, adding a sense of tranquility and natural integration.\n\nThe person in the photograph, poised on stepping down from a low stone platform, is dressed casually in a white short-sleeve top and matching shorts, appropriate for a warm day. Their relaxed pose and light-colored clothing contrast nicely with the darker, textured backdrop provided by the building and its wooden, shutter-style window coverings.\n\nThe foreground of the image includes a path made from large, flat stones that guides visitors toward the building. The landscaping is well-maintained, with small shrubs and plants bordering the pathway and filling the garden beds around the base of the tower. This setup suggests a well-cared-for environment that is both welcoming and private.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, from the historic architectural style of the building to the verdant, tree-filled environment and the casual stance of the individual, all contribute to a sense of calm and retreat from busier, urban settings.","title":"Mrs.  Charles welek, wife of a prominent realtor, leaves her house (valued at over $400,000) in blackhawk estates, perhaps the most exclusive development on the lake of the ozarks","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["544448","549360","551104","556628","545041","556182","546463","557669","558153","558109","543580","557750","557952","549195","544911","542967"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["stone","tower","building","soar","veil","roofline","verdant","bordere","poise","residence"]}
