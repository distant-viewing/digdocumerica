{"path":"557517.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of expansive agricultural fields, neatly divided into large geometric sections of varying shades of green, brown, and tan. This patchwork of fields stretches out towards the horizon where it meets rolling hills and mountains. The rugged terrain of these hills provides a stark contrast to the orderly, flat farmland in the foreground. The colors in the image suggest it might be either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft, diffused light that casts gentle shadows across the landscape.\n\nSeveral buildings, likely farmhouses or agricultural facilities, are sparsely scattered among the fields. Roads intersect the landscape, creating straight lines that further emphasize the geometric division of the land. The overall impression is one of human-modified nature, illustrating the scale and organization of modern agriculture. No people are visible in the image, emphasizing the vastness and the focus on the landscape itself.","title":"Aerial view of oxnard plain, a prime agricultural area in ventura county, California, north of Los Angeles, now being developed for housing.  Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressures.  Restrictions on coastal development within 1,000 yards of the shoreline were tightened with the passage of the coastal zone conservation act in november, 1972","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["549094","548907","542708","542517","554029","549253","553977","558414","548908","553047","552858","547684","553972","553973","554055","547350"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["farmhouse","division","fields","patchwork","farmland","organization","mountains","hill","tan","field"]}
