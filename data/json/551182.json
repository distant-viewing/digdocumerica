{"path":"551182.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a busy urban industrial landscape along a river. In the foreground, there is a section with a cluster of residential homes surrounded by greenery. Adjacent to this, there are vast open areas that look like they are under development or used for industrial purposes.\n\nThe river flows prominently through the center of the image, winding its way horizontally. Along its banks, numerous industrial facilities can be seen, including factories and warehouses. There are also several large storage tanks in varying colors (red, blue, grey, and white) prominently situated near the riverbank, likely for storing oil or chemicals.\n\nA number of bridges cross the river, facilitating road transportation across the urban and industrial areas. Extensive road networks are visible, with multiple road lanes and train tracks paralleling the river and connecting different sections of the area.\n\nIn the farther background, the landscape rises into wooded hills, suggesting the surrounding areas might be more residential or less developed. The image has an overall bluish and slightly dark tone, possibly due to the time of day or the type of film used in the camera. This historical photo captures a mix of residential, industrial, and transportation infrastructure in what appears to be a bustling urban environment.","title":"Aerial view of blaine's island on the kanawha river, showing construction of interstate 64 through south Charleston","placename":"Charleston (W.
