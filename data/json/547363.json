{"path":"547363.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lively indoor scene centered around music and social interaction. In the foreground, a man is playing a piano. The focus on his hands shows them in motion, suggesting he is actively engaged in playing. The piano, a traditional upright model, appears well-used, adding a sense of warmth and familiarity to the image.\n\nBehind the pianist, the room is filled with people seated at long tables arranged parallel to each other. These people seem to be enjoying a communal meal or a gathering; they are dressed in casual to semi-formal wear, indicating a social or possibly semi-formal event. The room is well-lit by overhead lights, casting a warm glow over the attendees, and contributing to the ambient, convivial atmosphere.\n\nThe walls are simple and unadorned, directing the viewer's focus to the activities taking place. The overall composition of the photograph, with its perspective leading from the pianist in the forefront to the gathered people in the background, creates a narrative connecting the music being played to the communal experience in the room.","title":"At the weekly meeting of the Seward Kiwanis Club","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["551319","547390","551479","551320","545868","548563","556032","558263","547371","552625","556474","546025","547387","547401","556308","553286"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["room","music","familiarity","people","meal","attendee","warmth","experience","forefront","narrative"]}
