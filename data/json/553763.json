{"path":"553763.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph appears to capture the interior of a bookstore or a library with a unique architectural and design element focused on showcasing books or magazines. The dominant feature of the image is a large, wooden wall rack filled with numerous books or pamphlets arranged in discrete vertical compartments. Each compartment houses different titles displayed prominently so that the front covers are visible, suggesting a clear intention to attract readers or buyers.\n\nThe color palette of the stored items ranges widely, featuring bright yellows, reds, blues, and many more, creating a vibrant and inviting atmosphere. There are also texts visible on some of the book spines and covers, though specific titles are not legible from this distance.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there is a wooden counter with a similar finish to the bookshelf. Behind this counter, partially obscured by a blurry foreground element that resembles a plant leaf, is a person, likely a woman, seated and seemingly engaged in a task which might be related to managing or selling the books. Next to her is a vertical display or sign with text and images on it, possibly providing information or advertisements related to the items on display or events.\n\nThe space seems to be illuminated by downlights fixed into a flat, light-colored ceiling, creating a warm, welcoming glow that highlights the books and the wooden tones of the furniture.\n\nOverall, the photograph presents a calm, organized environment likely designed to appeal to readers and knowledge seekers.","title":"Once the tourists have arrived (some 3,000,000 are expected in 1974), the Hawaii Visitors Bureau is ready with suggestions on where to go and what to do.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["546549","549361","549337","548219","546553","546560","555316","555310","546511","546500","554380","555289","546564","552592","556016","555315"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["book","title","compartment","counter","cover","display","library","text","bookshelf","pamphlet"]}
