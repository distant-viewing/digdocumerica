{"path":"550796.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic and weathered Volkswagen Beetle, primarily observed from its rear left view, situated amid tall, overgrown grass that suggests neglect or abandonment. The car's paint is a faded red with areas exhibiting rust and decay, emphasizing its age and the lengthy period it has likely been stationary. \n\nProminently displayed is the vehicle's rear license plate, which shows a registration from Wisconsin, marked \"AUG 63,\" indicating the photograph might have been taken in the early 1960s or that the car has been unattended since that date. The design of the Beetle, featuring its classic rounded shape and distinctive split rear window, is a notable element of the composition.\n\nSurrounding the car is lush vegetation, densely packed with various grasses and potentially weeds, reaching up to the height of the vehicle's windows. The background shows a thick green treeline, implying the car is located in a wooded or forested area, secluded from regular traffic or human activity. This setting enhances the feeling of isolation and the passage of time. The overall lighting and saturation of the image suggest a sunny day, casting natural light that highlights the rusty textures of the Beetle and the vibrant greens of the grass and trees.","title":"Abandoned Chevy with 1960 license plate on a back road that follows the Wisconsin River","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553008","550797","545540","554920","546405","553002","552995","550795","546230","549107","548750","553010","547747","553007","542817","550683"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","grass","registration","treeline","weed","license","saturation","plate","date","passage"]}
