{"path":"550018.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a scene that contrasts an urban skyline with foreground elements that suggest a more suburban or park-like setting. Here’s a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Foreground:** The immediate foreground includes an expansive, grassy area which appears well-maintained yet deserted. There is a prominent building towards the bottom left, likely a small, single-story structure, possibly a park facility or utility building with a sloped roof and a brick exterior. Adjacent to this is a playground, equipped with various play structures including swings and slides, indicative of a family-friendly park environment. A network of roads and pathways can be seen weaving through the area, lined with sparse traffic and a few parked cars, enhancing the sense of quietness in the area.\n\n2. **Midground:** Just beyond the immediate recreational area, there are hints of a residential or less densely populated urban area, possibly a suburb. The houses and buildings shown have a homogenous architectural style, typical of residential city outskirts. An elevated pedestrian bridge painted green stretches across the middle of the frame, suggesting connectivity between different parts of the park or community areas.\n\n3. **Background:** Dominating the backdrop is a striking city skyline, characterized by a variety of high-rise buildings. These structures vary in design, from modern glass-faced towers to older, more traditional buildings with visible spires and detailed facades. This mix of architectural styles conveys the historical and economic growth of the city. Notably, there’s a clear sky above the city, and some smoke or steam can be seen emanating from a few points among the buildings, adding a dynamic element to the urban environment.\n\n4. **Composition and Atmosphere:** The composition of the photograph uses a layered approach, with the foreground inviting calm and leisure, the middle ground providing a residential buffer, and the background suggesting bustling urban activity. The overall atmosphere could be described as serene yet poignant, capturing a tableau of city life that balances urban development with recreational and residential spaces. The color palette features muted earth tones in the foreground, contrasting with the cooler hues of the cityscape, suggesting the time of capture could be either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft lighting and long shadows.","title":"Smog over Boston - looking north from Columbia point traffic circle","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["557271","552268","549543","548334","543714","553295","548384","549283","543957","553557","549958","550157","545429","550190","556951","546624"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","park","building","skyline","breakdown","buffer","sloped","suburb","describe","quietness"]}
