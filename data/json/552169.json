{"path":"552169.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a landscape displaying significant environmental or industrial damage. At the center of the image, there is a large, dark body of water, likely a lake or a pit, with steep, excavated banks encircling it. The surrounding terrain is heavily cluttered with rubble and what appears to be discarded materialsâ€”some of which include white bags, wooden debris, and various other industrial or construction-related refuse.\n\nThe area is predominantly devoid of vegetation, suggesting recent or ongoing heavy industrial activity. There is a faint road or path that cuts across the image from one side to the other, with a solitary vehicle and a rectangular structure resembling a shed or a trailer placed beside the road.\n\nIn the foreground, just adjacent to the body of water, there appears to be a collapsed structure or overhang, possibly a conveyor belt or part of the loading mechanism for materials, now partially submerged or destroyed.\n\nThe borders of the environment suggest a dense green foliage indicative of a forested area, contrasting starkly with the disturbed site. The overall composition strongly highlights the impact of industrial or construction activities on the landscape, indicative of mining or heavy material processing, involving significant alteration and likely pollution of the site and possibly the water.","title":"Solid waste dumped as fill in former log storage pond at crown zellerbach kraft pulp mill","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555846","555859","551611","552427","554546","555847","551585","548641","543815","547485","544498","550572","551612","551556","544062","543709"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["material","destroy","excavate","site","collapse","encircle","construction","alteration","pit","loading"]}
