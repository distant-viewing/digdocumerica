{"path":"547940.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and somewhat moody scene centered around a railway track and towering electrical transmission towers. The perspective is taken from ground level, slightly off the centerline of the railway track, which leads into the distance and draws the eye towards the horizon. The railway itself features single rail lines flanked by wooden ties, and there is a visible railroad crossing sign, consisting of a crossbuck (X-shaped sign) adorned with circular signals, on the right side of the track.\n\nAbove the track, dominating the scene, are large, imposing electrical transmission towers constructed of metal frameworks. These towers carry multiple lines of heavy electrical cables, which are arranged in descending tiers from the top of the towers. The intricacy of the metalwork in the towers creates a mesh-like pattern against the sky. The photo captures several of these towers receding into the distance, creating a deep sense of vanishing perspective enhanced by the linear design of both the towers and the railway.\n\nThe lighting suggests either early morning or late evening, with a subdued, almost silhouette effect on the towers and the foreground. The sky is overcast, adding to the somber and industrial feel of the scene. There are no human figures or moving trains visible, leading to a sense of stillness and abandonment. The background is minimal, primarily the flat horizon that could indicate a rural or undeveloped area, with sparse or no visible vegetation. The general atmosphere is a blend of technological might and isolated bleakness.","title":"Transmission lines of electrical power station built on marshlands of Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543007","544706","547944","544355","553028","549110","543728","556854","553830","544681","556841","555574","556783","556873","546389","550867"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["towers","railway","track","transmission","metalwork","might","vanishing","intricacy","tier","crossing"]}
