{"path":"544771.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This is a photograph featuring a large, military-style helicopter in mid-flight against a clear blue sky. The helicopter, appearing to be a Chinook with its distinctive twin rotors, is captured in a position where it is slightly tilted, emphasizing the motion and the function of its rotors which are blurred, indicating their rapid movement.\n\nAttached to the helicopter is a long, narrow object—seemingly a log or a lengthy piece of timber—suspended vertically by cables or ropes. This suggests that the helicopter is in the process of transporting this object, a task commonly associated with heavy-lift helicopters in logistics or construction operations.\n\nIn the background, there is a stark and arid landscape, characterized by a large, red rock formation that rises prominently. The rock's surface is rugged, textured, and predominantly reddish-brown, typical of desert mountain regions possibly in the southwestern United States.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is dynamic, with the helicopter and suspended log positioned towards the upper frame, creating a sense of depth and scale when contrasted with the expansive rock face in the background. The vibrant colors and sharp focus draw attention to both the helicopter and the geological features, telling a story of human activity within a natural environment.","title":"Dropping material at site of small mining operation.","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["544741","545642","544737","545637","545638","544766","552372","555835","547533","544754","552365","552393","548815","545645","552373","544491"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","rotor","suspend","rock","log","tell","logistic","object","timber","tilt"]}
