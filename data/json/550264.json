{"path":"550264.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban decay, featuring a cluttered and litter-strewn vacant lot. The foreground is dominated by assorted debris which includes tires, scattered papers, cardboard boxes, and some partially broken wood planks. Among the visible trash are a few commercial boxes with recognizable branding, contributing to the sense of neglect and disorganization.\n\nIn the middle ground of the image, two vehicles contribute to the derelict atmosphere: an old-style pickup truck with visible rust and a partially dismantled state, and a sedan that also appears in poor condition. There’s a makeshift shelter constructed with tarpaulin, indicating temporary human activity, possibly by homeless individuals or scavengers.\n\nThe background features a brick wall with a partly visible sign that says “INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS CO.”, suggesting the area might be near or part of an industrial zone. There are a few individuals visible: one near the shelter, who seems to be standing and facing away from the camera, and others who are more obscured and indistinct, possibly engaged in conversation or other activities.\n\nThis image overall conveys a strong sense of urban blight and socio-economic neglect, hinting at the broader challenges faced by certain urban areas.","title":"The vacant lot next to 2303 East 63rd Street has become an unsightly dumping ground.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["549786","549785","552750","556640","547775","550253","547470","552102","557345","549307","545295","555521","554536","550246","547587","546854"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["shelter","box","dismantle","neglect","branding","overall","say","pickup","cardboard","face"]}
