{"path":"552293.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque sunset scene over a large body of water, possibly a lake or an inlet. The image is bathed in warm, muted orange and pink hues, reflecting the setting sun's light. In the foreground, the waters are calm with subtle ripples and shine under the golden light, enhancing the tranquil ambiance of the scene.\n\nScattered across the water are numerous sailboats, each with sails that are either fully or partially unfurled. These boats are spread out across the composition in a somewhat scattered pattern, yet their presence adds a dynamic and engaging aspect to the otherwise peaceful waterscape.\n\nIn the background, the silhouette of a hilly or mountainous landscape can be seen lining the horizon. This adds depth to the composition and contrasts subtly with the brightness of the water and sky. The sky itself blends into the water, without a clear demarcation at the horizon, due to the similar color tones of the sunset reflected in the water.\n\nThe overall composition offers a sense of calm and leisure, capturing a leisurely sailing activity during a quiet, beautiful sunset, making it an image that evokes warmth and tranquility.","title":"Sailboat race on Commencement Bay, near Point Defiance","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552038","543613","552039","543143","548117","550303","548118","553990","543119","551215","552344","550299","550039","550296","544669","543411"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["sunset","water","waterscape","demarcation","inlet","warmth","sailing","sail","sailboat","brightness"]}
