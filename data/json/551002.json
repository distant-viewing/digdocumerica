{"path":"551002.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a residential area that appears to be economically distressed. In the foreground, a dark-colored car (possibly a Mustang) is parked next to a line of large trash bins. Behind this, two women and a young girl are visible, standing on what looks like a dilapidated wooden porch of a multi-unit, weathered wooden house. The porch shows signs of wear and lacks maintenance, with peeled paint and unstable wooden structures.\n\nOne woman, standing on the right, leans against the door frame, wearing a sleeveless top and patterned shorts. Directly to her left, a young girl stands in the doorway, partially obscured by a white door. Further left, another woman is engaged in either hanging out or taking down laundry from a clothesline that is strung up across the porch. She wears a casual, light-colored dress.\n\nThe house itself is in a worn state with peeling paint and exposed wood. Several items, including more laundry and a pair of shoes, are scattered around the porch, hanging on railings or placed on the steps, adding to the lived-in and somewhat cluttered feel of the space. The environment suggests a tight-knit community setting, possibly in a rural or underdeveloped urban area. The overall atmosphere is one of everyday life and activity amidst modest surroundings.","title":"Rand, wv., with much of its population living in poverty, has many unpaved roads, substandard houses, and junked autoMobiles","placename":"Charleston (W.
