{"path":"553304.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures a lively evening scene, presumably at an outdoor event, where a group of individuals is engaged in social interaction. The lighting is dim with a purple hue dominating the image, suggesting the photograph was taken during the night. In the background, soft glows of light perhaps from lamps or other light sources create a bokeh effect, adding an element of festive or public ambiance.\n\nThe people in the photo are dressed in a variety of styles, indicating a casual and possibly festive gathering. Some individuals are wearing hats, including wide-brimmed and Fedora-style hats. The expressions and postures suggest engagement and enjoyment, as some are smiling, clapping, or engaged in conversation. The focus is soft, giving the image a blurry, dreamy quality that enhances the sense of motion and spontaneity in the scene. There appears to be an interaction happening between two people in the center where one appears to be reaching out to another, adding dynamic movement to the composition. The overall mood of the photograph is cheerful and convivial.","title":"D'aug Days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, Fountain Square.
