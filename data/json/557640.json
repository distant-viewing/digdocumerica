{"path":"557640.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This image captures an old, weathered wooden house enveloped in a somewhat eerie atmosphere, accentuated by a blue monochromatic filter. The house features traditional architectural elements with a gabled roof and a modest front porch that includes a set of wooden stairs leading up to a doorway, which is notably missing its door. The facade is composed of faded horizontal siding that shows signs of wear and neglect, such as peeling paint and visible damage.\n\nOn the porch, one can see a bit of random clutter including what appears to be a cage or a wire fencing leaning against the wall. A couple of unidentifiable objects rest on the porch surface near the door.\n\nFlanking the house are two mature trees, their branches heavily laden with foliage, which frames the house and adds to the secluded and mysterious quality of the scene. Beneath one of the trees, another collection of objects—including what looks like a bench or another piece of wooden furniture—suggests a once-used outdoor living area, now left to decay along with the house.\n\nThe windows of the house, partially obscured by the trees, curtains, and the angle of view, add an element of mystery, as they offer no clear insight into the interior conditions of the home.\n\nThis image captures a blend of natural deterioration and the quiet resilience of an aged structure, presenting a poignant reminder of past habitation now abandoned, evocative of themes related to memory, decay, and the passage of time.","title":"House in the fifth ward of Houston, Texas.  This is one of a series of 21 black and white photographs.  They document the environments remaining from the 19th century in terms of architecture, commerce and lifestyles.  The pictures also compare the contemporary city showing displacement of the unique by the ordinary and noting current urban problems.  The pictures show a region and its uniqueness in people and architecture in east Texas which is still a part of the south","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["552491","546989","552494","557633","554822","555632","554788","552455","554799","557646","549195","550113","554787","558110","554823","552488"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","porch","decay","random","themes","cage","insight","miss","door","memory"]}
