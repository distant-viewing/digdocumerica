{"path":"544704.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic scene featuring a large, dark cloud of smoke rising into the air, against a backdrop likely of a sunset or a similarly dusky sky, tinged with hues of orange and yellow. The smoke emanates from a structure which has the appearance of an industrial facility, such as a refinery or factory. The structure is visible but obscured partly by the dense smoke and includes cylindrical and cuboid elements, indicating heavy machinery or storage tanks. The top of the image shows the smoke billowing widely, suggesting a strong, possibly hazardous, emission.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, silhouetted plant life is discernible, indicating that the viewpoint is perhaps from a distance and might be outside the boundaries of the industrial area. This juxtaposition hints at environmental impact or the intrusion of industrial activities into natural or less developed areas. The overall composition uses the contrasting elements of the dark, heavy smoke against the lighter sky and the industrial versus natural elements to create a striking visual narrative that may invoke discussions around industry, nature, and pollution.","title":"Setting sun amid smoke cloud","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["545990","547137","545975","545994","551054","548157","546237","547204","544700","544173","550987","550983","550905","545446","555166","544688"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["smoke","refinery","intrusion","discussion","emission","viewpoint","boundary","narrative","element","orange"]}
