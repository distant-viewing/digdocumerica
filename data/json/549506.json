{"path":"549506.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large industrial complex, likely a manufacturing or assembly plant, surrounded by ample parking lots filled with numerous cars, indicating a significant workforce. The facility is characterized by long, extensive buildings with flat roofs, and several tall smokestacks emitting smoke, suggesting heavy industrial activity.\n\nTo the left of the complex, a freeway with sparse traffic can be seen, possibly indicating the photograph was taken on a non-peak hour or a less busy day. Adjacent to the freeway is a water body, possibly a river, paralleling the road. The neighborhood around the complex is a mix of residential areas with dense vegetation and other smaller industrial structures.\n\nThe overall composition gives a sense of scale and the significant impact of the industrial operations on the area, with its huge layout dominating the landscape. Despite the focus on industry, green spaces can be spotted within the complex, possibly for aesthetic or environmental considerations. The backdrop shows a distant horizon, hinting at a suburban setting with open skies and scattered cloud cover which brightens the scene, indicating it might be midday or early afternoon when the photo was taken.","title":"General motors chevrolet plant on the niagara river","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["549727","553892","549726","555779","547126","548433","555761","549968","550339","549494","551566","549526","556925","545889","555769","545841"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["complex","freeway","consideration","brighten","assembly","parallel","midday","hour","manufacturing","layout"]}
