{"path":"548669.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a leisurely day at a beachfront campsite. In the foreground, there’s a camp setup including a red camper trailer, which is parked next to a picnic table adorned with various items suggesting meal preparation, such as a portable stove. A classic, possibly 1970s era, car is parked adjacent to the camper.\n\nIn front of this setup is a gravel pathway, leading towards the beach and sea. The view includes lush tropical greenery—palm trees and other tropical foliage swaying gently, suggesting a mild breeze. The background shows a tranquil beachfront with calm turquoise water. Adding to the serene vacation vibe, there are more camping elements visible, such as a booth-like structure with a thatched roof, possibly for shade or another leisure use.\n\nOn the right side of the scene, a man in swimwear is walking, presumably engaged in activities around the campsite or heading towards the beach, emphasizing the recreational nature of the environment. The overall atmosphere is relaxed and denotes a typical beach camping scene with an inviting setup for enjoying the natural surroundings.","title":"Campsite at Ohio, or \"sunshine\" key.
