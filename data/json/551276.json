{"path":"551276.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an outdoor gathering, likely suggesting a communal meal or barbecue event. It is set on an elevated wooden deck shaded by surrounding trees with lush green foliage visible in the background, suggesting a serene, private setting, possibly in someone's backyard.\n\nThe foreground is partially obscured by what appears to be the back and arm of a person sitting at the table, affording the viewer a feeling of being part of the group. The table itself is covered with a white tablecloth featuring a vivid red floral pattern, and it's laden with a variety of dishes.\n\nTwo men are visible in the frame, engaging with the food. The man on the right is older with white and grey hair; he is dressed in a patterned short-sleeve shirt and dark trousers, actively serving himself. The man on the left appears younger, with dark hair and wearing a light blue t-shirt. He is assisting or waiting to serve himself. Their attention is focused on the plates, indicating a moment of casual interaction.\n\nOn the table, there are several dishes that reflect traditional American or Western-style outdoor food. Thereâ€™s a bowl of what looks like tomato salad, and another of potato salad. Trays with roasted or grilled meat, possibly beef, and a basket of bread rolls are visible. A couple of condiments or side dishes can also be spotted, apart from a few covered dishes and utensils.\n\nThe relaxed attire of the individuals and the nature of the meal indicate a warm, casual gathering among friends or family enjoying a summer day. The scene is typical of a friendly outdoor feast, showing spontaneity and a shared enjoyment of food.","title":"Guests serve themselves at a party given by a retired advertising executive at his lake ozark house in the \"land of the fifth season\", a high-priced residential development","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551277","544990","554861","549444","557934","557779","558188","544975","545738","557793","543631","550026","548568","556530","543987","550081"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["dish","food","table","meal","condiment","tomato","gathering","spontaneity","meat","tablecloth"]}
