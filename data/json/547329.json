{"path":"547329.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a man prominently in the foreground. He appears middle-aged and is wearing a large, short-sleeved, green and white checkered shirt. His stance is slightly sideways with his left arm bent and his hand resting on his hip, revealing a watch on his wrist. His expression seems focused or possibly contemplative as he smokes a cigar, which is held firmly in his mouth.\n\nIn the background, partially obscured, are a few more people, suggesting a social or public gathering. One can see parts of a person dressed in a white shirt and blue jeans, facing away from the camera. Thereâ€™s also a glimpse of another individual in a darker outfit. The scene takes place outdoors; indications include natural lighting and a structure that could be a building with a wooden exterior partially visible behind the man.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is candid, capturing a moment during an informal outdoor event or gathering. The setting and attire suggest a casual, possibly suburban environment during a warm season.","title":"Local man looks over the scene at a saturday auction near hickman","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547007","557708","555529","548451","547028","558321","546097","554858","554910","553122","547313","554026","556457","549054","553176","557713"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["gathering","wrist","hip","indication","stance","mouth","exterior","watch","shirt","season"]}
