{"path":"548263.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a subway train parked at an elevated outdoor platform. The image has a vintage feel, highlighted by the train's appearance and the slightly faded colors typical of older film photography.\n\nThe focus is on the subway train, prominently featuring graffiti and weathered paint that suggest urban decay or heavy use. The train's front displays unique graffiti designs in various colors, and each car side is tagged with multiple graffiti marks. The train is silver with a blue stripe running horizontally along its side, and the front end of the train has two headlights turned on, adding to its gritty, industrial look.\n\nThe station platform is narrow and appears quite utilitarian with minimal decoration. Similar graffiti marks are visible on the station walls and surfaces, maintaining the feel of urban street culture. We can see antique-style lampposts lining the platform, adding an oddly quaint contrast to the modernity of graffiti art.\n\nThere is a clear path along the platform beside the train, leading into the distance where another train or part of the station continues out of focus. In the background, one can discern vague outlines of city buildings, hinting at an urban setting.\n\nA few people are visible inside the train, with one person standing near the open door of the conductorâ€™s cabin appearing to look out. The platform itself appears to be devoid of any passengers, suggesting a moment caught between busy periods or in a lesser-used station area.\n\nOverall, the photograph tells a story of urban transit, art expression in public spaces, and the worn-down but enduring infrastructure of a city's subway system.","title":"Trains like this one have been spray-painted by vandals.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556811","554324","548266","554325","548261","548265","556821","556660","556650","556652","549650","548253","551889","548258","556814","551895"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","graffiti","platform","subway","station","mark","art","down","modernity","conductor"]}
