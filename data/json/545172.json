{"path":"545172.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures two men aboard a blue boat, engaging in what appears to be environmental or scientific fieldwork in a body of water surrounded by lush greenery. The man in the foreground wears a yellow life vest over a long sleeve shirt and is using a cylindrical device, possibly for sampling water or measuring some environmental parameter. The second man, standing beside him, is focused on a clipboard and pen, likely recording observations or data connected to their work. Dominating the background is a large, imposing cooling tower, typically associated with nuclear or industrial facilities, which suggests that their research may be related to the environmental impacts of the facility. The landscape is serene with a mix of verdant trees and clear water, juxtaposed against the stark industrial element of the cooling tower.","title":"Bob McConnell and Larry Davis of U.S. Marine Fisheries record fish life and water samples in the Columbia River prior to installation of Trojan Nuclear Plant.","placename":"Prescott (Or.)","location":"Prescott, Oregon","nn1":["548882","546307","546324","546758","549356","547718","549059","548770","546331","549622","549348","546334","552861","546892","546044","550962"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["cool","clipboard","fieldwork","record","tower","datum","sample","pen","facility","measure"]}
