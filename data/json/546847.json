{"path":"546847.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a detailed scene where a young man is engaged in an activity by a body of water. The young man, wearing a brown jacket, blue jeans, and sunglasses, is kneeling close to the water's edge. He is focused on pouring or collecting a substance from one container to another; he holds a smaller container with his right hand and a larger black bottle with his left. The environment around him is natural and somewhat rugged, featuring water flowing and small rocks scattered around. In the background and to the right edge of the image, partial views of another individual can be seen, suggesting that the young man is not alone. This individual appears to be standing and is also wearing casual attire. The image gives a sense of outdoor exploration or scientific investigation, possibly related to environmental studies or water quality testing. The use of vibrant colors and the clarity of the image enhances the depiction of the serene and natural setting.","title":"Don miller, of the Maryland water resources administration, checks water of stony run after accidental spillage of 4000 gallons of oil","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550962","548956","552110","554848","542556","552290","549628","551406","545077","548831","556991","549059","545032","546750","554535","552288"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["container","investigation","testing","collect","substance","depiction","sunglasse","bottle","water","clarity"]}
