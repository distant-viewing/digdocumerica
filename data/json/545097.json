{"path":"545097.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph shows a scenic beach view with various activities. The setting includes a coastline with a cluster of dark, rugged rocks contrasting against the sandy beach and the ocean. The waves are gentle and the ocean appears calm with light foam near the shore.\n\nOn the beach, people are engaged in various leisure activities. There are several groups and individuals spread out along the shore. Some people are standing near the edge of the water, possibly enjoying the view or chatting. Others are sitting on the rocks, and a few are walking around, exploring the area.\n\nThe lighting is somewhat dim, suggesting this might be either early morning or late afternoon. The overall mood is relaxed and tranquil, with people enjoying a sunny day by the sea. The composition is balanced, with the expanse of the ocean on one side and the detailed, textured arrangement of rocks and people on the beach occupying the foreground and middle ground of the image.","title":"'Netting smelts'","placename":"Yachats (Or.)","location":"Yachats, Oregon","nn1":["543047","553952","543322","543072","543254","555402","557458","545162","542890","546982","543310","547009","543089","553765","553766","543237"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","ocean","rock","people","shore","foam","coastline","arrangement","wave","cluster"]}
