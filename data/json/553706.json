{"path":"553706.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a suburban development, possibly on the outskirts of a town or city. In the foreground, there is a large, open field covered with piles of soil and scattered vegetation, suggesting recent or ongoing land development. The middle of the image is dominated by rows of brown-roofed houses; the architecture is uniform, indicating a planned community.\n\nFurther beyond the residential area, a more industrial setting appears with several larger buildings and what seems to be storage yards with numerous cylindrical objectsâ€”likely storage tanks or similar industrial containers. In the distance, you can see a wide expanse of flat land leading up to a body of water, giving the scene a coastal feel.\n\nThe backdrop features a distant view of water and a flat horizon, possibly a sea or large lake, with a faint outline of another shore or landform. Above the water, the sky is relatively clear with minimal cloud cover, suggesting a clear day. A notable feature in the distant background is what appears to be smoke or steam rising vertically, likely from a factory or power plant chimney, emphasizing the mix of residential and industrial settings in the area.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a comprehensive view of a community in transition from rural to more developed urban environments, underscored by the presence of both residential areas and industrial facilities.","title":"Rezoning of \"surplus pineapple land\" enabled pineapple growers-turned-developers to build this subdivision in Mililani town, one solution to the island's housing shortage","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["544600","553936","544568","549523","544604","558112","553692","553934","553700","551198","551174","558369","553938","553693","557451","544502"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["storage","development","landform","community","land","plan","outskirt","yard","view","develop"]}
