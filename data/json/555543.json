{"path":"555543.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures two goldfish in a body of water, viewed from above. The left fish is vividly colored in shades of gold and orange, with a shiny, scaly texture that reflects light. It appears lively and is swimming through the water. The right fish, on the other hand, appears pale and is facing upwards towards the waterâ€™s surface, suggesting it might be deceased or unwell due to its color and lack of movement.\n\nThe background of the image is a dark, murky aqua environment that suggests either a pond or a very stagnant section of a larger water body. The bottom surface beneath the water appears uneven and rocky, contributing to the overall natural and somewhat somber setting of the scene. The lighting is subdued, casting a gloomy ambiance over the image, highlighting the contrast between the vibrant life of the healthy fish and the stillness of the pale one.","title":"Major fish kill on the olentangy was caused by chemicals from the pennwalt corporation storage building, which was desTroyed by fire and explosions june 20, 1974.
