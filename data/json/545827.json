{"path":"545827.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a stark, somewhat desolate landscape. In the foreground, there are eroded soil formations and rough terrain, suggesting either a dried streambed or erosional features. The ground is covered with patches of parched earth and sparse vegetation, indicative of an arid environment. A series of telephone poles, equipped with electrical lines, recede into the distance, emphasizing the flatness of the surroundings.\n\nIn the middle ground and further into the background, an oil rig dominates the scene, positioned under a clear blue sky. This introduces an industrial element to the largely natural landscape, hinting at possible exploration or extraction activities. The rig is placed relatively centrally in the composition, drawing attention as a focal point against the vast, open terrain. The landscape and the man-made features together portray a scene of human impact and natural desolation, typical of areas used for resource extraction.","title":"Barren, eroded land is a result of oil spill.","placename":"Odessa (Tex.)","location":"Odessa, Texas","nn1":["555634","549118","554804","545815","555610","545963","555882","552004","544418","544102","544390","555883","545615","544068","544751","549180"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["rig","extraction","telephone","desolation","oil","resource","feature","terrain","exploration","landscape"]}
