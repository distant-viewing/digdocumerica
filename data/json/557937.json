{"path":"557937.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph shows a young boy in a cornfield. The boy is of light complexion and appears focused as he examines or shucks an ear of corn. He is wearing a light yellow T-shirt with darker colored pants. The cornfield around him is dense, with the cornstalks showing signs of maturation or possibly drying out, featuring brown and dried leaves.\n\nThe lighting suggests it's a bright, sunny day, casting vivid shadows and highlights across both the boy and the plants around him. Sunshine permeates through the foliage, creating a dappled effect on the ground and on the boy's clothing and face.\n\nOverall, the image captures a serene, agricultural moment, possibly suggesting themes of harvest, nature, or youthful curiosity.","title":"Youngster picks up an ear of corn at the hale farm which is adjacent to the western reserve village near Akron, Ohio.  Visitors take the ears and feed them to hogs located nearby.  Operated by the western reserve historical society, the 19th century farm and village form a living museum that preserves life as it was lived in that era.  The community is being reconstructed with original buildings moved from other sites.
