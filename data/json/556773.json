{"path":"556773.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy and crowded parking lot, filled almost entirely with cars from what appears to be the 1970s based on their design and styling. The cars, which include a variety of models, colors, and sizes, are tightly packed into the space, suggesting either a high-traffic event or limited parking availability in the area.\n\nThe setting is in a developed area as evidenced by buildings along the periphery of the parking lot. To the left and right of the image, there are buildings which look like small businesses or possibly homes adapted for commercial use. They have a somewhat aged look, typical of mid-20th-century architectural styles.\n\nThe background features lush green trees, indicating either the edge of a suburban area or a location near a park or greenbelt. It's a bright, sunny day with clear skies, which adds to the vibrancy of the scene. Overhead wires stretch across the top portion of the photograph, possibly for telephone or electrical transmissions, common in infrastructure from that period.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a slice of daily life, likely from the mid to late 20th century, centered around automobile usage and suburban commercial areas. The image conveys a sense of the era's dependency on personal vehicles and possibly hints at a popular event or a generally busy locale that draws a significant number of visitors.","title":"Commuter parking lot at a Southeastern Transportation Authority (SEPTA) train station in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Ridership increased from 273 million to 293 million between 1971 and 1974. Improvements in fringe parking, equipment and service helped to attract passengers. SEPTA has an annual operating budget of $180 million. Half of it is collected in fares, the remainder comes from state and local governments.","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556204","556736","546599","546731","547826","556790","546879","554349","556201","554617","556722","548496","553303","546685","556721","546813"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["parking","lot","availability","styling","periphery","event","transmission","telephone","century","locale"]}
