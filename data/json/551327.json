{"path":"551327.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features two pale-colored horses standing in a lush green field. The horse on the left is slightly closer to the viewpoint and is in a more frontal stance facing slightly to its left, while the horse on the right is positioned further from the camera, standing obliquely with its head turned towards its left looking over the field. The grass in the field appears dense and reaches up to the horses' lower bodies, indicating a healthy, quite untouched environment.\n\nThe background comprises a dense collection of trees with rich green foliage, enhancing the rural, serene setting of the shot. The light in the photo suggests either early morning or late afternoon as it casts soft, diffuse lighting over the scene, contributing to the tranquil atmosphere. No human presence or artificial structures are visible, suggesting a natural, possibly remote location. The overall composition of the photograph prioritizes a sense of peace and calmness, emphasizing a simple and pastoral beauty.","title":"In a pasture along route 5 near versailles, Missouri","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["542619","551229","556958","552501","542622","542972","543726","545894","545890","557186","544290","554161","556957","543366","542956","557988"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","field","left","peace","stance","calmness","comprise","viewpoint","reach","collection"]}
