{"path":"551204.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a landscape dominated by marked human activity amid natural surroundings. The central feature of the image is a large excavation area with exposed earth and various shades of brown and gray, suggesting a mining operation or large-scale earthworks. The excavated area is surrounded by thick green forests, showing a stark contrast between nature and human intervention.\n\nSeveral roads and pathways can be seen crisscrossing the landscape. A well-defined road, possibly a highway, runs horizontally across the upper part of the picture, bordering the excavation area on one side with a smaller road branching off and weaving along the contours of the disturbed earth. Smaller paths appear to have been carved out around the edge of the excavation zone, likely for vehicular or equipment access to the site.\n\nThe image provides a powerful representation of industrial activity within a forested environment, highlighting the interface between development and the natural world. The positioning of the roads and the sections of untouched forest around the excavation site offer a diverse view of the landscape's current use and its geomorphological changes over time.","title":"The land shows strip-mining scars","placename":"Charleston (W.
