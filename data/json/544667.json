{"path":"544667.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"In the photograph, there is a picturesque scene featuring a sailboat navigating through a body of water which appears to be choppy, with whitecaps visible on the surface indicating a breezy day. The sailboat, positioned nearly at the center of the frame, has two sails: a larger white main sail and a smaller one, both catching the wind efficiently. Its hull is not fully visible due to the perspective, but there are several people onboard, visible around the edges of the sail.\n\nThe background shows a distant coastline, with structures and a clearly outlined pier or bridge extending into the water. The overall coloring of the image suggests it might have been taken during the late afternoon or early evening, as evidenced by the warm light and the deep blue tonality of the water, creating a serene maritime atmosphere.\n\nThe foreground, which occupies a significant portion of the frame, focuses extensively on the sea itself, highlighting the texture and dynamic movement of the water under windswept conditions. The photograph captures the essence of sailing, emphasizing the interaction between human-made craft and the natural elements.","title":"Sailboat and white caps","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["549403","549394","549421","552345","548513","547463","549405","548506","549392","548521","549386","548498","549404","543402","544021","548204"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","whitecap","coloring","craft","sailing","water","hull","coastline","pier"]}
