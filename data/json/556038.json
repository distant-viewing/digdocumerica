{"path":"556038.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a young man leaning out of the window of a train's cab. This train cab is painted in a two-tone color scheme, with the upper portion in orange and the lower half in white. The scene is captured against a clear blue sky, emphasizing the contrast between the bright train colors and the vivid sky.\n\nThe young man appears pensive or reflective, gazing into the distance. He is dressed casually in a white t-shirt, and his dark hair contrasts with the light tones around him. His arms are crossed, resting comfortably on the edge of the window. The window itself has a sturdy, simple design, enhancing the utilitarian aspect of the train.\n\nVisible on the side of the train are labels indicating that this is a product of the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors, identifying the locomotive's manufacturing lineage. The painting is crisp, and the train looks to be well-maintained, with no visible wear or dirt.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of tranquil solitude, with the man seeming almost isolated within the mechanical setting, surrounded by the serene backdrop of the blue sky. This juxtaposition adds a contemplative, slightly moody atmosphere to the image.","title":"Engineer of the lone star passenger train waits in his cab before continuing the amtrak train run at Pauls Valley, Oklahoma enroute from Chicago to Houston, Texas.
