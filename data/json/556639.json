{"path":"556639.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a large pile of discarded aerosol cans in a dry, rugged terrain under a bright blue sky dotted with puffy white clouds. In the background, there is a small activity happening where one man is visible beside a parked truck, which is near some construction or maintenance work that includes wooden posts and possibly concrete foundations. To the left side of the image, there are additional peculiar details like a red barrel and other small clutter on the ground, hinting at an industrial or waste management setting. The scenery beyond the immediate foreground shows a sparse desert landscape with low hills in the distance, suggesting that this might be a remote or less populated area. The overall composition draws attention to environmental issues, possibly highlighting waste disposal challenges or pollution.","title":"Pile of aluminum beer and soft drink cans are the raw material for building blocks of an experimental house being built near Taos, New Mexico. A total of 70,000 cans will be used singly and in building blocks of eight to build a two story house designed by architect Michael Reynolds. Unskilled labor and cheapness of materials will allow the structure to be built for as much as 20% less than conventional housing.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["542494","552446","544637","556640","553433","556636","552937","551246","545600","547899","557307","554541","549750","544298","549957","542549"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["waste","foundation","clutter","disposal","barrel","challenge","can","issue","post","scenery"]}
