{"path":"548626.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures three older women sitting side by side on a metal bench outside the facade of a hotel named \"The New Bolivar Hotel.\" The background indicates that the image was likely taken in a sunny, warm environment with a stone wall featuring several signs. One sign indicates \"Low Summer Rates Now in Effect,\" coupled with another sign proclaiming \"The Only 100% Air Conditioned Hotel in This Area,\" highlighting the amenities meant to attract travelers. Below these, a more prominent sign stating \"VACANCY\" is placed between the women and the signs above.\n\nThe women are dressed in typical mid-20th-century casual wear. The woman on the left wears a light blue dress, the middle one is in a yellow dress, and the one on the right is dressed in a floral patterned dress in shades of pink and purple. All three display relaxed postures with varying expressions of indifference or mild interest. The bench they sit on is placed atop a small concrete platform, which adds a slight elevation, and they are partially shaded, likely by the stone wall or an overhead structure. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet, relaxed waiting, possibly watching the world go by or engaging in casual conversation. This scene encapsulates a moment of everyday life, possibly in a small town where this hotel serves as a notable local establishment.","title":"Inexpensive retirement hotels are a hallmark of the south beach area, a favored place is the front porch, where residents sit and chat or watch the activities on the beach","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["548646","546855","547772","557175","548625","556764","555991","553484","551444","557690","556176","555599","553485","548618","553483","551013"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["hotel","sign","woman","one","bench","dress","rate","stone","waiting","amenity"]}
