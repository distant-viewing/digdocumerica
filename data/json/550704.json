{"path":"550704.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural, slightly weathered setting centered around a two-story, traditional American style house with a gabled roof and what appears to be white clapboard siding. The house features a covered front porch draped with laundry hanging to dry, suggesting daily domestic activity. The house also has double-hung windows, some of which are opened slightly, likely for ventilation.\n\nAdjacent and slightly behind the main house, to the right, there stands a rustic barn or outbuilding with a darker, weathered wooden exterior and what appear to be two large double doors. Its overall condition and aesthetic hint at a functional, perhaps agricultural use.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes a lush green lawn in the foreground, framed by a small patch of yellow flowers and neatly trimmed hedges. Toward the background, a mix of deciduous trees can be seen, and behind these trees, a misty, tree-covered hill suggests a mountainous or hilly terrain, providing a serene and secluded atmosphere.\n\nThe skies above are grey, likely overcast, contributing to a mood of tranquility and a sense of simple, rustic life seemingly removed from the hustle of more urban environments. The overall composition and elements in the image create a glimpse into rural living with a focus on simplicity and the natural environment.","title":"House in gilead, a village on the androscoggin river","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["557746","554697","551091","548295","556959","558110","557669","547658","555611","557025","546992","546997","546439","554767","547861","557094"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","hedge","outbuilding","ventilation","remove","hustle","drape","barn","dry","living"]}
