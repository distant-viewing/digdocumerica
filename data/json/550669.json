{"path":"550669.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene where nature and industrial architecture merge. In the foreground, there is a tumultuous waterfall rushing over rocks, creating a dynamic and foamy appearance in the water, evidencing its power and speed. This natural force contrasts sharply with the background, which features a large, worn industrial building.\n\nThe building itself is multi-storied, with a flat roof and numerous rectangular windows, many of which appear to be broken or open, adding to the sense of decay. The exterior of the building is stained and weathered, suggesting long exposure to the elements and perhaps neglect. It has a dull yellow color with horizontal lines running across, possibly indicating different floors or structural reinforcements. An external pipeline or some type of conduit runs horizontally along one section of the building, and a small chimney or vent protrudes from the roof, suggesting functional but possibly outdated technology.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the vigorous, chaotic waterfall in the natural rocky environment with the stark, rigid lines of the aging industrial edifice creates a compelling contrast that might provoke reflections on themes like the passage of time, the impact of human activities on nature, or the resilience of natural processes amidst human-made structures.","title":"Outfall from the brown company paper mill at Berlin on the androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["553340","550857","553354","550736","553389","544796","550684","549540","548061","553386","550673","550710","553349","549555","550738","544769"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","reinforcement","conduit","provoke","pipeline","run","vent","stain","building","roof"]}
