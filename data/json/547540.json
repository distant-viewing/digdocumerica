{"path":"547540.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene natural landscape composed predominantly of wild foliage and grasses. The foreground prominently features lush shrubs studded with vibrant pink flowers likely to be wild roses. The dense grouping of these bushes is interspersed with tall, slender grasses swaying subtly, suggesting a gentle breeze.\n\nSlightly beyond these botanical elements, the vegetation transitions into a patch of taller, wild grass or reeds, highlighting varied textures and hues within the greenery. The landscape gradually opens up to reveal a calm body of water in the distance, its surface reflecting the sky, enhancing the sense of tranquility in the scene.\n\nIn the background, the land gently rises, and additional layers of diverse vegetation are visible, leading up to a clear, open sky that dominates the upper portion of the image. There are hints of structures or trees on the horizon, but they are distant and not detailed, suggesting a secluded natural setting, possibly near a coast or wetland area.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its focus on flora and the progression from dense foreground to an expansive, serene background, evokes a sense of peaceful solitude and the beauty of a natural, untouched environment.","title":"Wild roses and beach grass on the dune","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["557111","550536","557099","551370","557098","557189","557191","549225","549218","553084","556990","547488","557190","545209","557159","546205"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grass","grouping","rose","sway","coast","breeze","reed","flora","wetland","open"]}
