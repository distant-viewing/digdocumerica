{"path":"556402.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph showcases an industrial setting characterized by mechanical and structural elements in a somewhat rural or undeveloped environment. In the foreground, there is rugged terrain with patches of grass and scattered debris, possibly indicating recent construction or excavation activity. A barren, muddy hill looms in the background, stripped of much vegetation, possibly due to industrial impact or land clearing.\n\nCentral in the image are large industrial containers or tanks, cylindrical in shape, made of metal with a dull silver finish. One tank is positioned horizontally while the other extends partially out of the frame, suggesting significant size. These tanks might be storage units for gases or liquids, common in manufacturing or processing plants.\n\nAdjacent to the tanks are smaller structures and piping, some of which appear rusty, indicating age or exposure to elements. There are also power lines and utility poles visible, adding to the industrial feel. The environment lacks any sign of active human presence in the scene, emphasizing a focus on the industrial components and setting.","title":"Large fan equipment used to blow fresh air into Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company mine #2 near Richlands, Virginia.
