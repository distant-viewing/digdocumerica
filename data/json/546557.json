{"path":"546557.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph features a dual composition largely dominated by a close-up of a building on the left side, showing a large expanse of a plain brick wall. This wall extends vertically across the frame, creating a stark division between the left and right sections of the image. The left section is much darker as it includes a shadowed area beside the brick wall, contributing to a strong contrast within the composition.\n\nOn the right side of the image, behind the brick wall, the ornate top part of a classical architectural style tower is visible. This tower includes a clock face visible on the green-hued, tapered, spire-like roof adorned with ornamental features and a vented, crown-like structure on top. The clock, set within a white circle with black numbering and hands, adds a point of interest. Another notable feature is that the sky is clear and blue, providing a simple, unobtrusive backdrop that allows the focus to remain on the contrasting architectural elements.\n\nThe photographic composition effectively harnesses geometrical and color contrastsâ€”separating the minimalistic, modern construction of the brick wall and the intricate, historical detail of the clock tower. This juxtaposition evokes a sense of architectural evolution and the blending of different historical periods within urban environments.","title":"Courthouse tower (right) and tower of First Christian Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546499","546490","550062","549997","546508","546503","550001","542794","551442","557084","548649","548057","545873","546491","546521","550011"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["clock","brick","wall","tower","evolution","blending","division","circle","section","spire"]}
