{"path":"548975.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a large dam situated in a rugged, mountainous landscape. The dam itself appears prominently in the image with a curving concrete structure. Below the dam, a deep blue reservoir is visible, surrounded by steep, rocky terrain. The color of the water contrasts noticeably with the barren, brown mountains around it. Several roads wind along and through the mountains, illustrating the remote and structured access to this area. \n\nThe terrain across the photo is arid and features minimal vegetation, typical of desert environments. The photograph's perspective provides a comprehensive view of both the engineering marvel that is the dam and the natural, harsh beauty of the surrounding landscape. \n\nIn addition to the main dam, smaller structures and possibly other smaller dams or barriers are visible, along with various buildings that likely serve operational functions for the dam. Power lines and towers are also apparent, running across the landscape, which indicates the presence of electricity transmission infrastructure related to the dam's power generation capabilities.","title":"Hoover Dam on the Colorado River.
