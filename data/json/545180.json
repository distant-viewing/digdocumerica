{"path":"545180.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a lively moment at a sunny marina environment. In the foreground, a man is prominently smiling as he holds up an impressively large fish, which overwhelms the frame with its size. The fish has a glistening, silvery body with iridescent scales and a dark tail, and itâ€™s wrapped in a transparent plastic layer, possibly to preserve its freshness.\n\nThe man holding the fish is middle-aged, with a joyful expression, displaying pride or thrill from his catch. He is wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt. Behind him slightly out of focus, is another man who appears to be assisting or observing. This second man wears a hat and sunglasses, contributing to a typical fisherman's attire, suggestive of a warm, sunny day.\n\nIn the background, partial views of boats and maritime equipment contribute to the bustling marina setting. The boats have vibrant colors like yellow and features such as antennas, hinting at a scene of leisure and possibly commercial fishing activity. The sky is bright and blue, indicating clear weather, perfect for a day of fishing.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the triumph and human joy associated with fishing, framed against a backdrop of maritime activity under a clear sky.","title":"Fisherman show off their catch in the \"salmon capital of the world.\"","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552322","552323","552274","552315","550297","552321","552329","552118","553095","548164","544256","545165","548738","548190","548114","545178"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fish","fishing","marina","thrill","freshness","fisherman","pride","man","catch","antenna"]}
