{"path":"550230.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"In the photograph, a young boy leans casually against a wooden railing with signage attached, which reads \"CABIN SITE LORENZO MAY 1791.\" He is wearing a horizontally striped T-shirt paired with bell-bottom trousers, and his hands are resting on the top of the railing while he looks off to the side. Behind him, a large, smooth, multi-arched bridge spans across a tranquil river reflecting the structure above. The scene is enveloped in a soft-focus, contributing to the serene and somewhat nostalgic atmosphere. Lush greenery in the foreground, likely wildflowers and grasses partially seen in the photo, suggests that the location is embraced by natural surroundings. The overcast skies meld with the faded colors of the foliage, bridge, and water, enhancing the overall placid and historical aura of the setting.","title":"Marking the site on the Cuyahoga River where early settler Lorenzo Carter built his cabin.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557744","550836","558005","557969","558015","548837","544542","549068","542555","544203","548064","551527","557959","557996","543226","555730"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["railing","meld","bridge","embrace","bell","aura","wildflower","cabin","envelop","pair"]}
