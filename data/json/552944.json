{"path":"552944.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a group of young women actively engaged in an outdoor activity, likely a nature study or environmental education session. The scene is set in a forested area rich with evergreen shrubs or small trees. The setting suggests it might be during the warmer months due to the attire of the participants and the lush greenery around.\n\nIn the image, five young women are seen inspecting and interacting with the foliage intently. Starting from the left, the first young woman is bending over and pointing at something in the plants, showing a keen interest in her observation. She has long brown hair, and wears a long-sleeve, dark yellow top with lighter sleeves. Next to her is another woman, who appears to be helping by pointing and also looking closely, wearing a dark green sweater and white gloves.\n\nAdjacent, a woman with a bandana on her head crouches down by the bush. She seems to be examining or handling the plants carefully, doubling over the bush from the direction that is not fully faced towards the camera. Next to her, another participant is also crouched and focused on checking the lower depths of the bush. She has her hair pulled back and wears a red cap and a brown jacket.\n\nOn the far right, a woman with long hair and a dark band on her forehead is closely observing her peers work, or possibly also looking at the bush. She wears a dark blue, almost black long-sleeve top.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is one of curiosity and teamwork, with each member participating actively and suggesting a focus on learning or collecting samples from the bush. The background offers limited views, mainly consisting of similar green bushes, pine trees providing a dense natural backdrop, and what appears as scattered sunlight through the trees gives a peaceful, outdoor educational ambiance.","title":"Balarat center for environmental studies northwest of Boulder.
