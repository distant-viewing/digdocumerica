{"path":"545319.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in an urban environment, showing signs of wear and neglect. Two boys are sitting against a worn and stained brick wall. The boy on the left is burrowed into his knees, appearing focused or introspective, while the boy on the right is watching his hands, which are in his lap. Both boys are casually dressed, reinforcing the informal nature of the setting.\n\nIn the background, there is an old, multi-story brick building, featuring a balcony where two other children are standing and interacting, possibly talking. The architecture of the building shows signs of deterioration; missing bricks, stained walls, and old wooden doors suggest a lack of maintenance. A lone, white, pedestal-style sink sits inexplicably outdoors, adding a sense of abandonment to the setting.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a palpable atmosphere of urban decay and simplicity of life, with the children engaged in quiet and possibly introspective activities in their residential backdrop. The casual and possibly reflective poses of the children contrast with the rough textures and dilapidation of their surroundings.","title":"19th century brick presidio apartments in the heart of south El Paso's spanish speaking community","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["556163","552970","556166","545509","550249","555950","544368","553506","552969","557987","551001","553552","546565","545383","556164","545338"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","stain","brick","child","sink","deterioration","sit","wall","miss","talk"]}
