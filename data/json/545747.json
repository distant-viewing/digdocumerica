{"path":"545747.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a stark and dramatic landscape, primarily featuring a large, dead tree in the foreground. The tree is leafless with gnarled branches that stretch upwards, eerily silhouetted against a clear, blue sky. Above the tree, the sun is visible and casts a distinct flare, giving an intense backlight to the scene and creating a strong contrast with the darker silhouette of the tree.\n\nIn the background, there is a hill covered with dark debris or rocks that contribute to a barren, desolate environment. Rising from behind the hill, a plume of smoke or steam can be seen, suggesting volcanic or industrial activity in the region. The ground at the base of the tree is also littered with what appears to be debris, possibly metal parts and fragments, adding to the sense of desolation and abandonment.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somber and haunting, with the composition and elements hinting at themes of destruction, resilience, or nature reclaiming industrial ruins. The stark lighting and the distinct elements combine to create a powerful, visually compelling image.","title":"Dead tree with the Moab city dump in the background. Aside from autos, the dump seems to be the main source of air pollution in the area. The system of open burning is used. The dump is about three miles from Arches National Park to the north and fifteen miles from Canyonlands National Park to the south.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["543722","543718","552551","543843","546113","546121","553572","554994","546157","555207","554780","546056","555103","546065","554135","547546"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["backlight","ruin","tree","reclaim","flare","silhouette","destruction","debris","fragment","hill"]}
