{"path":"544740.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph depicts a desert landscape, characterized by a spacious, sandy terrain under a bright blue sky. In the background, towering red sandstone cliffs loom dramatically, suggesting a scene typical of the American Southwest, possibly a location like Monument Valley. The environment is arid, with sparse vegetation visible mostly as low bushes scattered across the sandy ground.\n\nIn the foreground, three individuals are engaged in some sort of activity involving large cylindrical pipes which are lying on the sand. The people, who appear to be workers, are spaced apart along the length of these metallic pipes, either inspecting or performing maintenance. The scene suggests a utilitarian purpose, possibly related to water or gas utility work common in remote areas.\n\nThe sandy surface is marked with tire tracks, indicating the recent movement of vehicles, likely associated with the work being done by the people in the image. This setting and activity combine elements of nature's grandeur with human endeavor, reflecting themes of development and maintenance in a rugged, natural landscape.","title":"Small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["545615","545596","545575","555883","545827","549118","553112","545677","552432","544418","555397","545657","542601","554804","544102","545804"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["pipe","maintenance","do","loom","endeavor","inspect","perform","gas","work","tire"]}
