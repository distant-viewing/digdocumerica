{"path":"547027.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph portrays an early morning or late evening scene featuring a serene lakeside setting. The primary subjects of the image are multiple wooden docks and a boathouse that extend into the calm water. The docks are constructed with wooden pillars and beams, and there are several shelters built on the docks that possess roofing but lack walls, likely serving as protective areas or observation points.\n\nA striking feature of the scene is the congregation of birds, potentially pelicans or seagulls, seen resting atop the roofs of the shelters and along the railings of the docks. These birds add a natural and somewhat quaint charm to the photograph, emphasizing a peaceful coexistence with the man-made structures.\n\nThe background features a dense treeline along the horizon, hinting at a thick, undisturbed forest. The sky, merged seamlessly with the water, casts a multitude of soft, muted hues—likely purples and blues—contributing to the tranquil and somewhat mysterious atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe reflection of the docks and the gentle gradation of colors in the sky and water suggest the photograph was taken during the \"golden hours\" of dusk or dawn, where light is soft, diffused, and warmly colored. This lighting creates a mirror-like reflection of the structures and birds on the water’s smooth surface, enhancing the overall balance and symmetry in the composition.\n\nOverall, this image captures a serene natural environment briefly intersected by human activity, where the focus lies on the harmony and quiet beauty of the lakeside.","title":"Buzzards wait for waste from the oyster co-op at Blufton.","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["547052","545911","557493","557562","543579","551258","544266","543527","554477","552311","548034","544567","550324","550299","545149","544126"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["dock","bird","shelter","lakeside","pelican","boathouse","congregation","reflection","gradation","symmetry"]}
