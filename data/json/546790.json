{"path":"546790.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, somewhat nostalgic scene featuring three children on top of a large, dark cannon. The cannon is pointing diagonally upward, and extends from the foreground into the middle of the frame. The largest part of the cannon, presumably the breech, is where two children are seated, with their backs turned towards the camera. Both appear to be engaged in a conversation, enjoying each other's company. The first child, who is slightly closer to the camera, wears a light pink shirt and white pants with vertical stripes, while the second child wears a white shirt paired with darker shorts.\n\nA third child is seen standing in the foreground, behind the cannon, isolated somewhat from the other two. This child, facing more towards the camera, wears a horizontally striped shirt and seems to be looking off into the distance, beyond the immediate scene.\n\nIn the background, a vast expanse of water stretches across the horizon, possibly a lake or a calm sea, under a broad daylight sky. The setting is peaceful, with a sense of quietude and simplicity. The composition of the photo, with the cannon as a central element, suggests themes of history or reminiscence, contrasted with the youthful innocence of the children.","title":"Tourists at fort mc henry","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546814","546772","546906","558277","545961","547676","558273","558275","544302","552341","544299","558274","544194","544200","544187","551639"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","camera","stripe","innocence","quietude","shirt","company","history","isolate","simplicity"]}
