{"path":"547827.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photo captures a vivid and somewhat gritty urban scene. In the foreground, there's a large, rusty metal dumpster that has opened flaps revealing its dark, empty interior marked with \"USG\" on one side. This dumpster sits on an unkempt, littered area where miscellaneous debris, including a red toy truck and various discarded items such as papers and cartons, are scattered around.\n\nIn the background, a two-legged signboard stands prominently. Despite its worn-out appearance, the sign is legible and contains instructional text advising community members on appropriate disposal practices and mentioning legal prohibitions against the disposal of hazardous waste; however, the exact wording is slightly obscured.\n\nBeyond the immediate vicinity is a sparse landscape showing signs of urban change or decay, with a stretch of undeveloped or cleared land. Residential buildings, identifiable as small houses with peaked roofs, are visible in the mid-distance. They provide a sharp contrast to the disorderly foreground. The environment suggests an area undergoing transition, possibly in need of municipal attention or revitalization efforts.","title":"Old sanitation department truck rusts in suburban dump","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550264","545494","551245","549786","557284","550798","547775","556640","547878","549752","549833","553039","549785","549769","545502","557307"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["dumpster","signboard","peaked","toy","undergo","discarded","disposal","mention","obscured","need"]}
