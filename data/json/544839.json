{"path":"544839.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of two men engaged in the activity of holding and stabilizing a large, red parachute-like structure. The setting is an arid, rocky landscape indicative of a desert environment. The background showcases a towering rock formation under a deep blue sky, enhancing the stark contrasts and vividness of the scene.\n\nThe two individuals, centered in the foreground, are actively pulling on ropes attached to the red fabric, which billows out above and in front of them. Their body posture and the tension in the ropes suggest that they are exerting significant force. One man is wearing a blue shirt and jeans, while the other is dressed in a light blue shirt paired with jeans and a red helmet, which hints at safety precautions typical for aerial or adventure activities.\n\nIn the distance, other people can be seen around vehicles, suggesting a group activity or organized event taking place in this remote location. The overall composition emphasizes a sense of dynamic movement and a vibrant splash of color against the natural earth tones of the desert surroundings.","title":"Hanging a $700,000 curtain across a quarter-mile-wide Rifle Gap.
