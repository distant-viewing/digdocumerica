{"path":"543722.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a stark, somewhat desolate landscape characterized primarily by rocky terrain under overcast skies. At the center of the frame stands a prominent, isolated dead tree with a gnarled and split trunk leading up to a spindly network of bare branches reaching toward the sky. The bark is stripped in places, giving the tree a rugged, weathered appearance.\n\nThe ground around the tree is rocky and uneven, composed of various-sized stones and pebbles that suggest an arid or volcanic environment, possibly suggesting recent environmental stress or changes. In the background, even though details are minimal, one can infer a barren horizon that continues the theme of a stark and uninviting terrain.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is subdued, with a mostly cloudy sky casting an even, diffuse light that enhances the somber mood of the scene. There are no active human or animal subjects present in the image, directing the focus entirely on the natural elements and the sense of isolation conveyed by the landscape and the lone tree. The composition's use of harsh lines and an unembellished palette underscores a narrative of survival or desolation.","title":"Peabody Coal Company strip mine","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543718","545747","552551","543843","546157","544921","554994","552433","544019","546121","555573","543658","546124","554780","555207","554135"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["survival","stress","pebble","tree","desolation","bark","change","terrain","network","narrative"]}
