{"path":"547192.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph portrays a scene in a public playground. In the center of the image, a young woman is seated on a spring-mounted ride shaped like an elephant, designed for children's amusement. She is dressed in casual attire, with a notably colorful striped sweater. Her expression is neutral, possibly contemplative, as she faces the camera.\n\nSurrounding her are several other similar rides, including two more elephants and a horse, all mounted on springs and made of metal, painted in soft colors like blue, gray, and yellow. These rides are placed on a paved area of the playground, and their bases show signs of wear and age.\n\nIn the background, there's an assorted array of playground equipment including a metal slide and a swing set, which is partially visible. Beyond the playground, residential buildings can be seen, suggesting this park is situated in a suburban area.\n\nThe setting appears to be somewhat desolate, devoid of other people except the woman, and the overcast sky suggests a cool or overcast day. The photograph captures a moment that blends childlike innocence with adult introspection, underscored by the nostalgic feel of the playground equipment and the urban backdrop.","title":"Lincoln Park playground","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["552470","551720","549711","543218","555946","549718","549674","556290","551725","546562","546781","543093","543496","547188","548488","549666"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["playground","ride","spring","slide","basis","innocence","swing","amusement","introspection","equipment"]}
