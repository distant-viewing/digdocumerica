{"path":"558374.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a printing press environment with various machines and a person operating within the facility. The environment is industrious and somewhat cluttered, filled with assorted mechanical components typical of a printing setup.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple printing machines occupy the space, each equipped with numerous knobs, rollers, and spools. These spools appear to hold labels or papers, possibly indicating that these machines are used for labeling or packaging purposes. The machines are metallic and complex, with parts of them semi-open, showing the internal mechanisms and printed materials flowing through them.\n\nIn the background, an individual is visible, seemingly occupationally engaged with one of the machines. This person seems to be observing or adjusting the machine they are attending to, focused on the process at hand.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the photo suggests a scene of productivity and mechanical intricacy, characteristic of a printing press where precision and monitoring are crucial. The lighting in the space is artificial, casting a warm hue over the metallic surfaces and giving the room an industrial ambiance. This setup not only highlights the complexity and mechanical nature of the printing process but also the human involvement essential in managing and operating such equipment.","title":"Interior of the 3m co.( Minnesota mining and manufacturing) plant showing an employee working on one of the machines.  3m has 1,377 employees which makes it the largest industry in town.
