{"path":"554317.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The image depicts a dense accumulation of compressed, mangled metal scrap, possibly from automobiles or other large metal objects. The metal pieces are pressed together, creating an intricate mosaic of rusted and weathered textures. The colors vary from deep rust reds to dark blues and blacks, intersected by occasional flecks of unoxidized metal and lighter, perhaps aluminum, components. The surfaces of the metal pieces have a glossy, wet look, suggesting either recent rainfall or oil residue.\n\nThe pieces are crushed and distorted significantly, making any original forms unrecognizable except for a few characteristics that hint at automotive parts, like what might be a crushed wheel hub or parts of vehicle frames. The arrangement of the metal gives the image an almost abstract quality, where the distinction between individual pieces is blurred, fusing them into a coherent, chaotic texture.\n\nThe lighting in the image is diffuse, casting soft shadows which enhance the dimensionality and the texture of the metal heaps. The lack of any background or context outside the scrap metal itself focuses the viewer's attention entirely on the intricacies of the crushed, intertwined materials. The overall composition invokes themes of decay, recycling, and perhaps the environmental impacts of industrial waste.","title":"Auto scrap yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554301","554357","554319","554300","554305","548753","548147","554352","554304","557308","551517","554320","554318","554346","548109","547476"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["metal","piece","scrap","mosaic","aluminum","residue","intricacy","texture","recycling","black"]}
