{"path":"548799.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image captures a serene outdoor scene featuring three people relaxing in hammocks suspended between trees. The person closest to the camera is lounging in a red and white striped hammock, visibly enjoying a book. This individual appears to be a woman with wavy hair, dressed in a warm, quilted jacket indicating it might be a cool day.\n\nTo her left, there's another hammock with a person wrapped in a beige cloth, perhaps a blanket or a light-colored garment, mostly obscured except for their legs. The orientation suggests a relaxed posture with a tilt towards the camera.\n\nThe third hammock, to the far right side of the frame, contains another individual in a white hammock. This person is less visible, with only parts of their lower body appearing in the shot.\n\nIn the foreground, the ground shows signs of outdoor leisure; there's a pair of sandals and a green towel or a piece of clothing spread out on the grass. The scene is backlit with natural sunlight, creating a bright and tranquil mood, emphasizing a leisurely day spent outdoors. The blue sky peeking through can suggest itâ€™s a clear day.","title":"Campers on Little Duck Key sleep in their own hammocks.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548800","548798","545293","551682","553065","554679","547877","543467","558096","550232","546566","547340","552033","553403","557672","553438"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["person","sandal","orientation","lounge","cloth","garment","spend","towel","suspend","peek"]}
