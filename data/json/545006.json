{"path":"545006.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a heap of discarded old car doors and other automotive parts. The car doors are densely packed in an array of orientations and angles, creating a chaotic and tightly filled space. Most of the doors have traces of peeling paint and signs of corrosion, indicating their worn-out condition. The colors of the doors vary, including shades of white, brown, blue, and other faded hues, which adds to the visual texture of the image. Some doors still have recognizable features such as handles, mirrors, or window frames, but they are generally crushed or deformed.\n\nA noticeable number on one of the doors ('35') is painted in red, standing out against the duller backgrounds, possibly indicating a categorization in a salvage yard or a specific part to be retrieved or processed. The overall impression is one of neglect and obsolescence, showcasing environmental and recycling themes related to the automotive industry. The interplay of colors, alongside the rust and decay, also contributes to a certain aesthetic quality, highlighting themes of decay and the passage of time.","title":"Zidell ship-wrecking yard","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555492","553005","545303","542656","545365","552739","545340","547476","552999","555491","553006","554317","548753","554319","546249","545010"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["door","obsolescence","salvage","decay","corrosion","orientation","trace","handle","recycling","theme"]}
