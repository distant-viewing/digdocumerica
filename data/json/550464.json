{"path":"550464.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph beautifully captures an isolated, vibrant flower. The flower, displaying a captivating shade of soft lavender with delicate, thin petals arranged in a radial pattern, is centrally positioned in the image. The center of the flower is a rich, warm yellow to orange color, consisting of many small, densely packed florets.\n\nThe background of the image is a softly blurred unification of dark and light green tones, providing a calm, out-of-focus backdrop that enhances the sharpness and color of the flower. The play of light and shadow on the petals suggests either natural sunlight filtering through a canopy or a soft, directional artificial light source, creating subtle differences in the lavender hues and adding depth and dimension to the petals.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is simple yet striking, using a shallow depth of field to focus all attention on the solitary beauty of the flower, evoking a sense of tranquility and the delicate intricacies of natural flora.","title":"Alpine aster","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555035","543623","554586","551368","547613","547815","545699","554840","555034","544875","543597","545706","557618","555189","553361","554579"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","difference","intricacy","sharpness","dimension","flora","depth","source","yellow"]}
