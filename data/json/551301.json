{"path":"551301.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features two young men at the forefront, possibly captured during the 1970s, given their style and grooming. The man on the left sports a full mustache and curly shoulder-length hair, wearing a plain, light-colored t-shirt. The man on the right, who seems slightly more central in the frame, has a distinctive look with a handlebar mustache and chin-length hair. He wears a dark cowboy hat, aviator sunglasses, a denim jacket, and a necklace with a small pendant, projecting a somewhat rugged style.\n\nBoth individuals appear engaged in a moment of conversation or observation, looking off to their left with expressions of interest or concern. The background is blurred, featuring indistinct shapes and colors that suggest a busy urban setting, possibly a street scene with vehicles and possibly other people, although details aren't clear due to the depth of field used.\n\nThe overall mood conveys a casual, perhaps spontaneous moment captured among everyday urban hustle. The focus and composition highlight the two men, emphasizing their expressions and distinct personal styles against the undefined, busy backdrop.","title":"Motorcyclists survey \"the strip, a commercial amusement area","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["556552","557907","552752","554872","557145","551459","549291","554097","553148","551300","545044","557043","554860","557854","545970","557042"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["mustache","length","handlebar","style","necklace","man","hustle","hair","expression","observation"]}
