{"path":"555346.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a desert scene dominated by several large saguaro cacti. The landscape is arid and flat with a clear blue sky overhead. These towering cacti, which are iconic of the Sonoran Desert, are scattered throughout the image and have multiple arms, indicating their mature age. The terrain is sandy with sparse vegetation and appears to be a dry, open field commonly found in desert environments.\n\nIn the background, there are distant mountains with softened contours likely due to atmospheric haze, typical in desert landscapes. The mountains are quite barren with little to no vegetation visible, enhancing the rugged terrain's appearance. Below the mountains, the horizon is faintly lined with what could be low vegetation or distant structures, though these details are not clearly defined.\n\nThe foreground of the photograph shows traces of human activity, such as tire tracks and a cleared path, suggesting recent or ongoing usage of this area, perhaps for vehicle access or construction. There is no visible water body or significant greenery, emphasizing the dry, harsh environment typical of desert ecosystems. The combination of natural elements and subtle signs of human presence creates a serene yet stark depiction of a desert landscape.","title":"Piece of bulldozed desert on the edge of Tucson, Arizona. The saguaro cactus are left standing near what will be a housing development. The fate of other saguaros is uncertain. Many are dying in less disturbed parts of the desert in the area.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["545717","553996","545843","544027","544879","545903","544071","545575","555367","545754","545583","544016","544401","545789","552923","544024"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","mountain","vegetation","trace","overhead","usage","soften","depiction","tire","clear"]}
