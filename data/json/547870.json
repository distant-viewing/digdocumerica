{"path":"547870.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of a group of people, predominantly elderly, seated outdoors in a public event setting. They are arranged in a long row of connected chairs, lined up against a railing which suggests the proximity of water or a body of water in the background. The people are dressed in a varied array of attire, reflecting personal styles and the formal or semi-formal nature of a daytime event. Men are mostly seen in suits or jackets, while women wear dresses, coats, and hats.\n\nOne individual, near the left of the image, is notably leaning back with his head turned upwards, possibly enjoying the sunlight or looking at something specific in the sky. Many attendees are shown holding event programs or similar paper items, indicative of their participation in an organized event. Their facial expressions vary, with some engaged in conversation and others looking straight ahead, possibly listening or watching something at the event.\n\nThe setting is further characterized by the presence of a brick building on the left, which adds an urban feel to the scene. The ambiance of the location is illuminated by bright sunlight, leading to prominent shadows cast on the ground, contributing to the depth and texture of the image. The general mood of the gathering appears calm and organized, with participants enjoying a sunny day at an outdoor function, probably by a river or lake shore given the presence of a railing and the wide-open space behind it.","title":"A small park on Sheepshead Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547885","551675","553757","553759","557054","548625","551814","551801","551808","548647","548569","548588","554442","556522","550302","549734"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["event","railing","organize","enjoy","participation","attendee","participant","sunlight","listen","left"]}
