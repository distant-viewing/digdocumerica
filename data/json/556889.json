{"path":"556889.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and active railroad scene, taken from an elevated perspective. It depicts multiple railroad tracks stretching into the distance alongside a lush, tree-lined area. The focus of the image is on a section of the railroad where maintenance or construction work appears to be in progress.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a large piece of railroad maintenance equipment, likely a tamping machine, which is typically used to pack the ballast under railway tracks to make the tracks more durable. This machine is orange in color and is positioned on one of the tracks. There are several workers visible around this machinery. One worker is standing on the machine itself, operating or adjusting its components, while another is walking along the gravel beside the tracks, seemingly supervising or moving towards another task.\n\nThe background of the image shows a serene, wooded area that seems to mark the onset of autumn, given the hints of yellow and orange in the foliage. One side of the railroad features a dense grouping of trees, indicating that this could be near a forested region or a rural area.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a snapshot of the essential yet often unnoticed maintenance work that keeps rail transport systems operational, set against a backdrop of natural beauty, highlighting a blend of industry and nature.","title":"Southern railway right-of-way work crew, with equipment used in laying new quarter mile long sections of rail to replace the old shorter track. In 1974 the company spent 18.6 percent of its revenue in track maintenance, the highest in the industry. That year Southern laid 91,808 tons of rail and placed 2,278,318 railroad ties. The maximum safe speed on the company's track is usually 60 miles per hour for the entire 10,531 miles of the system.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556869","556894","556862","556891","556877","556860","556888","556883","556879","556872","556885","556901","556873","556899","556895","556856"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railroad","track","machine","maintenance","worker","grouping","onset","progress","work","gravel"]}
