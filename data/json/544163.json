{"path":"544163.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a man standing inside a train car framed by a doorway. The color palette of the image is primarily cool-toned, dominated by dark and muted shades of blue. The train car door is metal, painted in a weathered blue finish, with visible rivets and hinges suggestive of heavy-duty use.\n\nThe man appears to be a train worker or conductor, as indicated by his attire. He is wearing a safety helmet with a reflective band, suggesting a focus on safety standards. His face shows a calm but focused expression, partially illuminated, giving a dramatic contrast with the shadowed areas of the image. He wears a striped, dark, and light gray shirt under a protective vest or jacket. Around his neck, there is what appears to be a dark-colored bandana, perhaps for protection or as a sweat rag.\n\nHe gazes directly out of the doorway, possibly observing activities outside or waiting for a signal to begin his duties. His posture and position in the doorway suggest readiness and alertness, common traits for someone responsible for the operation and safety of a train. There is no visible movement in the image, reinforcing a moment of stillness or anticipation in his routine.\n\nThe setting is industrial, indicated by the structure and nature of the doorway and car interior. This setting, combined with his clothing and equipment, suggest the photograph's capture in a working environment centered around rail transport.","title":"Photograph of a Navajo construction worker at the Navajo generating plant in Arizona","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["556844","556083","556087","556079","556845","556038","556108","556109","556846","551975","556082","551889","556006","556676","548259","556770"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["doorway","train","safety","duty","alertness","rivet","working","car","conductor","bandana"]}
