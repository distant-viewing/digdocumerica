{"path":"553851.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a moody and dramatic scene on a residential street engulfed in an ethereal, smoky haze. In the foreground, a child is captured in mid-motion, likely running across the pavement. The child's silhouette is distinct against the diffuse background light, contributing to the dramatic atmosphere of the image. The childâ€™s pose, with one leg extended forward and arms positioned as if in mid-stride, suggests a moment of play or hurried movement.\n\nTo the right of the frame, an older model car is parked on the street, further anchoring the image in a specific historical context, likely mid to late 20th century. The backdrop features a row of townhouses visible through the haze, which adds a mysterious or eerie quality to the setting.\n\nAbove the houses, thick smoke billows into the sky, dominating the upper portion of the image and creating a stark contrast with the quieter residential setting below. This smoke, along with the haze that fills the air, could imply a distant fire or some form of industrial activity, contributing to a sense of unease or tension in the otherwise everyday scene.\n\nOverall, the composition, with its play of light, shadow, and smoke, along with the dynamic pose of the child, creates a compelling narrative, inviting the viewer to ponder the story behind this moment captured in time.","title":"Heavily polluted air of Birmingham, center of steel, coal and coke industries, poses serious threat to city's children.
