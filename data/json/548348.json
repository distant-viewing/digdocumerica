{"path":"548348.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene at a waste disposal site. It captures a yellow bulldozer, branded Caterpillar, actively engaged in moving garbage or debris. Adjacent to the bulldozer are two large, rusted, and battered dump truck trailers with their beds elevated, presumably dumping waste. The trailersâ€™ sides show significant wear and have graffiti or faded markings, one displaying the number \"539.\"\n\nThe area is densely packed with miscellaneous trash that sprinkles the landscape like confetti, consisting mainly of smaller waste items that create a multi-colored texture over the ground. There's little vegetation visible; the setting underscores a heavy, industrial workload and environmental impact. The background is mostly out of focus, emphasizing the central actions of waste management and machinery in operation. The overall mood conveys a gritty, utilitarian aspect, typical of waste disposal operations.","title":"Dumping landfill at fresh kills, on the west shore of Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549796","549795","549807","549941","549740","549797","546231","546257","549943","549793","549937","549792","549794","543828","549936","548322"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","bulldozer","trailers","sprinkle","disposal","operation","graffito","brand","underscore","trailer"]}
