{"path":"545399.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a patient receiving medical treatment in a hospital setting. The patient, a man, is lying on his back on a hospital bed. He is wearing a hospital gown and appears to be unconscious or sedated, with his eyes closed. There is an oxygen mask fitted snugly over his nose and mouth, which is connected by a tube trailing off to medical equipment out of frame.\n\nThe man's hands are resting on his chest, and the bed sheets are slightly rumpled. With one exposed forearm visible, his physical state appears relatively relaxed.\n\nThe background shows a small room outfitted with various medical equipment and supplies. To the right, there's a brown wooden cupboard on which several items are placed, including what seems to be medications, a bowl, a jug, a home iron, and other hospital-related devices. Above this, there's a shelf holding yet more items, possibly related to the medical care, such as wires and tubing. The overall setting conveys a clinical and functional environment typically seen in a hospital's private or semi-private room.\n\nLighting in the photograph is dim, suggesting indoor lighting conditions without a strong external light source, contributing to the solemn and subdued atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Ex-coal miner is now a black lung victim.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["558178","558177","545552","553035","556556","545413","545407","545412","556567","545482","545416","556575","545408","558338","558167","554849"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["hospital","patient","bed","room","jug","gown","tubing","bowl","mask","receive"]}
