{"path":"544606.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph features an expansive natural landscape with a clear focus on both the ecology and human activity. The foreground is dominated by a rugged, wild terrain covered with a variety of vegetation, primarily consisting of sparse, tall pine trees and a dense undergrowth. The trees appear somewhat scattered, with open spaces revealing the grassy and bushy underbrush.\n\nCentral to the image is the striking presence of an airplane, captured mid-flight slightly above the center of the frame. The aircraft, likely a large commercial or military jet given its design with visible wings and rear tail, is in sharp contrast to the natural setting. It is depicted descending, which suggests it is either landing or flying very low over the area.\n\nThe background is populated with a vibrant sky, filled with fluffy, voluminous clouds that occupy much of the upper part of the frame. These clouds are distributed across the sky, creating a dynamic and textured appearance that adds depth to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph juxtaposes the serene, untamed wilderness with the mechanical, human-made element of the airplane, highlighting an intersection of natural beauty and technological advancement. The image evokes a sense of scale and the relationship between human activity and natural environments.","title":"Jet landing at the controversial Miami-Dade jet park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544491","548469","542577","545042","555861","556907","551601","557003","550554","547824","556936","550604","542720","551568","548447","550642"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["airplane","advancement","underbrush","jet","relationship","tail","undergrowth","wing","aircraft","cloud"]}
