{"path":"553913.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a young person holding a crab directly towards the camera. The person has shoulder-length dark hair and is partially out of focus, with the focus being primarily on the crab they are holding. The crab is prominent in the frame, displaying its detailed body structure, including its claws, legs, and patterned shell. The background is softly blurred, but appears to be an outdoor setting with neutral tones suggesting it could be near a body of water or a sandy area typically associated with crabs. The expression on the person’s face is partially visible and shows a neutral to slightly amused demeanor. The lighting in the photograph is natural, soft, and diffused, highlighting the details of the crab and casting a gentle illumination on the person’s face and hands.","title":"Hawaiian boy has caught a crab","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["543909","545182","543912","543751","552285","557443","543905","554005","544264","552808","545175","552943","552304","546214","543916","544509"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["crab","person","claw","shell","illumination","face","diffuse","demeanor","hold","shoulder"]}
