{"path":"547039.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene that seems to be set in an outdoor, possibly rural area, exhibiting signs of neglect or abandonment. The focal point is a number of objects strewn across the ground. There are several metal garbage cans, one tipped over with its lid adjacent to it. Another can stands upright with its lid askew.\n\nThe scene also includes an assortment of debris littering the groundâ€”pieces of wood, a rusted metal bucket, crumpled pieces of paper, and a green glass bottle. In this somewhat desolate setting, a single black bird is perched on a pile of debris prominently in the foreground. This adds a touch of life to the otherwise inanimate scene.\n\nBackground elements are less distinct but appear to include leafless shrubs and bare trees, suggesting a cold or dormant season. Altogether, the composition and elements present a tableau that evokes themes of desolation, human impact on the environment, and perhaps resilience or survival, marked by the presence of the bird. The lighting appears natural, with shadows indicating either early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Aftermath of severe storm in Zion--bird perched on strewn garbage","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556640","552102","556324","551246","551964","543165","544640","547947","546241","544648","552992","549742","550246","547971","547775","547983"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["lid","bird","survival","piece","tableau","debris","assortment","garbage","desolation","can"]}
