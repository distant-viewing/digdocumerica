{"path":"546197.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up scene of autumn leaves in water, displaying a unique interaction of natural elements. The image shows several leaves submerged in a dark, swirling liquid that resembles watery oil or a similar dense fluid. The visible leaves, mainly maple, are in a state of decay, with brown and golden hues that contrast sharply against the dark, almost black color of the liquid.\n\nThe water around the leaves has dynamic swirl patterns and ripples that indicate movement, possibly caused by the gentle flow of water or wind. Bubbles and patches of white foam are interspersed throughout the fluid, suggesting some agitation in the liquid.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image focuses on the natural beauty and the textural contrast between the decaying leaves and the viscous looking liquid, highlighting themes of change and the passage of time within nature. The choice of focus, lighting, and the detailed capture of textures enhance the visual impact of a seemingly simple scenario.","title":"The contaminated water of Mill Creek.
