{"path":"545531.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a group of six people involved in an outdoor activity near a red-brown river. The setting is lush and green, filled with dense vegetation, including tall grasses, bushes, and scattered trees in the background, likely near a woodland or a forested area.\n\nIn the foreground to the left, there is a man standing, dressed in a dirty white T-shirt and jeans, looking slightly off-camera with a contemplative expression. His attire and the dirt marks on his shirt suggest he has been involved in some physical work.\n\nIn the background, there are five more individuals engaged in various activities. One person stands out on a slightly risen area on the edge of the river wearing what appears to be a white shirt and pants. This individual looks on from a distance, overseeing or observing the action.\n\nThe main group comprises four individuals, clustered towards the center and right of the image. They are in the midst of thick foliage. Three of these individuals are in white T-shirts and hats, suggesting a uniform or coordinated effort, possibly part of a work crew or a team performing environmental, construction, or clean-up work. They appear to be handling the vegetation, either clearing it or organizing it in some way.\n\nOverall, this scene suggests a communal effort focused on environmental maintenance or similar outdoor activity near a water source. The riverâ€™s prominent muddy color hints at possible soil erosion or recent rains affecting the water clarity.","title":"Prisoners from Jefferson County Jail remove branches from polluted stream.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545535","548198","551427","551538","551414","550209","546803","558066","551391","546338","548191","545684","552948","554467","543439","551416"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["effort","shirt","individual","river","work","team","involve","oversee","crew","woodland"]}
