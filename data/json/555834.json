{"path":"555834.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph portrays a serene and expansive ocean scene highlighted by human, maritime, and aquatic elements. In the foreground, three scuba divers are partially submerged in the water. The divers are equipped with full scuba gear, including masks, fins, and air tanks, suggesting preparation for underwater exploration. The middle diver, more prominently visible, wears an orange floatation device, enhancing visibility at the water's surface.\n\nA large ship, positioned in the mid-ground and dominating the background, stretches horizontally across the frame. This ship, likely a commercial or research vessel given its structure and size, appears stationary. This gives a sense of scale against the vast, calm oceanic backdrop which merges with a clear, lightly clouded sky at the horizon.\n\nThe water exhibits a gentle surface, reflecting sunlight and creating a glittering effect, and the overall peacefulness suggests favorable weather conditions for diving. A lone buoy, visible near the left edge of the frame, hints at the area being designated for marine activities or as a navigational aid.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of adventurous activity within a tranquil marine setting, combining elements of human interaction with a natural, expansive seascape.","title":"Divers from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ship \"Ferrel\" searching for current meters in the bight. (Note: Ship in background is not the \"Ferrel\".) The meters are taken aboard ship for monitoring and cleaning, then are replaced by the divers. Current research will show how well sludge and waste is dispersed by natural circulation, and the effect of man's activities.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555830","549347","555833","549265","548681","543065","548675","555831","544129","554007","548680","549359","549598","548683","549369","548714"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["diver","ship","marine","diving","aid","fin","mask","buoy","seascape","maritime"]}
