{"path":"552342.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene nocturnal scene featuring several sailboats on a body of water, lit by a glowing moon that hangs in a partly cloudy sky. The sails of the boats are fully unfurled, suggesting a gentle breeze. Each sailboat has distinct sail numbers visible, with \"483\" prominently displayed on the sail of the nearest boat.\n\nThe moon casts its reflection on the water, creating a path of light that adds a magical quality to the scene. The dark water and the darker skies are contrasted by this luminescence, emphasizing the calm and quiet of a nighttime sailing scenario.\n\nIn the background, there is a shoreline dotted with bright city lights, suggesting an urban setting not too far from this tranquil maritime activity. These lights twinkle dimly, providing a subtle, colorful backdrop to the darker tones of the evening. The general ambiance of the image is peaceful and somewhat mysterious, evoking the quiet solitude one might find while sailing at night.","title":"Moonlight sailboat race on commencement bay.
