{"path":"551098.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene under a large highway overpass. The overpass, supported by thick columns, creates a shaded area beneath where various activities are occurring.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a concrete column with part of a rail crossing sign visible, showing the words \"RAILROAD CROSSING.\" This sets the context near possibly a train or tram area. Under the left side of the bridge, a bench lines the wall where several older individuals are seated, spaced out casually, most likely enjoying a rest or observing the surroundings.\n\nThe center and right side of the photo show more dynamic activities. A handful of children are engaged in play. Two boys in particular are in the midst of a playful interaction, possibly throwing or catching something small, indicated by their focused postures and gestures involving their hands.\n\nBeyond the immediate underpass area, the surroundings appear natural and somewhat unkempt, with trees and shrubs visible. Also noticeable is a pile of rocks or debris to the right side under the overpass, hinting at either recent construction or a less maintained area.\n\nThe setting suggests an urban environment where the space under the overpass is used by the community for various casual and social purposes, providing shade and a place to gather during the day. The lighting in the photograph highlights the contrast between the sunlit exterior and the shadowed area beneath the overpass, enhancing the textures of the concrete and natural elements.","title":"Some little league bench warmers.
