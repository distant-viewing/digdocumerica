{"path":"552724.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic urban scene against a stark architectural backdrop. The building is imposing, featuring tall vertical lines and a grand entrance. The facade is comprised of large stone blocks, displaying a blend of dark and light beige tones. A distinct door is centered in the image, characterized by its tall, narrow shape and dark wood panels.\n\nA striking feature of the building is a row of air conditioning units embedded within the upper portion of the door structure, breaking the monotony of the wooden panels with their mechanical appearance.\n\nOn the ground, lying in front of the massive doorway, is a person seemingly in a state of rest or exhaustion. This person is dressed in dark clothing and is lying on their side with their limbs relaxed. Next to the person are several personal belongings including what appears to be a red soda can and possibly other small items, suggesting a scene of transience or homelessness.\n\nThe scene is captured under bright sunlight casting part of the front of the building, including the person on the ground, into deep shadow, which contrasts sharply with the brightly lit sections of the facade. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of isolation and contrast between the grandeur of the building and the vulnerability of the individual at its entrance.","title":"Homeless man sleeping on doorway of Penn Central's 30th Street Station","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["546506","553537","550257","546519","550129","550253","555952","546498","555897","552971","550285","553255","556164","546423","553539","555902"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Urban Architecture"],"terms":["person","panel","entrance","monotony","soda","facade","conditioning","door","vulnerability","limb"]}
