{"path":"552565.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic scene of rural life, featuring a person on horseback herding cattle in a grassy field. The individual, who appears to be a middle-aged man, is dressed in traditional ranch attire: a cowboy hat, long-sleeve shirt, and riding chaps. He is mounted on a brown horse and is actively watching over the herd.\n\nThe herd consists of around a dozen cattle, including cows and their calves. The cattle have predominantly reddish-brown and white coats. They are dotted throughout the foreground of the image, grazing calmly on the lush green pasture.\n\nThe setting is a vast, open field bordered by a simple fence that disappears into a background of gently rolling hills. The sky above is clear and bright, suggesting it is midday or early afternoon.\n\nThis image powerfully conveys a moment of daily life in the countryside, emphasizing the relationship between a rancher, his animals, and the natural landscape.\n","title":"At the Oldlands' summer cow camp, 15 miles south of their Piceance Creek ranch. Three generations of Oldlands have ranched here.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["543776","549033","548830","554128","553105","548828","548829","553100","553104","543634","553814","548878","552698","552562","548954","543779"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cattle","herd","calf","dozen","horseback","pasture","ranch","cow","relationship","countryside"]}
