{"path":"554153.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts two weathered wooden tiki carvings positioned against a scenic coastal background. The tiki carvings are placed in the foreground, with one tiki facing directly towards the viewer and the other one slightly turned to the side, facing right. Both tikis feature intricate detailing with deep-set facial features and prominent tribal patterns carved into the wood.\n\nThe background consists of a calm seascape with rocky shores visible under a bright, cloudless sky. Small waves can be seen gently crashing against the shore. Near the horizon, a small, white sailboat is anchored, adding a graceful touch to the landscape. The environment suggests a tranquil, serene setting that contrasts with the fierce expressions of the tiki carvings.\n\nThe composition effectively uses the tikis to frame and draw attention to the natural beauty of the coastal scene. The contrast between the aged, dark texture of the wooden tikis and the soft, light colors of the sky and sea enhances the visual impact of the image.","title":"Ancient statues in the city of refuge national historic park near honaunau on the western side of the island","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554150","554152","554151","549533","542888","544554","543075","543057","543053","545173","544284","543069","548810","543250","542889","545122"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["carving","shore","crash","seascape","anchor","carve","near","detailing","face","sailboat"]}
