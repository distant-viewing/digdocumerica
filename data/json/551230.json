{"path":"551230.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil and somewhat moody scene of a small, man-made watercourse. On the right side of the image, a concrete pathway or edge is visible, leading towards the top where water spills over forming a small, smooth, and silky waterfall due to a long exposure effect. The left side and foreground show a natural water body where the water appears calm and dark, with pieces of debris, including leaves and small branches, floating on the surface. The water's surface is somewhat reflective, subtly mirroring the dusky light and colors of the surrounding environment.\n\nThe color tones in the image are cool, dominated by shades of blue and gray, conveying a serene, early dusk or overcast day atmosphere. The overall mood is quiet and reflective, focusing on the interplay of man-made structures with natural elements. The composition skillfully balances the harsh lines of the concrete with the soft, fluid motion of the water, creating a harmonious and peaceful scene.","title":"Shallow clay soils and poorly bound land pose erosion problem whenever heavy rain falls.
