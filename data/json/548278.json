{"path":"548278.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph appears to capture a scene at a dock. The foreground features an older man standing prominently with his hands on his hips. He is wearing a plaid shirt, eyeglasses, and appears to be gazing directly at the camera with a serious expression. He seems to be in a shaded area, likely under a structure like a dock or pavilion.\n\nIn the background, there is more activity evident. A few people can be seen engaging with each other on a wooden boardwalk, possibly working or discussing. In the very background, there are various boats moored in calm water adjacent to the dock area. One of the boats prominently has \"Miss Rachel V\" written on its side.\n\nThe setting suggests a sunny day, given the bright lighting and clear skies visible beyond the shaded area. Various maritime elements such as ropes, wooden planks, and water suggest the location could be a working dock or marina.\n\nTo the left in the foreground, a white bucket/pail is visible on the weathered wooden floor, and part of another individual is visible, suggesting the presence of others nearby outside of the frame. The laid-back and practical attire of the man suggests he might be involved in manual or outdoor work, possibly related to the boating activities in the background.","title":"One of the oystermen of Pointe a la Hache, idled because of a state health department ban on oyster fishing.
