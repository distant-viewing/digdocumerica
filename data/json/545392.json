{"path":"545392.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a large smokestack emitting a voluminous plume of dense, orange-pink smoke. The smoke blends into a similarly colored sky, suggesting a possible filter effect or the lighting condition emphasizing pollution. The smokestack is tall, with a ladder running up one side, indicating its industrial functionality.\n\nIn the foreground, there are silhouette-like outlines of industrial buildings, which appear to be constructed from corrugated metal, commonly used in factory buildings. These structures are characterized by their angular, sloped roofs and seem aged or weathered, adding to the gritty industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThere is a sense of depth created by the layering of the smokestack in the middle ground and the buildings in the foreground. The overall tone of the image is somewhat ominous and dramatic, underlining themes of industrial impact on the environment. The photograph is tinged with a reddish-pink hue, enhancing the visual impact and possibly symbolizing the pollutionâ€™s dangerous qualities.\n\nThe picture also shows signs of wear or age, with visible scratches and dust, suggesting that this is an analog photograph that has been physically preserved. This adds a historical or documentarian dimension to the image, indicating its potential use in discussions about environmental pollution and industrial practices.","title":"Red-orange color is characteristic of smoke from a steel plant.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["550905","545468","551054","550938","550172","547531","545507","545447","550333","550871","550176","545239","546884","550981","551026","551052"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","pollution","layering","scratch","smoke","dimension","ladder","tinge","symbolize","impact"]}
