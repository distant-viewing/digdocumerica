{"path":"543052.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene at sunset. The foreground is heavily covered with driftwood and other natural debris scattered across the sand, hinting at a recent storm or high tide. Various sizes and shapes of logs, branches, and entwined wood pieces create a textured layer over the beach. \n\nIn the midground, the beach stretches out towards the horizon with a smoother, clear sand surface leading to the water's edge where the waves gently meet the shore. There are two people in the center of the image, appearing small in the distance, walking along this part of the beach. They seem to be enjoying a tranquil stroll together, perhaps conversing or simply absorbing the peaceful atmosphere.\n\nThe background is defined by a calm sea meeting the sunset sky, soft gradients of orange and yellow light reflecting off the wet sand and water, enhancing the overall golden hue of the scene. On the far right, the coastline extends into a hilly point, and scattered off the shore are small, silhouette-like rocky formations or islets that punctuate the seascape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its vast textures of wood in the foreground leading to the open, expansive view, and the presence of people, evokes a sense of calm isolation and the natural beauty of a coastal environment.","title":"Timber-strewn beach near Trinidad","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543069","542890","544989","543054","543078","542889","557509","545111","543075","546953","548221","548757","543089","545194","546970","543287"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","sand","sunset","stroll","islet","shore","wood","meeting","driftwood","tide"]}
