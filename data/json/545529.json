{"path":"545529.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph presents a dramatic landscape primarily dominated by a large mining excavation site. In the foreground, a rough and rocky terrain is visible, scattered with various sized stones, pebbles, and some larger rocks. This area leads into a descending slope towards a central point where a small body of water has pooled, reflecting the light and surrounded by darker materials that could be indicative of mining residue or wet soil.\n\nThe middle ground of the picture shows steep, rugged sides of the quarry, where sections of exposed earth and layers of sediment are noticeable. These sections display a range of natural earthen colors from dark browns to lighter clay tones. \n\nIn the background, topping the edges of the excavation site, a few sparse trees and bushes can be observed, suggesting that the area was once more forested before being cleared for mining activities. The sky overhead is partly cloudy but mostly bright, hinting it might be a late afternoon or during a clearing after heavier weather.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a stark and somewhat desolate industrial setting, emphasizing the environmental impact of such activities. The absence of any human presence in the image further underscores the abandonment or isolation typical of exhausted mining areas.","title":"Effect of a strip mining operation off route 269 near Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["555622","555614","554804","555610","544139","554768","554815","552422","545534","545533","544418","555621","552427","554836","554769","543836"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","excavation","clay","quarry","residue","site","section","pebble","overhead","descend"]}
