{"path":"549360.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, elegant building with a classical architectural style along a tree-lined pathway. This three-story building features a symmetrical facade with numerous large windows, each framed with shutters. The second and third floors have arched windows that add an element of grandeur.\n\nThe building is constructed with light-colored stone or stucco, and dark shutters contrast nicely against the walls. The roof appears flat with a slightly raised ledge, typical of many formal, institutional buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a wide pathway leading towards and past the building. This path curves gently to the right in the image, providing a sense of depth. It is flanked by green, well-manicured lawns and shaped hedge rows add to the landscaped aesthetics. Along the pathway, there is a lamp post visible which hints at the pathway being well-maintained and functional for night-time use.\n\nThe environment includes mature trees that cast dappled shadows on the path, indicating either early morning or late afternoon sunlight. These trees, some of which lean over the path, contribute a peaceful, sheltered feeling to the scene.\n\nOverall, the scene is serene and picturesque, indicative of a well-maintained public or private estate, potentially dating back to the 19th or early 20th century given its architectural style. There is no human activity visible in the shot; it captures a quiet and tranquil moment.","title":"The center of marine research at the rovenj branch of the ruder boskovic institute","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["545870","558162","558146","546464","542593","546456","558155","557156","556046","546460","556182","546999","551263","558099","558159","557094"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["pathway","shutter","path","raised","stucco","hedge","estate","building","maintained","peaceful"]}
