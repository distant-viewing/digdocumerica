{"path":"552253.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat industrial and neglected riverside scene. In the forefront, the river's edge is cluttered with a variety of discarded concrete pipes and debris, partially submerged and strewn in a haphazard fashion. These concrete elements vary in size and shape, suggesting they might have been used in some type of construction or sewage projects.\n\nBeyond this immediate riverside chaos, there is a glimpse of more industrial activity. A large, orange locomotive stands prominently on tracks that run parallel to the riverbank. The train is stationary and positioned on a slight incline, suggesting it might be parked on a loading or maintenance track. \n\nThe background features industrial buildings with faded and aged appearances, and there are various utility poles and lines crisscrossing above. The sky is relatively clear with few clouds, indicating a sunny day, which casts sharp shadows and enhances the vivid colors within the scene, particularly the fiery orange of the train and the multi-tonal blues of the water. \n\nThis photograph reveals a stark contrast between natural waterways and the industrial impact on the environment, highlighted by the presence of industrial machinery and discarded infrastructure components.","title":"Culvert pipe and cables dumped as riprap (a haphazard sustaining wall to prevent erosion) on the edge of the Duwamish River","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["544699","548357","545988","546112","551603","550204","552254","547890","553393","551531","550673","553462","552070","551519","546785","547582"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["riverside","discard","train","track","locomotive","incline","chaos","loading","crisscross","strew"]}
