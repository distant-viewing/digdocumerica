{"path":"550920.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This image captures a serene beach scene. In the foreground, two women are sunbathing on beach towels, laid directly on the sand. One woman on the left wears a striped, possibly two-piece swimsuit, while the other, to the right, wears a bikini with a subtle floral pattern. They appear relaxed and possibly sunbathing, with neither of them interacting with the other.\n\nSlightly closer to the shore, a child stands in the water, facing towards the sea. The child sports a dark swim cap and a light-colored swimsuit. Behind the child, the ocean extends towards the horizon, its surface textured by gentle waves and the reflection of sunlight.\n\nDominating the background is a sailing boat with a vibrant red sail prominent against the blue expanse of the sea and sky. The visual contrast between the red sail and the surrounding blues enhances the sense of tranquility and leisure captured in the photograph.\n\nThe entire scene is enveloped in natural light, emphasizing the leisurely and calm atmosphere typical of a beach environment.","title":"Sunbathers, swimmer, sailboat--view from west beach on the gulf of mexico","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["553882","547935","557507","547507","550930","548624","550936","546397","547680","547009","547877","548541","545162","547503","551972","546768"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sunbathe","swimsuit","beach","sail","child","sea","bikini","towel","sailing","swim"]}
