{"path":"546003.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene by the water. In the foreground, a large pipeline supported by rust-covered pylons runs horizontally across the image. This pipeline is discharging a stream of liquid directly into the water below, stirring up white foam and agitating the otherwise calm blue water surface. The background features a flat horizon line, punctuated only by a few isolated structures and power lines in the distance, suggesting a rather isolated or industrial area by a large body of water, possibly a bay or estuary. The sky above is clear and bright, indicating good weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.","title":"Leak in pipeline that carries mined sulphur from lake gRande ecaille mine to port sulphur on the Mississippi river.
