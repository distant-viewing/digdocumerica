{"path":"544673.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil yet industrially touched landscape during either dawn or dusk, evident by the soft lighting and long shadows present. The image showcases a body of calm water on the left side, which takes up about one-fourth of the frame. Along the edges of the water, there's a significantly large runoff or waste deposit that appears textured and foamy, suggesting pollution or chemical residue.\n\nIn the foreground, a concrete-like pathway covered with textured waste leads into the image, bordered at its end by scrubby vegetation and small yellow flowers, which hint at some level of resilience in the environment. This pathway and the surrounding waste deposit occupy the majority of the frame, with their rough and gritty texture highlighted by the natural light.\n\nThe background is dominated by multiple high-voltage electricity pylons, representing human influence and technological infrastructure in an otherwise natural scene. These pylons, stretching across the horizon, create a stark contrast to the natural water and the polluted surroundings, adding a layer of complexity to the landscape's narrative. The horizon line is quite flat, marked only by these man-made structures, leading into a clear and seemingly unpolluted sky, which paradoxically caps off the scene marked by hints of environmental challenge.","title":"Final-stage sewage enters the bay from the Union Sanitary District biofiltration plant.","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["544695","545854","545167","551519","547539","558107","545988","551559","547485","545862","543006","544675","550368","543636","557234","550684"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pylon","waste","deposit","pathway","voltage","runoff","residue","electricity","mark","majority"]}
