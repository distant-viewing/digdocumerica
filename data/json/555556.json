{"path":"555556.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a dark and murky underwater scene, presumably in a cave or a similarly enclosed aquatic environment. The primary subjects of the photo are several fish, distinguishable by their elongated, pale bodies which contrast with the surrounding darkness. These fish are swimming in various directions, suggesting they are in a natural setting where they roam freely.\n\nIn the backdrop, the rocky textures of what appears to be a cave ceiling or side wall can be seen. These rocks are rugged and uneven, enhancing the sense of this being a subterranean water body. There's a lack of visible vegetation or other aquatic life forms in the immediate vicinity, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the fish and the stark, rocky surroundings.\n\nThe overall composition has a moody and mysterious aura, with the darkness amplifying the sense of depth and seclusion of the underwater cave setting. There is a slight illumination possibly from natural light sources or artificial ones, which highlights the fishes and part of the rocks, creating a glimmer effect on the surfaces. The low light condition contributes significantly to the ambiance and mood conveyed by the image.","title":"Dead fish were evident in a four mile stretch of the olentangy river, on june 20, 1974, when chemicals spilled into the river.
