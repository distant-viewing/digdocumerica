{"path":"551038.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and industrially tinged river scene. In the foreground, there is a dock area where two individuals, clothed in work attire, are seen engaged in conversation or examining the area. The dock is equipped with various utility devices and a long walkway that has yellow safety markings along the edges.\n\nThe central focus of the image is a large barge carrying mounds of coal. The barge is prominently positioned in the middle of the river and includes a small control hut on top, suggesting that it's actively managed. The barge, coupled with the presence of the workers, implies a strong industrial activity, likely related to the transportation or loading of materials.\n\nIn the background, the river is bordered by densely wooded hills, creating a natural and lush perimeter that contrasts with the industrial foreground. The hills are shrouded in a haze, giving depth to the scene and highlighting the mix of natural beauty with human industrial endeavor. The overall atmosphere is calm, yet underscored by the purposeful activity taking place at the dock. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the entire scene, enhancing the tranquil yet working nature of the environment.","title":"A Coalburg tug and eight coal barges go downstream through the London locks, one of three lock systems on the Kanawha River.
