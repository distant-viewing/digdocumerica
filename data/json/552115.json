{"path":"552115.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"In this photograph, two young men appear to be engaged in manual labor on a small boat. The setting includes a river with muddy brown water, suggestive of a rural or natural environment. Both individuals seem focused on their task.\n\nThe man on the left is shown bent over, shirtless, displaying his bare back. He wears dark jeans held up with a belt and is barefoot. His posture suggests he might be pulling or adjusting something inside the boat.\n\nThe man on the right is also bending over, wearing a white t-shirt and dark trousers, also barefoot. He seems to be dealing with a fishnet, pulling it or gathering it into the boat.\n\nOn the boat, there are several objects visible: fishing rods, a small can, and a container, possibly for bait or caught fish. The sides of the boat show signs of wear and utility, emphasizing a functional, possibly recreational or subsistence fishing context.\n\nThe background is mostly the water of the river, with no other boats or people visible, highlighting the isolation or privacy of these two individuals in their endeavor. The lighting and shadow imply that this is taken during daylight, possibly under strong sunlight, contributing to the warm, gritty feel of the scene.","title":"Warren freeman, 50, built a cottage on an island in the Kansas river.
