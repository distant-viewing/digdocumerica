{"path":"550288.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene by the sea. The sun appears as a brilliant, glowing orb just above the horizon, casting a vibrant pathway of light across the water's surface. Above the sun, the sky is adorned with multiple layers of clouds varying in thickness and texture, showing a rich gradient of oranges and yellows blending into darker tones.\n\nIn the foreground and central focus of the image, two silhouette figures are seen walking along a narrow strip that extends into the water, perhaps a shallow sandbar or a jetty. The figures appear engaged in a leisurely walk, moving parallel to each other across this strip. Their silhouettes contribute to the tranquil and picturesque nature of the scene.\n\nThe background on the left side of the image shows a landmass with a silhouette of thick vegetation or trees, contributing to the sense of a secluded natural spot.  The overall composition, with its contrasting elements of dark silhouettes against the luminous sky and water, creates a peaceful, almost poetic visual narrative. The scene evokes a sense of calm and reflects the tranquility often found alongside natural water bodies at sundown.","title":"Polluted Lake Erie is lovely in the sunset.
