{"path":"543528.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene focused on a large tree trunk to the left, with a vivid blue lake stretching out in the background. Attached to the trunk of the tree is a yellow and white \"For Sale\" sign that reads “FOR SALE, ASA M. CLARK, Jr., Realtor, 135 W. Lake Blvd., Tahoe City, (916) 583-4142, Call ED SHERMAN”. The tree is surrounded by its own sparse pine branches, and through these branches, the clear, calm lake can be seen stretching across the entire backdrop. The lighting suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, casting deep hues over the water, and no other man-made structures or people are visible in this tranquil natural setting.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552988","543556","543557","554133","543115","557556","543100","545049","551207","551962","557553","549039","543101","543547","554529","555702"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sale","trunk","branch","lake","tree","afternoon","morning","hue","left","sign"]}
