{"path":"547266.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an area severely affected by flooding. A murky, brown water covers what appears to be a marina or dock area for boating. Several boats and houseboats are seen floating amidst the flood water; their usual docking areas are submerged, indicating the high water level.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there's a two-story building that seems to be a waterfront property or business, partially surrounded by the floodwaters but still standing on dry land. Various smaller structures and debris are scattered around the building, surrounded by the flood. Several leafless trees are also visible, stripped of foliage, likely indicating that the photo was taken in a cooler season or after the leaves have been washed away possibly due to the severity of the flooding.\n\nIn the background, a roadway with guardrails runs parallel to the flooded area, elevated above the level of the inundation, suggesting it's a bridge or an elevated highway. The terrain around the flooded area is a mix of barren land and sparse vegetation, indicating a lack of dense development, which could be either due to the season or the natural environment in the area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo captures a scene of disaster with dilapidated structures and watercraft stranded by the high water levels, providing a stark visualization of the impact of severe flooding.","title":"Power boats moored on the Anacostia River.
