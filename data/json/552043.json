{"path":"552043.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of urban decay juxtaposed against elements of a city's infrastructure. In the foreground, there's a pile of rusted and twisted metal debris scattered across an overgrown field of grass and weeds. The metal pieces, which appear to be remnants of cars or machinery, are rusted and weather-worn, suggesting they have been discarded in this location for a long time.\n\nIn the background, the elevated roads of a highway system dominate the upper part of the image. The highway's massive concrete pillars stretch vertically, supporting the long, wide expanse of the road overhead. This structure conveys a strong sense of industrial strength and urban development.\n\nFarther in the background, various urban buildings can be seen, including what looks like a parking garage and several nondescript mid-rise office buildings. The skyline is relatively low and spread out, typical of many mid-sized American cities. The clarity and brightness of the sky suggest the photograph was taken on a clear, sunny day, which contrasts sharply with the abandoned and neglected condition of the foreground. \n\nOverall, the composition of this image highlights a stark contrast between the engineered durability of the highway and the transient, decaying nature of discarded industrial materials. It creates a narrative around urban growth and decay, suggesting reflections on environmental issues and the lifecycle of manufactured objects.","title":"Buffalo skyway near downtown section of city passes over a scrap metal dump.","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["552044","549638","549958","557283","551521","545851","558084","545146","543687","549782","549307","549773","542585","554346","546400","552072"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["highway","decay","discard","lifecycle","strength","engineer","manufacture","weed","city","pillar"]}
