{"path":"553904.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a young man sitting at a workbench outside, surrounded by industrial elements. The man has shoulder-length wavy blond hair and wears a light gray work shirt with a name tag labeled \"Mark.\" He is dressed in dark green pants and seems to have a somewhat serious or contemplative expression.\n\nOn the workbench in front of him, there are piles of various disassembled electronic components and scrap parts, possibly from vehicles or machinery. The background features a large open bay of an industrial building with a vintage car parked inside, and another darker facility can be seen in the distance. Clear skies with a few clouds and some visible industrial smoke or steam contribute to the sceneâ€™s industrial ambiance.\n\nOverall, the image has a vintage feel, reflective of an earlier era's work environment, focusing on manual labor and materials repurposing or recycling. The setting hints at a sort of recycling plant or a similar industrial operation.","title":"An employee of the Logan-long recycling plant in franklin demonstrates recyclable products from the community's solid wastes.
