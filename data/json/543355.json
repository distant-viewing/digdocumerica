{"path":"543355.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, multi-storied house perched precariously on a rugged cliffside. The building has a dark, weathered exterior with features that include multiple balconies, a turret, and a complex, steeply pitched roof. The architecture suggests a blend of rustic and Victorian styles.\n\nThe cliff on which the house is situated appears very steep and is composed of dark, jagged rocks. White-capped waves crash against the base of the cliff, suggesting a dynamic and potentially noisy environment influenced by the ocean.\n\nAbove the cliff, there is a hint of a road indicating some access to the area, though it seems quite isolated. The natural environment around the house is harsh, with little vegetation visible on the rocky surfaces. The top left portion of the image shows a slight touch of greenery, perhaps small bushes or trees, indicating some vegetation on or near the cliff.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of isolation and dramatic interaction between human construction and the natural elements of the rocky coastline and the tumultuous sea.","title":"California -- between Monterey and Big Sur","placename":"Monterey County (Calif.)","location":"Monterey County, California","nn1":["551963","554823","543334","543336","547149","543340","547119","543437","543291","543426","545110","547118","543242","543249","547030","543337"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["cliff","house","turret","balcony","coastline","access","exterior","base","vegetation","bush"]}
