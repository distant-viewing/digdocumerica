{"path":"547156.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features a rugged scene at sea, showcasing a large, sturdy boat battling against choppy ocean waves. The boat is predominantly red and black, with the words \"AMERICAN SHIP NO 1\" prominently displayed in white on its side. A lone person, likely a crew member, stands confidently on the deck at the stern of the boat. The individual is wearing a dark jacket and a safety helmet, reflecting a preparedness for the harsh maritime conditions.\n\nThe water around the boat is turbulent, with white foam indicating strong waves and possibly windy weather. The overall lighting in the image suggests it might be either early morning or late evening, given the dim and moody blue tones. The ocean water and the boat occupy most of the frame, emphasizing the sea's rough texture against the solidity and preparedness of the boat and its crew. The photograph captures a moment of solitary human endeavor within the vastness and wildness of the natural environment.","title":"Tug-boat on calumet river","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547694","547461","544234","555802","547559","547452","547456","550891","549395","545179","546040","545056","549618","547558","545057","549617"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","preparedness","crew","wave","wildness","sea","stern","endeavor","member","foam"]}
