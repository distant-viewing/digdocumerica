{"path":"558049.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph offers an aerial view of a complex network of highways and bridges over a forested area. The central focus is an intersection of multiple roads and bridges. Two primary bridges span across what appears to be a valley or a significant drop, surrounded by lush greenery that indicates a forest or rural setting. These bridges connect various sections of highways that intertwine with each other.\n\nOn the left side of the image, one can see a bridge that supports a road passing over another highway beneath it. There are several vehicles visible on these roads, suggesting moderate traffic. The highways are composed of multiple lanes, likely facilitating both directions of traffic.\n\nThe topography of the surrounding area is diverse. On the right, the terrain is relatively flat with wide-open fields, either agricultural or undeveloped land. The horizon shows a continuation of this flat terrain interspersed with patches of forest, extending into the distance.\n\nThe backdrop of the photograph features a clear sky with a few scattered clouds, adding a sense of depth and vastness to the aerial perspective.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the intersection of human-made infrastructure with natural landscapes, showcasing a blend of engineering and environmental elements. The photo could be indicative of a suburban or semi-rural area where infrastructure is developed enough to support complex road systems while still being close to natural surroundings.","title":"Aerial view looking northeast at the Ohio Turnpike of the 1950's and the interstate of the 1960's as the highways cross the Cuyahoga Valley north of Peninsula, Ohio, near Cleveland. The valley is part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area signed into law in December, 1975. It is located within a 20-mile stretch of land between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron. The National Park Service must complete a master plan for the area by June, 1976.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["558051","546588","558048","548401","546733","546581","558050","546721","551205","546722","553947","546569","546718","555745","558055","548418"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","highway","intersection","road","traffic","drop","span","continuation","infrastructure","forest"]}
