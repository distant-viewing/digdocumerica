{"path":"554041.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a foreground dominated by two large, rusted metal pipes lying on a dirt terrain, leading the viewer's eye toward a distant coastal scene. The pipes, which show significant signs of wear and corrosion, are parallel to each other and recede into the distance. The terrain is rough and sandy, scattered with small rocks and tracks that indicate recent activity, perhaps related to construction or industrial operations.\n\nIn the background, the composition opens up to a picturesque coastal view under a bright, clear sky scattered with light clouds. The sea is calm and glimmers under the sunlight. To the left, a mountain range can be seen fading into the haze, enhancing the depth of the scene. On the right, the coastline is protected by a rocky breakwater, beyond which the sea stretches out towards the horizon. The overall scene contrasts the industrial foreground with the natural beauty of the coastal landscape, creating a juxtaposition between human activity and natural serenity. The lighting suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, giving the scene a warm, golden tone.","title":"Pipes and apparatus used in dredging for the pukoo development site","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["543257","544705","547497","546393","544976","543160","543170","543405","546402","557510","543298","545277","543359","545615","547578","552192"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["pipe","glimmer","corrosion","breakwater","sea","serenity","recede","protect","open","terrain"]}
