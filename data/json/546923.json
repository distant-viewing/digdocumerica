{"path":"546923.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of an industrial facility, possibly a factory or a power plant. The main feature of the image is several large, cylindrical machines that dominate the space. These cylinders are likely to be some form of industrial rollers or drums, and they are mounted on heavy machinery platforms equipped with various mechanical components such as motors, piping, and gauges.\n\nEach cylinder is covered in a black material that looks worn and possibly rubberized, suggesting they may be involved in processing or fabrication that requires heavy, robust equipment. The cylinders are of different sizes but generally large, suggesting they handle a significant volume or mass.\n\nIn the environment around the cylinders, the floor is littered with industrial debris including hoses, tools, and small pieces of machinery, reflecting active usage of the space. Metal stairs and railings suggest accessibility to different levels of equipment for maintenance or operational purposes.\n\nThe surrounding structure of the facility includes brick walls and large windows, typical of older industrial buildings. The ceiling is lined with fluorescent lights, providing illumination to the workspace. \n\nThis setting is indicative of heavy industry, where large-scale machinery is used for manufacturing, processing, or power generation. The absence of visible workers at the moment of capture adds a static, almost eerie quality to the scene, focusing attention solely on the machines and the industrial architecture.","title":"From sludge to landfill-the final step in sewage treatment takes place in these vats at the Back River Sewage Treatment Plant.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["543158","543997","552003","556388","544818","544026","546757","558371","557387","558365","547964","544153","544045","557388","556386","556389"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["cylinder","machinery","machine","processing","power","roller","gauge","generation","drum","mass"]}
