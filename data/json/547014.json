{"path":"547014.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by a large factory complex in the background. This factory features multiple tall structures including silos and smokestacks from which thick white and gray smoke is billowing, contributing to an overcast sky, possibly indicating heavy industrial activity or pollution.\n\nIn the foreground, a railway track runs parallel across the frame. Positioned on these tracks are several flatbed train cars. Some of these cars are loaded with large logs, neatly stacked and prepared for processing or transport.\n\nTo the left of the image, a sign is visible. It is a warning or prohibitory sign which states \"UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL FORBIDDEN TRESPASSERS PROSECUTED\", indicating restricted access to the area, likely due to safety concerns or private ownership.\n\nAlso noticeable in the foreground are pieces of industrial equipment, which include cranes and conveyor belts, implying that the facility is involved in heavy material handling and processing.\n\nThe overall composition and elements in the image depict a busy industrial setting, possibly a paper mill or a lumber processing plant, with an emphasis on heavy machinery and environmental impact.","title":"The Brunswick pulp and paper plant","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["545244","550716","546236","545503","555564","545256","554632","555165","543005","550974","542999","543749","545445","550343","545434","545236"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["processing","factory","ownership","track","restrict","flatbed","lumber","warning","conveyor","mill"]}
