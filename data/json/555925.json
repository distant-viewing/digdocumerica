{"path":"555925.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant urban scene focused on an elevated train track in what appears to be an American city. Viewed from an elevated perspective, likely from another section of the train platform or an adjacent building, the image provides a comprehensive look at both the bustling street below and the train tracks running parallel.\n\nTo the right, the elevated train tracks extend into the distance, marked by metallic rails and wooden ties. They are devoid of a train, exposing their rigid, linear structure. Sturdy metal support columns rise from the street to hold the tracks aloft.\n\nOn the left, the street runs alongside the tracks, lively with pedestrian activity. A small group of children can be seen playing in the street, their figures casting long shadows due to the bright overhead sun, which suggests a midday time. They are likely engaged in a game or merely hanging out, bringing a sense of community and everyday life to the scene. A few other pedestrians are visible on the sidewalks, walking or possibly watching the children play.\n\nThe surroundings are lined with two- to three-story buildings, characteristic of residential neighborhoods with mixed-use commercial properties on the ground levels. Signage on one of the buildings is partially visible, hinting at local businesses but not fully readable due to the angle and lighting.\n\nThe overall composition is rich with urban textures, from the rugged textures of the street and buildings to the sleek metallic sheen of the train tracks. Light and shadow play a pivotal role in giving depth and contrast to the scene, emphasizing the vertical and horizontal lines of the urban landscape. The distant view shows silhouetted building outlines against a clear sky, implying the expanse of the city beyond what is immediately visible.","title":"Brooklyn's Bushwick Avenue seen from an elevated train platform in New York City. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers, and tract homes. It is populated by Blacks, Latins, and the white poor. Brooklyn remains one of America's best surviving examples of a 19th century city.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555890","548474","550012","550022","555927","548479","556076","556692","556841","556853","555930","556202","546700","556075","547580","556021"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["train","track","street","pedestrian","building","child","sheen","city","game","midday"]}
