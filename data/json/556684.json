{"path":"556684.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling indoor scene, likely taken from an elevated perspective, looking down upon a spacious hall or lobby. The large hall is filled with numerous people, appearing to take part in a variety of activities. Most prominently, a dense crowd gathers in the center, possibly focused around an event or display that is not clearly visible in the image. The ambient lighting is dim, contributing to a moody atmosphere, with brighter illumination emanating from some commercial establishments around the edge of the space.\n\nSignage indicates the presence of a \"Chase Manhattan Bank,\" highlighted with its logo, clearly visible in two locations within the establishment. This suggests that the photograph may have been taken in a transportation hub such as a train station or airport where such banking facilities and mixed commercial areas are common.\n\nThe crowd consists of numerous individuals, mostly standing and facing towards the center where the main activity seems concentrated. Various people on the outskirts of the crowd are going about their business, crossing the hall or engaged in small groups.\n\nThe upper parts of the image show partial views of light fixtures and possibly digital boards, suggesting a modern, somewhat industrial setting. Given the composition and elements like signage and gathered crowd, the location likely serves a functional role catering to the needs of travelers or daily commuters.","title":"Passengers buying tickets (background) at Pennsylvania Station in New York City","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556825","556680","556054","556679","556674","548268","556018","551798","556829","556686","556056","556049","553311","556069","556828","551879"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["hall","crowd","establishment","gather","cater","traveler","commuter","airport","emanate","fixture"]}
