{"path":"542773.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a dense forest with considerable tree diversity. The forest appears to be a coniferous type, with tall trees showing rough bark textures. The ground is covered with a mix of pine needles, small branches, and some freshly cut tree trunks and stumps, indicating recent logging or tree management activities.\n\nIn the foreground, a person, dressed in worker attire including a helmet, is engaged in sawing through a log using a chainsaw. The person is bent over their task, focusing intently on cutting the wood cleanly. Their outfit suggests safety and practicality, likely designed to protect them from the hazards of such work.\n\nThe background is less focused but shows a continuation of the forest with more trees standing upright and a few scattered on the ground. The overall lighting of the photo indicates either an overcast day or a setting where the dense foliage high above filters much of the sunlight, casting a diffuse and soft light across the scene. This setting emphasizes a natural and rugged outdoor workspace, highlighting elements of forestry management or logging in a wilderness setting.","title":"D.Jackson felling red fir tree","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["553602","542769","542770","553601","553604","542771","542786","542788","542787","555472","553608","542785","542623","554415","553599","554414"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","forest","management","cut","chainsaw","outfin","practicality","hazard","tree","continuation"]}
