{"path":"554340.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features a close-up profile view of a man looking to the left side of the frame. His facial features, such as his prominent nose, thick eyebrows, and the texture of his skin, are well-defined under warm, low lighting that appears to originate from the front-left side. He has short, dark hair and a small earring visible in his left ear. The man is wearing a dark, possibly textured jacket or coat that blends into the dark, indistinct background.\n\nThe lighting accentuates the contours and details of his face, creating a somewhat dramatic and introspective mood. The background is uniformly dark and featureless, ensuring that all attention is focused on the man's face. The composition uses a shallow depth of field, which softly blurs the manâ€™s ear and the back of his head, further emphasizing his facial profile and expression.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides an intimate and somewhat introspective portrayal of the man, drawing attention to his thoughtful or contemplative demeanor.","title":"Participant in a citizens' forum held in Midtown Manhattan to discuss transportation problems and clean air strategies for New York City proposed by EPA's regional office.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556443","557035","553055","557034","554341","543701","556452","557033","557032","556563","557648","547282","552103","543713","552872","548218"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Portrait"],"terms":["ear","profile","man","earring","face","nose","portrayal","attention","skin","demeanor"]}
