{"path":"544915.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The image shows a close-up of a rock surface that features several carved or etched symbols and letters. The texture of the rock appears rough and uneven, with variations in color ranging from reddish-brown to darker brown tones, suggesting it might be sandstone or a similar type of rock. The carvings include some capital letters organized in vertical alignments such as \"TN\" and \"SU ELI\" as well as some shapes that could be interpreted as simple geometric designs or boxes.\n\nThe symbols and letters are spaced irregularly across the surface of the rock, and they are carved with varying depths and clarity, giving a handmade and ancient appearance. No other objects or background elements are visible, focusing all attention on the carvings themselves. There is a natural, rugged quality to the image, emphasized by the primitive form of the markings, which might suggest historical, archaeological, or cultural significance.","title":"Modern graffiti carved into rock near Cliff Palace","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545686","557117","545679","554172","545682","545675","557118","545683","545608","545687","545671","542915","544907","554410","550474","543151"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Religious Imagery"],"terms":["carving","letter","rock","symbol","alignment","capital","close","marking","significance","variation"]}
