{"path":"556187.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph depicts a middle-aged man operating a heavy construction vehicle. The man is wearing a dark jacket, black pants, and a yellow hard hat with clear protective goggles raised onto the top of the hat. He appears to be focused on his work, looking slightly downward with a serious expression.\n\nThe operator is seated inside the cab of the construction vehicle, which is primarily yellow. Part of the vehicle's large, ridged wheel is visible in the lower right of the photo. The door of the cab is open, suggesting either the vehicle is stationary or perhaps the photo was taken just as the operator was about to disembark or had just entered.\n\nIn the background, the upper part of a building with a muted brown color can be seen, providing context that the setting is likely an urban construction site.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of everyday work, focusing on the individual's role within a larger construction or industrial environment. The lighting and quality suggest it might have been taken in natural daylight, and the image has a candid, unposed quality to it.","title":"Black street worker in Chicago.
