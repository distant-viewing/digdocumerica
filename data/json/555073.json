{"path":"555073.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures the powerful and tranquil scenery of a waterfall surrounded by lush vegetation. The waterfall descends through a narrow opening between two large, moss-covered rock formations. The water cascades down in a smooth, silky flow, creating a misty atmosphere at the point where the water crashes into the basin below.\n\nThe overall environment is quite shadowy and moody, suggesting that the location might be within a densely wooded area, where sunlight only partially penetrates through the tree canopy. The moss on the rocks is vividly green, contrasting with the darker shadows and the white of the waterfall. The upper part of the image shows the waterfall beginning its descent, obscured somewhat by darkness, emphasizing the depth of the crevice through which the water flows.\n\nThe fine mist generated by the waterfall adds a layer of softness to the image, muting the underlying details of the rock and water interaction. The predominant colors in this scene are shades of dark green and grey, with the bright white of the water drawing the eye along its journey downwards. The composition conveys a serene yet dynamic natural landscape, emphasizing the textures and the interplay of light and shadow. \n\nThere are no human or human-made elements visible; the focus is entirely on the natural elements and the inherent beauty of this secluded spot.","title":"Waterfall into Lake Crescent, Washington, in the Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545839","545878","554408","558087","557820","555210","554113","554409","545874","555220","550697","555074","550979","542594","550843","544344"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["waterfall","moss","white","rock","descent","water","softness","basin","crevice","dark"]}
