{"path":"546118.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape at what appears to be either dusk or dawn, given the dim, ambient lighting. The scene is a factory or plant consisting of several large structures including towering smokestacks, some of which are emitting smoke or steam. Large, cylindrical storage tanks are visible, suggesting that this might be a chemical or petrochemical facility.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a calm body of water which reflects the industrial structures dimly in the low light. Along the edges of the water, there is vegetation, possibly wetland plants, enhancing the contrast between nature and the industrial setting. On the right-hand side of the image, against this water body, an old, wooden structure (likely a dock or platform) can be seen. It looks worn and partially dilapidated, adding a somewhat rustic or abandoned feel to the portion of the scene.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph is slightly moody and serene, with natural elements in the foreground softly blending into the harsh structural lines of the industrial backdrop. This juxtaposition likely invites reflection on the interplay between industry and nature.","title":"Sunrise over the Olin-Mathieson plant on the Calcasieu River","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["545996","547702","552194","552210","548070","552041","544173","543004","544293","546974","544179","551156","557225","547539","544328","557376"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["plant","wetland","steam","dawn","smokestack","platform","factory","dock","industry","interplay"]}
