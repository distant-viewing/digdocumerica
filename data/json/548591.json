{"path":"548591.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts a severe wildfire consuming a forested landscape. In the foreground, there is a line of intense flames visibly engulfing the trees and underbrush on the slope of a hill. The hillside, colored in browns and patches of green where the vegetation has not yet been consumed, slopes upwards from the left to the right.\n\nThick, ominous smoke rises and spreads across the entire scene, dominating the background with a greyish-brown haze that obscures the sky and distant landscape. The smoke's overwhelming presence indicates the scale and intensity of the fire. Only a few trees, still unburnt, stand out against the smoky backdrop, with their green foliage providing a sharp contrast to the fiery red and orange hues of the flames.\n\nThe atmosphere captured in the image conveys a sense of destruction and urgency, highlighting the force and unpredictability of natural wildfires. There are no visible human figures or artificial structures, suggesting a remote or natural setting possibly away from populated areas. The overall composition of the photograph, with its engulfing smoke and advancing line of fire, strongly emphasizes the theme of nature's uncontrollable power.","title":"Forest fire in the Everglades, Collier County. Fires are fairly common in the Everglades in dry seasons or dry years. 1973 was not dry, however, and there have been reports that the condition was caused by drainage of the land for commercial development.","placename":"Marco Island (Fla. : Island)","location":"Marco Island, Florida","nn1":["553843","548597","555156","555157","553128","548590","555113","548592","547728","548595","553560","557577","542712","553561","548593","542598"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["consume","wildfire","engulf","flame","smoke","fire","slope","underbrush","urgency","destruction"]}
