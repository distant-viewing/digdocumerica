{"path":"546251.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling landfill site with significant activity and equipment engaged in waste management. In the foreground, a large bulldozer, colored beige, is maneuvering through a mound of dirt. The operator, visible in the open cabin, is steering the vehicle which is pushing dirt or possibly covering waste. The middle ground of the photo reveals a vast accumulation of refuse. Various materials such as papers, plastics, and other debris are scattered extensively across the site. In the background, another piece of heavy machinery is visible atop a dirt mound, appearing to be compacting or moving the accumulated waste. Additionally, one person can be spotted standing near this machine, likely overseeing the operation or preparing to engage in another task.\n\nThe setting is an open, expansive area dedicated to waste disposal, bounded by piles of earth created to manage and contain the waste. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting either early or mid-day light conditions which illuminate the scene adequately for the operations to be conducted effectively. This image highlights the scale and the mechanical efforts involved in managing landfill operations, showcasing the substantial human and mechanical resources required to handle urban waste effectively.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
