{"path":"542951.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures two horses in motion, portrayed with a unique, almost ethereal effect. The horses appear to be running, their forms blurred and melding together, creating a dynamic sense of movement. The blurring technique gives the image a dreamlike quality, emphasizing motion and fluidity.\n\nThe coloring of the image is vibrant yet muted, predominated by deep oranges and soft blues, creating a contrast that suggests the time could be either dawn or dusk. The background is indistinct, contributing to the overall abstract feel of the composition. This artistic approach enhances the mystical and majestic aura of the horses and evokes a sense of raw, natural energy.\n\nThe lighting and the motion blur technique used in the photograph contribute significantly to its artistic impact, creating an image that is more about capturing the essence and spirit of the horses rather than a clear, detailed depiction.","title":"Horses gallop aLong Beach","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["552671","543694","542972","547002","542619","544414","543675","542956","543071","542800","551229","557186","542966","542622","544309","542806"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["horse","technique","motion","dreamlike","predominate","meld","fluidity","spirit","aura","coloring"]}
