{"path":"543567.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph shows an underwater view featuring a single brightly colored fish captured against a deep blue backdrop of water. The fish, which appears quite streamlined, has a narrow and elongated body with shades of light and dark blue speckled on its skin. Its prominent fins are white and are visible along its tail and the lower body. The photograph provides a clear view of the fish swimming in its natural habitat, emphasizing the grace and the seemingly effortless glide of the fish through the water. This sense of motion is captured amidst the tranquility of the underwater environment. The background is relatively uniform, suggesting the depth of the water, and there are minimal disturbances in the clarity of the water around the fish. The lighting in the image highlights the reflective surfaces of the fish's body, enhancing its sleekness and the distinct textures of its scales.","title":"S.
