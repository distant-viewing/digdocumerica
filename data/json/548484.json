{"path":"548484.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a surreal and striking moment where a large airplane appears in close proximity to a residential street. The airplane, positioned in the upper portion of the frame, is angled as if in mid-descent, dominating the sky above. It is a commercial jet, detailed with visible undercarriage and flight control surfaces.\n\nThe setting below contrasts sharply with the modernity of the aircraft, featuring a serene, tree-lined neighborhood. The street is bordered by traditional Victorian-style homes, characterized by their ornate architectural details, bay windows, and multiple stories. These houses are painted in subtle, likely faded colors, which suggest a sense of historical preservation.\n\nOn the ground, a car is parked on the shady street, hinting at everyday residential life undisturbed by the looming presence of the airplane overhead. Leafless and semi-leafy trees are scattered along the sidewalk, and the sky is clear with a soft texture of sparse clouds, emphasizing the unexpected nature of the aircraft in such a tranquil urban scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph juxtaposes the ordinary calm of a residential area with the dynamic interruption of a jet plane, capturing a thought-provoking and visually arresting moment.","title":"Jet zooms over southwestern side of neptune road","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548448","548485","548446","550156","553888","548469","548486","548447","550160","548481","544606","544963","546178","548445","547824","544491"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","jet","aircraft","street","undistur","undercarriage","interruption","surreal","modernity","provoke"]}
