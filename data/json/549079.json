{"path":"549079.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at what appears to be a border or checkpoint, likely in a warmer climate given the presence of palm trees. The focus of the image is on a large, red mesh bag filled with onions, prominently marked \"Treasure Valley, Idaho Oregon U.S. No. 1 Spanish Onions.\" This bag is being carried by a person wearing a red and blue shirt, only partially visible on the left side of the frame.\n\nThe background shows a group of people, mostly men, queued in a line extending towards a gate that is being guarded by officials. These individuals vary in attire but predominantly wear casual, warm-weather clothing. Many are carrying bags or personal belongings, suggesting they might be migrant workers or travelers. To the right, a forklift is visible, indicating that the area might be used for transporting goods as well as movement of people.\n\nThe setting is a paved area with a clear sky, with the harsh daylight suggesting midday. The atmosphere portrays a blend of everyday labor-related activity and regulated mobility, typical of a controlled transit area.","title":"It's back to mexico for these farm workers who were picked up by the border patrol at calexico for illegal entry.
