{"path":"543502.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph portrays a historic scene featuring a damaged brick structure and a commemorative plaque mounted on a stone structure. \n\nOn the left of the image, a stone memorial appears with a bronze plaque that provides information on James Stuart Cain. The plaque is flanked by three cylindrical objects on top of the stone structure, possibly symbolic or ornamental elements. The text on the plaque is centered and details significant biographical and historical contributions of James Stuart Cain, indicating its purpose as a historical marker.\n\nTo the right, there is a segment of a crumbling brick wall with partial plaster remnants. Integral to this wall is a well-preserved wooden door, featuring intricate carvings and a circular design element both at the center and top, suggesting a once-elegant entrance. The door has a distinct antique look, with weather-worn textures and a robust appearance that contrasts sharply with the dilapidated state of the brick wall around it.\n\nThe background comprises a clear sky and sparse vegetation typical of a desert or arid landscape, which underscores the overall abandoned and isolated feel of the setting. The bright sunlight casts shadows and highlights the textures of the stone, brick, and wood materials present in the scene, enhancing the historical ambiance and visual interest of the photograph.","title":"\"ghost\" town","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543345","543344","552498","545355","545821","558010","552681","553478","552511","546971","543339","551330","557347","544945","552964","554707"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["plaque","brick","stone","wall","crumble","plaster","bronze","carving","door","marker"]}
