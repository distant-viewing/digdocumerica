{"path":"547385.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an elderly woman standing outdoors during daytime. She appears joyful and is smiling. The woman, whose demeanor exudes a robust yet friendly countenance, is holding various gardening toolsâ€”a shovel and what appears to be a large dirt rake or hoe. Along with these, she grips something reminiscent of a sickle, reinforcing the connection to traditional gardening or farming.\n\nShe is dressed in a practical yet somewhat formal manner for outdoor work: wearing a long, light green coat and a patterned headscarf, paired with a predominantly green and white color scheme that somewhat camouflages with the vegetation in the background. Hanging from her shoulder is a black handbag, indicating she might be engaged in light travel or running errands.\n\nThe background is verdant, suggesting a lush, possibly private garden or a well-maintained park. There are suggestions of other people milling about in the distant background, perhaps at a public gathering or community event related to gardening or farming.\n\nThe lighting and composition suggest the photograph was taken on a sunny day, casting natural light that highlights the subject's face and the textures of the tools and clothing. The overall atmosphere of the image is cheerful and active, capturing a moment of pride or satisfaction in the elderly woman's outdoor activities.","title":"Farm wife with wares at a saturday auction near hickman","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["554051","543853","547281","552398","547086","555530","557172","552401","547372","551701","556487","543864","549298","557113","547741","551439"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["gardening","farming","tool","rake","suggestion","woman","pride","handbag","camouflage","headscarf"]}
