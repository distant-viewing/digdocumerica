{"path":"549320.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and bustling public event, filled with numerous people of various ages and backgrounds, all gathered outdoors. It seems to be a daytime event based on the clear visibility and natural lighting.\n\nThe central focus of the image is a man dressed in a bright red jacket and white cap, who appears to be placing a hat on the head of a young child dressed in a red uniform-like outfit akin to either a band or scout uniform. The child looks delighted, standing next to another young boy who is wearing a plaid shirt. The man in the red jacket seems to be engaging actively with these children, suggesting a kind and friendly interaction.\n\nIn the background, a dense crowd of people can be seen. These people display a variety of fashion styles that suggest the era might be from the late 20th century. The crowd includes individuals dressed in light spring or summer attire, such as t-shirts, light jackets, and patterned blouses. The atmosphere seems festive and casual, indicated by the presence of balloons and what may be banners or flags in the far background, hinting at a celebratory occasion like a festival, community gathering, or public celebration.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo with its crowded backdrop and foreground interaction portrays a lively social scene, filled with interaction and community engagement. The setting is outdoors, likely on a street or in a public park area near a water body, as hinted by the brightness and open space around.","title":"Memorial day holiday crowd at battery park on the lower tip of Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543482","553142","546821","551811","551810","558294","551688","558295","551689","553287","558292","553322","553311","553264","551852","551011"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["child","jacket","crowd","uniform","scout","interaction","gather","balloon","event","festival"]}
