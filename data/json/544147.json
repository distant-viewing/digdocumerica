{"path":"544147.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph presents a vast, arid landscape dominated by a large mobile home community in the foreground, set against a backdrop of rugged mountainous terrain. The mobile home park consists of densely packed trailers and RVs, many appearing to be permanent or semi-permanent fixtures with smaller structures or attachments visible.\n\nThe scene is captured from an elevated vantage point, providing a comprehensive view of the mobile home park which is spread horizontally across the image. The park is surrounded by sparse desert vegetation and sandy earth, typical of rugged desert environments.\n\nBeyond the mobile home community, the landscape opens up into a broad valley scattered with low-lying bushes and sparse vegetation, leading the eye to the mountain range in the distance. These mountains rise starkly against the sky, with their ridges and contours clearly defined.\n\nPower lines and electricity towers are prominent, crisscrossing the mid-ground of the image. These towers and lines are especially noticeable due to their large scale and the way they contrast with the natural environment.\n\nThe overall color palette is saturated with purples and blues, giving the image a somewhat surreal or dramatic tone. This, combined with the clarity of the air and the starkness of the landscape, suggests a harsh, sunlit day in a deserted or sparsely populated region.","title":"Trailer court","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["557339","544816","556468","544149","544118","548762","556417","556476","558296","544633","558300","556455","544400","553130","546756","544146"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["home","desert","attachment","park","saturate","starkness","tower","electricity","community","mountain"]}
