{"path":"549693.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside an industrial steel mill. The setting is dark and moody, heavily influenced by the ambient lighting that highlights the harsh working conditions. Several workers, dressed in protective work attire including hard hats and safety coveralls, operate within the facility. One worker stands closer to the foreground on the left side of the frame, overseeing operations, while others are engaged directly with the equipment, focused on the molten metal pouring from a furnace.\n\nThe environment is filled with intense light and shadows created by the bright, molten steel contrasting against the dark industrial surroundings. There are visible sparks and the glow of the steel illuminates part of the scene, casting a dramatic light on the workers and their immediate vicinity.\n\nIndustrial elements such as metallic structures, grated walkways, and heavy machinery dominate the composition, contributing to the overall impression of a rugged and hazardous workplace. The heat and intensity of the steel mill operation are palpable, with steam and smoke adding to the atmosphere of the photograph. This image reflects the tough and perilous nature of work in a steel mill, highlighting the physical labor and precision involved in handling and processing molten materials.","title":"Pouring sand castings at the ford foundry in dearborn","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549694","544000","544001","543996","544045","549695","544049","557399","544018","544004","557400","547060","557395","545536","544331","557397"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["steel","worker","molten","work","spark","furnace","workplace","pour","heat","precision"]}
