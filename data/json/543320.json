{"path":"543320.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged and somewhat aged industrial structure built on a series of pilings over a rocky coastline. The main focus is a large, dilapidated pier-like facility, which appears to be an old mill or factory. The structure is made up of multiple tiers and sections, each showing varying degrees of weathering, suggesting long-term exposure to marine elements. There are several smaller buildings attached to the main complex, constructed from wood and metallic materials, contributing to an overall patchwork appearance. \n\nIn the foreground, there is a damaged structure, possibly part of a conveyor belt or loading mechanism, consisting of heavy-duty metal columns and beams, some of which are broken and rusting. It frames the view towards the ocean, creating a stark contrast between the man-made decay and the natural seascape.\n\nThe ocean is active, with waves crashing against the shore and the base of the buildings, emphasizing the challenging environment the structure is situated in. The sky is partly cloudy with patches of blue, suggesting variability in the weather.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of obsolescence and abandonment, highlighted by the mechanical decay and the relentless natural forces surrounding the structure. The photograph might illustrate themes of industrial decline or the impacts of human activity on coastal environments.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543364","543359","543405","543242","543257","547581","547575","543288","547577","547582","547622","547040","547579","551985","547118","552240"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["obsolescence","decay","variability","ocean","piling","tier","degree","structure","decline","patchwork"]}
