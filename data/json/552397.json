{"path":"552397.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and bustling scene at Niagara Falls, capturing a moment likely from the 1970s based on the style of clothing and vehicles. The primary focus of the image is the majestic waterfall in the background, visible across its full width. The falls create a dramatic backdrop and a mist can be seen rising from where the water hits the lower basin.\n\nIn the foreground, several groups of people are engaged in various activities. On the left, a group is gathered by the stone railing, seemingly mesmerized by the falls, some are taking photographs, while others are just observing. This stone wall appears to provide a safe viewing platform for visitors.\n\nThe middle and right portions of the scene feature more people scattered around the area. A small cluster of individuals stands near a flowerbed, which adds a touch of color to the scene with its bright blooms. Across the road, others stand by a car with a trailer attached, potentially preparing or wrapping up a picnic.\n\nVehicle-wise, the street is lined with cars that date the image, including a prominent brown sedan in the foreground and several others parked along the roadside, highlighting the popularity of the area as a tourist destination.\n\nOverall, the photograph encapsulates a typical busy day at Niagara Falls with tourists enjoying the natural beauty and engaging in leisure activities, enhanced by the dated yet charming appearance of the cars and fashion styles.","title":"Queen victoria park, ontario, offers spectacular views of the canadian Niagara Falls","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549537","549560","549536","549549","549535","549530","549546","549534","549563","549558","549466","552405","549557","549548","549475","549473"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["tourist","other","fall","flowerbed","popularity","stone","car","picnic","viewing","hit"]}
