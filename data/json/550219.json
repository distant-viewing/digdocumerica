{"path":"550219.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural outdoor scene focused on a body of water with a mostly still surface, likely a pond or a swamp. Dominating the foreground and the center of the image is a large accumulation of debris and plant material, which forms a natural raft or island across the water. This includes sticks, branches, logs, and an array of decomposing leaves.\n\nThere is a notable presence of a large alligator partially submerged in the water on the left side of the image, resting on the sandy and pebbly bank. The alligator's body is mostly visible with its typical rugged, textured skin and ridged back.\n\nThe water itself is covered partially by green algae and duckweed, giving it a textured and varied appearance that adds a vibrant green color to the scene. The edges of the pond or swamp are lined with dense, dark green foliage, which provides a natural backdrop, indicating a secluded or less disturbed natural environment.\n\nThe image captures the essence of a serene yet wild environment, typical of wetland or swamp areas, often rich in biodiversity and natural processes.","title":"Debris on the Rocky River in Columbia Township.
