{"path":"547450.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures an engaging scene of a sailing race or regatta. A large sailboat with a dark blue hull dominates the foreground. Spray from the water is visible as the boat cuts through the ocean waves, indicating a strong, steady pace. The boat is leaning slightly due to the wind in its sails, emphasizing the action and skill involved in handling the vessel.\n\nOn board, several people are busy managing the boat. They are dressed in casual, athletic gear suitable for sailing, and are positioned around the boat performing various tasks related to navigation and sail control. Their focused expressions and active stances suggest they are deeply engaged in the sailing process, working together to maintain speed and direction.\n\nIn the background, other sailboats are visible, adding to the competitive atmosphere of the scene. These boats vary in size and are also under sail, spread out across the hazy, overcast seascape. The water and sky blend into a palette of muted blues and grays, typical for an overcast day on the ocean, setting a dramatic backdrop for this maritime activity.","title":"Setting a course south on Chesapeake Bay toward the Atlantic Ocean at the","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548526","549424","549394","549389","548513","549388","549400","549082","549426","549425","549404","549392","549401","549421","549430","548522"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sail","boat","sailboat","regatta","ocean","race","pace","skill","seascape"]}
