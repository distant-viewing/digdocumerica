{"path":"544019.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a stark and arid landscape under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, there are three prominent, stripped tree trunks standing upright in the dry, reddish soil. These trunks are tall and bear no leaves, appearing skeletal against the expansive backdrop.\n\nBehind these trunks, the terrain is flat and barren, with only a few sparse patches of grass and small, scattered bushes. In the middle ground, there's a long wooden fence that stretches across the field, adding a linear element to the composition. This fence seems to demarcate an area possibly used for pasture or cultivation, though the land inside looks equally dry and devoid of lush vegetation.\n\nIn the distance, the landscape gently rises to form a low hill. Contrasting with the reddish earth, this hill has a yellowish hue that might indicate a different type of soil or vegetation coverage. The horizon is clear, emphasizing the vastness and open space of the setting.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a sense of desolation and the harsh reality of a dry, possibly desert environment. The absence of any visible wildlife or human presence adds to the feeling of isolation and the stark beauty of the natural world.","title":"Saguaro cactus in Peer Valley, site of Phoenix's new sanitary landfill","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["543774","555642","549183","543718","555573","544401","543722","546121","554780","546124","543658","549156","550397","549132","548673","545879"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["trunk","fence","soil","pasture","reality","coverage","cultivation","hill","desolation","world"]}
