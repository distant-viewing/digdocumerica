{"path":"545122.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic coastal landscape. In the foreground, there are several large, rugged rocks protruding from the sea, covered with what appears to be a white substance, possibly bird droppings, indicating they could be popular with sea birds. These rocks are jagged and steep, suggesting they are frequently battered by the waves.\n\nBeyond these rocks, the focus shifts to a prominent cliff on the left side of the image, which sweeps upwards to a forested hilltop. The cliff face itself is steep and appears barren or sparsely vegetated compared to the richly wooded area above it. This provides a strong contrast in textures and colors, from the dark, rugged cliff surfaces to the lush green forest canopy.\n\nThe sea is a deep blue, textured with the white of breaking waves, hinting at strong ocean currents or tide in this area. The sky above carries a mix of clouds, some dense and others wispy, casting shadows and adding a dynamic element to the lighting in the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the image suggests a remote, possibly untouched or minimally disturbed natural setting, emphasizing the raw beauty and power of coastal environments. The atmosphere conveys a sense of tranquility yet also the untamed nature of such landscapes.","title":"Rocky coastline","placename":"Seaside (Or.)","location":"Seaside, Oregon","nn1":["545130","543309","543295","545173","543061","543291","542917","543297","543092","553775","543067","543289","553771","543080","543307","545125"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","sea","bird","rock","wave","hilltop","tide","current","substance","white"]}
