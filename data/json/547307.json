{"path":"547307.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a rural setting and is taken from a low, ground-level perspective, focusing primarily on the textured, rough terrain of a plowed field. The soil is clumpy and dark, strewn with remnants of harvested crops such as broken stalks and dried leaves, indicating recent agricultural activity.\n\nIn the distance, centered on the horizon line, stands a lone traditional barn. The barn is an archetypal structure with a curved roof, characteristic of classic American farm architecture. It appears slightly weather-beaten, suggesting it has withstood many seasons.\n\nThe sky above is vast and clear with a deep blue color, indicating that the photograph was likely taken on a sunny day with no visible clouds. The overall scene evokes a sense of isolation and the expansive nature of agricultural landscapes. The composition uses the lines of the plowed field to draw the viewerâ€™s eye toward the barn, emphasizing the distance and open space typical of rural environments.","title":"Vast seeded area, typical of the eastern part of the Nebraskan plains","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547303","552462","555571","547304","557183","547291","554782","552537","547305","554806","544481","550019","549237","557946","552541","552515"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["barn","stalk","field","crop","line","remnant","distance","farm","season","level"]}
