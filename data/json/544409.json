{"path":"544409.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph features an elderly man with sun-tanned, wrinkled skin, showcasing a wealth of experience and age. He wears a wide-brimmed dark hat that sits snugly on his head, shading his eyes partially. His facial expression is solemn, with visible signs of aging, and he appears to be deep in thought or perhaps engaged in a conversation just out of frame. He has distinct facial features including deep lines, a prominent nose, a bit of facial hair, and has some missing teeth visible as he slightly opens his mouth.\n\nHe is dressed in a vibrant orange shirt, with a hint of a turquoise necklace peeking from under his collar, hinting at personal or cultural significance. The background is softly blurred, primarily in hues of gray and blue, indicating an overcast sky or distant misty landscape, creating a subdued backdrop that contrasts with his colorful attire.\n\nBranches, perhaps from a tree, frame the upper part of the composition, adding a natural element to the image. They are softly out of focus, adding depth to the composition and drawing attention directly to the manâ€™s face. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of introspective solemnity mixed with a stark, rugged demeanor.","title":"Arizona--Navajo Nation","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["554857","542613","552103","543701","556563","547179","553091","554846","554926","548226","552871","554858","547282","553055","548616","552872"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["tooth","solemnity","necklace","nose","collar","aging","skin","mouth","significance","thought"]}
