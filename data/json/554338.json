{"path":"554338.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph shows a middle-aged man standing at a podium, engaged in giving a speech. The man is dressed in a dark suit with a checkered tie. He appears to be speaking earnestly, as he looks out towards an unseen audience. \n\nThe podium is a standard wooden one, dark in color, with a prominent logo at the front that reads \"Department of Environmental Health,\" accompanied by a graphic of rolling hills and water, symbolizing an environmental focus.\n\nIn the foreground, just slightly above the podium, thereâ€™s a microphone angled towards the speaker, suggesting that the event is likely a formal and publicly addressed one. \n\nThe background is simple and mostly unadorned, with a solid color dominating it, which helps in focusing attention solely on the speaker and his activity. A slight shadow of the microphone can be seen on the podium, adding a bit to the depth of the scene. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of serious discourse, likely on an environmental or health-related topic, given the context provided by the podium's branding.","title":"Citizens meeting on transportation, a forum on \"Strategies for Clean Air\" proposed by the New York City EPA","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549114","543924","557703","554342","554343","556253","543925","543917","544097","553026","554333","556523","556451","554339","554337","544069"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["speaker","microphone","topic","speech","graphic","branding","health","audience","tie","logo"]}
