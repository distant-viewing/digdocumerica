{"path":"545169.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a fish, focusing on its head. The fish, whose species is not immediately identifiable, features prominently against a dark, unadorned background that accentuates its details. The fish's head is tilted slightly, giving viewers a clear view of its side profile.\n\nThe fish's eye is large and bulbous, highlighted by an orangish hue, and located towards the upper middle of its head. It appears glossy, suggesting moisture, which is typical of aquatic creatures. Below the eye, the mouth of the fish is open, showcasing a set of thin, slightly visible teeth and pale pinkish inner mouth parts. The gills and scales surround the face with a textured appearance, shimmering subtly under a direct light source that seems to come from above the frame.\n\nThe skin of the fish is sprinkled with small, shiny spots—likely water droplets or a natural sheen—that catch the light and add a sparkling effect. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of intrigue and detailed examination, focusing on the unique anatomical features of the aquatic creature. The dark background serves to isolate and highlight the fish, directing all attention to its physical characteristics.","title":"Closeup of left eye of sockeye salmon, afflicted with gas bubble disease.
