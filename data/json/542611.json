{"path":"542611.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image shows an expansive natural landscape, prominently featuring a large, charred log lying in the foreground. This log, presumably a fallen tree, spans nearly the entire width of the photo from the bottom left to the middle right, sitting on a ground that appears rough and dotted with small rocks and sparse vegetation.\n\nBehind the log, the terrain rises slightly and is covered with a mix of short grass, small bushes, and scattered pine trees. Several trees appear young, indicating possible recent growth or reforestation efforts. One notably tall, dead tree stump stands out amidst the younger growth.\n\nIn the distance, the landscape is densely wooded with coniferous trees, giving way to rolling hills that fade into the background under a light blue sky sprinkled with a few wispy clouds. The scene conveys a serene yet rugged wilderness area, likely situated in a mountainous region based on the undulating terrain and the type of vegetation present. The natural setting suggests a location that could be prone to natural events like wildfires, given the evidence of burnt wood and the regeneration of forest life.","title":"Six-year-old clear cut area where slash (logging debris) was piled and burned","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["542819","550347","555094","555202","555159","555138","551023","542865","542598","555139","555098","544852","545138","555207","555147","542604"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["log","growth","present","wildfire","evidence","tree","stump","width","terrain","effort"]}
