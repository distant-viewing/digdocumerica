{"path":"552663.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene at a livestock event, possibly a fair or a show. The primary focus of the image is a young woman dressed in a western-style outfit, including a black hat, a pink ruffled blouse, and black trousers. Sheâ€™s walking beside and guiding a large pig with a stick or crop, evidently participating in a livestock showmanship activity.\n\nThe pig is hefty with a predominantly pink skin adorned with black spots. It has a curly tail and seems well-groomed for the event. Both the young woman and the pig are in a sandy arena that covers the ground.\n\nIn the background, several spectators can be seen observing the event. The spectators, mostly men, wear casual and western attire, including cowboy hats and jeans. They are standing or sitting behind metal barriers that likely serve to demarcate the show area.\n\nThe setting includes some partial views of other structures and equipment typically used in livestock handling and shows, like metal gates and pens. The environment appears to be open and airy, with clear skies overhead, indicating a daytime event. The overall atmosphere captured is that of a community or agricultural event with active participation and engagement from people and animals alike.","title":"Garfield County Fair.
