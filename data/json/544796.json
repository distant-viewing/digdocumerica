{"path":"544796.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene with a strong rustic and somewhat industrial feel. At the forefront and dominating the scene is a large wooden structure, which appears to be an old, weathered log building, possibly a cabin or mill. Its dark wooden logs are prominent, and the construction shows signs of age and exposure to the elements.\n\nAdjacent and integral to this structure is a man-made waterfall created by water being channeled through a wooden flume or sluice. This particular setup suggests the building might have been used for purposes that required water power, such as a mill. The water forcefully exits from the side of the structure, splashing onto a wet, rocky area below, indicating significant water flow and possibly continuous operation.\n\nThe surroundings are barely visible behind the bursts of water and the shadow of the building. The sky overhead appears overcast, contributing to the moody, slightly desolate atmosphere of the scene. There are no people visible in the image, which adds a sense of abandonment or disuse.\n\nThe composition of this photograph, with its focus on strong textures like the wet rocks, flowing water, and aged wood, as well as its play with light and shadow, enhances the historical and possibly functional significance of this structure.","title":"Water that has been polluted by mineral content seeps from the Argo mine.","placename":"Idaho Springs (Colo.)","location":"Idaho Springs, Colorado","nn1":["549639","544795","553462","550669","550647","544769","558001","557745","550211","558006","547952","553340","549514","551111","546067","544824"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["mill","log","water","burst","disuse","overhead","waterfall","significance","structure","cabin"]}
