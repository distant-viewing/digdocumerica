{"path":"552003.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This image depicts a highly industrial setting focused on a complex array of machinery and structures typically found in a factory or processing plant. It features large, vertical cylindrical units, which are possibly storage tanks or reactors, distinguished by their sizable dimensions and functional exteriors. These cylindrical units are covered in varying shades of paint, mostly in weathered blue and green, with spots of rust and wear indicating heavy industrial use and exposure to elements.\n\nThe cylindrical units are interconnected with numerous metal pipes of varying diameters and orientations, suggesting the transportation of materials or fluids between the units. Metallic staircases and walkways run along and between these tanks, providing accessibility for maintenance or operational purposes. The walkways are constructed with safety railings and visible structural supports.\n\nForeground elements include additional pipes and possibly pressure vessels, enhancing the complexity of the plant's infrastructure. The background is less distinct but is lined with more industrial components, likely part of the same facility, seen under a light sky.\n\nThe overall scene is enveloped in a haze, possibly steam or emissions, which adds a gritty, atmospheric quality to the photograph, highlighting the industrial nature of the site. This environment is characteristic of heavy industry segments such as chemical production, oil refining, or steel manufacturing, where such infrastructure is essential for operations.","title":"Part of Exxon oil refinery on the New Jersey Turnpike at Linden","placename":"Elizabeth (N.J.)","location":"Elizabeth, New Jersey","nn1":["549960","557304","546108","546143","545920","557387","549713","557386","550917","544691","545836","546221","546107","545837","542705","545992"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["unit","walkway","pipe","tank","fluid","dimension","orientation","accessibility","infrastructure","staircase"]}
