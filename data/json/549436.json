{"path":"549436.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures an intense moment during a yacht racing event. The image displays a large yacht titled \"La Forza del Destino\" in the midst of action, sailing at a significant heel, which adds a dramatic angle to the composition. The hull of the yacht is dark, contrasting sharply with the white and grey furled sails above. Waves splash against the hull, indicating a strong wind and active sea conditions.\n\nThere are multiple crew members visible on the yacht, all actively engaged in handling different tasks, likely adjusting the rigging and sails to optimize speed and balance. The crew members are dressed in a mix of casual sailing gear, such as t-shirts, hats, and sunglasses, suggesting a professional yet relaxed atmosphere typical of yacht racing. Their positions and focus indicate coordinated teamwork and expertise in managing the yacht under demanding conditions.\n\nThe yacht itself is equipped with numerous technical features, including winches, ropes, and other sailing apparatuses that give it a technical and robust look, typical of sailing vessels designed for competitive races. The background of the scene is a hazy blue sky, merging seamlessly with the ocean horizon, highlighting the isolation and the challenging environment the crew faces during the race. Overall, the photograph captures a moment of skill, thrill, and the raw beauty of sailing sport.","title":"Contender in the five-class Annapolis-Newport race on Chesapeake Bay near the start of the race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549430","549435","549401","549434","549388","549391","547457","547449","549404","549390","549433","547448","549429","548494","547454","547450"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["yacht","sailing","crew","racing","race","member","sail","hull","expertise","winch"]}
