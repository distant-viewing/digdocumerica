{"path":"549826.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph captures a sunset scene characterized by a deep orange and amber sky, which suggests it was taken during the golden hour of evening. Dominating the upper region of the frame are two rooftop TV antennas silhouetted against the bright backdrop. Both antennas appear old and somewhat rusted, indicative of their long exposure to the elements.\n\nOn the lower part of the image, the sun is positioned just above the horizon barely touching the silhouette of what seems to be a flat-roofed building, adding a flair of drama to the scene. The soft glow of the sun provides a natural contrast and enhances the outlines of the antennas and the building's edge, all contributing to a stark, minimalist aesthetic.\n\nThe simplicity of the composition—a clear focus on the silhouettes against the setting sun—elicits a sense of calm and end-of-day tranquility that is typical of sunset photography. There are no visible people or moving objects; the scene is still, evoking a moment paused in time.","title":"Television antennas at sunset, upper Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549811","544707","542678","542680","549106","552896","549847","549805","547719","543410","548123","552337","557957","554396","552335","546100"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["antenna","sun","silhouette","sunset","tv","drama","flair","pause","rooftop","photography"]}
