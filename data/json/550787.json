{"path":"550787.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a natural, somewhat desolate landscape, characterized by a foreground of vibrant wildflowers and a middle ground dominated by a wetland or marsh. The area is filled with tall grasses and numerous water plants. Scattered throughout the middle ground are numerous dead tree stumps and trunks, providing a sense of a once-thriving wooded area that has now given way to different ecological conditions, possibly due to flooding or logging.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dense tree line, which consists of various trees, possibly including deciduous species, forming a natural border around the wetland. The sky above is partially visible and appears to be slightly overcast, suggesting an overall moist, temperate climate.\n\nThe composition focuses on the contrast between the lush, colorful foreground of yellow and white flowers against the stark, muted tones of the wetland and its decayed wooden remnants. The scene is indicative of wetland ecosystems, showing both the beauty and the harsh realities of natural environmental changes.","title":"River flowage (an overflowing onto adjacent land) is a result of destruction of forest cover--in this case by reckless lumbering practices of the 19th century.
