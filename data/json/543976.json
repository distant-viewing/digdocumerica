{"path":"543976.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, arid landscape showing a narrow river flowing through a rocky, sediment-rich channel. The river displays a striking aquamarine color, a possible indication of mineral contents or reflection of the sky. The surrounding environment is characterized by steep, barren hills with sparse vegetation, predominantly brown and beige rocks and earth. In the distance, towards the center-right of the image, a small bridge spans the river, enhancing the remote, undeveloped nature of the terrain.\n\nThe perspective is from an elevated vantage point looking down the river channel, adding depth to the image and emphasizing the rough, mountainous terrain. The sky above is clear, suggesting a dry, sunny day, which casts sharp shadows and enhances the textural details of the landscape. This scene could be located in a desert or semi-desert region, known for minimal vegetation and significant geological features.","title":"Runoff from Phelps Dodge Corporation's waste rock dump carries iron oxides into nearby streams.","placename":"Morenci (Ariz.)","location":"Morenci, Arizona","nn1":["545640","545632","543977","543793","544752","543716","545301","549021","545633","544863","544744","548924","545629","552548","552908","544748"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["channel","river","indication","mineral","sediment","content","terrain","vantage","desert","vegetation"]}
