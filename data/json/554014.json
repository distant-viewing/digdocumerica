{"path":"554014.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a low-lit landscape that primarily features farming activities via overhead irrigation systems on a large agricultural field. The frame is backlit by a low sun, which highlights and reflects off the surfaces of numerous scattered droplets from water being sprayed. This creates a sparkling, almost glittering effect across the vast field.\n\nThe background is dominated by a flat horizon with gently rolling hills, showcasing faint outlines of possibly more agricultural land or open fields. Additionally, thick clouds of spray or mist—originating from the irrigation—are visible in the distance against the darker backdrop, forming a dramatic and somewhat unusual scene.\n\nThe atmosphere of the image can be described as serene yet lively due to the dynamic and essential nature of the farming practice depicted. The time could either be early morning or late evening given the low angle of the sunlight and the long shadows cast upon the field.\n","title":"World's largest pineapple plantation is on Lanai, but production is down as foreign pineapple takes larger share of market.
