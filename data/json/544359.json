{"path":"544359.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a striking silhouette of a rugged landscape at dusk. In the foreground, there are shadowy outlines of rock formations; the most prominent is a large, steeply pointed peak with a smaller adjacent spire. The shapes of these formations suggest an arid, possibly desert-like environment.\n\nThe sky above dominates the upper part of the image, filled with scattered clouds that are illuminated by the diminishing light of the sunset, providing a dramatic backdrop. The clouds vary in density and are tinged with light shades of blue, gray and white, reflecting the waning light and adding a sense of depth and vastness to the scene.\n\nThe horizon shows the rolling outlines of distant hills, further creating a layered effect in the composition. Additional smaller peaks are just visible against the sky, enhancing the wild and natural character of the scenery. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of solitude and the stark beauty of nature unspoiled by human intervention.","title":"Church rock","placename":"Monument Valley (Ariz. and Utah)","location":"Monument Valley, Arizona","nn1":["555206","543127","544392","544944","544376","544123","557591","550429","545775","550428","545375","552896","552891","543023","557575","550646"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["peak","outline","formation","shapes","tinge","spire","intervention","cloud","arid","density"]}
