{"path":"553088.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures a man seated at a desk within an office setting. He is wearing glasses and a short-sleeved light pink shirt, looking slightly towards the viewer with a neutral or contemplative expression on his face. His desk is cluttered; documents, a stapler, tape dispenser, a binder, and several other items are strewn around, suggesting a busy work atmosphere. The office ambiance is enhanced by the lighting, which focuses more on him and less on the surroundings, shadowing his face and highlighting reflective surfaces such as his glasses.\n\nBehind him, the wall is built from cement or cinder blocks, painted in a grey or neutral tone which gives an austere look to the environment. There is a visible calendar hanging on the wall, indicating the place adheres to a functional setup, typical of many workspaces. The overall atmosphere of the scene is somewhat formal but also indicates a personal workspace scenario often seen in many professional environments.","title":"Mervin wright, tribal chairman of the paiute indian tribe Pyramid Lake indian reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["551897","544326","555297","547353","542690","556250","547366","557317","546486","556754","547720","548864","549378","555233","555417","556573"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["desk","workspace","office","dispenser","cinder","cement","tape","glass","wall","scenario"]}
