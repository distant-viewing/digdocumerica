{"path":"547032.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant and dynamically composed scene featuring a person on a bicycle and a bus parked in the background. The cyclist, who appears to be a man, is dressed in a dark blue jacket, red pants, and a light yellow beanie. He is riding a classic racing style bicycle with thin wheels and drop handlebars, partially turned to face the camera, providing a side view of his pose.\n\nThe background prominently features a purple school bus, adding a colorful contrast against a clear blue sky. The bus is traditional in design with a front-engine configuration, and it incorporates a horizontal band of yellow and red just below the windows. The word \"STOP\" is visible on a red sign attached to the bus, suggesting that it is equipped with a safety stop sign used during passenger loading and unloading.\n\nThe ground shows the shadow of leafless trees, indicating either an early spring or late autumn season inferred from the absence of foliage and the clarity of the shadows cast by a seemingly low sun. The setting appears to be a spacious, flat area, possibly on the outskirts of a town or in a rural area, as evidenced by the open space and minimal buildings or other structures in the view.\n\nThis scene captures a moment that seems both ordinary and intriguing, with the juxtaposition of the bus and bicycle adding depth to the narrative about transportation and possibly lifestyle in that area.","title":"Surveying lakeside damage after severe storm","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551445","556708","551464","547389","544967","551465","551504","557535","555433","550073","543497","551443","555501","551456","547133","545328"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["bus","bicycle","stop","configuration","infer","handlebar","cyclist","racing","incorporate","drop"]}
