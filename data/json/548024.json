{"path":"548024.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a large hydroelectric dam on a river. The dam spans across the river, and several sections are visible where water is flowing through, creating a foamy appearance on the downstream side. Adjacent to the dam are water control structures and power generation facilities.\n\nThe river in the image is broad and calm on the upstream side, contrasting with the churning water visible downstream of the dam. Beyond the dam, the landscape is semi-arid with sparse vegetation. There are large, cultivated fields apparent in the background, which are sharply geometric in shape, and the colors range from various shades of browns and greens, suggesting a mix of fallow and actively cultivated land.\n\nOn the left side of the dam, there seem to be some ancillary buildings and infrastructure possibly related to the dam's operation. The overall setting is remote, with no significant urban development visible in the surrounding area.\n\nRoads snake around the dam itself, likely providing access for maintenance and operations. The overall impression is of a significant industrial facility within a largely undeveloped, rural setting, harnessing the river for hydroelectric power.","title":"Ice harbor dam on the snake river is about 8 miles from the confluence of the snake and Columbia Rivers","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548007","549004","548938","548008","548920","548936","551580","548003","548930","549497","548927","550743","548975","548016","548017","548940"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","cultivate","river","churning","power","harness","generation","foamy","operation","facility"]}
