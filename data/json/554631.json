{"path":"554631.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a large open pit mine. The landscape is rugged and dominated by various shades of gray and brown, reflecting the exposed earth and rocks. Numerous dirt roads wind through the area, facilitating the movement of vehicles within the mine.\n\nIn the foreground, steep, rocky cliffs surround an open pit area, showing visible strata that suggest different geological layers. There are several large industrial vehicles in the pit, including dump trucks and possibly an excavator, which are dwarfed by the scale of the mining operation, indicating the vastness of the area.\n\nThe background features a range of forest-covered hills under a hazy sky, suggesting either dust pollution from the mining activities or a misty weather condition. The presence of lush greenery on the mountains contrasts with the stark barrenness of the mine.","title":"Ilmenite ore is mined with massive equipment which has resulted in a hole more than 3,000 feet long, 1,500 feet wide and 300 feet deep. Ore is separated into ilmenite for titanium and magnetite. It is located at Tahawus, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549242","552177","544110","549172","544054","555621","549241","544112","544785","544111","549167","544789","544096","544100","543758","549240"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["pit","mine","mining","stratum","excavator","dump","facilitate","dust","vehicle","cliff"]}
