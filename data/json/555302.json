{"path":"555302.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"In this photograph, the central focus is on a tall, metal structure possibly used for telecommunications or weather monitoring, mounted atop a building. The structure is reminiscent of a classic radio or TV broadcast tower, featuring a slender, vertical pole bearing several cross-bars and a set of antennas at its top. A prominent and notable element is a whimsical, robotic-looking object installed atop the tower, sporting two disks that may represent ears or fans, and additional protrusions resembling antennas or sensors. This figure gives a futuristic, perhaps playful air to the otherwise utilitarian object. \n\nThe background is a clear sky, mostly a deep blue with a few scattered clouds, suggesting the photo was taken on a bright, sunny day. The top part of the building visible in the lower part of the frame shows the edge of a roof with weathered shingles, possibly indicating the structure's exposure to elements or its older age.\n\nThe perspective is from the ground looking upward towards the top of the tower, highlighting its height and position over the building. The framing and focus are such that the tower and its quirky, robotic appendage command most of the attention, against the stark simplicity of the sky behind it. The overall aesthetic could imply a blend of old technology with a touch of creative, futuristic retrofitting.","title":"Wind generator for producing electricity in a solar-heated log cabin home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
