{"path":"545275.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image features a large and prominently displayed sign in the foreground on the right, reading \"Worlds Largest Bigleaf Maple (Acer macrophyllum)\" along with specifications about the tree: \"Trunk circumference 24 feet, Height 98 feet, Average crown 104 feet, Approximate age 300 years\". The sign is white with black lettering and is mounted on a simple metal post positioned on grass.\n\nBehind the sign is the described Bigleaf Maple itself, taking center stage in the photo. The tree has a massive, thick trunk, and its bark is rugged and uneven, suggesting great age. The trunk largely fills the left side of the frame, emanating strength and permanence. Several of its limbs stretch out robustly, clothed in dense, verdant foliage, casting shadows beneath. \n\nThe background shows a serene park-like setting with other trees spaced throughout well-kept grass. These trees are smaller compared to the Bigleaf Maple and vary in density and types, showing a mix of light and shade in the area. The general atmosphere of the image is peaceful and natural, highlighted by sunlight filtering through the leaves creating dapples of light and shadow on the ground. The sky glimpsed through the canopy of trees is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day. Overall, the photograph is composed in such a way to emphasize the grandeur and prominence of the maple while situating it within a cared-for natural environment.","title":"\"World's largest bigleaf maple\" in English Camp","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554995","542928","542722","554977","557621","554999","543448","542748","548687","543447","554966","554969","545278","542728","550792","554967"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["foot","trunk","age","limb","strength","tree","sign","prominence","year","grass"]}
