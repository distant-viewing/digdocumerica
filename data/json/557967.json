{"path":"557967.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a vintage steam locomotive moving along a curved section of railroad track, surrounded by a picturesque autumnal landscape. The train, emitting a thick plume of white steam and some smoke, appears to be an older model characteristic of earlier eras of rail travel. The locomotive is black, enhancing its dramatic presence against the colorful backdrop.\n\nA lush forest with variegated foliage in shades of green, yellow, orange, and red surrounds the scene, signifying that it is either late summer or early fall. A calm river or creek visible to the right adds to the serene ambiance of the setting. The water reflects some of the treesâ€™ colors, integrating beautifully with the overall natural environment.\n\nThe train tracks are visible in the foreground, curving around to follow the landscape's contours. Small white wildflowers are noticeable in the lower left foreground, adding a touch of nature's delicate beauty to the rugged industrial scene. The picture captures both the raw power of industrial progress (the train) and the quiet repose of nature, making it a striking composition of movement and stillness. The overall mood is one of nostalgic adventure and a voyage through a serene, colorful landscape.","title":"Cuyahoga Valley Line steam powered weekend excursion train moves along the Cuyahoga River below Riverview Road near Akron, Ohio. Chicken wire encases bricks along the train right-of-way to halt landslides onto the tracks. The train leaves the Cleveland Zoo station and heads south through part of the 30,000 acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area towards Akron. The valley contains the last major undeveloped land remaining between the two metropolitan areas.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["557963","557956","557966","557965","556759","556106","549131","550790","556009","545541","556120","556837","556029","545378","556104","556850"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["locomotive","train","steam","track","creek","characteristic","progress","railroad","wildflower","rail"]}
