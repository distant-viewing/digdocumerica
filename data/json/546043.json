{"path":"546043.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image captures a poignant scene featuring two young children, a girl and a boy, sitting together on a large wooden log in a somewhat overgrown grassy area. The girl, to the left, is dressed in a white T-shirt and light-colored pants, and wears red boots. She is focused on either showing or giving something small to the boy. The boy, on the right, wears a striped shirt in shades of green, blue, yellow and red, paired with dark blue pants and dark shoes. He appears engaged in watching what the girl is handling.\n\nBehind the children, slightly out of focus, is a small neighborhood. The focal point of this background is a single-story white house with several windows and a dark roof, surrounded by a trimmed lawn. To the right of this image looms a tall industrial chimney, out of which billows a significant amount of dark smoke, dispersing into the overcast sky. This element contrasts with the otherwise serene and residential setting, adding a layer of complexity to the scene. \n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the children in the foreground engaging in a quiet activity and the industrial chimney in the background emitting pollution, might suggest themes of innocence, environment, and the impact of industrial activities on residential life.","title":"Kaiser aluminum plant smokestack belches smoke above the residential area of the Chalmette section","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["545246","545242","545509","556166","545319","545953","552591","545383","544794","557987","545436","551075","543612","556163","556584","552830"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["girl","boy","child","chimney","innocence","poignant","pants","loom","disperse","t"]}
