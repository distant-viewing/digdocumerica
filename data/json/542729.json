{"path":"542729.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a rural large-farm layout. Notably, the image is punctuated by a systematic arrangement of cropped fields distinguished by their raised, rounded forms, likely indicating a tree crop such as citrus or nut trees.\n\nTowards the left of the image, a large, open-sided structure can be seen, perhaps a barn or shed, under which a cluster of vehicles or farm equipment is parked, suggesting that this area serves as a central operational or storage facility.\n\nAdjacent to this, a formal building complex appears, likely the main farm office or processing plant. This compound includes two prominent white buildings with gable roofs, oriented perpendicularly to each other, and surrounded by a paved area where several cars are parked, indicating the presence of workers or visitors.\n\nA network of dirt roads providing access to and from the fields and buildings is visible, also contributing to the functional layout of the farm. Along the top of the photograph, a line of utility poles stretches across, hinting at the essential infrastructure supporting agricultural activities.\n\nThe landscape beyond the farmed and built areas shows variations in vegetation and soil color, offering a contrast to the orderly farmland. This rural setting is characterized by its broad expanses and structured agricultural practice, typical of large-scale, possibly commercial, farming operations.","title":"\"Citrus ranch\"","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547447","547426","558414","547350","548907","542710","554029","547321","554053","553047","548908","547684","542714","549098","542708","553696"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["farm","crop","layout","compound","farmland","distinguish","field","practice","orient","barn"]}
