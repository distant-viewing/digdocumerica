{"path":"551056.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene set against a wooded hillside. Visible in the image are several large industrial buildings, likely made of metal or weathered wood, in muted tones of browns and grays. The main focus is a large plume of white and gray smoke or steam that is billowing out from one of the structures, dominating the upper half of the image and blending into the tree-covered hill behind.\n\nThe vegetation is dense and green, suggesting a humid or verdant location. The sky is obscured by the smoke, casting a somewhat hazy or overcast atmosphere over the scene. There are no visible people or moving objects, lending a static and somewhat desolate mood to the composition. The size and function of the industrial facility are not specified, but it appears to be active, considering the smoke production. The scene has an environmental impact implication due to the emission into the atmosphere right next to a natural area.","title":"A portion of Union Carbide's ferroAlloy plant as seen from across the Kanawha River at Montgomery Heights","placename":"Charleston (W.
