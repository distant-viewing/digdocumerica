The main focus is on a clown, who is dressed in a colorful, multicolored outfit with patches of yellow, red, green, and blue. The clown is wearing a bright red wig and traditional white face paint with red and blue accents around the eyes and mouth, creating a cheerful expression.\n\nThe clown is holding a bunch of balloons with a mixture of colors including pink, yellow, blue, and green, which add a playful and festive element to the image. The balloons are slightly translucent and catch the light, giving them a soft glow against the clear blue sky.\n\nThe background shows a crowd of onlookers who appear to be enjoying the event. The spectators include people of various ages, from young children to adults. They are casually dressed, suggesting a warm, sunny day. Behind the crowd, the facade of a grand old building with detailed architectural elements can be seen, indicating that the event is taking place in an urban setting.\n\nOverall, the composition is dynamic and colorful, capturing a moment of joy and community engagement at a public festivity.","title":"Light as froth on the town's famous beer, the carnival spirit overflows at the \"Old Milwaukee Days\" annual circus parade.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549582","552652","549575","552653","553282","556217","553272","553714","551689","551688","549320","549567","557799","554615","553308","551811"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["balloon","crowd","festivity","event","onlooker","parade","accent","spectator","joy","mouth"]}
