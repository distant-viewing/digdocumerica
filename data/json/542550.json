{"path":"542550.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a landfill or dump site where several individuals are engaged in activities related to waste management or scavenging. The setting is outdoors, under a clear blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, a man wearing a cap, denim overalls, and a long-sleeve shirt is using a pitchfork to sift through a pile of debris and foliage. His stance and focused attention suggest he is actively searching for specific items or clearing a section of the dump.\n\nFurther in the background, another person is visible wearing only pants and no shirt. This individual appears to be walking away from a pile of debris towards an open trunk of a parked car, possibly placing or retrieving items.\n\nThe landscape is cluttered with various objects and trash, including boxes, plastic bags, papers, and other unidentifiable refuse scattered around the scene, creating a sense of chaos and abandonment. There's a visible accumulation of items that are typically found in household waste.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of daily activity in a waste disposal area, highlighting the contrast between human endeavor and environmental management challenges. The image conveys themes of recycling, waste management, and perhaps the economic realities that lead individuals to scavenge in such environments.","title":"Local residents help to fill clyde kepley's sanitary land fill","placename":"Pinedale (Calif.)","location":"Pinedale, California","nn1":["542549","545299","547983","551248","549936","549750","546761","547208","549945","553039","548210","546902","546257","546377","549949","546238"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","management","dump","item","pile","search","retrieve","reality","recycling","chaos"]}
