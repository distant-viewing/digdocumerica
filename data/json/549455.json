{"path":"549455.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic aerial view of a river winding through a valley. The river, flowing prominently from the top right to the bottom left of the image, is bordered by steep, hill-like terrains on both sides. These hills are largely barren, with a sparse covering of grass and some agricultural fields visible further down the valley, indicating some degree of human activity and land use.\n\nThe landscape is rugged with a mix of soft brown and green colors, portraying a dry or semi-arid environment. The river itself appears wide and calm, with rippling water reflecting light. Several bends in the river create distinct peninsulas of land, some topped with light vegetation, which sharply contrast the surrounding barren slopes.\n\nThere is no visible infrastructure apart from a few patches that might indicate paths or small roads. The setting is serene and largely untouched by urban development, suggesting a remote location. The perspective offered in the photo suggests it might have been taken from a high vantage point, possibly a hillside or a low-flying aircraft, providing a wide, encompassing view of the natural landscape.","title":"Winding course of the Snake River viewed from trail near \"Suicide Point\" in Hells Canyon, wildest and deepest gorge in North America.","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["549456","550542","552548","542695","550616","544744","552925","550577","550576","552560","550593","555575","545633","550581","552908","550633"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","valley","covering","peninsula","degree","encompass","land","hill","fly","aircraft"]}
