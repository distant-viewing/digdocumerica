{"path":"556344.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The image features a male miner wearing a red, hard hat with an attached front-facing lamp. The hard hat shows signs of use, with scratches and a slightly faded color. The miner has a youthful face with a slight smile, and his eyes are looking off to the side. He is dressed in a striped, collared work shirt that shows signs of wear, overlaid with a lighter-colored, long-sleeve jacket. The background of the photograph is out of focus but appears to be an outdoor or possibly industrial setting with dull colors, suggesting a work environment. The overall tone of the image focuses on the miner, showcasing his attire and facial expression in what seems to be a candid, everyday moment at work.","title":"One of a series of portraits of miners waiting to go to work on the 4 p.m.  To midnight shift at the Virginia-pocahontas coal company mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia.  His red hat means that he has been working below ground less than one month.  Before going underground he received 40 hours of training in the classroom which included closed circuit television and audio visual materials.  He also is closely supervised by veteran miners in his first month","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556343","556345","556599","556357","556358","543775","558312","556367","556342","556364","542783","556396","556428","556346","556366","556337"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["miner","dull","work","collared","scratch","hat","facing","faded","lamp","male"]}
