{"path":"555972.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment inside a train, showing passengers engaged in various activities during their journey. At the forefront, there is a family composed of two children and at least one adult. The visage of another adult, presumably a parent, is partially visible at the edge of the frame.\n\nThe children and the adult are seated around a small table. The table is strewn with various objects suggestive of travel and leisure, including a board game and what appears to be a box of cigarettes and a lighter, indicative of the era when smoking in such environments was more common. The family seems absorbed in their activities: the children, one of whom is focused on the board game, and the adult nearby, who is reading a book or magazine.\n\nThe train interior is characterized by large panoramic windows that provide views of a flat, barren landscape typical of desert terrain, conveying a sense of movement and travel through a vast space.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a warm, somewhat nostalgic feel, accentuated by the natural lighting and the candid capture of everyday activities. The setting inside the train along with the familyâ€™s engagement in simple pleasures, captures a slice of life from a time possibly before the digital age, highlighting how people spent travel time in more interactive and communal ways.","title":"Lounge car on the Southwest Limited Amtrak train helps a family pass the time. The train is an overnighter from Los Angeles, California, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and continues on to Chicago. Dome car and dining car also are a part of the train in addition to the regular passenger cars. It and most other U.S. intercity passenger trains are the responsibility of Amtrak, which leases use of the tracks from the nation's railroads.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556838","556081","555998","556835","556094","555974","556095","556080","556671","556118","556834","556061","556842","555977","556656","556117"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["adult","family","train","game","board","child","travel","table","parent","magazine"]}
