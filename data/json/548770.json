{"path":"548770.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features two men on a boat, under a clear blue sky. The man on the left is of older age, wearing a red life vest, colorful patterned swim trunks, and has a camera hanging around his neck. He also has a head-mounted device that appears to be a flashlight or camera. He is holding a large white board featuring several black and white photos or illustrations, possibly related to wildlife or scientific research, given the aquatic setting and the boat.\n\nThe man on the right is dressed in a more formal attire, wearing a white shirt with rolled-up sleeves, a black vest, and dark trousers. He appears to lean towards the board, possibly explaining or discussing the images displayed on it.\n\nThe background is minimalistic, primarily the open sky and the hazy line of the horizon indicating a large body of water. This setting, combined with the outfits and tools, suggests that the men might be engaged in some form of nautical or scientific expedition, possibly involving marine research or exploration.","title":"Shell Oil scientists on an expedition to John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo study photographs of coral formations to be observed in the area.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546324","548769","546758","552861","548882","549351","555832","549616","551253","546307","554196","548768","557242","549356","544270","549331"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["vest","board","research","illustration","expedition","man","swim","boat","camera","neck"]}
