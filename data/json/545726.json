{"path":"545726.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a blossoming bush or tree, showcasing numerous small white flowers with a delicate and somewhat dainty appearance. Each flower has a central cluster of stamens, surrounded by multiple petals that radiate outward. The flowers are densely packed along the branches, which are visible intermittently and appear slender and dark, contrasting sharply with the brightness of the blooms.\n\nThe background is out of focus, providing a bokeh effect that enhances the visual emphasis on the flowers themselves. This background appears to be a darker shade, possibly indicating shaded areas behind the plant or a natural backdrop that emphasizes the subject under brighter lighting conditions.\n\nThe composition capitalizes on the natural beauty and intricate details of the flowers, using a shallow depth of field to blur out distractions and bring the viewer’s attention solely to the floral elements. The lighting seems natural, likely sunlight, which highlights the petals’ delicate texture and creates a vibrant yet soft aesthetic overall.","title":"Cliff roses","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545720","554576","545695","554574","554587","543597","547642","557618","554590","553368","544875","553366","554595","555106","543623","554745"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","capitalize","delicate","stamen","bokeh","radiate","bush","distraction","shaded"]}
