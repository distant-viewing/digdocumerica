{"path":"550935.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a warm, sunny day at a beach setting with various activities and elements visible. In the foreground, a significant visual interest is a large, open-framed four-wheeled motorcycle-like vehicle, carrying two individuals. The driver, a shirtless man wearing sunglasses, is actively steering the vehicle on a paved path parallel to the beach area. The vehicle, primarily constructed with metal frames and equipped with large, exposed wheels, presents a rustic or homemade look. His passenger, also shirtless and possibly female, sits behind him, both seeming to enjoy their ride.\n\nIn the background, the beach scene includes several other elements that hint at a recreational or tourist area. Three men, shirtless and likely in beachwear, are seen walking away from the camera towards a more developed area featuring palm trees, low buildings, and commercial signs. Notably, one of the signs reads \"CAR WASH,\" suggesting proximity to auto-related services or a commercial district near the beach.\n\nThe overall environment indicates a casual, leisure-focused day at the beach, with sandy areas complemented by sparse vegetation and urban facilities possibly supporting beachgoer activities. The image evokes a sense of relaxed, outdoor enjoyment typical of coastal vacation destinations.","title":"Dune buggy on Stewart Beach on the eastern tip of Galveston Island","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["547478","543209","543370","550922","557475","547495","545237","546397","550921","543208","550934","547499","543207","545252","546955","545857"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","wash","auto","vehicle","beachgoer","vacation","motorcycle","destination","ride","palm"]}
