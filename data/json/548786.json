{"path":"548786.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This is an aerial photograph that captures a picturesque view of several small tropical islands surrounded by clear turquoise waters, possibly in a coral reef system. The scenery is characterized by vibrant greens of the vegetation interspersed with the blues and greens of the shallow waters surrounding each land mass. Some islands are fairly barren with sparse foliage, while others are lush with a dense covering of trees.\n\nIn the foreground, one island hosts a few buildings which appear as white specks nestled among the trees, alongside a long pier extending into the water. The sandy shorelines are prominently visible, curving around the periphery of the islands, suggesting popular spots for beach activities. There appears to be one boat, either moored or in motion, near the pier. This area suggests signs of human habitation or perhaps a vacation or resort destination.\n\nTo the right of the image, further islands stretch into the distance, fading towards the horizon where they meet a clear blue sky. The marine environment shows signs of varying water depths as indicated by the changing water colors—from deep blues to light aquamarine—possibly indicating underwater topography like coral reefs, which are essential ecosystems for marine biodiversity.\n\nThis is a beautifully tranquil scene that likely attracts visitors for its natural beauty and serenity, ideal for activities such as swimming, boating, or environmental exploration.","title":"A small, privately-owned key near summerland key.
