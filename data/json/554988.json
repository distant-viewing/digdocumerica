{"path":"554988.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of a pine branch, primarily focusing on a young cone and surrounding needles. The pine cone is still immature, exhibiting a blend of colors from pale green to yellow and reddish-brown, suggesting that the cone is in the early stages of development. The needles are slender, sharp, and radiate outward from their attachment points, typical of pine trees. They have a deep green color, appearing both vibrant and lush.\n\nThe background of the photograph is blurred, predominantly in soft greens and browns. This out-of-focus background enhances the sharpness and detail of the pine cone and needles in the foreground, making them stand out more prominently.\n\nOverall, this image captures the details of the pine tree's reproductive and foliar structures, showcasing the beauty and intricacy often overlooked in everyday observation of tree parts.","title":"Douglas fir new growth in Olympic National Park Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["557542","555003","554987","555004","557592","555099","555100","554588","554741","542610","553361","557607","549226","555194","557020","557602"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["cone","pine","needle","attachment","intricacy","sharpness","greens","overlook","observation","detail"]}
