{"path":"558385.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a moment during a Christian religious service, specifically a Eucharistic celebration. An elderly priest, wearing a white robe with a green stole, is seen holding a communion wafer, which he is about to administer to a congregant. To the left of the image, only the back of the head of the congregant (a woman with blonde hair) is visible. Beside the priest stands a young altar server, also in a white robe, who appears attentive to the proceedings. They are positioned in front of an altar, upon which lies a cloth and other unseen liturgical items.\n\nThe background features elements typical of a church setting such as tall, vertical architectural details and a partial view of a draped flag. The ambient lighting casts soft shadows and highlights on the figures and surroundings, emphasizing the solemnity and quietude of the scene. The photograph appears to have been taken during an intimate moment within the larger context of a worship service.","title":"Religion plays an important part in the lives of residents. The largest group of churchgoers are Roman Catholics. A priest at the New Ulm Cathedral is giving communion at a folk guitar mass. The weekly mass was begun for the younger people and has become most popular gathering with standing room only. The church interior is decorated with baroque carvings reminiscent of churches in southern Germany's Bavarian.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["556236","558386","558398","556237","558406","558404","558383","558239","547336","558400","556234","558396","558384","558382","552623","554209"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["altar","robe","service","proceeding","solemnity","quietude","cloth","celebration","drape","church"]}
