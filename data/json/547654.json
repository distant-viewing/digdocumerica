{"path":"547654.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph presents a rustic and pastoral landscape, characterized by scattered, moss-covered boulders and patches of grass. In the foreground, a prominent boulder marked with patches of moss and lichen is centered at the bottom of the frame. The field beyond is uneven and dotted with similar stones, suggesting a rocky terrain. \n\nIn the background, several farm buildings contribute to a serene rural setting. There is a large barn constructed with stone and another building that appears weathered, with a siding that seems old and worn, alluding to their enduring presence in the landscape. A crisp blue sky appears at the top of the frame, though there are no visible clouds. \n\nThe land is sparsely vegetated, mainly with low grass, and gives a somewhat barren yet tranquil appearance, typical of a farm in early spring before the full onset of growth. The image evokes a sense of quiet and simplicity, portraying a moment frozen in a rural, timeless environment.","title":"Farm in West Greenwich.
