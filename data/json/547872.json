{"path":"547872.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of debris and discarded items, likely resulting from a flood or similar environmental disaster. The foreground prominently features crumpled and wet brown bags, possibly filled with sand or soaked possessions, hinting at an attempt to mitigate water damage. Central to the image is a framed black-and-white photograph of a group of people, with the content and era the photo represents undistinguished but suggesting a preservation of memories amidst chaos.\n\nThe middle ground is partially submerged under a pool of murky water reflecting a dreary sky, containing branches, a tire, and scattered fragments of unknown objects that contribute to a sense of upheaval and disarray. The reflections and standing water suggest recent or ongoing flooding.\n\nThe background of the scene is minimally depicted but consists of a graying sky and additional indistinct debris, enhancing the somber and abandoned feel of the setting. Overall, the composition evokes themes of loss, the passage of time, and the persistence of human memories even in the face of natural calamities.","title":"A class picture in the trash.
