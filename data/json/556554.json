{"path":"556554.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene inside what appears to be a public or institutional waiting area. There are five men seated in a row along a set of chairs that line the wall. The wall and floor are nondescript, painted in muted colors, and the area has a clinical or utilitarian ambiance, possibly suggesting a setting like a hospital or a government office.\n\nFour of the five men are dressed in various forms of casual to semi-formal wear, with details such as open collars, a cardigan, and rolled-up sleeves visible. The man second from the right is notably shirtless under an open jacket, which is unconventional for such a setting and implies a sense of urgency or distress. Each man exhibits a distinct expression or demeanor, ranging from contemplative to wearied, which could indicate they are waiting for a service, news, or perhaps undergoing a process.\n\nIn the background, an office-like setting is visible with another individual dressed in professional attire working at a desk, suggesting administrative activities or ongoing work parallel to the seated menâ€™s wait. The lighting is subdued, mainly fluorescent, casting a stark, artificial glow over the scene, heightening the sense of an impersonal, institutional environment.\n\nOverall, the mood conveys a sense of tired anticipation or resignation, possibly reflective of the men's long wait or the gravity of their reasons for being there. The photograph engages themes of waiting, perhaps in a healthcare or bureaucratic context, and the human condition in such environments.","title":"Miners waiting for their examination at the Appalachian regional hospital in Beckley, West Virginia, dr.
