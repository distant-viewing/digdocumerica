{"path":"547339.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a group of elderly women, presumably friends or a community quilting group, proudly displaying their handcrafted quilt. The central figure in the foreground is a woman wearing glasses and a black top, smiling gently at the camera while holding up a section of the quilt. Behind her are five more women, each also holding the quilt, showing various floral and geometric patterns in an array of colors. The quilt features an intricate design with multicolored petal-like pieces arrayed in circular patterns, each centered with a different fabric.\n\nThe setting appears to be a casual, possibly outdoor area as hinted by ambient lighting and a structural beam or edge of a building visible on the right edge of the frame. The space is minimally adorned, keeping the viewerâ€™s focus mainly on the group and their collaborative artwork. The atmosphere evokes a sense of community and shared accomplishment among the women.","title":"Members of the golden circle senior citizens club of fairmont holding quilt they made.
