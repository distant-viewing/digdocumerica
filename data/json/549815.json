{"path":"549815.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a cityscape featuring various layers of architecture and nature. At the foreground, there is a body of water shimmering under the sunlight. Above the water, there's a tiered infrastructure that includes a road with cars moving along it. This road is structured on a bridge-like element with visible underpasses potentially for additional vehicular or pedestrian paths.\n\nAbove the road, there's an elevated walkway or park lined with numerous trees and a row of benches where a group of people can be seen walking and sitting, enjoying the outdoor space. The background showcases a larger, lush green area with more trees and a well-maintained lawn, an impression of a quiet urban park. Adjacent to the park, there is a classical style building, possibly an apartment or an official space, characterized by its pale facade and traditional architectural details like columns and decorative moldings.\n\nThe setting seems to be a well-integrated mix of urban functionality and green spaces, likely designed to offer recreational areas amidst a busy city environment. The image captures a serene moment despite the presence of urban elements, with natural light enhancing the tranquility and beauty of the scene.","title":"A lovely, well-kept park at Manhattan's exclusive Sutton Place","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547784","551776","557257","546574","546624","546673","546745","553672","549828","552223","546706","557271","549381","548406","557273","546710"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["park","space","road","molding","apartment","functionality","walkway","bench","lawn","column"]}
