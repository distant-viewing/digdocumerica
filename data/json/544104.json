{"path":"544104.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a group of older adults on what appears to be an industrial tour, focusing on a massive tire of a very large vehicle, likely used for construction or other heavy industry. The tire dominates the left side of the frame; it is larger than the people near it, suggesting it belongs to a mining or earth-moving vehicle.\n\nThe group consists of both men and women, most likely retirees, given their age. Many are dressed in typical casual attire from the late 20th century, such as slacks, blouses, and light jackets, suitable for an outdoor, daytime event. A few individuals wear hats to shield themselves from the sun. The men predominantly sport sunglasses and glasses, indicative of a bright, sunny day. One of the women is peering through a pair of binoculars, which she holds up to her eyes.\n\nGeneral expressions of intrigue and curiosity are evident; some individuals are looking up, possibly at a guide or the machinery itself, as they try to hear or get a better view. The environment around them features industrial elements, such as a building structure with shadows that suggest it could be an open shed or factory.\n\nThis scene effectively portrays a social or educational outing focused on learning more about industrial operations, highlighting the scale of machinery used relative to human size, adding a layer of awe to the context.","title":"The American Association for Retired Persons tour the Sierrita copper mine of the Duval Corp.
