{"path":"550418.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph presents a captivating aerial view of a rugged landscape. Dominating the scene is a sprawling, textured terrain that appears to be a glaciated area. The surface of the land is uneven and primarily covered in grayish-white tones, suggesting a thick layer of ice or frost. The grooves and ridges running through the terrain indicate significant geological activity, possibly shaped by glacial movement over time.\n\nSnaking through the landscape are several dark, winding paths, likely rivers or streams carved into the valleys by melting ice or snow. These water bodies contrast sharply with the surrounding lighter terrain. The winding patterns of the rivers add a dynamic quality to the photograph, directing the viewer's eye through the complex terrain.\n\nThe surrounding area features patches of greenery, suggesting sparse vegetation managing to grow despite the harsh environmental conditions. The green areas are more prominent along the riverbanks where moisture may be more readily available.\n\nThe topography shown is rugged and steep, with dramatic cliffs and sharp drops visible, particularly on the right side of the image where the terrain dramatically descends into deeper valleys. This suggests the photograph might have been taken in a mountainous region known for its harsh, beautiful landscapes.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures the stark and powerful beauty of a high-altitude, glaciated environment, highlighting the interplay between ice, rock, and water in shaping the landscape. There are no visible human elements or activities, reinforcing the wild and natural character of the scene.","title":"Bluffs and ridges near the eastern end of the Atigun Gorge the view looks south","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550410","550592","550511","550510","550594","550402","550512","550419","550523","550507","550498","555663","552907","555678","550404","550518"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["ice","terrain","valley","frost","melt","groove","drop","shape","carve","descend"]}
