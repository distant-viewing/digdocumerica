{"path":"543418.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal moment, likely taken on a sunny day. It features three people walking along a sandy beach with a prominent natural rock arch formation creating an overhead bridge toward the right side of the image. The arch is rugged and made of weathered stone, adding a textural character to the scene.\n\nThe coast is lined with this sturdy, erosion-formed rock, which curves gently toward the ocean, sheltering a portion of the beach under its arch. Below this formation, the ocean waves gently lap the shore, with the frothy sea water in various shades of blue and white due to the sunlight.\n\nThe people, two of whom are further away and one closer to the foreground, are walking casually along the shoreline. They appear relaxed, dressed in light, casual clothing suitable for a beach day. Their presence adds a human element to the otherwise natural landscape scene.\n\nIn the background, the perspective extends to show the curvature of the coastline, with more rocky outcrops and a hint of buildings possibly suggesting a residential area nearby. There's a clear sky above, which suggests good weather, contributing to the overall serene and leisurely atmosphere of the setting. The natural and human elements combined make this a picturesque, peaceful outdoor environment.","title":"Near Santa Cruz -- Natural Bridges beach","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["543322","543310","547697","543072","548700","545106","543492","553765","543389","543204","557459","553773","553775","546953","543250","553772"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["arch","beach","ocean","formation","curvature","coast","outcrop","rock","coastline","erosion"]}
