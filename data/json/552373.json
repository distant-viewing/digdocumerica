{"path":"552373.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a dense urban area with a yellow helicopter prominently flying on the right side. Below the helicopter, a vast residential area with numerous single-story houses creates a pattern of squared blocks, separated by straight roads that stretch across the image. These roads are marked with traffic and surrounded by sidewalks and a few trees.\n\nTowards the left and extending to the center, a freeway or major road, noticeable by larger vehicles and a dividing barrier, slightly curves through the neighborhood. The area is predominantly residential, but a few larger commercial or industrial buildings can be seen interspersed among the houses, particularly towards the upper left area where buildings with large, flat roofs dominate the view.\n\nThe helicopter is painted yellow with green stripes and a black bottom. Its rotors are in motion, suggesting it is in active flight. The background features a hazy sky that suggests either fog, smog, or mist, typical of many urban areas, slightly obscuring distant buildings and reducing the clarity of the horizon.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a mid-flight view of an urban district under a hazy sky, using the motion and orientation of the helicopter to draw attention and add a dynamic component to the otherwise static urban landscape below.","title":"Los angeles reactive pollutant program (larpp), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552374","547765","546687","553001","546617","555743","553936","546678","548318","553016","546579","549476","549979","555781","547764","548424"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["helicopter","roads","rotor","motion","reduce","urban","smog","orientation","house","flight"]}
