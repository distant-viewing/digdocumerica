{"path":"556781.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts the interior of a vintage train car, seemingly from the mid-20th century. The car features rows of cushioned bench seats upholstered in a deep red fabric, aligned in a 2-2 configuration on either side of a central aisle. The aisle itself is covered with a patterned floor, possibly of linoleum, in a checkered design with alternating colors.\n\nThe train car's ceiling is curved, typical of older railcar designs, and fitted with fluorescent lights that run along the center, illuminating the space. The walls near the ceiling display advertisements, ranging from consumer products to entertainment, reflecting the cultural and commercial elements typical of the era.\n\nPassengers are scattered throughout the car, each occupying their individual space and engaged in various activities. Some appear to be reading, while others are looking out the windows or simply sitting in thought. The passengers display a variety of fashion styles, hinting at the diversity of the period and perhaps the different walks of life from which they come.\n\nEach row of seats has large windows next to it, offering passengers a view outside, though the scenery outside isn't visible in this shot. Overall, the photograph exudes a sense of quiet routine and captures a moment of everyday travel from a bygone era.","title":"Commuters on a virtually empty Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) train as it leaves Philadelphia for the suburbs early in the morning.
