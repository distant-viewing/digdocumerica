{"path":"544688.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph presents a dramatic silhouette of an industrial facility against a sunset sky. The plant consists of multiple complex structures including towers, chimneys, and various other machinery, all outlined against the bright backdrop of the sky. Predominantly noticeable are the large plumes of dark smoke billowing out from several stacks, mixing into the sky above. The setting sun provides a glowing, orange and yellow tint to the sky, contrasting starkly with the dark outlines of the facility. There are no visible human figures or moving objects in the scene; the focus is entirely on the industrial structures and the emissions. The atmosphere conveys a mixture of industrial activity and environmental impact, highlighted by the vivid colors and stark silhouettes.","title":"Sunset and smoke","placename":"Fremont (Calif.)","location":"Fremont, California","nn1":["544700","544684","553847","544708","544696","545421","546384","547090","545446","544173","545425","548886","545414","545438","542544","545410"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["glowing","silhouette","facility","tint","emission","billow","mixture","towers","plume","chimney"]}
