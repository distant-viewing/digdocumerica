{"path":"544405.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a desert landscape under a dynamic sky. The foreground features rugged, rocky terrain with sparse vegetation, typical of a desert environment. Dominating the middle ground are rows of large, metal electrical transmission towers. These structures, each consisting of angular, geometric shapes, stand stark against the natural backdrop, marching off into the distance towards the horizon. \n\nAbove, the sky is a mix of blue and scattered clouds, ranging from thin wisps to fluffy, larger formations that add a soft texture to the scene's upper portion. The clouds vary in brightness and shadow, suggesting either a setting or rising sun that casts a warm light across the scene, enriching the colors of the sky and the earthy tones of the terrain.\n\nThe overall composition of the image juxtaposes man-made elements with natural ones, highlighting themes of technological progress set against the timeless and arid wilderness. The color saturation and graininess suggest that the photograph might be taken on film, giving it a slightly vintage or dated feel.","title":"Power lines","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544355","544400","543728","558107","544300","545790","549110","545771","549011","548673","549132","548136","555397","549179","549183","555609"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["desert","wisp","graininess","transmission","progress","saturation","cloud","film","brightness","one"]}
