{"path":"544291.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene with a focus on recreational activities in the water. The image shows three individuals engaging in water play. Two appear to be actively swimming towards a white, circular floatation device, perhaps a buoy or an unattended life ring, which is close to them in the water. Another person farther in the background appears to be lying or sitting on a similar floatation device, indicating a leisurely activity.\n\nThe water has a gentle appearance, with mild ripples, suggesting a calm sea condition. The foreground prominently features sand, tinted dark, possibly black sand, indicating volcanic activity or a specific geographical location known for such unique beach characteristics.\n\nThe lighting suggests this may be during a time when the sun is not at its peak, possibly morning or late afternoon, creating a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere for beach-goers. The colors in the scene are rich, with the blue of the water contrasting with the dark hues of the sand. This setting delivers a peaceful, inviting scene of water recreation and natural coastal beauty.","title":"Kenner public swimming area.
