{"path":"556141.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures an engaging moment featuring a young man being doused with water from above. The water is flowing from a red and white can labeled with the word \"COKE,\" suggesting that it's a Coca-Cola can. We can see the water splashing over his face as he tilts his head back, his mouth open wide in a broad, joyous smile.\n\nThe lighting in this image emphasizes the water's cascading effect, creating sparkling droplets and highlights across the subject's face and the surrounding environment. His skin gleams with the water, enhancing his expressions of happiness and excitement.\n\nHe is wearing a pink shirt, and the background is dark, with little to no discernible details, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the action and emotion portrayed in the foreground.\n\nThis image evokes a sense of fun, spontaneity, and perhaps is part of a playful moment or celebration. The choice to use a Coca-Cola can for pouring water adds an element of whimsy and cultural reference.","title":"Summer fun means cooling off with water from a fire hydrant at Woodlawn Community, a low income highrise apartment complex on Chicago's South Side. These children don't go to the city beaches. Cooling off with open fire hydrants is a community tradition. The area has high crime and fire records. From 1960 to 1970 the percentage of Chicago Blacks with an income of $7,000 or more jumped from 26% to 58%, but still fell behind the gain made by whites.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["552539","553245","551446","552540","548818","553149","543877","553229","554220","551638","551857","552702","551544","544204","545330","543710"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["water","spontaneity","emotion","fun","happiness","reference","face","excitement","choice","droplet"]}
