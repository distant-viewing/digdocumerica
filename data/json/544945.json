{"path":"544945.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of an ancient stone wall, likely part of a historical or archaeological structure. The wall is constructed from numerous irregularly shaped stones varying in sizes and hues of dusty red, brown, and orange, giving an earthy look. The stones are tightly packed together without visible mortar, which suggests traditional building techniques.\n\nA prominent feature in this image is a small rectangular window or opening in the wall, which is centrally located in the frame. This aperture is neatly outlined by carefully placed, smaller and smoother stones, contrasting with the rough and uneven texture of the surrounding stonework. The inside of the opening is shadowed, appearing dark and empty, providing no view of what lies beyond.\n\nThe composition of the photograph focuses intensively on the texture and pattern of the stonework, bringing forth its rugged beauty and the skilled craftsmanship required to build such a structure. The lighting appears natural, possibly sunlight, highlighting the grain and color variations of the stones and enhancing the three-dimensional feel of the wall. No backdrop or other surrounding details are visible, directing all attention to the stonework itself.","title":"Ancient Indian dwelling, built between 1100 and 1300 A.D., Hovenweep National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558010","544919","544937","545554","547518","543348","552498","544907","543345","547514","552530","544948","558013","545821","545550","545825"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["stonework","stone","wall","opening","inside","craftsmanship","technique","grain","require","bring"]}
