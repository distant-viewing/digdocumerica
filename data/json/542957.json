{"path":"542957.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image captures a close-up of a furry caterpillar crawling on a granular surface, perhaps sand or fine gravel. The caterpillar is predominantly brown with a textured, hairy body that appears soft and dense. The background focuses primarily on the texture of the surface, which consists of numerous, small, light-colored granules that provide a contrast to the darker color of the caterpillar.\n\nThe lighting in the photo highlights the caterpillar’s fuzzy hairs and some of them glisten, suggesting either moisture or a reflection of light, which adds a tactile dimension to the image. This positioning and framing of the caterpillar, being at the center and almost coming towards the viewer, creates an intimate and detailed visual exploration of its form and the surface it’s traversing. The depth of field is shallow, with the focus sharp on the caterpillar and softer on the granular background.","title":"Furry caterpillar","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555196","544930","557585","553872","543264","544520","557544","555053","555062","544514","544553","544518","544619","544526","547682","544517"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["dimension","surface","positioning","close","moisture","framing","gravel","up","exploration","sand"]}
