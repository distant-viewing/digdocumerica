{"path":"550842.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The image shows a view of Earth from space, taken at night. The photograph captures clusters of bright city lights, concentrated and sprawling across various regions, which illuminate the landscape and outline the urban areas. These lights vary in intensity and density, indicating the size and spread of human habitation.\n\nDarker areas interspersed among the illuminated zones represent less populated or rural regions, bodies of water, or terrain with minimal human activity, such as forests and mountains. The lights create intricate patterns, highlighting the shape of the coastlines, rivers, and the topographical contours of the land.\n\nThere are no visible clouds in this frame, offering a clear view of the Earth's surface features lit by artificial lights. The background is a solid black, characteristic of space, contrasting starkly with the bright specks and clusters of human civilization. This view emphasizes the complexity and extent of human development seen from an orbital perspective.","title":"Water ripples through reeds in the Fox River.
