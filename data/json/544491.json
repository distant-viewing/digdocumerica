{"path":"544491.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures an intriguing scene consisting of a rugged natural landscape and a military aircraft. The focal point is the aircraft, which is depicted in mid-flight against a vivid blue sky dotted with fluffy, cumulus clouds. The airplane appears to be a large, dual-propeller model, typically used for military purposes, and is shown from a slightly frontal and bottom perspective, highlighting its distinctive wings and engines.\n\nThe landscape below forms a striking contrast with the man-made aerial machine. It features a dense marsh or swamp area, characterized by a variety of trees, predominantly pines, which are sporadically distributed across the scene. These trees have a somewhat gnarled and twisted appearance, suggesting a challenging growing environment. The ground is not clearly visible, but hints of earth and underbrush can be inferred among the trees, suggesting a wild, possibly undeveloped terrain.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the raw, untamed natural environment with the mechanical, precise nature of human technology, emphasized by the aircraft's crisp silhouette against the organic, irregular forms of the landscape. The light and shadows play across the scene, casting the ground in partial obscurity while illuminating the plane and clouds, creating a dramatic and somewhat surreal atmosphere.","title":"Jet takes off from Miami-Dade Jetport in Everglades","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544606","542577","548469","545642","542506","542500","551601","553873","542720","542496","547721","548881","548883","542793","547533","544610"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["aircraft","propeller","swamp","cumulus","underbrush","marsh","plane","airplane","wing","pine"]}
