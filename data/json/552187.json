{"path":"552187.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of an industrial area situated along a riverbank. At the center, a large industrial plant with multiple tall, vertical structures is emitting white steam or smoke from its chimneys into the sky. The river is prominently featured, flowing through the landscape and curving around the industrial site.\n\nSurrounding the plant, there are various other buildings, warehouses, and storage facilities, indicative of a bustling industrial zone. The layout includes several docks and small ships, suggesting that this area engages in significant marine transport activities. The river is peppered with jetties and moored boats, emphasizing the area's reliance on waterways for logistics and transport.\n\nIn the background, a more residential or less dense industrial region can be seen, with smaller buildings and areas of open space. The horizon is overcast, possibly indicating early morning or late afternoon light. The overall impression is of a busy industrial hub situated in a significant water-linked infrastructure, likely heavily involved in manufacturing or processing activities, integral to the locality's economy.","title":"Industrial waterfront overlaid with smog","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548340","551201","550890","555769","555770","552182","551173","552181","549495","555776","545889","546705","549968","552191","548423","544999"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["transport","locality","reliance","situate","economy","pepper","jetty","logistic","hub","plant"]}
