{"path":"547415.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man standing in front of a white church entrance. The man is smiling and dressed smartly in a gray suit, white shirt, and a gray fedora hat. He holds a book in one hand, standing with his other hand clasped in front. The man appears cheerful and is looking slightly downwards toward his right.\n\nThe church entrance includes white wooden doors set into a curved archway, with large arched windows on either side of the door, consisting of multiple panels. The buildingâ€™s exterior is classic, painted white, and has a traditional architectural style.\n\nConcrete steps lead up to the church entrance, and there's a simple metal railing on the left side of the steps. The ground surrounding the steps appears slightly overgrown with grass and small plants. The overall atmosphere of the image is serene and invokes a sense of warmth and community.","title":"After service at the Immanuel Lutheran Church on Highway 34 near Garland","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547411","558396","547425","547332","558397","557666","558402","557078","546233","547336","558330","552542","546229","547414","552479","558163"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["church","entrance","step","door","fedora","clasp","archway","front","invoke","warmth"]}
