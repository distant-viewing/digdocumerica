{"path":"546838.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph portrays a scene of pollution and neglect, depicted through discarded objects submerged in murky water. In the foreground, two prominent rubber tires are visible, partially submerged and filled with water, suggesting they have been discarded in this environment for some time. Around and between these tires, assorted debris floats on the water's surface, including pieces of wood, smaller bits of refuse, and unidentifiable fragments.\n\nThe background of the scene is a blend of reflective water and shadowy areas that transition to a brighter, more illuminated section, likely due to the angle of sunlight reflecting off the water surface. The sunlight casts sparkling highlights on the water, creating a shimmering effect contrasting with the detritus scattered throughout.\n\nThe overall appearance is one of environmental decay, highlighting human impact on natural water bodies. The composition captures a dismal yet compelling depiction of pollution, its persistence, and the indifference shown towards natural habitats.","title":"Trash floats in Baltimore Harbor near Pier 8 which is close to downtown Baltimore.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["551440","547517","550812","546913","551441","546878","547846","550352","543302","547590","547907","547689","555784","555848","547524","547513"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["tire","water","pollution","detritus","rubber","refuse","fragment","sunlight","depiction","highlight"]}
