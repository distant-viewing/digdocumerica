{"path":"554139.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph displays a dramatic and eerie scene characterized by a deep crimson sky, which sets a somber mood. In the foreground, silhouettes of barren, twisted trees with spindly branches are starkly outlined against the glowing, red-hued backdrop. These trees, devoid of leaves, contribute to the ominous atmosphere of the image.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, there is a visible source of intense light resembling flames, suggesting the presence of a fire whose glow permeates the sky above. The flames are not directly shown, but their bright illumination at the base creates a powerful contrast with the surrounding darkness.\n\nThe red sky possibly indicates the presence of smoke or a particular time of day, although the intensity and uniformity of the color suggest it could be influenced by the light from the fire. This photograph could be capturing a natural disaster, like a wildfire, or a controlled burn, creating a visually striking scene that emphasizes themes of nature's power and vulnerability.","title":"Mauna Loa glows with hot lava during peak of eruption; trees in foreground were killed by earlier eruptions.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["555164","554956","557578","545025","553572","555156","557577","555157","543400","546113","547733","553561","545747","557573","548591","555160"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["flame","fire","burn","wildfire","vulnerability","uniformity","disaster","illumination","intensity","darkness"]}
