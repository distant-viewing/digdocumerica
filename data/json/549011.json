{"path":"549011.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a striking view of electrical power lines and transmission towers silhouetted against a sunset sky. The scene is taken during the golden hour, where the sky displays a gradient of deep oranges and browns, enhancing the outlines of the subject matter. Several large metal towers, characterized by their angular and geometric lattice structures, dominate the midground. These towers are interconnected by numerous stretched wires that zigzag across the frame.\n\nIn the background, a smooth, dark silhouette of a mountain range forms a natural horizon line, contrasting with the industrial elements in the foreground. The light from the sunset casts a warm hue across the entire scene, emphasizing the metallic structures of the towers and the linear patterns created by the power lines. There's a sense of depth provided by the fading light and the overlapping elements, creating a layered visual effect. The photograph could evoke themes of energy, technology, and the juxtaposition of nature versus human-made structures.","title":"Power lines pass from nearby Hoover Dam to Southern California.","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["553830","543903","553028","544355","549110","544011","543728","546389","544020","543926","544613","549020","544405","547732","548136","546384"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["tower","sunset","power","line","lattice","matter","transmission","technology","hour","gradient"]}
