{"path":"557014.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, misty landscape. The setting is a grassy field dotted with deciduous trees, likely on a foggy morning given the obscured backdrop, soft lighting, and subdued colors. In the foreground, there is a murky, narrow waterway reflecting the quiet light, bordered by unkempt vegetation and flanked by a rugged embankment. The embankment itself is textured and appears damp, covered partially with grass, small stones, and earth, leading the eye gently towards the mist-filled background. This environment exudes a tranquil, almost surreal aura, enhanced by the mist that gradually obscures trees and diminishes the clarity of further distances, creating a soft gradient from the distinct foreground to the faded background. The composition leverages the subtle contrasts between dark and light areas, fluid and solid elements, as well as the organic forms of nature under a muted sky.","title":"Farm pasturage adjacent to Nelson Road near Tracyton increased land use pressure for this area and others like it are expected when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby.
