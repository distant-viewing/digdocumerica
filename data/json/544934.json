{"path":"544934.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a flowering plant in a natural setting. The main subject of the image is a cluster of tall flowers with small, delicate, pale pink blossoms arranged along slender, green stalks. The plant is surrounded by dry, reddish-brown soil, which appears to be rocky and arid.\n\nIn the background, similar flowering plants can be seen spread sporadically across the landscape, suggesting a semi-desert or dry grassland habitat. Each plant stands out distinctly against the bare soil, indicating sparse vegetation typical of arid environments. The lighting appears natural and suggests that this photo was taken on a sunny day, contributing to the vividness of the earth tones and the soft contrast between the vibrant green of the plants and the pink hues of the flowers.\n\nThere are no human figures or man-made objects in the photograph, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on the natural aspects and the rugged beauty of the environment. A sense of serene isolation is conveyed by the sparse distribution of the plants and the open, undeveloped land.","title":"Hovenweep national monument","placename":"Utah","location":"Utah","nn1":["544875","553588","554595","553366","542970","554843","545703","554111","557500","547642","543200","550462","553074","543597","553361","544877"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","flower","soil","stalk","blossom","distribution","grassland","vividness","habitat","aspect"]}
