{"path":"556070.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a large, possibly historic train station with high ceilings and grand architectural features. The room is filled with strong vertical lines, mainly from the columns and wall panels, creating a solemn, imposing ambience.\n\nIn the foreground, there are four wooden benches, each with an elegant, carved design that evokes a sense of vintage charm and sophistication. On these benches, four individuals are seated, spaced apart, each engrossed in their own activity.\n\nThe first person, a man on the left, sits facing slightly away from the camera, looking distant or possibly in thought. He is dressed in dark clothing and has his arms crossed.\n\nNext to him is a woman dressed in a green sleeveless top and matching pants. She is focused on reading a book, showing a look of concentration.\n\nFurther to the right, another younger woman is seated with her legs crossed, looking down at a book or a small piece of technology like a compact laptop or large mobile device; she wears a blue jacket and white sneakers, her posture relaxed yet attentive.\n\nAt the far right, the last bench holds an older man wearing glasses and dressed in a light blue shirt and darker pants. He appears to be resting, with his eyes closed and hands clasped in his lap.\n\nThe background includes visible balconies with additional people scattered around, some walking and others sitting, below signage that hangs overhead, indicating train schedules or station information.\n\nOverall, the photo has a vintage tone, punctuated by the attire of the subjects and the classic train station interior, suggesting an era when cellphones and modern gadgets were less dominant, pushing people towards more traditional pastimes like reading and introspective rest while waiting.\n","title":"Passengers sit on massive wooden benches which fit in with the architecture of the cavernous Chicago union station.
