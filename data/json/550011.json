{"path":"550011.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures a cityscape at dusk, featuring a contrast between architectural styles and eras. On the left side of the image is a classic, older skyscraper with an Art Deco design, identifiable by its tiered structure, sharp angles, and the distinctive antenna at its peak. This building is largely in silhouette against the fading light of the sky, emphasizing its outline and form.\n\nTo the right, there is a modern skyscraper distinguished by its smooth glass facade, which reflects the orange hues of the setting sun. The reflective glass creates a striking pattern of illuminated windows that appear like glowing squares scattered across the building's surface.\n\nBetween these two dominant structures, a small portion of another building with a spired rooftop suggests another older, possibly Gothic, architectural style, adding a layer of historical depth to the urban environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is serene and contemplative, with the play of light and shadow highlighting the juxtaposition of different architectural styles. The sky, transitioning from blue to deeper shades, suggests the time is either early morning or late evening, a period commonly referred to as the \"blue hour\" in photography for its quality of light.","title":"John hancock building - a major disaster for the owners architect, engineers and public.
