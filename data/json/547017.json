{"path":"547017.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, natural scene characterized by wetland terrain. In the foreground, there's a weathered rowboat, primarily in a shade of light gray with peeling paint, suggesting age and exposure to the elements. The boat is resting on a bed of dried brown reeds that sprinkle the muddy ground, indicating a possibly tidal area or a shoreline of a marsh.\n\nMuch of the middle and background is dominated by an expansive view of a marsh, characterized by tall, dense green grass stretching into the distance. The horizon suggests a vast flat landscape, typical of wetland environments. There are patches of water visible within the marsh, hinting at recent water levels that may have subsided.\n\nThe sky, partially shrouded by heavy clouds bringing a moody and overcast ambiance to the setting, casts a natural, diffused light over the entire scene. This lighting enhances the hues of green in the marsh and the muted tones of the boat and reeds. The clouds seem heavy and nearly touching the horizon, enhancing the feeling of an enclosed, intimate natural environment. Despite the overcast sky, the scene is void of any people or animals, which contributes to a sense of quietude and abandonment in nature.","title":"An old boat rots in a marsh on st.
