{"path":"547153.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph shows a striking winter scene where a substantial building, possibly a boat house, stands partially over water at the edge of a lake. The structure is remarkably covered in thick ice, likely formed from the spraying waves during colder temperatures, creating a dramatic and almost surreal landscape.\n\nThis icy exterior features long, dagger-like icicles hanging from the eaves and covering what appears to be the walls and guardrails, emphasizing the extreme cold experienced by the building. The roof and sides of the structure show signs of being completely overtaken by the frosty environment, with both ice and snow clinging to every exposed surface.\n\nIn the foreground, the shore is visible, comprised of small rounded stones and pebbles, presumably washed up by the lake. The weather appears overcast, contributing to the muted color palette dominated by grays, whites, and the dark tones of the water.\n\nIn the background, partial views of leafless trees and a diffused, gloomy sky suggest a chilly, desolate winter day. The scene is devoid of any human activity, highlighting the abandoned or remote nature of this location during such harsh weather conditions.","title":"Ice-encrusted house on shore of Lake Michigan","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547105","543770","547127","543550","550201","546899","543656","547040","543619","554232","557180","557199","554788","547145","557200","547038"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ice","winter","eave","guardrail","lake","temperature","cling","pebble","wash","spray"]}
