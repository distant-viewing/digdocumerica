{"path":"551021.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features a suburban or rural road scene encapsulating a sense of mid-20th century Americana. In the foreground, an aging and slightly rusty red car with white roof is parked on a grassy area beside the road. This car appears to be an old model, likely from the 1950s or 1960s, showing signs of wear and non-operation, such as covered side windows, possibly with cardboard.\n\nTo the left of the car, an off-white single-story house with a flat roof is visible. It’s a simple structure possibly serving as a residential home, characterized by minimal architectural detailing and a central window. Behind the house, lush green trees enhance the semi-rural vibe of the setting.\n\nThe road itself is paved, with a yellow dividing line indicating it’s a two-way street. Traveling on the road is a mint green utility-style van, which has marking text that could be related to a business, although it’s not clearly readable. In the opposite direction, a white mid-size car from around the 1970s is approaching.\n\nFurther down the road, additional homes can be seen. These homes have features similar to the first, including flat roofs and simple designs, painted in bright, plain colors. Large, mature trees line the street, contributing to a serene neighborhood atmosphere.\n\nThe setting suggests a small town or a suburban area from around the 1960s to 1970s, depicted on a bright, sunny day that casts clear shadows beneath the parked vehicles and highlights the lush greenery of the area. The overall scene captures a slice of life from an era gone by, focusing on everyday elements like transportation and residential architecture.","title":"A junked autoMobile on a vacant lot in Rand.","placename":"Charleston (W.
