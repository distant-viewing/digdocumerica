{"path":"546193.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of the rear end of a vehicle, specifically focusing on the license plate area and a bumper sticker. The license plate is from Texas, indicated by a small embossed shape of the state at the top, and is labeled \"TRUCK\" at the bottom. It is identified by the alphanumeric code \"6E-1027\". The bumper sticker below the license plate is a humorous advertisement for motorcycles, stating \"MOTORCYCLES...\" followed by the suggestive phrase \"Put something exciting between your legs\" in bold, yellow text on a black background.\n\nThe background and surrounding areas of the vehicle, which are partly visible in the image, suggest a dark color for the vehicle, possibly black or deep blue. The license plate and bumper sticker are both a bit worn and weathered, with visible scuff marks and specks of dirt or debris, suggesting that they have been exposed to the elements for some time. There are also small glistening details which might be droplets of water or dew, highlighting the textures and adding to the worn look of the surfaces.","title":"Texas--Leakey","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["547269","549312","555462","555432","555893","554369","554368","546104","554364","544859","545135","547494","549883","544370","557922","557044"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["license","plate","sticker","bumper","motorcycle","code","vehicle","dew","phrase","speck"]}
