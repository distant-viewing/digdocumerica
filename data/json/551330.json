{"path":"551330.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph showcases a dilapidated structure, possibly an old house or building, in a state of significant decay and ruin. The walls, constructed from bricks or stone, are mostly crumbled and weathered, with sections missing, revealing the natural landscape beyond.\n\nThe scene is set in an overgrown environment, indicating the structure has likely been abandoned for a considerable time. Vegetation is sprouting around and even on the remnants of the building, including small bushes and patches of grass. Trees are visible in the immediate surroundings which also adds to the sense of abandonment and nature reclaiming the area.\n\nIn the foreground, there are debris and rubble scattered around. Notable objects include what appear to be rusted metal canisters or pots, contributing to the overall scene of neglect and decay. The ground is uneven, covered with dirt, rocks, and small plants.\n\nIn the distant background, a contrast to the ruin, thereâ€™s a glimpse of more modern development with a structured, clean-looking building set against the sky, possibly implying the proximity of this ruin to a more inhabited or developed area.\n\nThe image has a quiet, somewhat melancholic atmosphere, capturing the textures and colors of the decay with natural lighting that suggests it might be taken during daylight, casting soft shadows around the debris and structures.","title":"Abandoned and vandalized tourist cabins by the side of route 54 at new linn creek, Missouri","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["543344","554565","543171","553555","551115","550129","554707","546971","553548","543339","552494","553551","557348","549195","551329","552491"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["ruin","decay","canister","crumble","sprout","reclaim","pot","rubble","miss","debris"]}
