{"path":"557560.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset landscape. The image is dominated by a large sun, hanging low in the sky, casting a radiant blend of warm oranges and subtle pinks across the horizon. The background is composed of layers of mountains which gently recede into the distance, silhouetted against the glowing sky. The mountain outlines are jagged and create a series of peaks and valleys along the landscape, offering a sense of ruggedness and undisturbed wilderness.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is tranquil and slightly somber, with the darkness around the edges suggesting the approach of night. The light and color gradations in the sky reflect off what could be a gentle haze or light cloud cover, enhancing the depth and richness of the view. The composition skillfully uses the natural silhouettes of the mountains to frame the sunset, drawing attention to the interplay of light and shadow.","title":"Sunset in the santa monica mountains near the west edge of Los Angeles county, California.
