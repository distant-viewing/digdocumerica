{"path":"557971.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene focused on fishing near a large bridge. In the foreground, an individual is seated on a small concrete dock by the edge of a turbulent river. The person, who appears to be a male, is dressed in a casual light blue shirt and dark pants, and is engaged in fishing. He has two fishing rods, one in use and one resting beside him, along with a small tackle box and what appears to be a container, possibly for bait or caught fish.\n\nThe background features an impressive large bridge constructed with multiple arches, which span across the river. The arches are tall and slender, with elegant pointed extensions emerging at the top of each pier. The architecture of the bridge gives it a gothic or neo-gothic appearance, suggestive of significant height and length. The surroundings are lush with dense greenery on both sides of the riverbanks, indicating a possibly secluded or less urban location.\n\nThe water itself is choppy, with white frothy waves indicating a strong current or recent rainfall swelling the river. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and somewhat introspective, juxtaposing the calm activity of fishing with the dynamic flow of the river and the monumental presence of the bridge in a natural landscape.","title":"Fishermen along the cuyahoga river near the spillway under the Ohio highway 82 bridge near Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553081","548141","552068","550317","551025","554519","554520","550217","550666","549935","542509","551024","544542","550665","550313","543628"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["bridge","fish","river","arch","fishing","bait","extension","rainfall","rod","emerge"]}
