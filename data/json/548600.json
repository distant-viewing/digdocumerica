{"path":"548600.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a large industrial area focused on what appears to be mineral mining, specifically salt evaporation ponds. The scene is marked by numerous rectangular ponds filled with water of various hues of blue and grey, reflecting different stages of the evaporation or mineral extraction process. These ponds are organized in a grid-like pattern, separated by thin strips of land or pathways, indicating deliberate, managed operations.\n\nSome of these ponds have darker water, possibly indicating deeper water or different concentrations of minerals or chemicals. Others appear more shallow, with white or light grey surfaces that could be salt or other mineral deposits. A few sections within the scene are darker, with exposed earth and compartmentalized sections that could be under preparation for future ponds or currently inactive.\n\nIn terms of activity, you can discern a tugboat-like vessel in one of the water channels, suggesting the transportation of materials or maintenance activities. The surrounding landscape features more of these pond formations extending towards the horizon, surrounded by a large body of water (possibly a lake or coastal area), further emphasizing the extensive scale of this industrial operation.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a very organized, large-scale industrial effort in a relatively isolated location, leveraging natural processes (like evaporation) for mineral extraction. The photograph provides a view into the human impact on and alteration of natural landscapes for industrial purposes.","title":"Marco Island land development on the southwest Florida coast. Many coastal developers dig channels for waterfront property lots. But since hard-to-get state permits are required to open the channels to the ocean, small \"land plugs\" are left between the channel exits and the open water. Buyers, meanwhile, are assured that such plugs are temporary.","placename":"Marco Island (Fla. : Island)","location":"Marco Island, Florida","nn1":["545627","544782","545628","548602","548601","544569","544686","551612","551556","544788","551575","552991","550405","548640","555860","551585"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pond","mineral","salt","extraction","leverage","process","water","section","alteration","scale"]}
