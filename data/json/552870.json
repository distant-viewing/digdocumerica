{"path":"552870.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image depicts three older men on a small boat. The man on the left wears glasses and a short-sleeved light blue shirt and beige pants, and he is seated with his legs crossed, facing slightly to the left. The man in the middle, who appears slightly leaned forward and engaged in conversation, sports a striped shirt in shades of blue, white, and brown, paired with grey slacks. The third man on the right, who is directly facing the camera, wears sunglasses, a dark floral printed shirt and grey pants, and also has his legs crossed.\n\nThey seem to be in a serious discussion, and the overall mood appears contemplative or engaged. In the foreground, parts of the boat's interior and accessories are visible, such as a metallic anchor and chain. Behind them, the background shows a broad expanse of calm water, extending to the horizon under an overcast sky.\n\nThe image gives a sense of leisure activity possibly mixed with a discussion of pressing matters, suggesting a scene of veteran seafarers or friends sharing time and conversation while surrounded by the serenity of the water.","title":"Lake Borgne oystermen claim release of Mississippi River flood waters has polluted their oyster beds.
