{"path":"545117.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking natural rock formation on a sandy beach. The rock, prominent in the foreground, towers vertically and has a rugged texture with a broad, stable base tapering into a narrower, rounded top. Its surface shows signs of erosion and weathering.\n\nThe rock formation is set against a serene backdrop of a dense line of trees, likely a coastal forest, which can be seen in the distance under a clear blue sky. The beach appears expansive and relatively flat, covered in patches of small debris such as driftwood, indicating recent tide activities. There's no visible presence of human activity or wildlife in the immediate area, giving the scene a tranquil and isolated mood.\n\nThe light intensity suggests the photograph was taken on a bright, sunny day, which enhances the sharp contrasts in textures and colors between the sand, rock, forest, and sky.","title":"Quinault Beach","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545130","543294","543250","545173","545126","543307","551554","544363","552890","547486","545122","543142","543237","558083","552444","542884"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","beach","formation","driftwood","tide","forest","weathering","intensity","wildlife","erosion"]}
