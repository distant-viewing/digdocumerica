{"path":"552517.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a modest, slightly weathered rural store with a primary function as a feed and trucking business, named \"Woodside Feed & Trucking.\" The structure appears to be a single-story building with a flat front and side overhangs supported by simple pillars, typical of small roadside businesses.\n\nThe front of the store is adorned with various signs advertising brands such as \"Wayne Feeds,\" \"Funk's G Hybrid,\" and beverage brands like \"Pepsi.\" The signs contribute to a colorful yet cluttered visual, suggesting the store serves multi-purpose roles possibly catering not only to agricultural needs but also providing conveniences like soft drinks.\n\nA single, old-fashioned gasoline pump stands in front, labeled with the Shell brand, indicating the store also functions as a refueling station. The pump adds a nostalgic element to the scene, indicative of earlier decades.\n\nThe facade of the building has large windows which allow a glimpse into the interior where products are likely displayed. Around the building, the ground is largely unpaved with patches of grass, and the background shows lush greenery hinting at a rural setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a snapshot of a functional community hub in a countryside location, evoking a sense of rustic charm and the simplicity of rural commercial operations. The store serves as a poignant representation of small-town commerce, integral to its local community.","title":"Du Quoin gas station","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["552518","556368","552513","555377","555640","542803","546973","557679","544373","544882","553097","552454","547805","542812","554036","554784"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["store","brand","pump","function","front","business","convenience","serve","gasoline","cater"]}
