{"path":"544441.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This is an aerial photograph that shows a vivid and detailed landscape which includes bodies of water, land areas, and both residential and industrial developments. At the top left, there is a large body of water extending into the distance, with several land-forms slightly submerged or jutting out into the water. The shoreline is irregular, containing both densely and sparsely populated areas.\n\nCloser to the center and bottom of the image, the focus shifts to a more urban-setting with visible residential districts that feature an array of houses aligned along well-planned streets and roads. These homes have varied roof colors and are surrounded by ample greenery or cleared land. Notably, in the lower part of the image, there appears to be a large, densely packed settlement, likely informal, with closely packed small structures and narrow pathways winding through them. This section is demarcated from the rest by a curved road or path.\n\nThis settlement contrasts with the more orderly and spaced-out housing in the surrounding areas, indicating a mixture of socioeconomic environments within close proximity. The overall scene is captured under bright lighting conditions, bringing out the rich textures and colors of the environment, from the deep blues of the water to the greens and earth tones of the land.","title":"Pink granite quarry at lake buchanan","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["553945","556953","550550","550555","553062","557501","553059","548636","550557","552725","557504","553792","555720","557451","555757","553938"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["land","settlement","pack","closer","demarcate","jutt","vari","curved","clear","shift"]}
