{"path":"555576.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This image captures a tranquil scene centered around an individual fishing in a secluded, natural body of water. The photograph portrays a lush landscape framed with vibrant greenery and blooms of wildflowers in the foreground.\n\nThe person, dressed in a bright red shirt and dark pants, stands at the water's edge, slightly immersed, and actively engaged in fishing. They are holding a fishing rod, extended towards the calm water, reflecting a focused demeanor amidst the serene environment.\n\nThe background features gently sloped hills, densely covered in varying shades of green vegetation. The slopes frame the curved shoreline of the pond or small lake, adding to the feeling of an enclosed, private space. The water surface is smooth, suggesting a quiet, possibly early morning or late afternoon setting, with sunlight enhancing the natural colors and contributing to a peaceful atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of human activity and the natural environment, capturing a moment of solitude and interaction with nature.","title":"Fisherman makes a catch in a body of water left in a 20-year-old strip mining pit off Route #519.","placename":"Athens (Ohio)","location":"Athens, Ohio","nn1":["550217","550666","550313","551024","554519","551025","554520","542651","542529","550665","542509","543628","553338","549935","542646","545968"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["fishing","bloom","wildflower","rod","water","pond","demeanor","slope","feeling","shoreline"]}
