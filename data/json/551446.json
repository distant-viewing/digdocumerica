{"path":"551446.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of playful interaction at a public fountain. The focal point of the image is a young child, likely a boy, standing at the edge of a fountain. He is wearing a light-colored striped tank top and has short dark hair. The child is engrossed in the activity of splashing water with his hands, his face expressing joy and concentration.\n\nBehind the boy, a woman, likely in her twenties, is partially visible. She has long dark hair and is smiling while watching the child play. The warmth in her expression suggests she might be a family member or caretaker.\n\nIn the background, there are blurred urban elements, including a red public bus or trolley, which adds to the downtown, lively setting of the scene. The bus provides a splash of color contrasting with the more muted tones of the surroundings, which include various shades of gray and green.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph conveys a sense of casual, summery enjoyment and the simple pleasure of a day out in an urban park or square, emphasizing a moment of connection and carefree leisure.","title":"Splashing water from fountain on Nicollet Mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551467","553229","551857","552702","552539","551638","551667","552540","552737","553149","553245","553219","550080","551544","549985","553192"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["fountain","child","bus","boy","twenty","pleasure","hair","downtown","member","warmth"]}
