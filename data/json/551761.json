{"path":"551761.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic garden setting and features a group of children on an outing. In the foreground, a wooden sign reading \"Garden for the Blind\" is prominently displayed, positioned in front of a well-maintained flower bed with yellow and green foliage. A concrete planter with plants also appears beside the sign.\n\nTowards the middle of the image, a group of children, approximately 7 to 10 years old, can be seen walking and standing along a path. They are dressed in typical casual attire from what appears to be the late 20th century (jeans, sweaters, and vests). The children are variously engaged; some are walking towards the camera, while others stand and appear to be waiting or talking.\n\nIn the background, thereâ€™s a small wooden structure labeled \"Visitors Center\" and beneath in a smaller sign, \"Snack Shop\". This building is surrounded by dense trees which suggest the setting is in a moderately forested area, possibly part of a larger park or botanical garden designated for educational visits like this one.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph is lively and educational, mixing elements of nature exploration with a structured learning environment. The emphasis appears to be on sensory garden experience tailored for all visitors, including those with visual impairments, as suggested by the foreground sign.","title":"High Rock Park, in Staten Island, has nature trails, wildlife preserves, and a garden for the blind.
