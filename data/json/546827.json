{"path":"546827.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a steel mill adjacent to a body of water, likely a river or lake. The sky is clear with a few scattered clouds, giving prominence to multiple thick plumes of white smoke that rise vigorously from tall stacks above the facility. These smokestacks create a striking visual contrast against the blue sky.\n\nThe steel mill itself is expansive, featuring a range of structures including several blast furnaces, large buildings, and additional chimneys. These are arrayed in a line, showing the extensive size of the operation. The architecture is utilitarian, composed primarily of metal and concrete, indicative of mid-twentieth-century industrial design.\n\nThe foreground features calm water that reflects elements of the sky and the factory. There's no visible boat traffic on the water, which places the entire focus on the industrial activity. The photo captures an essence of industrial might and the environmental impact of such large-scale operations, emphasized by the prominent emissions from the stacks. Color tones are somewhat muted, typical of photography from the mid-20th century, contributing to the historical feel of the image.","title":"Prisoners picking up trash from alongside John Hanson Highway","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["546882","557216","549966","557215","557222","557227","550344","546884","547101","549510","549967","552179","547696","550868","550956","546769"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["mill","steel","stack","might","furnace","century","prominence","operation","photography","emission"]}
