{"path":"547720.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph is framed through an opening, possibly a hole or tube, creating a vignette effect that focuses on a man seated at a control panel or desk. The image has a slightly punchy, vintage color palette, indicative of older film stock.\n\nThe man appears to be engaged in some kind of technical work, manipulating several knobs and buttons on a panel that has various meters and displays. He wears glasses and a dark sweater, seeming focused on his task. His workstation is cluttered with papers, hinting at detailed work or calculations.\n\nIn the background, there are electronic or mechanical devices that resemble a mix of receivers and filing equipment. The setting could be a laboratory or a specialist control room. The equipment appears dated, suggesting the photo could be from the mid-to-late 20th century.\n\nThe office furniture, such as chairs and desks, are made of wood, emphasizing an older, utilitarian office design. There's a minimalistic style to the room, with no personal objects or decorations visible, which could suggest a strictly professional environment focused on technical or scientific work.\n\nOverall, the composition and focus on the man through the vignette effect creates a centered, almost portrait-like feel, emphasizing the manâ€™s interaction with the technology before him.","title":"Technician at controls of \"whole body counter\" at EPA's National Environmental Research Center at Las Vegas","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["542765","549378","557317","551897","551916","548855","555332","551595","555334","551900","549364","549367","542668","552380","542659","556771"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["vignette","desk","office","panel","room","workstation","control","work","knob","stock"]}
