{"path":"545250.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a striking contrast between industrial and religious symbols. The image's primary focus is on the facade of a building, likely a church, made of reddish-brown brick. The architecture of the church includes symmetrically placed sections with angular roofs of varying heights. This building facade displays neon tube lights that spell out \"JESUS SAVES,\" and there is also a large Christian cross constructed of a darker brick pattern incorporated directly into the brickwork of the building.\n\nTo the right background of the church, there is a tall industrial chimney releasing a dense plume of white smoke into the sky. The sky is mostly clear, hinting at a clear day. The contrast between the religious messaging of the church and the industrial element of the chimney might suggest themes of faith and modernization, or perhaps a juxtaposition of spiritual and earthly enterprises.\n\nOverall, the image offers a visual commentary, intentional or incidental, on the coexistence or conflict between industrial development and religious or spiritual messaging in a modern setting. The composition of the photo—with the religious text and cross on the left and the industrial chimney on the right—further emphasizes this potential narrative or thematic exploration.","title":"A church in Point Defiance.
