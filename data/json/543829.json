{"path":"543829.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a man standing beside a stream in a natural, outdoor setting. He is positioned on the left side of the image, looking downward with his hands on his waist, possibly observing something in the water. The man is dressed in a long-sleeve shirt and khaki pants, suggesting a casual outdoor activity.\n\nIn the foreground, a dead fish is noticeable just beneath the clear water of the stream, partially surrounded by stones and aquatic plants. This element suggests a narrative between the man and the fish, possibly indicating fishing or the observation of natural wildlife.\n\nThe background features a landscape of grass and bushes with a wooden structure that might be part of a small bridge across the stream. Behind this immediate scene, there is a tree-covered hill that ascends gently, topped with evergreen trees. The sky above is mildly overcast with fluffy clouds indicating it might be a cool or temperate day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph combines natural elements and human presence, capturing a moment of interaction or contemplation in a serene outdoor setting.","title":"Fish killed by water pollution","placename":"Grand Lake (Colo.)","location":"Grand Lake, Colorado","nn1":["550313","554519","542509","550666","554520","550268","549012","542529","550317","546922","552976","550217","551024","543659","553082","545386"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["stream","fish","khaki","waist","observation","man","contemplation","wildlife","narrative","fishing"]}
