{"path":"545499.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a cityscape during a time of day when the lighting is dim, possibly at dawn or dusk, contributing to a moody and subdued atmosphere. The skyline includes several high-rise buildings, possibly office towers, standing prominently against a somewhat hazy sky. There is no direct sunlight visible, but the ambient light reveals the silhouettes and structural details of buildings.\n\nThe foreground and middle areas of the image show dense urban development. There are many smaller buildings, possibly a mix of commercial and residential structures. The arrangement appears tightly packed, indicative of a bustling city center. \n\nIn the distance, towards the horizon, the skyline meets a hilly backdrop, adding a natural contour to the otherwise urban setting. The air appears misty or polluted, somewhat obscuring the view and layering the scene with a gradient of gray and subdued tones.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a large, densely populated city viewed from an elevated perspective, during a moment of quiet, accentuated by the soft, diffuse light and the expansive view of the city leading up to the natural landscape in the background. The picture has a somewhat vintage feel, possibly suggesting it was taken several years ago.","title":"The red-orange smoke characteristic of the steel plant blurs the city skyline","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["549970","548383","548339","548384","545406","548385","549620","555736","552394","548337","548328","548360","551141","548417","549971","550186"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","skyline","subdue","year","pollute","moody","gradient","view","towers","contour"]}
