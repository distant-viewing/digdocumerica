{"path":"547582.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a neglected and decaying waterside scene. In the foreground are the remnants of a dilapidated wooden dock or pier. The wood is heavily weathered and falling apart, with planks jutting out into the water at various angles, creating a feeling of abandonment and decay. Within these remnants, there is visible debris, including old tires half-submerged in the water, which adds to the sense of neglect and pollution.\n\nIn the background, the middle plane of the image features an industrial landscape across the water. There are several large buildings, possibly factories or warehouses, characterized by their robust and utilitarian construction. The buildings are accompanied by multiple smokestacks, some of which are active, as suggested by the smoke emanating from them. The industrial structures dominate the skyline and reflect a stark contrast to the derelict foreground, perhaps indicating an active industrial area surrounding a forgotten or less maintained waterfront.\n\nThe sky is overcast, casting an even, diffuse light over the scene and contributing to the somber mood of the photograph. The body of water reflects some of this grey sky, blending the water visually with the industrial landscape in the background. Overall, the composition highlights themes of industrialization juxtaposed with environmental degradation and neglect.","title":"Providence river at bold point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547622","547581","551985","547577","551984","549300","547626","548105","547575","547584","552240","551559","547594","552154","544294","547019"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["neglect","remnant","forget","water","industrialization","plane","jut","emanate","accompany","degradation"]}
