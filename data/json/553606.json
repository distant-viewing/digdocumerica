{"path":"553606.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays two men, likely engaged in some form of outdoor manual labor, possibly related to forestry or logging. The man in the foreground is smiling at the camera and is dressed casually in a plaid, long-sleeve shirt and denim pants. He is wearing a brimmed helmet, suggesting a work environment where protective headgear is required. His rugged attire and the visible bits of dirt on his clothing indicate that he's been actively working.\n\nThe background of the image reveals another man, slightly obscured, wearing a similar protective helmet and a darker jacket. Behind him, there are trees and what appears to be a large pile of logs or timber, supporting the idea that they are in a forested or wooded area engaged in logging activities. The background is slightly blurred, placing emphasis on the man in the foreground.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken during daylight hours, with natural light casting shadows and highlighting the contours of the menâ€™s faces and attire. The overall mood conveyed by the man's smile is one of positivity and satisfaction with the work, despite the apparent physical demands of their jobs.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora.
