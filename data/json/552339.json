{"path":"552339.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a deer in a dense, lush forest setting. The deer is positioned in the center of the frame, viewed from behind with part of its body slightly turned towards the camera, giving a partial profile view of its head. Its fur appears to be of a soft brown color, with darker tones around the tail and lighter shades around the neck and head.\n\nThe surroundings are richly green, indicative of a vibrant forest in full bloom. Light seeps through the canopy, casting patches of illumination and creating a speckled light effect on the ground and the deer. Various types of foliage, including broad and slender leafed plants, are visible. Tall trees stand in the background, their trunks somewhat obscured by the undergrowth and the play of light and shadow.\n\nThe overall composition conveys a serene, somewhat secretive glimpse into the life of a deer in its natural habitat, emphasizing the tranquility and beauty of the woodland environment. The focus is shallow, adding a softness to the edges of the forest details and contributing to a sense of depth and immersion in the scene.","title":"Columbian blacktail doe browsing in the woods at Larrabee State Park on northern Puget Sound","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["542778","545902","543279","544916","554621","558368","546163","544623","543369","551367","545898","546159","544114","550803","546088","543839"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["deer","forest","head","immersion","softness","tail","fur","undergrowth","bloom","neck"]}
