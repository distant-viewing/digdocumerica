{"path":"550033.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph is focused on a lush flowering tree, which appears to be in full bloom with pink blossoms, set against a bright blue sky. The tree's branches, filled with clusters of flowers, create an intricate pattern that partially obscures the sun, casting light rays that penetrate through the foliage.\n\nIn the background, beneath the tree, is a park-like setting with grassy areas and several parked cars, suggesting an urban or suburban location. The cars appear dated, possibly from the late 20th century, aligned parallel to each other, indicating a peaceful, serene day out in a public park or a similar recreational area.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of tranquility and beauty of spring, highlighted by the vibrant blooms and sunlit backdrop, set in a daily life scene where nature meets an urban environment.","title":"Commonwealth Avenue, between Arlington and Berkeley streets","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["543551","551740","551678","551644","551781","551741","557257","551747","546533","554740","549516","545720","551746","556448","551742","554111"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["bloom","ray","park","parallel","blossom","car","spring","tree","cluster","flower"]}
