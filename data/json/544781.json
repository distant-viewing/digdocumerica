{"path":"544781.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph depicting a large industrial site nestled in a rugged, mountainous desert landscape. The central focus of the image is an expansive open-pit mine characterized by terraced excavation sections revealing various earth layers. Above and slightly to the right of the pit, plumes of white smoke or steam rise from several points, suggesting active industrial processes.\n\nSurrounding the pit are other industrial facilities including buildings, large holding tanks, and structured plots, possibly for storing or processing materials extracted from the mine. There are multiple roads in the area, including a main highway running along the bottom of the image, curving around the site and leading towards the mountains on the horizon.\n\nThe terrain itself is arid and mostly devoid of vegetation, dominated by shades of brown and gray, with the mountains providing a dramatic backdrop, their folds and ridges clearly defined against the sky. The lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft shadows cast by the mountainous contours, enhancing the three-dimensional feel of the landscape.\n\nThis image highlights the stark contrast between natural rugged landscape and human industrial activity, emphasizing the scale and impact of such operations.","title":"The kennecott mine is the largest open-cut copper mine in the world","placename":"Salt Lake City (Utah)","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","nn1":["543758","544055","544067","544785","543980","543729","544059","542513","549174","552686","544111","551065","544788","550568","544789","549177"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["pit","mine","extract","site","fold","mountain","plot","ridge","excavation","define"]}
