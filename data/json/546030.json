{"path":"546030.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat grim industrial scene, likely associated with construction or demolition. At the forefront of the image are two large cranes with their arms crossed in an \"X\" shape, dominating the upper portion of the frame. The cranes are old and appear to be made of steel with cables and winches visible along their lengths.\n\nThe background is cluttered with a mass of twisted metal and debris, suggesting a site of extensive demolition or wreckage. A red structure, possibly a mobile office or container, is visible amidst the debris, adding a spot of color to the otherwise muted scene.\n\nIn the foreground is a large puddle reflecting a clear image of the cranes and some of the debris, lending a somewhat serene element to the otherwise chaotic environment. The ground around the puddle is cracked and uneven, indicating poor or aging infrastructure.\n\nOverall, the setting appears desolate and abandoned, with overcast skies enhancing the somber mood of the scene. This photograph might be documenting a phase in an industrial process or capturing the aftermath of a structural collapse or other significant incident at a construction or demolition site.","title":"This scrap metal storage yard is located directly behind the New Orleans City Hall.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544127","547223","550907","548559","545649","547615","547621","544109","548324","545655","546833","547181","550874","545648","547583","547171"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["demolition","crane","puddle","debris","collapse","winch","incident","phase","wreckage","site"]}
