{"path":"544494.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of an industrial facility, likely a power plant, located near a large expanse of flat, undeveloped land, possibly a wetland or coastal area. The facility includes several prominent features: \n\n1. **Smokestacks**: There are multiple tall smokestacks emitting white smoke. The stacks are red and white, which is a common pattern used to increase visibility for aircraft.\n\n2. **Buildings and Structures**: Surrounding the smokestacks are various industrial buildings with blue and gray exteriors. Some structures are large and rectangular, while others appear to be more complex with multiple levels and sections. There is construction or maintenance work in progress, as indicated by the scaffoldings around some buildings.\n\n3. **Storage Tanks**: In the foreground, two large, round, flat-topped white storage tanks are prominent. These are possibly for storing liquids or gases used in or produced by the facility.\n\n4. **Water Bodies**: The plant is bordered on one side by a large body of water, which might be used for cooling purposes, waste disposal, or as a source of water for the processes within the plant. There are also smaller canals or waterways that branch from this main body of water, facilitating further water management around the site.\n\n5. **Infrastructure and Access Roads**: There are access roads around the facility with a few vehicles visible, indicating some level of activity or ongoing operations. \n\n6. **Landscape and Environment**: Beyond the immediate vicinity of the plant, the landscape transitions into a vast, flat area with minimal vegetation, which extends to the horizon. There appears to be a smoke or dust trail in the distance, suggesting either ongoing land clearing, agricultural activities, or another industrial operation.\n\n7. **Sky**: The sky is moderately cloudy, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light which casts a soft glow over the scene, enhancing the industrial atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures the scale and complexity of an industrial power plant in a location that balances man-made technology with a vast natural environment.","title":"Turkey point nuclear plant","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["544495","557305","547255","545833","557294","545841","548195","549215","548376","557384","557306","550339","556501","546087","551994","546143"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plant","facility","smokestack","power","tank","level","storage","increase","smoke","scaffolding"]}
