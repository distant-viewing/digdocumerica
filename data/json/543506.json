{"path":"543506.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image depicts three people standing on a snowy ground with a striking mountainous backdrop. The mountains in the background are snow-capped and appear to be a part of a dramatic, rugged range under a cloudy sky. The image has a vintage feel, suggested by the graininess and the color saturation typical of older film photographs.\n\nOn the left, there's a person dressed in a striped, long-sleeve shirt and wearing a hat, seemingly looking off into the distance at the mountain scenery. In the center, two individuals are engaged in conversation. One is dressed in a dark jacket and light-colored pants, while the other is wearing a white sweater and dark pants. Both appear to be gesturing with their hands, possibly discussing the view or their immediate environment.\n\nTo the right, there's a photographic camera placed on the snow, and what seems to be another camera or small bag, suggesting that this group might be involved in photography or documenting their trip. The overall feel is that of a casual, possibly spontaneous gathering of friends or travelers enjoying and capturing the grandeur of the mountain scenery.","title":"California -- mammoth mt","placename":"Mammoth Mountain (Calif.)","location":"Mammoth Mountain, California","nn1":["543383","543375","543510","543371","543385","545710","554672","542751","543638","554508","554509","543382","554257","548046","543378","554271"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["scenery","mountain","snow","graininess","traveler","pant","discuss","friend","trip","camera"]}
