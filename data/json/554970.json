{"path":"554970.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a serene and dense old-growth forest. Towering trees dominate the scene, displaying a variety of sizes and species typical of such a forest ecosystem. Many of the trees have thick, rough barks and are adorned with moss, indicating a moist environment. The understory is populated with smaller trees, ferns, and thick brush, suggesting a rich biodiversity.\n\nThe sunlight filters through the high canopy, creating a play of light and shadow on the forest floor, which adds depth and texture to the photograph. The color palette is predominantly shades of green from the leaves and moss, contrasted with the brown and gray tones of the tree trunks.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of untouched wilderness, tranquility, and the lush, moist atmosphere typical of a temperate rainforest.","title":"Dense ground cover of huckleberry and salal in old growth forest, on Milwaukee Land Company property in Clallam County, Washington.
