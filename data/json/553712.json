{"path":"553712.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man dressed in a decorative, traditional outfit, seemingly part of a cultural or festive event. He wears a white, wide-brimmed hat adorned with a ring of pink roses that matches the overall floral theme of his attire. His crisp, white shirt features ruffled detailing at the front, suggesting a formal or ceremonial style.\n\nOver his shirt, he wears a sash made of the same pink fabric and adorned with more roses, draping diagonally across his torso and back. This floral embellishment is echoed in a wrap around his waist, also festooned with roses, adding a deep richness in texture and color to his outfit. The combination of these elements gives the ensemble a vibrant, celebratory feel, perhaps indicative of a festival or a parade.\n\nThe background is slightly out of focus, directing attention primarily towards the subject. The blurred greens suggest an outdoor setting, likely in a park or a garden, which fits well with the floral theme of the man's costume. The lighting is natural, highlighting the vivid colors and intricate textures of his attire and the flowers. The composition and the attire suggest that the scene might be part of a larger celebration, possibly a floral parade or a culturally significant event emphasizing local traditions and aesthetics.","title":"Dressed for Aloha Day parade during annual Aloha Week festivities","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553711","553716","558280","556528","553717","558278","549730","553916","557797","553234","544295","558270","553709","553737","557794","548226"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["rose","parade","outfit","wrap","attire","ensemble","torso","embellishment","costume","richness"]}
