{"path":"555584.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph portrays a street scene seemingly from the mid to late 20th century. The image centers around a mildly busy road with multiple vintage vehicles in motion and parked along the sides. Prominently in the foreground, a road sign indicates \"SOUTH 9,\" classifying this view as likely looking southward on route 9.\n\nOn the road, the cars exhibit styles typical of the 1960s or 1970s, offering a nostalgic automotive display. The red car traveling towards the camera exemplifies the era's automotive design with its sleek, elongated body and bright color.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there appears to be a sidewalk with mature trees and a pedestrian, enhancing the everyday suburban feel. An electric pole and overhead wires frame the top left of the composition, intersecting with lush, green foliage.\n\nThe middle ground is dominated by a one-story building labeled \"UNITED STATES OFFICE\" in block letteringâ€”a typical small-town post office. Nestled amidst this everyday tranquility, an advertisement for \"Lee'ser's Dairy Foods\" on the right side brings a local commercial touch, aligning with the small-town American atmosphere.\n\nIn the backdrop, the scene expands to an industrial or possibly a landfill area marked by mounds of debris or materials, with large mechanical structures looming in the distance. This contrast intersects interestingly with the peaceful and mundane foreground, possibly indicating the proximity of industrial activity to residential life.\n\nThe lighting and quality of the photo suggest it might have been taken during the day, given the unobstructed sunlight casting clear shadows and highlighting the vibrant colors of the environment. This blend of daily life activities with a hint of industrial presence encapsulates a typical American street scene from the mid-20th century.","title":"The head of a huge coal company strip mining shovel is seen in the background of this picture of a street in","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["548889","547651","545216","545614","557705","554709","558028","552602","555438","547369","557155","550093","556709","551135","549113","546184"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["town","road","century","landfill","street","route","lettering","advertisement","mound","block"]}
