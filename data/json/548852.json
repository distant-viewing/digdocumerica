{"path":"548852.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man amidst a large collection of geodes and rocks, suggesting an outdoor setting possibly related to geology or rock collecting. The man, appearing in good spirits, is dressed in a plaid shirt and leans slightly forwards with his arms resting on a pile of large, rough textured stones that dominate the foreground of the image.\n\nBehind the main subject, there is a rustic building, with visible signs of wear and fading paint. This structure features a façade that includes windows and what appears to be a long, faded sign, though the text is not legible in the image. Notably, there’s a decorative element resembling a mining cart wheel mounted near the roof of the building, contributing to a thematic link with mining or geology.\n\nThe background is bright and clear, indicating a sunny day, and shows the sky above the building. The overall composition focuses closely on the interaction of the man with the geodes, framed by the intriguing backdrop of the aged building which adds a sense of place and context likely tied to a mining or rock-hounding environment.","title":"Don Madison, with his \"Imperial Rock Shop\", 14 miles west of El Centro.
