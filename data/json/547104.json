{"path":"547104.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor mining or excavation scene. It features a large dirt mound with prominent ridge lines running vertically down the slope, possibly due to erosion or machinery. The color of the mound varies from dark brown at the bottom to lighter brown tones as the slope rises. The surrounding environment appears barren around the mound, with a few leafless trees visible at the top of the hill suggesting a winter or early spring season.\n\nThere is a heavy equipment vehicle with large wheels, likely an articulated dump truck, on a flat area at the base of the mound, to the right side of the image. To the rear of the truck, there is a worker wearing a hard hat, standing and facing the truck. This indicates ongoing work or inspection.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, suggesting a dry, sunny day, which emphasizes the stark, treeless nature of the excavation site. The overall setting and equipment suggest that this is a site actively engaged in industrial or construction-related activities, involving large scale earth-moving and material handling operations.","title":"Grading","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["554765","547922","544139","544099","549240","547232","547243","552416","555638","543785","554837","545677","549245","555614","547591","549171"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mound","truck","excavation","site","rear","dump","equipment","inspection","varies","handling"]}
