{"path":"546756.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a rugged, mountainous landscape interspersed with residential and possibly some commercial buildings. The terrain is arid with sparse vegetation, primarily small bushes and few trees, indicating a desert-like environment.\n\nThe area is characterized by winding roads that snake through the hills, connecting the various properties. The buildings vary in size and design, some with flat roofs typical of desert architecture, and several have swimming pools, suggesting residential usage. The color palette of the roofs—whites, reds, and browns—blends with the natural surroundings.\n\nIn the background, the mountains stretch into the distance, their contours clearly defined under a bright sky. This suggests a sunny day with good visibility, enhancing the sharpness and color contrast in the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a developed settlement within a stark, mountainous desert landscape, showcasing how the buildings and roads have been adapted to the natural topography.","title":"North mountains-a rapidly developing area","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544816","546765","557516","553130","545625","549067","557518","552603","544400","542674","545809","553938","553059","544024","549016","542518"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["desert","sharpness","adapt","swimm","usage","roof","topography","settlement","snake","pool"]}
