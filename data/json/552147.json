{"path":"552147.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features a wide, expansive tidal flat landscape under a clear blue sky. The foreground and middle ground of the image are dominated by large patterns of curvilinear water channels that snake through the mudflats, creating intricate patterns and textures. These channels are filled with water that reflects the light, contrasting with the darker mudbanks.\n\nSurrounding the water channels, the mudflat's surface varies in color from dark blues and purples to lighter browns, suggesting a mix of wet and dry areas. This variation adds depth and complexity to the scene.\n\nIn the background, a range of snowy mountains stretches across the horizon, providing a stark, majestic backdrop to the flat terrain of the tidal area. The mountains appear serene and distant, with patches of snow visible on their peaks, enhancing the sense of untouched natural beauty.\n\nThe scene is devoid of any visible human activity or constructions, giving it a tranquil, almost otherworldly quality. This suggests that the photograph might have been taken in a remote or protected area focusing on natural landscapes and ecosystems. The overall composition of the image balanced between the sweeping lines of the water channels, the textured mudflats, and the rugged mountain skyline creates a vivid and dynamic visual experience.","title":"Skagit Flats on Puget Sound near Conway","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552145","542869","545183","553867","544687","544729","552236","545294","545656","552910","550402","545095","550399","547663","550426","555696"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mudflat","channel","mountain","pattern","water","variation","experience","purple","complexity","ecosystem"]}
