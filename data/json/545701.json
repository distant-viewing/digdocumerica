{"path":"545701.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures an engaging moment of two people sandboarding down a steep, sandy slope. The backdrop consists dominantly of a compact, deep rusty-brown sand, indicating arid, possibly desert terrain.\n\nThe two individuals are sportively engaged in an activity where they utilize boards, similar to snowboards, to slide down the slope. The topography of the slope is uneven with some patches appearing smoother and others rougher, perhaps with small rocks or hardened sand clusters that add texture to the scene. One of the individuals is slightly ahead of the other, and both are creating a trail of sand clouds behind them due to their rapid descent, lending a dynamic feel to the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests a time close to noon or early afternoon, considering the sharpness of the shadows cast by the individuals. These shadows stretch long and thin, trailing behind the sandboarders dramatically and contributing to the compositionâ€™s depth.\n\nOverall, the photograph is rich in action and texture, conveying a vivid snapshot of adventure sport in a stark, natural landscape.","title":"Sand near entrance to the park","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544869","549037","545102","545199","543512","553058","543248","543842","545767","547717","554251","545782","550017","543097","554252","545772"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["slope","sand","descent","sharpness","individual","topography","board","trail","adventure","sport"]}
