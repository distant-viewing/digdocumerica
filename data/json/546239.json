{"path":"546239.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, open landfill area with significant environmental activity. In the foreground, a large bulldozer, painted in orange and driven by a visible operator, is working to move mounds of earth. The operator, a man wearing a light-colored hat and shirt, actively controls the vehicle amidst a dusty, rugged setting.\n\nThe surroundings are overwhelmed with mounds of garbage and debris that stretch across the entire landscape, hinting at the vast scale of waste. Numerous hills made up both of soil and trash cover the area, containing a mix of indiscernible refuse and pieces of domestic waste, potentially including plastics, fabrics, and other discarded materials.\n\nThe sky above is clear but slightly hazed, possibly due to the dust and emissions from the ongoing operations. In the background, further construction and landfill machinery are at work, silhouette against the skyline, reinforcing the ongoing nature of the operations aimed at managing and containing the waste.\n\nThe scene conveys a strong sense of industrial effort involved in waste management, highlighting environmental challenges associated with large-scale refuse disposal and land reclamation.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
