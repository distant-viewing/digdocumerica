{"path":"554096.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a row of nine fish, each suspended from their tails, displayed in a descending left to right manner. The fish vary in color from pale yellow to deep pink, and they are photographed against a dark background, emphasizing the vividness of their scales and textures. Each fish carries a small piece of paper attached to its body with a rubber band; the papers each display a hand-drawn symbol that appears distinctive for each fish. The image projects a blend of biological documentation and artistic interpretation, suggesting that these fish might be part of a scientific study or an artistic exhibit. The overall composition of the photograph is carefully arranged, creating a compelling and somewhat surreal visual sequence of marine life.","title":"Fish auction is a daily event.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["543189","545063","546792","542892","553258","551364","546784","553878","548142","554093","547704","544987","555560","546138","551592","549340"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","paper","documentation","sequence","interpretation","exhibit","rubber","tail","pink","symbol"]}
