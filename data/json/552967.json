{"path":"552967.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts a deserted urban alleyway lined with dilapidated brick buildings. The setting gives an impression of neglect and abandonment typically found in industrial or former industrial areas. The buildings are uniformly constructed with worn-out red bricks, and many of the windows and doors are either boarded up or absent, leaving dark, empty openings. The facades are marked with graffiti, including tags and other markings that add to the sense of urban decay.\n\nThe alley is narrow, with a concrete ground that shows signs of wear and patches of debris, including small stones and dirt. Utility poles with multiple wires are visible, running parallel to the buildings, contributing to the industrial feel of the scene. The sky is visible at the top of the frame, showing a clear blue, which contrasts starkly with the red and brown tones of the buildings and the gray concrete.\n\nThe perspective of the photograph is from one end of the alley looking straight down its length, providing a deep view into the urban corridor, which ends in a bright area that suggests an opening or intersection with a larger street. \n\nOverall, the image captures a raw and gritty aspect of urban environment, often associated with areas in need of renewal or in the process of being forgotten.","title":"The chicano area, or second ward, is slowly giving way to urban renewal.
