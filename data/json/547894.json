{"path":"547894.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a dilapidated industrial building facade. The building has a rectangular frame filled with large, broken windows. The window frames are metallic and painted red, and many of the glass panes are shattered, leaving gaping holes.\n\nThe walls of the building have layers of peeling paint, showcasing a range of colors from blue to yellow and bare concrete visible in places, contributing to a sense of decay and abandonment. An array of warning and directional signs are painted directly onto the building; one sign reads \"Positively NO BUMPING,\" another reads \"ONE WAY,\" and there is also a warning that says “Beware of Dog.” The black stenciled lettering of the signs has faded over time, reflecting weathering and neglect.\n\nAbove the main entrance, there is a curved, rusted metal sheet, adding to the visually hazardous appearance of the building. There's a smaller door visible below this metal sheet that is partially ajar, suggesting infrequent or unauthorized use.\n\nThe upper part of the building features a skeletal metal frame, possibly part of the roof structure, exposed against the sky. The condition and composition of the building indicate it might once have been part of a factory or similar industrial facility, now long disused and exposed to the elements.\n\nThe photograph captures the texture and contrasting colors vividly, emphasizing themes of industrial decay and the passage of time.","title":"Entrance to abandoned parachute jump tower at Steeplechase amusement park on Coney Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547985","551586","550023","543330","544656","553555","553479","550129","557348","557139","557347","547969","557344","556351","544719","543258"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["warning","sheet","building","decay","metal","sign","hole","pane","frame","time"]}
