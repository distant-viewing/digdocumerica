{"path":"546471.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph presents a somewhat dimly lit interior, most likely an office or gallery space. The foreground is dominated by a large, dark square painting or art piece mounted on a white wall. The painting appears to be monochrome, possibly black or very dark in color, framed modestly or possibly unframed but with a subtle border.\n\nTo the right of the image, in a separate room visible through a passageway, there's an office setting where one man is seated at a desk, appearing to engage in some sort of paperwork or desk-bound task. He is dressed in a light-colored shirt. In the same room, behind the man at the desk, another individual is seated, partially obscured, and also seems to be focused on some paperwork.\n\nThe lighting of the room where the individuals are seems brighter compared to the area where the art is hung, primarily illuminated by a hanging light fixture visible near the top of the frame, which features multiple bulbs. The contrast in lighting could be emphasizing the art piece, making it a focal point of interest, yet it remains enigmatic and understated.\n\nThe general atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of quiet concentration and simplicity, typical of a professional environment. The plainness of the walls and the minimalistic hanging of the artwork suggest a setting that values focus and perhaps discretion.","title":"Cummins corporate office","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546580","546486","546482","546475","546572","555290","546479","557037","551897","546558","557695","552647","555332","548864","557038","551899"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["desk","art","paperwork","painting","room","office","value","bulb","piece","artwork"]}
