{"path":"555210.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a vertically oriented natural scene depicting the lush, green, and somewhat mystical environment that could be interpreted as a part of a dense forest or rainforest. Central to the composition is a thin, delicate waterfall that cascades down the center of the image. The waterfall divides the scene roughly in half, with water flowing visibly down what appears to be a dark, possibly moss-covered rock surface.\n\nThe surrounding vegetation is dense and diverse, featuring a variety of plants including long-bladed grasses hanging downwards, rounding fern-like leaves, and clusters of small white flowers creating bright focal points. The moisture-loving moss clings heavily to the stones and roots, tinting the scene with vibrant shades of green and creating a feeling of a damp, lush environment.\n\nAbove and around the waterfall, there is an overhanging of roots and other vegetation that appears to grow from the top of the rocky surface, suggesting that the water source may be higher than can be seen in the frame. The foreground and edges of the image blur slightly, indicating a shallow depth of field that emphasizes the waterfall and the closest plants.\n\nThe overall impression is one of tranquility and natural beauty, with the composition leading the viewer's eye through various textures and shades of green, accented by the water's graceful descent and the delicate white flowers. It's a rich portrayal of a serene, secluded spot in nature, untouched and flourishing.","title":"Stream in a 60-year-old age class timberland in the Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
