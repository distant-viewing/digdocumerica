{"path":"546634.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene involving law enforcement and a civilian. On the left side, a police officer is seated on a motor scooter marked with \"DC 1 25\" and branded with \"POLICE.\" The officer, wearing a traditional police uniform and helmet, appears attentive to the situation at hand.\n\nStanding in the center and right of the frame are two more police officers engaged in a conversation with a civilian woman. The woman, seen in profile and dressed in a dark coat, is facing one of the standing officers who is holding some papers, possibly reviewing them. The second standing officer is partially visible on the right side of the image, observing the conversation.\n\nThe backdrop includes a section of a city street with a building that hosts \"Jim's Carry-Out\" restaurant, recognizable by its signage. The atmosphere appears somber under an overcast sky, which is subtly illuminated, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. The photograph conveys a sense of routine police work, possibly involving a traffic or document-related inquiry on a city street.","title":"Officer writing report on a regular disturber of the peace","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546637","546663","546633","546654","546645","546658","547205","546661","546641","554354","546657","546647","551941","546611","542758","546635"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["officer","police","street","inquiry","enforcement","review","law","conversation","restaurant","motor"]}
