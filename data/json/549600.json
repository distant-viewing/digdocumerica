{"path":"549600.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"In this photograph, there are two individuals engaging with scientific or monitoring equipment on a platform over water. The scene features a large mechanical arm painted in a faded yellow. This arm is equipped with a pulley system that is currently hoisting a cylindrical metal container out of the water. A woman and a man are present in the picture.\n\nThe woman, dressed in a raincoat with a bright reddish-pink hue, is observing the equipment attentively. She stands near the edge of the platform, facing towards the mechanical arm.\n\nThe man is interacting directly with the equipment, manipulating controls or managing the retrieval of the metal container. He wears a striped shirt and dark pants. His focus is on the task at hand, evidenced by his hunched posture as he works.\n\nThe platform is outlined with a safety railing and painted in red, adding a vibrant contrast to the yellow mechanical arm. The environment around them is noticeably calm, with the water surface smooth and reflecting a muted, grayish sky.\n\nThis photograph likely depicts scientific or environmental surveillance, possibly related to water quality monitoring or marine research, indicated by the setup and handling of specialized equipment in a waterfront setting.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical, biological, and meteorological conditions in Lake Superior.
