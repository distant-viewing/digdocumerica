{"path":"556669.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a crowded subway train, viewed from the outside through a window. The image is framed by the dark exterior of the train, which creates an enclosed view into the passenger area.\n\nThe interior of the subway train is dimly lit and filled with a variety of passengers. The passengers, who display diverse expressions ranging from disinterest to weariness, are holding onto overhead handles or straps, indicating that the train is likely in motion. Some passengers are looking at the camera, while others are gazing away, lost in their thoughts or perhaps avoiding the gaze of the viewer.\n\nThe environment inside the car appears somewhat dated, possibly hinting at a setting in the past few decades, suggested by the clothing styles and hairdos of the passengers, such as collared shirts, sweaters, and different hairstyles typical of mid-to-late 20th century fashion.\n\nSigns and advertisements can be faintly seen on the walls above the windows inside the train, adding to the realism of daily commuter life. The overall mood conveyed is one of everyday routine and the private contemplation often found in public transit settings.","title":"Passengers pack the Lexington avenue line subway during rush hour.  In 1970 the New York transit authority reported a total of 2.1 million passengers used the system daily.  There are 232 miles of track making it the longest subway in the world.  Despite the crucial importance of the system to the city, New York voters have refused to authorize new funds for improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be increased to cover transit authority costs","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554327","556780","554326","556665","554328","548256","556691","556817","556813","548261","556661","556653","556698","554370","556671","554324"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["passenger","train","subway","gaze","realism","outside","lose","commuter","strap","hairstyle"]}
