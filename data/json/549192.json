{"path":"549192.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a striking contrast between nature and industrial activity. In the foreground, bright yellow wildflowers stand out, with a butterfly perched delicately on one of the flower stalks. The flowers and butterfly are sharp and vivid against the backdrop of industrialization.\n\nThe background shows a massive open-pit mine, characterized by deep, dark layers of earth and curved excavation lines. The pit displays various shades of brown and black, signifying different mineral layers or the depth of excavation. Towards the center of the pit, there are large industrial vehicles, possibly trucks, evident from their significant size even at such a distance, emphasizing the vast scale of the mining operation.\n\nRoads wind around the pit, and a large, opened area has patches of water, reflecting the environmental impact of mining activities. The overall composition juxtaposes the small, delicate life forms in the foreground against the grand scale and disruptive presence of human industrial activity in the background. The image is a powerful visual narrative about the intersection of natural beauty and environmental modification.","title":"Butterfly and flowers at the edge of the Acme Coal Company strip mine","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549241","549148","549167","544418","549242","549174","550568","556400","554815","543857","549172","554768","542552","544111","544100","544112"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["pit","butterfly","excavation","mining","flower","modification","layer","industrialization","mine","scale"]}
