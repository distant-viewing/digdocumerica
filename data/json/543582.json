{"path":"543582.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape dominated by a striking mountain backdrop and a dense forest foreground. The mountain, covered partially by snow, stands majestically with rugged slopes and peaks, indicating possibly high alpine terrain. The upper section of the image shows the bright, snow-covered peaks contrasting sharply against a clear, blue sky.\n\nThe middle and foreground feature a lush, leafy forest composed of tall trees with vibrant green foliage. These appear to be a variety of coniferous trees mixed with some broad-leaf trees, suggesting a diverse woodland habitat. Below the canopy is a bright green grassy area, peppered with wildflowers and patches that glow with sunlight filtering through the trees.\n\nLight plays a significant role in setting the atmosphere of this scene. The sunlight dapples through the sparse tree cover onto the grass, creating a pattern of light and shade that adds depth and texture to the scene. This interplay of light suggests it may be early morning or late afternoon when the sunlight is softer and angled.\n\nThe image is framed such that the forest leads the viewer's eye towards the mountain, creating a natural depth and drawing attention to the contrast between the verdant forest and the rugged, snowy mountain. The overall composition is tranquil and picturesque, typifying a pristine wilderness scene.","title":"\"meadow\"","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["555657","543569","555681","550602","555656","544936","548025","554461","554531","554398","554402","555660","555110","554459","550629","550516"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","forest","peak","sunlight","snow","typify","pepper","dapple","tree","cover"]}
