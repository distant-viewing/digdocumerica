{"path":"551701.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures an older woman tending to plants on a table in a lush garden setting. She is wearing a knee-length dress with a bold, geometric black and white pattern. Her attention is focused on arranging or caring for the small plants in front of her.\n\nThe garden itself is richly decorated with greenery and blooming flowers. It appears to be enclosed by high walls and fences that contribute to a cozy, private atmosphere. There are several varieties of flowers, visible in vibrant colours such as red, pink, and yellow, with a particular abundance of roses. Hanging planters add to the vertical layers of the garden's flora.\n\nIn the background, the walls of surrounding buildings, painted in a light muted color, are visible. They have a slightly weathered look, providing a contrast to the fresh, lively garden. The garden also includes elements like a wrought iron bench, chairs, and a garden fence, which enhance its quaint and charming character.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a serene moment of gardening, set in a beautifully maintained urban garden, showcasing a pleasant interaction between the person and nature.","title":"Meg Wehlberg, editor with a nearby publishing house and an ardent gardener, has created this flowering oasis back of her East 30th Street house.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551702","551728","551705","556168","551744","551748","557681","550760","551743","551620","552401","550063","551625","551104","546505","551780"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["garden","fence","flower","rose","planter","abundance","gardening","wall","iron","plant"]}
