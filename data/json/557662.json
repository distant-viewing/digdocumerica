{"path":"557662.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph showcases a vivid and colorful artistic rendition of a quaint and picturesque European town square, referred to in the text as \"Die Weißen Rössl\" (The White Horse Inn) or \"White Horse Square.\" The image appears to be a painting that captures a charming, detailed village, possibly conceptualized for a theatrical set or a themed environment.\n\nStarting from the bottom, the foreground features neatly arranged rows of outdoor seating with red and white umbrellas, suggesting a cafe or dining area. A cart filled with red flowers adds a pop of color and liveliness to the scene. The layout progresses to include several half-timbered houses with steeply pitched roofs and prominent gables, typical of traditional German architecture.\n\nEach building is detailed with various elements like dormer windows, shuttered windows, and flowering window boxes adding to the idyllic atmosphere of the village. A prominent feature in the layout is the collection of spires and towers that rise above the roofs, contributing to the fairytale-like ambiance of the painted scene.\n\nThe background is simpler, employing broad strokes of blue and green to suggest a distant landscape possibly representing hills or a rural setting. This creates a contrasting backdrop that accentuates the vivid colors and intricate details of the town square.\n\nOverall, the image is rich in architectural detail and color, evoking a sense of a historical or thematic recreation designed to transport viewers to a charming European village setting.","title":"Drawings of White Horse Square, a proposed quarter-acre development on the main street of Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. The shops will be located around the Wurst Haus (restaurant) in the foreground, which already occupied the site, and the City Hall (background at extreme upper right). Several independent developers paid $200,000 for the site, which will be developed with an alpine theme that was chosen by the business district during an earlier Renovation.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557725","557656","554458","557654","551790","551794","557663","557806","550271","551799","553326","551866","549659","551788","550115","554281"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["village","square","layout","town","window","liveliness","cafe","gable","pop","painting"]}
