{"path":"543777.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of farmland irrigation at sunset. The image primarily revolves around a male figure standing in a field, who is engaged in the activity of manually irrigating the crops. He is holding a shovel and directing a flow of water from what appears to be a small irrigation channel into a flooded section of the field. The water sprayed by his action catches the sunlight, creating a bright, sparkling effect.\n\nThe field is abundant with lush, green crops, possibly young vegetables or similar plants, that spread across the foreground. The texture of the soil is wet and dark, indicative of recent watering. The background features a flat, expansive landscape under a vast, clear sky that gently transitions into warm sunset hues. Silhouettes of distant mountains or hills line the horizon, adding a sense of depth and isolation to the scene.\n\nThe composition of the photograph uses the backlighting of the setting sun to silhouette the farmer against a bright sky, emphasizing the streaming water and giving the scene a feeling of energy and vitality. This backlighting also beautifully highlights the edges of the crops and water, creating a contrast between the darkness of the earth and the illumination of the water and sky.","title":"Worker irrigates alfalfa field with water from the San Miguel River","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["554014","553432","548875","548869","548877","548950","544371","543650","548953","553652","546825","554015","546949","548991","549178","548979"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["crop","irrigation","backlighting","field","sunset","streaming","vitality","farmer","vegetable","water"]}
