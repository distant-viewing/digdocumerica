{"path":"544285.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph portrays a rustic and scenic view dominated by a long wooden walkway leading to a house. The walkway is composed of weathered wooden planks supported by pillars and stretches from the foreground to the midground of the image. The edge of the walkway has occasional posts protruding vertically, indicating it might have once had a railing or similar structure.\n\nThe house at the end of the walkway appears to be aged, with a tin roof that shows signs of rust and discoloration. A small, elevated porch surrounds part of the house, featuring railings and several support columns. The structure has visible wooden siding and appears somewhat weathered, enhancing its rustic charm.\n\nThe surrounding environment is lush and overgrown, with tall grasses and wildflowers encroaching on the walkway. The yard around the house is slightly more manicured, suggesting it is maintained to some extent. Dense foliage and trees form a canopy around and behind the house, suggesting a secluded, woodsy location.\n\nOverall, this scene conveys a sense of tranquility and a bygone rural lifestyle, evoking feelings of nostalgia and simplicity. The composition's focus on the long walkway draws the viewer's eye towards the house, inviting speculation about its history and the lives of those who might dwell there. The vibrant greens of the vegetation contrast with the weathered tones of the wooden structures, creating a rich, natural palette.","title":"House on Mississippi River batture","placename":"Plaquemines Parish (La.)","location":"Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana","nn1":["545041","555581","555632","558110","551091","546559","557640","557646","554822","548295","554788","558102","557691","544811","547658","553458"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["walkway","house","railing","tin","encroach","discoloration","extent","support","nostalgia","lifestyle"]}
