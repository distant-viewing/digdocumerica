{"path":"548394.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of Central Park in New York City, showcasing a large, lush area surrounded by a dense urban environment. The park itself acts as a natural haven amidst the city's architecture, with various shades of green trees and pathways distinctly visible.\n\nIn the center of the image is a large, reflective body of water, reflective amidst the greenery, likely one of Central Park's several reservoirs. Below this reservoir, there are well-maintained fields, likely used for sports or general recreation, and a series of crisscrossing pathways for pedestrians.\n\nThe park is framed by a winding road on the left side of the image, leading down and out of view, providing a stark contrast with the natural and more organized elements of the park.\n\nIn the background, the high-rise buildings of Manhattan rise up, forming a skyline filled with various geometrical shapes of the city's famous skyscrapers, indicating a bustling urban life just beyond the tranquility of the park. Despite the high energy of the city, the photo conveys a serene atmosphere within Central Park itself, serving as an oasis of calm.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes the natural beauty of the park against the manufactured grandeur of the New York City skyline, emphasizing the park's role as a peaceful retreat in the heart of a vibrant metropolis.","title":"Central Park, looking south towards Lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547707","548406","551767","548323","547784","548395","553469","550165","555734","550052","553672","551776","549516","557257","550075","557271"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["park","reservoir","pathway","city","skyline","metropolis","oasis","heart","retreat","rise"]}
