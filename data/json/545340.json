{"path":"545340.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph depicts a large collection of old and damaged vehicles stacked in a salvage yard. The scene is composed of various models of cars and trucks, many of which are rusted and feature dented bodies, chipped paint, and broken windows. These vehicles are piled on top of each other in a somewhat disorganized manner, creating layers of metal and automotive parts.\n\nThe automobiles span different eras, as evidenced by their varying designs and sizes. Several have distinctive design features, such as tail fins and rounded body shapes, indicating their vintage nature. Some vehicles are more visible than others, with the nearer ones displaying more detail, such as specific damage to bumpers and grills.\n\nThe environment around the pile of cars appears to be a dry, open field with sparse vegetation. The soil is visible, and there are few green plants scattered around, suggesting a harsh or arid landscape. The background is mostly clear with blue skies, which enhances the feeling of an expansive outdoor setting.\n\nThe composition leverages a sense of abandonment and decay, reflecting a common scenario in vehicle scrapyards where cars that are no longer functional or needed are deposited. The setting and state of the vehicles suggest an emphasis on the passage of time and the eventual obsolescence of man-made objects.","title":"Junked autoMobiles are piled three deep along fence.","placename":"Santa Fe (N.M.)","location":"Santa Fe, New Mexico","nn1":["555492","545303","545365","555491","542656","542590","553005","552739","552999","543166","546268","553006","553004","547476","546249","552738"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["vehicle","obsolescence","salvage","car","fin","grill","scrapyard","bumper","tail","automobile"]}
