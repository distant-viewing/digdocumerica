{"path":"556879.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy railway line scene, likely involved in track maintenance or construction. The composition includes a focus on a large construction train, which is equipped with what appears to be track-laying or maintenance machinery. The train, emblazoned with \"RPM'S\" on the side, is hauling numerous identical, open-top orange railcars, which may be loaded with materials like gravel.\n\nIn the foreground, we see multiple rail workers engaged in different activities. Most of the workers wear protective clothing such as helmets, and one is seen bending towards the track, possibly inspecting or working on it. The presence of these workers indicates ongoing construction or maintenance work.\n\nThe setting includes railway tracks extending into the distance, under a large overhead signal gantry displaying red signals, indicating a stop or caution. The environment around the tracks is semi-rural with shrubs, small trees, and an open sky. In the far background, another figure can be seen walking along the tracks, adding to the depiction of a work-heavy environment on the railways.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of active railway construction or maintenance, highlighting the necessary ongoing upkeep required for railway systems. The overall atmosphere is one focused on industry and labor.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, with a car that holds new quarter mile long sections of rail which will replace the old track. The company in 1974 had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of railroad track. Maximum safe speed on virtually all the Southern tracks is 60 miles per hour. Another railroad company has some tracks which have a speed limit of eight miles per hour.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556894","556878","556901","556869","556871","556899","556885","556889","556886","556881","556860","556883","556872","556877","556902","556895"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","track","maintenance","construction","worker","signal","train","railcar","work","haul"]}
