{"path":"550712.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures the exterior of a large industrial building. The side of the building is prominently displayed, dominated by a clean, white facade. On this facade, there are bold, black letters reading \"INTERNATIONAL PAPER\" and a large, circular logo with a stylized \"A\" within it, located just to the left of the text. The logo and text are mounted onto the building's surface, which has horizontal siding details.\n\nThere is a clear sky visible above the building, suggesting a fair weather condition. The angle of the shot is slightly upward, focusing on the top part of the building and minimizing ground level distractions. There's a distinct industrial feel to the architecture and the style of the signage, typical of corporate industrial sites.\n\nNo people, vegetation, or other distinguishing environmental features are visible in the image. The photo appears to have been taken during the daytime, given the natural light and shadows present on the building's facade.","title":"Sign at the International Paper Company mill at Jay on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550883","553399","554702","549727","551578","553451","549726","550714","553892","550722","550308","557392","546083","550856","546236","552207"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["facade","logo","building","text","distraction","daytime","siding","letter","shot","exterior"]}
