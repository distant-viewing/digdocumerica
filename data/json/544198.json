{"path":"544198.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively indoor scene possibly within a home or casual gathering space. The image features three individuals participating in what appears to be a casual and playful moment.\n\nOn the left, a young man is the focal point. He is shirtless, wearing dark-colored jeans with a prominent belt, and appears to be lightly dancing or motioning humorously. His right hand holds a dark beer bottle, which is tilted as if he’s pretending to pour it, and his left hand rests on his hip. He has a carefree expression, smiling and looking towards the woman seated before him.\n\nThe woman, positioned in the center of the photograph and slightly blurred indicating movement, is seated and turned to her left to look up at the man. She wears a yellow top, and her posture and expression suggest she is engaged and amused by the man’s antics. \n\nTo the right, another individual, whose back is mostly towards the camera, watches the scene. This person is also shirtless and has short hair, indicating it might be a young boy or a woman.\n\nThe room is warmly lit, likely by natural light coming from the large windows visible in the background. The interior has a lived-in feel, with various small items and furnishings that suggest a domestic setting. Dominant colors are the yellow walls and the wooden tones of the furniture, which add to the warmth of the scene.","title":"Fisherman's family of Bayou Gauche, in the Louisiana wetlands","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545330","552972","557353","543041","551279","546025","553536","557352","552612","545985","558313","545496","551342","543511","553122","545970"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["woman","furnishing","hip","beer","furniture","expression","warmth","hand","bottle","belt"]}
