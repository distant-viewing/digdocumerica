{"path":"554675.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving two men engaging in the activity of processing a large game animal, specifically a deer, in an outdoor setting. The deer is suspended from a horizontal wooden pole supported by trees, a common arrangement for game processing in the field.\n\nOne man, standing on a red gasoline can for added height, is actively involved in handling the deerâ€™s front leg or shoulder area, possibly preparing to skin or butcher the animal. He wears a dark jacket, trousers, and a cap, and has a rugged outdoor appearance.\n\nThe second man, standing beside the first, is observing or assisting in the process. He is similarly dressed in a dark outfit that includes a jacket and a cap. Both men appear to be dressed suitably for outdoor work and possibly hunting, with the first man wearing gloves, hinting at the messy nature of the task.\n\nIn the background, there is a stark contrast with the rustic activity depicted, as there is a white and brown camper trailer. This indicates that the location might be a campground or a temporary hunting camp. The surrounding environment includes bare trees and a leafless underbrush, suggesting that it might be autumn or early spring.\n\nThe ground is muddy with visible tire tracks, probably from the movement of the trailer or other vehicles, emphasizing the outdoor and utilitarian nature of the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of traditional outdoor activity related to hunting and game processing, set against a semi-rural backdrop. It showcases a slice of life from a specific culture and time, highlighting the practical and communal aspects of such activities.","title":"Local environmental conservation officers check a buck deer kill by hunters at the start of the season in the New York Adirondack Forest Preserve area of Moose River Plains, the plains is a state primitive recreational area.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554676","552587","546132","546094","554934","552588","546133","546137","545980","552586","554680","554682","554943","554944","554925","554940"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["deer","game","hunting","trailer","animal","man","processing","cap","underbrush","gasoline"]}
