{"path":"548284.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a striking and somewhat unusual scene featuring a monarch butterfly on a white, granular surface that resembles snow. The butterfly, positioned towards the left side of the image, displays its intricate pattern of black, white, and orange markings across its open wings. Its delicate body and thin antennae are also clearly visible, contrasting sharply with the startling white background.\n\nThe surface on which the butterfly rests is textured, with a scattering of small shadows and indents that suggest the granular quality of snow or a similarly textured substance. The background of the photo is uniformly the same white and textured material, focusing all attention on the butterfly itself.\n\nThe lighting in the image appears natural, highlighting the vibrant colors and detailed pattern of the butterfly's wings, while also casting slight shadows around its body, enhancing the three-dimensionality of the scene. The overall composition is simple yet compelling, with the stark contrast between the natural beauty and vivid colors of the butterfly and the monochromatic and unusual setting of the white ground.","title":"Injured butterfly on the beach at Destin, on the Gulf of Mexico","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548281","551381","548283","544566","544619","544618","544553","544479","544603","544514","544517","547818","543603","544614","554839","543271"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","wing","snow","antennae","scattering","substance","marking","pattern","surface","shadow"]}
