{"path":"554609.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph presents a serene lakeside scene framed by overhanging branches with lush, blurry leaves in the foreground. A person, visible in profile, paddles a canoe gently across the still, reflective waters of the lake. The canoe is slim and elongated, colored in white with a yellow tip and end, creating a vivid contrast with the darker shades of the lake.\n\nBehind the canoe, the lake is bordered by a dense array of trees showing various shades of green, suggesting a thick, untouched forest. The reflection of the trees in the water enhances the sense of calm and isolation conveyed by the image. The sky, slightly visible through the tree canopy, appears overcast, casting an even, soft light across the scene and enriching the subdued color palette mostly consisting of greens, blues, and earth tones.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a moment of tranquil solitude and the natural beauty of a secluded lakeside environment, emphasizing the peaceful coexistence of human and nature.","title":"Young boy canoeing on twitchell lake, framed by red spruce branches in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544031","554474","550674","557562","550822","554472","553409","550768","554471","557571","554466","550324","553806","545229","551207","543579"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","lake","green","paddle","tip","lakeside","overhang","enrich","coexistence","profile"]}
