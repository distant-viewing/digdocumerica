{"path":"544633.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a dense mobile home community. Each home is arranged in a grid pattern, separated by narrow roads and small patches of grass. The mobile homes are predominantly rectangular and similar in size and style, featuring flat or mildly sloped roofs. Many of the homes have small, covered attachments that serve as car ports or porches.\n\nThe color scheme of the community is fairly monochromatic, primarily composed of light gray and white hues, with some homes exhibiting slight variations in shade. A few of the homes have add-ons like small decks or awnings in different colors, and several have vehicles parked beside them. Compact cars and vans are visible throughout the locality, parked along the streets or under the sheltered carports.\n\nThe area around the community shows no significant vertical structures; it seems to be predominantly residential or possibly semi-rural, with wide-open spaces visible towards the borders of the image. The overall layout is highly organized, emphasizing functionality and efficient use of space.","title":"Huge trailer park encroaches upon the boundaries of the Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["558296","556476","557339","556468","558300","552508","544147","552482","544629","548762","544550","553125","553934","556417","546399","544149"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["home","community","locality","attachment","awning","van","scheme","port","functionality","variation"]}
