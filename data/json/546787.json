{"path":"546787.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph shows the decaying remnants of a large wooden shipwreck, partially submerged in a body of water. The vessel appears old and dilapidated, with much of its structure broken down and scattered into various pieces. The wood is heavily weathered, with signs of rotting and collapse, indicating it has been exposed to the elements for a long time. The hull of the ship is barely intact, with large gaps and missing sections revealing the inner framework, which is also in a state of disrepair.\n\nThe ship is positioned in a relatively calm body of water, surrounded by bits of debris and other smaller remnants of wooden structures, possibly parts of the ship or other derelict vessels. Reflections of the ship and surrounding objects can be seen on the water's surface, adding to the atmosphere of abandonment.\n\nIn the background, a modern bridge extends across the water, suggesting a contrast between the forgotten, historic vessel and ongoing modern life. The surrounding area includes lush greenery along the shores, enhancing the natural, somewhat overgrown setting around the wreck. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of nostalgia and decay, highlighting the inevitable decline of man-made objects when left to nature's devices.","title":"Abandoned boats in Curtis Creek","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["543879","544181","548071","552158","547584","549306","547572","552128","551533","557995","548105","551979","547581","547594","551978","546887"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["ship","vessel","remnant","decay","forget","collapse","decline","nostalgia","gap","miss"]}
