{"path":"551045.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a towboat navigating a narrow channel presumably beside a lock or in a canal-like setting. The towboat, named \"COALBURG,\" is substantial and robust, painted primarily in white, with a darker base, equipped with typical marine communication and navigation instruments on the top. The boat is pushing a barge filled with a black substance which could likely be coal, given the boat's name.\n\nThe surrounding environment features rugged, densely wooded hills that seem to close in on the river, emphasizing the narrowness of the channel. The water is turbulent around the boat, indicating the power of the towboat's engines working against the river's flow. The sky is overcast, which casts a moody hue over the scene, and the water reflects this with a murky brown color typically seen in riverine environments. \n\nThere's also some infrastructure visible, including a bright yellow barrier that lines one side of the channel, possibly for safety and to prevent overrunning the channel edge. No people are visible in the image, focusing purely on the operation of the boat and its interaction with the natural and built environment.","title":"A coalburg tug and eight coal barges go downstream through the london locks, one of three lock systems on the kanawha river.
