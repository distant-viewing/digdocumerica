{"path":"544593.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a lush, dense wetland ecosystem, likely a swamp or marsh, filled with abundant vegetation and water. The foreground prominently features a pool of dark, still water, reflecting some of the flora and sky. This pool is fringed by large, broad-leafed plants, possibly water lilies or similar aquatic plants, contributing to the rich biodiversity typical of such an environment.\n\nSeveral tree trunks, possibly cypress or another water-tolerant species, occupy the middle ground. They rise straight up and are surrounded at their bases by water, hinting at a flooded landscape. These trees have textured bark and some are covered with climbing or hanging vegetation, possibly mosses or vines, adding to the feel of a dense and humid habitat.\n\nIn the background, the trees become denser and darker, reinforcing the depth and thickness of this wetland. The light, seemingly filtering through the canopy, casts dappled reflections on the water and highlights patches of the foliage, providing a sense of the sun's position and the time of day, likely either morning or late afternoon.\n\nOverall, the image captures the serene yet wild aspect of a swampy area, emphasizing the ecosystem's crucial role in supporting diverse plant and aquatic life. The scene might also suggest the challenges and tranquility of such environments, often inaccessible and untouched by human activity.","title":"Loop road","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544585","544589","550783","544541","550785","550786","546205","547509","546059","544549","547532","547589","545033","550345","544595","553856"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pool","wetland","ecosystem","plant","water","thickness","vine","lily","swamp","basis"]}
