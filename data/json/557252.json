{"path":"557252.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a water body, possibly a river or stream, filled with what appears to be foam or froth. The foam is unevenly spread across the surface, creating abstract, fluid patterns, highlighting a mixture of white, navy, and cyan hues. The source of this accumulation isn't clear from the image, but it could be natural or the result of water agitation downstream of a visible small waterfall or rapid on the upper left side of the frame.\n\nThe surrounding environment suggests a natural setting with dark, lush vegetation faintly visible in the background, contributing a rich, deep green contrast to the predominantly blue and white of the water. The lighting suggests this photo was taken during a time of day with strong sunlight, cast from an angle that enhances the texture and contrast of the foam on the water.\n\nOverall, the composition is rich in textures and colors, centered around the intriguing patterns formed by the froth on the water's surface.","title":"Closeup of an outfall containing styrene emptying into Raccoon Creek which empties into the Ohio River.
