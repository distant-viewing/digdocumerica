{"path":"548696.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photo captures a serene and tranquil beach scene with two individuals strolling near the shore. The beach appears expansive with a soft, sandy surface that meets shallow waters. The sea stretches into the horizon, divided into shades of blue and turquoise, suggesting shallow waters near the shore possibly due to a sandbar or the tide.\n\nThe individuals, a man and a child, are walking close together, engaged in what appears to be a personal, intimate conversation. The man is dressed in a tank top and shorts, indicative of casual, warm-weather attire, while the child is wearing a light-colored tank top and blue shorts. Both appear relaxed and absorbed in their interaction, enjoying their walk on the beach.\n\nThe overall feel of the scene is calm and peaceful, emphasized by the vast, open space and the gentle gradients of sea and sky. The lighting suggests it could be early morning or late afternoon, times known for softer sunlight and cooler temperatures, which enhances the placid mood of the image. The scene is typical of a leisurely day at the beach, where the main activities include walking, conversing, and appreciating the natural coastal environment.","title":"Tourists on the public beach","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["545194","555402","557509","543493","547009","557507","543517","543499","548805","543225","547600","548700","547612","543214","547943","546953"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","short","conversing","tank","shore","sea","stroll","child","temperature","turquoise"]}
