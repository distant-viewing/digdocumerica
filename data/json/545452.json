{"path":"545452.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures a night scene, presumably in a diner or an ice cream shop, highlighting an interaction between two elderly men. The setting is warmly lit, creating an atmosphere of intimacy.\n\nOn the left side of the image, we see a large advertisement poster prominently displaying images and prices of various popsicles, notably featuring \"The Bomb Pop\" for 25 cents. The text on the poster suggests a cheerful promotion of new products.\n\nCentered in the photograph are the two men. The man on the left, who appears to be a customer, is leaning his head forward slightly, showing signs of either conversation or examination of something held by the other man. The customer is dressed in a dark suit and tie, presenting a more formal appearance.\n\nThe man on the right, possibly a server or shop owner given his white uniform and cap, is focused on an object in his hands, perhaps counting change or showing something specific to the customer. His posture is bent slightly towards the customer, indicating engagement and attentiveness.\n\nIn the background, part of the interior of the shop or diner is visible, illuminated by warm, soft lighting. It emanates a cozy, inviting vibe, typical of a small, local establishment. The overall composition of the photograph, coupled with the gentle interaction between the two men, suggests a slice of everyday life, capturing a moment of quiet connection within a commercial setting.","title":"State fair","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["551342","557767","556676","553519","554866","545970","547789","554097","557152","551832","547794","554895","549291","552859","556214","548234"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["customer","shop","diner","poster","man","promotion","owner","attentiveness","examination","intimacy"]}
