{"path":"544137.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures a somewhat barren and desolate landscape characterized by sandy mounds and sparse vegetation. In the middle ground, there are several structures. On the left side of the image, there are two small, seemingly abandoned buildings with dark roofs and fading, weathered wooden walls. A third structure further to the right appears to be a dilapidated outbuilding, possibly an outhouse, with its door hanging partially open and signage visible beside it.\n\nTo the far right, a more distinct and perhaps traditionally constructed round stone building stands, with small open windows and no visible door from this angle. The overall scene indicates a remote location, possibly in a desert or rural area.\n\nThe background is shrouded in a hazy atmosphere, potentially due to dust or distance, obscuring detailed visualization of any further scenery or landmarks. The sky is overcast, contributing to the muted colors and a certain gloominess in the atmosphere. The image appears untouched, reflecting a natural and harsh rural environment.","title":"Banksides stripped bare by erosion","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545233","545809","549221","544396","543171","545879","543339","554787","554707","543344","545826","542588","543658","552420","551330","545817"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["door","outbuilding","round","landmark","dust","mound","scenery","signage","desert","stone"]}
