{"path":"557551.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows a large, rectangular, white sign with black lettering prominently displayed in the center. The sign reads:\n\n```\nNO DUMPING\nL.A.M.C. SEC 77.000\nPATROLLED BY HELICOPTER\nALL VEHICLES PROHIBITED\nOFF ROADWAY\nL.A.M.C. SEC 5725.21D\n```\n\nSeveral bullet holes or similar markings are visible, especially concentrated on the lower part of the sign. The setting is likely a rural or semi-wild area, hinted by the dense vegetation visible in the background. This consists mostly of bushy plants and small trees, suggesting a scrub or chaparral biome. The quality of the light and the clarity of the air suggest the photo was taken on a bright, clear day. The sign, evidencing some wear and vandalism (bullet holes), is likely intended to deter illegal dumping and off-road vehicle usage in the area, enforced by aerial surveillance as stated.","title":"No dumping sign is a symptom of the population pressures along the coast of California off mulholland drive on the western edge of Los Angeles.  The road winds through the santa monica mountains which contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles county and are being threatened by development.
