{"path":"543080.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal landscape, likely taken during the late afternoon, given the warm lighting. The focal point is a rugged cliff face that juts prominently into the sea, covered with a dense canopy of coniferous trees. The cliff is textured, showing signs of erosion and weathering, which have sculpted its steep, rocky surfaces. Surrounding the main promontory are various smaller rock formations or islets, scattered throughout the calm, deep blue waters of the ocean. \n\nThe horizon in the distance fades into a haze, suggesting either mist or the vastness of the ocean merging with the sky. The sky itself is clear with a gentle gradient from a pale blue at the horizon to a deeper blue overhead, hinting at the vast, open atmosphere. The water near the shore breaks gently against the rocks, creating soft white foam, indicating a tranquil sea.\n\nNo people or man-made structures are visible in the image, emphasizing nature's unspoiled beauty and the serene, untouched quality of the location. This scene conveys a sense of peaceful seclusion and the timeless interaction between land and sea.","title":"Tenacious pines grow to edge of ocean Bluff.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543061","543068","543249","543184","545173","545122","545125","542917","543374","543049","545129","543291","543300","543297","545222","553771"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["sea","cliff","ocean","islet","overhead","rock","seclusion","weathering","foam","horizon"]}
