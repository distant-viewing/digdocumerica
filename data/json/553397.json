{"path":"553397.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural, tranquil scene focused around a cascading waterfall. The waterfall itself is central in the image, with water flowing energetically over rocky outcrops, creating a dynamic and frothy display. The surrounding landscape includes lush green foliage, rocky terrain, and mature trees that contribute to a serene woodland setting.\n\nIn the foreground, two individuals, likely enjoying a leisurely outdoor adventure, are observed from behind, sitting on the ground. They are positioned on a rocky incline overlooking the waterfall. One person, appearing to wear a patterned shirt and darker pants, is holding what seems to be a camera up to their face, presumably capturing the beauty of the scene. The other individual, clad in a blue jacket and lighter pants, is sitting slightly lower, turned towards the waterfall, possibly in conversation with their companion or simply enjoying the view.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its blending of human interest and stunning natural scenery, suggests a moment of appreciation for nature's beauty. The overall mood is peaceful and contemplative, inviting the viewer to feel the tranquility and awe inspired by such a picturesque setting.","title":"Clear waters of phillips brook, just above the weyerhaeuser paper mill","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["549552","545874","554512","550979","544335","548021","558087","549534","549629","554408","544340","557820","544350","545839","545878","555073"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","stun","blending","outcrops","inspire","enjoy","companion","incline","cascading","appreciation"]}
