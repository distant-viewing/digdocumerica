{"path":"546248.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a group of workers on a large road construction site. They are involved in laying down what appears to be reinforcing mesh or grid on a section of highway that is undergoing development or repair. The road stretches straight into the horizon, flanked by greenery and a relatively clear sky. \n\nThe scene is composed from a high viewpoint, looking down towards the ground where the workers are focused on their task. Four workers are evident in the image, each wearing different casual clothing and safety hats, suggesting that their work involves manual labor and requires certain safety precautions. The workers are spread out across the steel mesh, each attending to different areas, possibly securing or aligning the mesh in place. They are surrounded by various tools and boxes, indicating the presence of construction materials.\n\nIn the wider context of the image, there are vehicles parked on the side of the road, including a vintage car and what looks like a utility or construction vehicle, emphasizing the organized, yet busy environment. The road itself is visibly unfinished, with several lanes visible and constructions signs or milestones, highlighting the under-construction nature of the scene. The background of the image shows a continuation of the road, leading into distant trees and a partly cloudy sky, giving a sense of depth and the scale of the roadwork project.","title":"Steel rods, made from shredded autos, are being used for reinforcement in this section of i-55, north of durant.
