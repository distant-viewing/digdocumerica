{"path":"553055.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of an elderly man. He has strikingly textured skin and deep-set eyes that reflect significant experience or emotion, partially shadowed which adds to the intense expression. His hair is thin and unruly, predominantly white with patches of black, giving an impression of aging. His facial features are marked with lines and wrinkles, indicating old age, and there's a slight grimace or contemplation on his face.\n\nThe man is wearing a dark-colored shirt, and the background is extremely blurred and dark, focusing all attention on his face. The lighting on the subject’s face is subtle yet highlights the contours and textures of his face effectively. The overall mood of the image is somber and introspective, enhanced by the dark tones and the serious expression of the man. The composition uses a shallow depth of field, with the man's face slightly off-center to draw the viewer’s focus directly to his features.","title":"Uranium miner at lunch.
