{"path":"557697.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph depicts a farmer working in a field using a vintage red tractor, specifically an \"Allis-Chalmers\" model. This classic tractor is shown in the process of cultivating or tending to crops. The man driving the tractor wears a white cap and a light-colored t-shirt, indicative of warm weather, and he appears focused on his task.\n\nIn the background of the image, there is a significant rural landscape that includes a construction site where a new wooden structure is being built, possibly a barn or a farmhouse. The wooden beams of this structure are clearly visible, and the building is at an early stage of construction. Surrounding the construction site and the field, there are lush green trees and a clear, blue sky that suggests a sunny day.\n\nThe field itself is densely planted with rows of moderately tall green crops, likely corn, which are healthy and well-maintained. This setting is typical of a rural farming area, combining elements of agriculture and construction, illustrating a scene of active rural development and agriculture.","title":"Al reinshagen, mathematics teacher at the white county high school in Cleveland, Georgia, farms a one acre plot in nearby helen because \"i love farming\".
