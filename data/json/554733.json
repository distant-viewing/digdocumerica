{"path":"554733.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a serene view of a natural landscape dominated by several slender birch trees in the foreground. The birch trees, with their distinctive white bark marked with black bands and knots, rise vertically across the image. These trees are framed against a backdrop of other foliage in mid to late autumn maturity, revealing leaves colored in hues of green, yellow, and hints of red.\n\nThe space beyond the trees gives glimpses of a water body, likely a lake, with its calm blue surface subtly visible through gaps in the foliage. This setting suggests a lush, secluded area, possibly within a forest or a lakeside. There are no people or human-made structures visible, emphasizing the untouched and peaceful quality of the scene.\n\nThe composition utilizes the linear forms of the birch trunks as a natural curtain, partially revealing the tranquil lake behind it, which adds a sense of depth and intrigue, inviting the viewer to peek further into the distance. The lighting appears to be natural, with sunlight filtering through the canopy and illuminating parts of the trees and undergrowth, enhancing the colors and textures of the autumn leaves. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of tranquility, natural beauty, and a hint of the fleeting nature of seasonal change.","title":"Trunks of paper birches at chapel pond","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["554734","554400","550650","543700","557159","553075","554528","554732","550356","550746","554715","543621","554718","555216","555217","554749"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["birch","autumn","maturity","intrigue","reveal","tree","lake","gap","undergrowth","foliage"]}
