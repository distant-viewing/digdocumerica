{"path":"546885.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a body of water near an industrial area. In the foreground, a young man is focused on completing a task. He wears a gray hoodie underneath a large, bulky yellow raincoat. The man is leaning over the edge of a small boat, engaging with some equipment or task, possibly sampling water or maintaining the boat. His face is not visible, as he is looking downwards toward his hands.\n\nThe background features an expansive industrial landscape. Several large factory buildings and smokestacks are visible, and multiple columns of white smoke or steam rise into the sky. The overall ambiance suggests an environment impacted by industrial activity, juxtaposed with the seemingly routine task being performed by the person on the boat.\n\nThe lighting and colors in the image suggest it might have been taken during daytime with quite clear weather, given the bright blue sky and the visibility of the distant smoke and industrial structures. The water appears calm, and the mood is industrious yet tranquil due to the vast, open space.","title":"Ron Jones, a member of the EPA Annapolis field office, takes bottom samples as part of a systematic check of Baltimore Harbor.
