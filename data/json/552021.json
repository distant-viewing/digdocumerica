{"path":"552021.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This image depicts an industrial landscape, likely part of a chemical or oil refinery. The foreground shows a muddy area, saturated with puddles and appearing somewhat polluted, with snaking tracks of water or oil forming intricate patterns on the ground. This area leads towards a large industrial complex.\n\nThe complex in the background is comprised of several large metal structures, tanks, and buildings, some cylindrical and others box-shaped. Prominent features include tall chimneys or stacks, which stand out against the sky, and spherical tanks, possibly for gas storage. There is a significant number of pipeline structures visible, part of the facility's infrastructure.\n\nThe overall setting is under a cloudy sky, suggesting overcast weather, which adds a gloomy tone to the scene. There are no visible human figures or moving vehicles in the image, adding to a sense of abandonment or minimal activity. The environment suggests heavy industrial usage with possible environmental impacts, as indicated by the condition of the foreground area.","title":"Port Reading on the Arthur Kill.
