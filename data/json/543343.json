{"path":"543343.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic, weathered wooden barn with a rich red hue, typical of vintage farm structures. The main barn in the foreground is constructed with vertical plank sidings and features a classic gable roof. Near the roof's ridge, there's a small protruding loft access, indicating a storage or loft area above. There's a large door, left half open, which offers a glimpse into the dark interior of the barn.\n\nTo the left side of the main door, a notable architectural detail is a tall, slender metal chimney extending above the roofline, suggesting some sort of furnace or boiler inside the barn. Adjoining the main barn on the right, a smaller section or annex is visible, with a roof that appears to have a shallower pitch compared to the main barn and is enclosed by a wired mesh, likely serving as a separated storage or livestock area.\n\nThere's another building visible in the background, partially obscured but similar in construction with a metallic roof showing signs of rust, hinting at the age and weather exposure of these structures.\n\nThe setting around the barn appears barren and dusty, typical of a rural or semi-arid region, emphasizing the ruggedness and functional simplicity of the building. The sky is a bright clear blue, indicative of a sunny day, casting natural light that enhances the textured wooden surfaces of the barn's exterior.","title":"\"Ghost\" town","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["552537","550019","552536","555627","550693","554821","547128","557991","554782","552462","549194","555571","556586","547307","556963","552448"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["barn","roof","furnace","door","storage","roofline","gable","mesh","livestock","ruggedness"]}
