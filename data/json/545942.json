{"path":"545942.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a high-tech and futuristic vehicle, resembling a streamlined capsule or pod, prominently featuring a red and white color scheme. Labeled with \"Department of Transportation\" and symbols suggesting a connection to high-speed transit or innovation in transportation technology, it is set against a stark and arid landscape under a clear blue sky which might suggest testing in a remote or desert area.\n\nA man in a white lab coat is seen stepping down a built-in stairway from the interior of the vehicle onto the sandy ground, adding a human element to the scene and hinting at the operation or evaluation of this advanced transport device. The presence of another metallic structure, possibly a mobile platform, seen in faded red near the left side of the photograph, suggests additional support for the vehicle's deployment or study. The overall ambiance is one of research, innovation, and the testing of cutting-edge transport technology in a controlled environment.","title":"The LIMTV (Linear Induction Motor Test Vehicle) is tested at the Department of Transportation's High Speed Ground Test Center.
