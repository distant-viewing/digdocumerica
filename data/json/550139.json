{"path":"550139.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling urban street scene, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s, characterized by a variety of vintage vehicles and a vibrant city atmosphere. In the foreground, we see a range of cars typical of the era, including a Volkswagen Beetle and several American sedans parked or in motion along a busy street. The traffic flows in two directions, with some lanes occupied by stopped cars, and one featuring cars in motion, suggesting a moment captured during a routine traffic signal change.\n\nProminently featured in the background are large, multistory buildings that line the street, contributing to a dense urban landscape. Notably, one building displays a large \"BURLESQUE VAUDEVILLE\" marquee, indicating the presence of a theater that hosted live performances, a common entertainment form during this period. Adjacent to it, other signs visible include advertisements and a mention of a hotel, injecting a commercial flavor into the scene.\n\nPedestrians are visible crossing the street and along the sidewalks, adding life to the urban setting. The intersection is regulated by traffic lights which are shown in red, possibly indicating the flow of traffic is currently halted to allow pedestrian movement.\n\nOverall, the image is a vivid depiction of a mid-20th-century American city, bustling with daily activities and adorned with architectural and commercial elements of the time.","title":"New building and old signs on east 9th street","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["554297","549872","551135","556724","549882","545216","556709","556753","548388","548369","547369","547651","546626","551324","545498","542586"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["traffic","street","pedestrian","inject","regulate","theater","car","entertainment","flow","motion"]}
