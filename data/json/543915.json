{"path":"543915.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a serene boating scene with three young individuals, which appears to be from the 1970s based on their attire and the overall vintage quality of the image. They are on a small motorboat that features a bright red interior with padded benches.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a blonde girl wearing a red shirt and jeans is seated facing towards the back of the boat. She is holding up a fishing rod over the water, while her gaze is directed towards her fishing line. Next to her, in the center of the boat, another girl and a boy are seated facing each other: she in a striped yellow and brown sweater paired with jeans and he in a light blue shirt also with jeans. The boy, who also seems to be engaging with a fishing rod, is turned slightly towards the blonde girl as if in conversation or observing her fishing technique.\n\nIn the background, we see the muddy, brown water of the river, richly forested banks, and hints of industrial structures beyond the natural foliage, potentially indicating the outskirts of a developed area.\n\nThe boat is equipped with personal belongings and a container, which might be used for keeping either fish or bait, indicating their preparedness for recreational fishing. The dynamic of the scene conveys a casual, leisurely day spent enjoying nature and the company of each other.","title":"School children testing water for purity","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["544980","554198","552945","543164","551350","546053","546976","552317","550841","552123","554177","553411","552116","553403","548499","543952"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["fishing","girl","jeans","rod","boat","boy","bait","preparedness","belonging","developed"]}
