{"path":"554637.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a striking autumn scene dominated by a landscape of dense woodland stretching across rolling hills. On the left foreground, bright red leaves of deciduous trees vividly frame the composition, suggesting the peak of fall foliage. These vibrant trees lead the viewer's eye toward the darker, conifer-covered slopes of a large hill or small mountain in the background, which occupies the center and right portion of the image. \n\nThe hill itself is dappled with patches of greens and autumnal colors, hinting at a mix of vegetation types. A prominent feature of the scene is the low-lying clouds or mist enveloping the summit of the hill, adding a sense of mystery and depth to the scene. This misty veil contrasts dramatically with the darker tones of the mountain and the bright foliage.\n\nThe sky is overcast, with heavy, moody clouds that suggest an imminent change in weather, possibly a storm or rain showers. The lighting in the photograph is soft, likely due to the overcast conditions, which enhances the saturation of the autumn colors.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photograph combine to create a serene yet dynamic depiction of a fall landscape in a temperate climate, emphasizing the natural beauty and transient quality of the season.","title":"Fall colors the slopes with a red maple in the foreground and storm clouds over the top of Blue Mountain (3,800 foot elevation).","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557127","558074","554715","554647","546090","554636","554713","554668","554642","554638","554633","550478","550603","554757","554758","550602"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["hill","fall","autumn","veil","summit","foliage","conifer","mountain","mystery","woodland"]}
