{"path":"550672.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene set against a backdrop of a mountainous area. The focal point of the image is a large industrial facility that appears to be a factory or power plant. Prominent in the image are two tall smokestacks which are emitting thick, white smoke into the sky. The sky itself is filled with dramatic, heavy clouds suggesting a possible storm or overcast weather conditions.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a rushing body of water, possibly a river, which is moderately turbulent. The riverbank is steep and rocky, and reinforced with what looks like concrete or rubble materials, likely to control erosion or flooding. A metallic mesh-like structure is also visible stretching across the bottom of the photo, but its purpose is not clearly discernible from the image.\n\nIn the middle ground and background beyond the plant, a series of round storage tanks can be seen, indicating that this might be a chemical or processing plant. The landscape beyond the industrial setup shows rolling hills covered with lush green foliage, hinting that this location might be in a relatively verdant region.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a strong juxtaposition between nature and industrial activity, highlighting themes of human impact on the environment. The lighting and mood of the sky contribute to a somewhat somber tone to the scene.","title":"Mills of the brown paper company in Berlin, on the androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["551051","551060","544736","551026","551053","554630","557374","543011","544735","550939","548195","550344","551009","550710","546141","550716"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plant","mesh","flooding","rush","rubble","storm","chemical","erosion","riverbank","smokestack"]}
