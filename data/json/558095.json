{"path":"558095.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene landscape featuring a water body densely covered with lily pads, which float on the surface, creating a patterned texture across the expanse. Towards the back of the scene, there is a long wooden dock that traverses part of the water. A small group of people can be seen standing and walking on the dock, providing a sense of scale and life in the otherwise tranquil environment.\n\nThe background is densely filled with tall trees, which exhibit varying shades of green and hints of autumnal colors, suggesting the photograph might have been taken during a transition between seasons. The forest forms a lush, thick wall of foliage that stretches across the entire background, reflecting partially on the water surface, thereby enhancing the depth and the natural aesthetic of the setting.\n\nThe overall composition and the subdued lighting suggest a peaceful, natural setting, possibly in a park or a protected natural area, ideal for quiet walks and reflection. The reflection of the trees and the lilies on the waterâ€™s surface add a symmetrical and almost impressionistic quality to the photograph.","title":"Platforms float over the lake in the Virginia Kendall Park which allows visitors to observe fish swimming in the water under lilies. The park is part of the Akron, Ohio Metropolitan Park System which in turn is located within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. Signed into law in December 1974, the recreation area includes 30,000 acres of largely undeveloped land situated in a 20-mile stretch between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["543598","550809","555080","544592","550775","558094","550808","558093","545387","543561","554603","547639","547536","550750","546963","544588"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lily","dock","reflection","pad","walk","surface","ideal","water","transition","aesthetic"]}
