{"path":"548461.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph features a middle-aged woman standing in front of a red corrugated metal background. She is wearing large, cushioned headphones over her ears. The woman has short, dark hair styled in a practical way and a sincere, mild expression on her face. She is dressed in a blue and turquoise collared shirt.\n\nThe woman is holding a newspaper with the headline “Mayors back Logan foes” visible. The newspaper image seems to cover some political issue and includes a smaller photograph featuring a man and a woman within it.\n\nHer posture and the presence of the headphones suggest she might be in a noisy environment or involved in some form of work or activity requiring concentration and noise reduction. The setting appears industrial or utilitarian due to the simple and sturdy appearance of the corrugated metal wall.","title":"Mary Stack, once of East Boston, (Logan Airport area) now lives some 10 miles north in Saugus.
