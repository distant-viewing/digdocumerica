{"path":"554712.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a lush, expansive landscape during the autumn season. The image is rich with a tapestry of vibrant fall colors including deep oranges, reds, yellows, and remnants of green foliage. The area is predominantly a dense forest with a mixture of deciduous and coniferous trees.\n\nCentral to the composition is a sinuous river that weaves through the terrain, reflecting the blue of a clear sky and acting as a natural leading line through the lush wilderness. Adjacent to the river, a dirt road parallels its course, suggesting a trace of human activity and possibly access for forestry or conservation efforts.\n\nIn the distance, multiple lakes can be observed. These lakes are interspersed with numerous small islands and peninsulas, adding complexity and variety to the water bodies evident in the scene. The background shows a distant view of gentle hills and mountain ranges, which provide a soft, layered effect under the horizon.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is serene and untouched, highlighting the beauty of natural landscapes in the peak of fall season. No direct human presence is discernible, which emphasizes the tranquility and unspoiled quality of this scenic wilderness area.","title":"Typical meandering inlet to a lake with adjoining balsam flats and marsh-bog.","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554649","554756","554711","554714","554713","554758","554651","554648","554723","554653","554757","552599","554715","554761","557159","557127"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["fall","wilderness","season","lake","peninsula","trace","tapestry","course","forestry","conservation"]}
