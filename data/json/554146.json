{"path":"554146.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a long, winding road that cuts through a rugged and dark-colored landscape, which appears to be a lava field or a similarly barren and rocky terrain. The road extends from the foreground of the image diagonally toward the background, where it curves gently towards a coastline visible at the distant end of the photograph. Along the road, sparse vegetation can be seen in patches, with small shrubs interspersed in the landscape, which is otherwise dominated by the darker ground material.\n\nThe image is slightly underexposed, making the overall colors quite dark. The sky is barely visible and appears hazy, contributing to the dim lighting and moody atmosphere of the scene. On the horizon, the coastline is faintly seen with a body of water, perhaps an ocean or large lake, showing a calmer area compared to the harsh land that dominates most of the view. The area along the coast seems slightly more developed or populated than the rugged terrain, hinting at possible human activity or settlements at a distance. The overall composition guides the viewerâ€™s eye along the road towards the distant horizon, highlighting the isolation and stark beauty of the landscape.","title":"New highway joining the recently built Kona airport with Kailua runs through an agricultural and conservation district. The land cannot support prime agriculture, however, and increasing applications for redistricting for urban development are expected.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554154","553774","545105","554131","557468","550600","554130","554170","550614","542838","544178","554802","544116","545886","557528","543429"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","coastline","lava","coast","settlement","horizon","guide","terrain","populate","compare"]}
