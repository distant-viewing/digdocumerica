{"path":"545491.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts a heavily industrial scene dominated by dense, dark clouds of smoke billowing into the sky from multiple tall smokestacks. These stacks are cylindrical and appear metallic, arranged in a line. They protrude upwards from a horizontal structure, possibly a factory or power plant, which is not fully visible. The smoke varies in color from dark gray to black and merges with the overall cloudy sky in the background, creating a gloomy and polluted atmosphere. The background is a mix of lighter and darker clouds, suggesting an overcast day. The image conveys a strong visual impact of environmental pollution, typical of industrial emissions. There are no visible people or other distinct objects in the image, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the environmental impact of the scene.","title":"Steel plant chimneys, sending out clouds of smoke, create a severe pollution hazard.
