{"path":"555095.jpg","date":"April 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a natural, forested landscape, likely after a forest fire or some form of natural disruption. The scene is dominated by charred tree stumps and fallen, burnt logs, indicating a recent past of destruction. Vibrant new life is evident through the presence of a young, healthy evergreen tree in the center. This tree, small yet prominently vibrant amidst the contrasting burnt remains, symbolizes regrowth and resilience.\n\nThe ground is covered with moss and small ferns, providing a lush green carpet that adds a touch of vitality against the backdrop of destruction. Patches of brown and green moss vivaciously cover the mounds and flat surfaces, adding to the varied texture of the landscape. The lack of any direct human interference or presence in the photograph focuses the viewer on nature's cycle of destruction and regeneration.\n\nThe composition of the image, using natural light, enhances the contrast between the burnt remnants of old trees and the thriving undergrowth and young tree. This suggests that the photograph was taken in natural daylight, likely under overcast conditions given the softness of lighting and absence of harsh shadows. This setting evokes a sense of quiet and calm after the event that led to the forest's current state.","title":"Douglas fir in olympic national timberland, Washington near Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555090","555202","553571","542819","555183","555151","550347","554746","553583","542571","542598","555139","552453","553572","553626","553561"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["destruction","moss","interference","vitality","tree","charr","remains","past","cycle","softness"]}
