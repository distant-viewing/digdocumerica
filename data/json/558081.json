{"path":"558081.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a series of large fungal growths, specifically bracket fungi, thriving on a dark, presumably moist log. The fungi are detailed with multiple concentric rings that vary in color from shades of beige to darker browns and deep reds. These formations are layered and protrude outward in a shelf-like, semicircular manner. The texture of the fungi appears woody and rigid.\n\nThe log itself is also in focus and shows signs of decay, with patches of blueish-white moss or lichen scattered across its bark, adding a contrasting color to the darker backdrop. The lighting in the image is subdued, with no harsh highlights, emphasizing the rich, natural colors and contributing to a somber, serene woodland scene. The background of the photograph is out of focus, which directs the viewer's attention primarily to the fungi and the textures of the log. This setting suggests a quiet, possibly damp forest environment where such fungi commonly thrive.","title":"A fungus called turkey tail (Polyporus versicolour) grows on a decaying log along the trail to Stumpy Basin, northeast of Peninsula, Ohio, near Cleveland. The basin was the turnaround area for boats using the old Ohio-Erie Canal. The canal was heavily used for commerce between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi River systems from 1833 to 1913 when a flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business. The area is part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["554593","555015","555180","558076","555006","557595","555181","555179","557624","555017","551373","555016","557620","555014","555018","558080"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["log","thrive","damp","bracket","lichen","ring","beige","shelf","protrude","manner"]}
