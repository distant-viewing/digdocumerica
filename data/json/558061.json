{"path":"558061.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view over a rural or semi-rural landscape. The area is bounded by lush, dense forests, predominantly green but with hints of autumnal colors starting to appear, suggesting that the season is either late summer or early autumn. Within the expanse of forest, a small community can be observed, comprising several houses scattered amongst clearings. The houses are small and appear quaint, typical of a rural community.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, a road runs horizontally across the scene, separating the dense forest on the left from the community on the right. Along the road, there are a few small, parked vehicles suggesting minimal but existent traffics and activity. Adjacent to the road, there is a body of water that appears calm, possibly a small lake or pond. The shore of the water body near the road is reinforced with what looks to be a concrete or stony structure, perhaps to prevent erosion or to demarcate an area.\n\nWhatâ€™s particularly striking in the image is the contrast between the natural, dense, forested areas and the developed, human-inhabited space. The landscape looks serene and quite isolated, providing a sense of a peaceful rural environment ideal for retreats or primarily resident living with minimal commercial activity. The overall composition of the image, with its rich colors and clear demarcation of land use, articulates a harmonious balance between nature and human habitation.","title":"Aerial view of the Cuyahoga River spillway at Peninsula, Ohio, north of Akron. There was a dam at the location a few years ago until taken out in a flood. The Ohio-Erie Canal crossed the river at that point and a mill stood at a point where visitors can view remains of the wall above the river water. The canal was heavily used for commerce as a link between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi River systems. It is now part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["556972","556994","556997","556955","556971","556968","556915","556937","556996","556969","556993","556967","556981","556954","558063","556970"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["road","community","forest","inhabit","bound","demarcation","demarcate","prevent","retreat","house"]}
