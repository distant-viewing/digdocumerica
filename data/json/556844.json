{"path":"556844.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat dark and moody scene, centered around a train car with its doors open. The train doors frame the image on either side, appearing robust and metallic with rivets and panels visible, providing an industrial feel. A warning sign that says “Watch your Step” is visible on one of the door’s thresholds, suggesting caution when entering or exiting the train.\n\nInside this frame, a person, likely a train operator or conductor based on their uniform, is partially visible. We see them from the back, dressed in a dark uniform with a cap, and they appear to be engaged in an activity just inside the door, possibly managing train operations or assisting passengers.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is dim but focused, illuminating the inside of the train where the person stands and enhancing the functional and slightly mysterious atmosphere of the setting. Overall, the image conveys a snapshot of everyday public transportation, highlighting the work and environment of those who operate the trains.","title":"Brakeman uncouples two cars from Amtrak's Broadway Limited at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The train, which originated in Chicago, is split into two sections at this station. One continues on to New York City while the other heads for Washington, D.C. The train has a history of late arrivals. Amtrak officials blame it on the poor condition of the roadbed which the corporation leases from the nation's railroads.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544163","556845","556087","556846","556083","556109","556082","556064","555959","551889","556108","551921","556857","549650","556770","556671"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","door","uniform","rivet","conductor","inside","caution","operator","say","warning"]}
