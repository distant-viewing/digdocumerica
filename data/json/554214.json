{"path":"554214.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene in a snowy mountain town. The background features impressive snow-covered mountain slopes that are likely used for skiing, indicated by visible ski lifts and trails on the mountain side. The sky is partly cloudy with blue patches showing, suggesting a cold, clear day.\n\nThe middle ground of the image displays a busy street scene with various vehicles and buildings. There are parked cars lining both sides of the street, covered partially in snow, suggesting recent snowfall. Among these vehicles, a prominent vintage van is parked facing the camera. Various building facades are visible, including a building with a \"Sinclair\" sign, indicating a gas station or an automotive service, and another with a sign reading \"F.O.E.\" which stands for Fraternal Order of Eagles, a local lodge or community center.\n\nThe foreground shows a group of people walking along the sidewalk. They are dressed in winter clothing, such as heavy jackets and pants, suitable for the cold weather. They seem to be engaging leisurely, possibly tourists or locals enjoying the day.\n\nOverall, the composition, with its combination of natural beauty and quaint town activity, offers a picturesque view of a lively winter destination.","title":"Looking north on galena street to the ajax mountain ski area","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554279","554275","554281","554284","554213","554291","552607","554236","552601","554263","554235","554289","543640","554249","554288","554261"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["winter","mountain","street","lodge","town","snow","skiing","local","snowfall","order"]}
