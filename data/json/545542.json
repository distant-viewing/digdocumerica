{"path":"545542.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a moody, evocative scene in a narrow alley created by two parallel wooden buildings, likely residential structures. A small child stands at the center of the image, their back to the viewer, gazing down the alley. The ground is wet, indicating recent rain, and puddles reflect light, adding a slightly glossy texture to the scene. The alley is dark and bordered by the weathered walls of the buildings, which are showing signs of wear and age, such as peeling paint and slightly dilapidated shutters.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is dim, suggesting either an overcast day or a time close to dusk. The mood is contemplative and slightly somber, enhanced by the solitary figure of the child and the narrow confinement of the space between the buildings. The limited visibility of the sky and the absence of any other human figures contribute to the feeling of isolation. The end of the alley, brightly lit compared to the foreground, draws the viewer's eye toward what might lie beyond this somber scene.","title":"Scene in \"Little Korea\", in South Birmingham. Despite the significant progress of recent years, many Birmingham Blacks still live in areas of substandard housing of which this is a prime example. Several creeks flow through the community. During heavy rains, these are apt to overflow, and residents must often be evacuated. Birmingham, Alabama.
