{"path":"555519.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph features a prominently displayed sign with a message about gasoline availability. The sign is blue with white lettering that reads, \"SORRY DUE TO ALLOCATION WE CAN SERVE NO MORE GASOLINE TODAY.\" This sign suggests a shortage or rationing of gasoline.\n\nIn the background, there is a blurred image of a cyclist riding on the road. The cyclist appears to be an adult wearing a light green shirt and dark pants, riding a bicycle with thin wheels, typical of road bicycles. There is also a blurred image of a car, suggesting that the photo is taken on a busy street.\n\nThe focus on the sign with the out-of-focus cyclist and car in the background implies that the availability of gasoline (or lack thereof) is affecting everyday life, particularly transportation. The setting appears to be urban given the paved road and vehicles present. The lighting suggests daytime with clear visibility, except for the deliberate blur applied for artistic or contextual emphasis on the sign's message over the background activities.","title":"Oregon still had scattered gasoline problems in May, 1974.
