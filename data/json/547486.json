{"path":"547486.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a rocky shoreline with a series of jagged, dark rocks dominating the foreground. These rocks are covered with what appears to be seaweed or some form of marine vegetation, giving them a textured and slick appearance. Small water pools can be seen trapped in crevices between the rocks, reflecting light and enhancing the intricate details of the rocky surface.\n\nThe middle distance shows more rock formations emerging from the water, forming a natural barrier between the beach and the sea. The waves breaking against these rocks create splashes, one of which is prominently visible, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene scene.\n\nThe background features the ocean which stretches to the horizon under a clear blue sky. The sea appears calm beyond the breaking waves, suggesting a contrast between the turbulent areas near the rocks and the placid open water. This setting likely represents a coastal environment during a low tide, exposing more of the rocky beach typically submerged under water.\n\nThis photograph is rich in natural textures and the interplay of light and shadow, emphasizing the rugged beauty of coastal landscapes.","title":"Rocky shore on Rhode Island sound","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["543142","547471","543289","545122","543092","543295","549353","543292","543243","543306","545173","543250","543297","543309","543290","543204"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","break","beach","wave","trap","sea","seaweed","crevice","tide","form"]}
