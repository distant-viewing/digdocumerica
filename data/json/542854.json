{"path":"542854.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"In the photograph, a large red logging truck is prominently featured, carrying an enormous log. The truck is an older model, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s, with a classic design including round headlamps and a squared-off hood. It's painted red with some white detailing on the body, complementing its robust and rugged look.\n\nThe truck is on a road that appears to be nestled within a dense forest. Large trees with green, lush foliage surround the area, creating a vibrant backdrop that contrasts vividly with the rich red color of the truck. Sunlight filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the road and creating a play of light and darkness that adds depth to the scene.\n\nGiven the context and the load the truck is carrying, it's evident that the truck is used for transporting timber, possibly from a logging site within the forest. The setting suggests a remote or less-populated area where logging is a significant activity. The scene captures a moment in the daily operations of forestry work, emphasizing the scale and nature of the industry.","title":"Within a mile of magnificent redwoods are sites of some of the worst logging and clear-cutting practices.
