{"path":"542637.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant array of old Volkswagen Beetles lined up closely together. The perspective focuses on the rear ends of the cars, leading the viewer's eye diagonally through a colorful, dense arrangement of vehicles. \n\nFrom the left, the cars' rich, glossy colors range from deep reds and oranges to cooler whites and blues. Each car features the signature rounded shape of the Beetle, with prominent rounded rear fenders and the characteristic large, circular tail lights. Additionally, the cars show reflective chrome bumpers that stand out against the colorful paint.\n\nThe cars are parked tightly, suggesting they are either in a lot or at a gathering for enthusiasts. The paint appears well-maintained on some vehicles, indicating that they might be cherished collectors' items. The photograph's focus progressively blurs as it extends to the cars in the distance, creating a depth of field that further emphasizes the array of Beetles.\n\nThe lighting and shadows hint at a bright day, which casts soft shadows under the cars, enhancing the texture and form of each Beetle. Overall, the composition uses depth, color, and repetition to create a visually compelling tribute to this iconic automobile.","title":"Volkswagens on pier","placename":"Terminal Island (Calif.)","location":"Terminal Island, California","nn1":["550908","550909","542634","542817","542638","553896","551912","546665","547480","546813","546879","542640","549852","547742","547327","550796"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","paint","array","repetition","fender","enthusiast","bumper","tail","chrome","automobile"]}
