{"path":"552151.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of an industrial area situated by the water. The scene includes several large red and brown buildings, likely used for manufacturing or processing. Some of the roofs are flat while others have a gabled style. The larger buildings prominently display tall smokestacks and industrial piping, indicating heavy machinery or plant operations are inside.\n  \nA small portion of the waterfront is lined with white foam, possibly indicating some sort of water pollution or runoff. The shoreline also encompasses some constructed barriers like wooden piers and concrete retaining walls, possibly to control erosion or to manage docking facilities.\n\nDark waters surround the industrial complex, and there are no visible boats. The ground area adjacent to the buildings includes a variety of smaller structures, parking lots filled with cars, and sparse greenery. The roads are quite empty and there is a visible lack of pedestrian activity, which complements the utilitarian feel of the area.\n\nThe surrounding area outside the main industrial complex features patches of grass and small clusters of buildings, which differ significantly in architecture from the industrial ones, possibly office buildings or facilities supporting the industrial operations.\n\nThe image captures the functional orientation of an urban industrial waterfront, emphasizing utility over aesthetic or recreational use.","title":"Scott sulphite pulp mill discharges water waste","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552209","548423","549495","549524","551988","550890","555769","549519","552191","549969","555776","550886","547214","551183","551566","549526"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["waterfront","complex","runoff","building","differ","orientation","retain","docking","encompass","piping"]}
