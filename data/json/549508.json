{"path":"549508.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive industrial landscape, likely that of a heavy industrial plant such as a steel mill or similar facility. Located near a body of water, which is possibly a river or a lake, the scene is dense with industrial infrastructure.\n\nIn the foreground, the shoreline is dotted with piles of materials which appear to be ores or possibly coal, heaped in large quantities. These materials are alongside docks where cargo ships would likely be loaded or unloaded. One can see cranes and conveyors, which are typical equipment for handling such heavy materials.\n\nThe middle of the photograph features several tall smokestacks emitting plumes of smoke and steam, contributing to a hazy atmospheric condition surrounding the area. The presence of these smokestacks, along with the apparent furnaces and cooling towers, indicates the massive scale of industrial processes taking place.\n\nSpanning the facility are numerous buildings, some of considerable size, spread across the terrain. The buildings include various tanks and cylindrical structures suggestive of storage or processing units. Several railways and service roads intersect the complex, facilitating transportation and logistics within.\n\nIn the far background, the area transitions gently into a hillier landscape, sparsely vegetated, which contrasts with the highly industrial nature of the foreground. The sky above shares in the coloration of the landscape beneath, hinting at the overcast or polluted air typical of such industrial zones.","title":"Bethlehem Steel plant on the Lake Erie waterfront just below Buffalo","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["549510","549968","549511","545236","555776","548070","547101","546769","551994","553891","550344","555769","555770","548340","551201","546103"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["smokestack","material","ore","furnace","quantity","logistic","facility","mill","conveyor","coloration"]}
