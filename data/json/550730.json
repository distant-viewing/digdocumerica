{"path":"550730.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a small town situated beside a large river. On the right side of the image, there is a frothy, turbulent section of the river which appears to be a dam or rapids. Directly adjacent to this section of the river, there is a large industrial complex, likely a factory or power plant, characterized by several large buildings and tall chimneys, one of which is emitting smoke or steam. Below the industrial complex and along the river, there are parking areas filled with cars, suggesting active employment or operations in the factory.\n\nThe rest of the town extends across the middle left of the photograph, with densely packed residential areas consisting of numerous small, individual houses, intersected by winding roads. The surrounding landscape includes patches of trees and green areas, contributing to a semi-rural feel.\n\nThe top and bottom of the photograph are framed by dense green forests, indicating that the town is located in a region with abundant natural vegetation. The overall composition vividly captures the juxtaposition between industrial activity and natural beauty in a small town setting.","title":"Chisolm Mill of the International Paper Company at Livermore Falls on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550728","551196","550732","551174","550327","557295","551191","551195","551202","551579","546705","551197","542933","549500","550335","550558"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["town","river","complex","factory","rapid","section","dam","rest","steam","chimney"]}
