{"path":"550826.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat introspective scene set at a shoreline. The composition is naturally divided between the rippled water in the foreground and the sandy beach edging into dense foliage in the upper portion of the image. \n\nA single person, a man, is seen standing close to the water's edge. He appears reflective or focused, staring out across the water. His attire is simple, consisting of jeans and he is shirtless, suggesting a warm weather setting or a moment of relaxation by the water. The man's posture and placement near the bend in the shoreline guide the viewer's eye toward him as a focal point amid the natural surroundings.\n\nThe water itself is calm with gentle ripples, capturing a sense of tranquility. The light, either from early morning or late afternoon, casts a soft hue across the scene, further enhancing the peacefulness of the setting. The sandy beach curves into the scene from the right-hand side, leading up to underbrush and trees, indicating a secluded or lightly traveled location. The vegetation is lush and green, suggesting a healthy natural environment, possibly in a park or rural area.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of solitude and contemplation, set against the backdrop of a gentle and inviting natural landscape.","title":"Shore of the Wisconsin river in the dells area, a picturesque region which attracts many visitors","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["542556","550268","546953","550235","546970","543293","542976","545095","554002","547943","546293","543203","547612","546963","548757","543493"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["ripple","stare","shoreline","beach","water","placement","peacefulness","relaxation","edge","guide"]}
