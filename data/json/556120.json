{"path":"556120.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant and busy railway scene on a clear day. In the foreground, a red locomotive leads a train along curved tracks, heading toward the viewer. The locomotive features a prominent front light and a logo that appears as a red sphere with a golden border and a design inside. Following the locomotive are several other train cars in varying colors, including blue and silver. The train tracks intricately intersect and diverge in multiple directions, creating a network of rails.\n\nTo the left side of the image, several parked cargo train cars marked with the letters \"ICAF\" are visible; they are white with bold, black lettering. Behind these parked cars, the terrain is interspersed with more tracks and other stationary train units, possibly part of a train station or a rail yard.\n\nThe background showcases a hilly urban landscape densely packed with buildings of varying architecture styles, suggesting a suburban or outskirts-of-the-city type of area. Vegetation, mainly trees, emerges prominently among the houses, adding a touch of greenery and indicating residential zones. The overall scene is framed by utility poles and lines, enhancing the industrial feel of the photograph.\n\nThe sky is relatively clear with a hint of haze, suggesting either the early morning light or a slight overcast condition. The light and shadow placement indicates sunlight coming from the upper part of the image, giving a bright but balanced exposure to the scene.","title":"The Coast Starlight (train #11) pulls into the Tacoma Washington passenger train depot. Amtrak assumed responsibility for most U.S. intercity rail passenger service from the nation's railroads in 1971. Since that time it has managed to halt a 25-year decline in ridership which began shortly after World War II.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556029","556076","556850","556692","556104","545541","556854","557965","556009","557956","556382","556902","547140","556851","549131","556772"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","locomotive","rail","sphere","track","car","silver","placement","outskirt","border"]}
