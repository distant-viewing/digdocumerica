{"path":"554787.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat bleak and unsettling landscape dominated by a large, older two-story house that appears somewhat dilapidated. The house is painted white but shows signs of wear and neglect. It features a traditional architectural style with a peaked roof, multiple windows, and an elevated front porch with what seems to be a broken railing.\n\nThe house is situated on a high, exposed piece of ground, likely a hill or mound, which seems to have been partially excavated or eroded, as indicated by the raw, dug-up earth in the foreground and around the sides. This creates a stark contrast between the natural and disturbed land.\n\nIn front of the house, there is a large red cylindrical tank, possibly for fuel or storage, which adds a touch of color to the otherwise muted landscape. The environment around the house includes a few sparse trees with autumnal foliage and a couple of evergreens. The background is a flat horizon line that suggests a rural setting, featuring distant power lines and minimal building structures.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is desolate and gives a sense of isolation, possibly hinting at themes of abandonment or transition. The lighting in the image is soft, with a haze that might suggest it was taken in the early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and contributing to the somber tone of the scene.","title":"This house off route 250, has had its windows and doors knocked out, legally qualifying it as \"derelict.\"  Now the coal company is stripping around it","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["554823","554822","558110","555632","554799","556999","554788","552455","552464","549195","552491","557141","544353","556962","558318","553458"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","evergreens","excavate","dug","peaked","erod","fuel","front","mound","transition"]}
