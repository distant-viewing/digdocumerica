{"path":"554159.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene, shot from a shaded perspective that includes foliage in the foreground. The image is framed by dark silhouettes of leaves and branches, which add a natural frame and a sense of depth. In the background, the beach is visible, characterized by its light sandy shore that contrasts with darker wet sand and patches of shallow water reflecting the sunlight.\n\nThe focal point of the image consists of several individuals on the beach. Two distinct groups of people are noticeable; one group comprises two individuals walking closely together, while the other group appears as a single person standing alone, further down the beach. These figures are small, shadowy, and not detailed, contributing to the tranquil and somewhat solitary mood of the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is soft yet bright, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. The gentle surf and its interaction with the shore create textured patterns on the sand, enhancing the peaceful ambiance of the setting. The overall composition and the vantage point of the photograph suggest a moment of quiet reflection or a casual, leisurely day at the beach, framed by the natural beauty surrounding it.","title":"Maunce Kea Beach Hotel, near Kamuela, is located on one of the few sandy beaches in all of Hawaii.
