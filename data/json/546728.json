{"path":"546728.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph offers a high-angle view of an urban landscape featuring a variety of buildings and streets. The foreground shows a large building with a distinct architectural design, featuring a rooftop that includes a circular structure possibly serving a functional or aesthetic purpose. The rooftop area is expansive, mostly flat, and composed of light-color materials which contrast with the darker details such as vents and small structures.\n\nAdjacent to this central building, several other structures vary in height and architectural styles; these buildings have pitched and flat roofs equipped with HVAC units and other mechanical systems. A street with visible lines divides various blocks, filled with cars suggesting typical urban traffic. Parking areas are filled with numerous vehicles, indicating either commercial or residential areas.\n\nTrees are sporadically placed along the streets and between buildings, adding touches of greenery to the dense urban environment. The overall composition captures a typical city block with a focus on rooftops and the layout of the urban configuration, emphasizing a blend of residential and possibly commercial or institutional buildings. The photograph likely belongs to a mid- to late-20th-century timeframe judging by the style of cars and general urban planning.","title":"Roof of parking building","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556180","548318","548343","548425","551507","548364","548424","555743","548329","549979","549476","551510","542580","553840","549971","556030"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["rooftop","block","building","street","timeframe","configuration","belong","vent","planning","pitch"]}
