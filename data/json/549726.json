{"path":"549726.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial facility, likely a power plant or a factory. The main structure consists of several large, rectangular buildings, with a dark, possibly metallic exterior. Several tall stacks, not emitting any visible emissions at the moment, rise from one of these buildings. The roofs feature an assortment of other industrial features like vents and smaller structures.\n\nTo the left side of the complex is a small, white and blue structure, and nearby roads show minor traffic and construction activity evident by patches of dirt and construction debris scattered around. This area is potentially undergoing construction or expansion.\n\nOn the right side of the main buildings, there is an extensive parking lot filled with many cars, indicating a high number of workers or visitors to the site on this day.\n\nIn the far background, beyond the facility, the landscape includes green open fields and trees, suggesting the facility is located on the outskirts of a town or in a less densely populated area. The sky is clear, casting natural light over the entire scene. This setting contributes to the industrial and somewhat isolated feel of the location.","title":"Ford Motor Company's new casting plant at Flat Rock","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549727","545841","553892","549506","544495","550339","547126","544573","551994","543872","555779","543764","544494","545833","548195","543768"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["construction","facility","vent","expansion","outskirt","assortment","emission","visitor","stack","exterior"]}
