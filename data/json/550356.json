{"path":"550356.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic landscape, presumably taken on a sunny day judging by the bright sunlight and clear blue sky. The foreground features lush green grass and several young birch trees with white bark and green leaves. These trees are distributed evenly across the frame. To the left, there exists a denser cluster of trees which runs along the frame, guiding the eye deeper into the picture.\n\nThe middle distance reveals a valley filled with more dense greenery, including a variety of trees and bushes. It appears a bit darker than the foreground due to shadows, possibly creating a beautifully textured impression of the terrain. Beyond this, the landscape opens up to a vast area filled with similar vegetation extending towards the horizon.\n\nIn the distance, there are rolling hills which fade into the skyline. There is some haze or atmospheric perspective, causing the distant hills to have a bluish tinge, providing a sense of depth. There are no visible buildings, people, or animals in this image, highlighting its natural and untouched beauty.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with trees framing the sides tends to focus the viewer's gaze towards the horizon in the center, offering a peaceful and expansive view of this natural setting.","title":"Reforestation by the St. Regis Paper Co., about 20 miles south of Woodland","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["554400","548025","545001","556990","557099","552903","549139","552553","549238","549249","550537","555217","557159","550602","550604","554982"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["birch","tree","hill","gaze","bark","horizon","distance","bit","haze","animal"]}
