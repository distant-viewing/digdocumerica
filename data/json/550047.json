{"path":"550047.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures a man standing in a body of water, likely a river, engaged in the activity of examining or sorting fish that he has collected in a net. He is wearing yellow waterproof overalls over a dark blue T-shirt, and his attire indicates that he might be involved in a form of fishery or aquatic research. The man, who appears focused on his task, is holding a net filled with a variety of small fish, which he seems to be either inspecting or preparing to release. His wristwatch is visible, suggesting a casual yet working environment. The background consists predominantly of dark, moving water, creating a naturalistic setting that underscores the outdoor, aquatic theme of the activity. The lighting in the photograph is natural, highlighting the shimmer of the water and the reflective surfaces of the fish, enhancing the dynamic quality of the scene.","title":"Massachusetts division of marine fisheries is responsible for stocking the north river with these pacific coast \"cohoe\" salmon which have been grown from eggs in the hatchery.
