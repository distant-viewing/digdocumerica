{"path":"556758.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photo depicts a busy office environment, likely from a past decade given the style of clothing and technology. The setting is a dimly lit room featuring a group of five people seemingly absorbed in their work. In the background, a large map is mounted on the wall, accompanied by other smaller notes and charts, suggesting this might be an operations or dispatch center of some sort.\n\nA man in the center foreground operates an older model printer or facsimile machine. He wears glasses and a white shirt, and appears focused on his task. To the left, in the foreground, another man with a mustache, wearing a plaid jacket, is observing or speaking with someone out of frame, his posture relaxed. Next to him, a woman with straight dark hair and eyewear sits facing towards a desk cluttered with various papers, a rotary phone, and another typewriter-like device.\n\nIn the far background stands another man, turned away from the camera, who seems to be writing or examining something on another large board or machine that is out of sight. On the right, another woman with a pink shirt stands near the map, holding a telephone receiver, looking pensively at a device which could be a radio or another form of communication equipment.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of professional activity, centered around communication and data processing, in an office setup characteristic of mid-to-late 20th century technology and office decor.\n","title":"Dispatching center for Dial-A-Ride radio dispatched door-to-door bus system in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
