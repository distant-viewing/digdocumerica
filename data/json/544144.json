{"path":"544144.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures the front facade of a cafe that offers both Mexican and American food. The building is painted in a bright turquoise color that adds vibrancy to the scene. On the left side of the image, a window with a large neon sign reads \"OPEN\" in red and below, additional signage advertises \"Mexican & American Food\" and notes \"PARKING IN REAR - CAFE\". You can see the reflection of buildings and skies in the window, suggesting it's a bright sunny day.\n\nTo the right, a basic door, which is also shaded turquoise like the walls, displays another \"OPEN\" sign hanging inside the glass, reflecting the scene from outside. Above the hang-tag style open sign, the street number \"120\" is displayed plainly. Below the door's window, a humorous sticker portrays a figure sitting beside a \"NO\" symbol, indicating a \"NO SMOKING\" area, although the only detail clearly visible besides \"NO\" is a comic-style drawing of a figure and a boot.\n\nOverall, the image looks to are taken in a quiet moment devoid of people, focusing entirely on the architectural details and character of the cafe, embedded in a typical urban setting. The presentation and simplicity suggest a straightforward, welcoming eatery catering to a casual dining crowd.","title":"Arizona--Holbrook","placename":"Holbrook (Ariz.)","location":"Holbrook, Arizona","nn1":["547789","542894","558123","547760","552606","548654","552528","544882","554188","545814","547809","552622","546183","545334","551867","547892"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["cafe","no","smoking","hang","drawing","door","window","sticker","cater","embed"]}
