{"path":"551206.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene sunset over a broad river or lake. The sun is situated near the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow across the sky and reflecting off the gently rippling water, creating a path of shimmering light. The surrounding landscape features dense, darkly silhouetted forests that outline either side of the waterway, with the left side having a more prominent projection into the water. There is a small boat visible in the mid-ground of the image, moving towards the bottom of the frame, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil scene. This landscape is bordered by a spread of more natural terrain stretching back into the distance, which is bathed in shades of blue and orange hues from the sunset, enhancing the peaceful and picturesque quality of the image.","title":"Sunsets on an inlet off the main osage arm of lake of the ozarks, near horseshoe Bend.
