{"path":"547798.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a lively urban street scene at night, likely during the holiday season given the visible festive decorations. The wet streets reflect the lights vividly, adding a glossy, almost mirror-like quality to the road surface. The scene is illuminated by multiple neon signs and street lights, contributing to the vibrant, colorful atmosphere.\n\nTo the left and center of the image, prominent decorations in the shape of Christmas wreaths and bells hang from street lamps, adorned with the word \"XMAS\" in bright neon letters. These festive elements are paired with stars, enhancing the holiday theme.\n\nThe buildings lining the street are multi-story and appear to be commercial, with various signs advertising different businesses including clothing stores, a military loans office, and other retail shops. The architecture, while mostly obscured by the darkness and signage, hints at mid-20th-century styles, typical of many urban commercial districts.\n\nThe roadway is populated with a few blurred vehicles, indicating motion, including a clearly visible parked car on the left. The image suggests a bustling, busy environment, typical of a city during the holiday shopping season.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a nostalgic, dynamic snapshot of urban life during the Christmas holidays, with a focus on commercial activity, festive decorations, and the interactions of light and reflection on wet urban surfaces.","title":"Street scene, night of Thanksgiving Day 1972","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["555446","551321","551322","545462","551864","547051","550127","549014","545216","549886","556983","555381","551239","551125","549872","556681"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["holiday","decoration","street","neon","season","bell","shopping","star","advertise","district"]}
