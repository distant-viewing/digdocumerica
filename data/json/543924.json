{"path":"543924.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a formal event held in an indoor setting. The main focus is an elderly man in a dark suit and glasses, standing at a podium adorned with a microphone, engaging in a handshake with another man seated in front of him. Surrounding the podium are several banquet tables covered with white tablecloths and decorated with various floral arrangements, adding a vibrant and formal touch to the scene.\n\nThe audience includes a mix of men and women, mostly dressed in formal attire, paying attention to the speaker at the podium. To the left forefront, a man with a camera is capturing the moment, suggesting the significance or public interest in the event.\n\nThe background is especially interesting, displaying a variety of colorful and creative banners and posters hanging from a balcony rail above. These posters feature a range of messages and illustrations, possibly student-made, adding a personalized and informal contrast to the otherwise formal gathering. The fluorescent lighting fixtures on the ceiling illuminate the entire scene, providing good visibility and highlighting the details of this event setup.","title":"Senator McClelland at environmental awards dinner","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["543925","557703","556694","556451","554333","543917","548557","554338","556253","556247","545384","552618","558393","554342","556243","547320"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["poster","event","pay","tablecloth","illustration","speaker","microphone","student","man","banner"]}
