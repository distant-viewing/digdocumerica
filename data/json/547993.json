{"path":"547993.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a red and white cement mixer truck captured while operating in a construction area. The truck is predominantly red, equipped with a large revolving drum painted white and marked with a circular red logo, containing the word \"Alb\" in white text. Its tubular structure likely carries and mixes cement or concrete.\n\nThe mixer is stopped in the midst of turning or maneuvering within a dirt-covered space, possibly preparing or continuing to mix its contents. The surrounding area appears barren and rough, characterized by exposed, rocky soil, which suggests a site under construction or a raw industrial environment. There are no visible structures or other vehicles in the immediate area around the truck, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the cement mixer and its operations.\n\nThe shadows cast by the truck are sharp and clearly defined, indicating that the photograph was taken under bright sunlight, which enhances the vividness of the truck's red color against the muted earth tones of the ground.","title":"Construction on the site of Expo 74","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547774","542538","553394","555636","557385","547922","550270","545653","542539","544083","547232","547243","547666","543896","547583","546252"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["cement","truck","drum","construction","mix","maneuver","midst","stop","vividness","concrete"]}
