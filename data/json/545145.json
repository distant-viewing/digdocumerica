{"path":"545145.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene evening scene centered around a vast, meandering river or estuary. The landscape is bathed in the rich, deep colors of dusk; shades of deep blues, purples, and pinks dominate, with the horizon casting a subtle warm glow.\n\nIn the foreground, there are dark silhouettes of what seem to be wooden posts or remnants of a pier, sharply contrasting against the lighter colors of the water. To the left, there's a reflection in the still water, mirroring the darker shapes of the land or vegetation. This adds a sense of calm and symmetry to the scene.\n\nMoving to the middle ground, the river flows gently, creating winding paths that reflect the sky's colors. It appears to be a tidal river or estuary, as indicated by the exposed sandbanks and the broad, flat areas of water.\n\nThe background features layers of rolling hills or low mountains, which fade into the sky with slightly darker hues, enhancing the depth of the scene. Above, the sky is visibly transitioning from day to night, contributing to a peaceful and tranquil atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition leverages the interplay of light and shadow, natural lines created by the river, and the silhouettes of foreground elements to draw the viewer into a contemplative and natural setting. The scene is devoid of any human activity, emphasizing a natural, undisturbed landscape.","title":"Estuary near a new wildlife refuge","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["552597","542994","550560","548182","547731","557239","552318","552263","550852","545000","557572","557000","550845","552142","542653","552336"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["river","sandbank","silhouette","symmetry","pink","night","calm","purple","remnant","pier"]}
