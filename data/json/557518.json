{"path":"557518.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial shot of a developed area, showing a mix of agricultural fields, residential neighborhoods, and commercial buildings, with a mountain range in the background. The landscape is divided by a straight highway or major road running vertically through the image.\n\nIn the center and towards the left, residential areas are densely packed with small, possibly single-family homes, each with its own plot of land. The houses are arranged in a grid pattern with streets running between them.\n\nTo the right of the residential area, expansive agricultural fields are visible. These fields are neat, organized, and likely contain crops or orchards based on the uniformity seen from this altitude.\n\nIn the foreground, various industrial or commercial buildings with large flat roofs are prominent. These seem to be part of a more commercially developed zone located closer to the camera's perspective.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a transitional landscape where urban development meets rural agricultural use, under the shadows of a mountainous backdrop, illustrating the mixed-use character of the area. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and enriching the colors of the natural and urban landscape.","title":"Aerial view of Oxnard Plain, a prime agricultural area in Ventura County, California, north of Los Angeles, now being developed for housing. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressures. Restrictions on coastal development within 1,000 yards of the shoreline were tightened with the passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November, 1972.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553059","557516","553938","542674","553692","553936","557461","545625","553694","553943","546407","553695","553693","552594","546756","553935"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["develop","field","uniformity","run","plot","enrich","altitude","crop","grid","divide"]}
