{"path":"550158.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene on a sunny, residential street where two garbage collection workers are in the process of loading a garbage truck. The truck is parked on the street, its back end open, revealing bags and other refuse already loaded inside.\n\nOne worker stands at the back of the truck, on the left side of the frame. He wears a dark blue jumpsuit and a cap; he has gloves on his hands and is facing the street, looking slightly towards the direction of the camera. He appears to be holding a clipboard or a small flat object in his hand.\n\nThe second worker, also in a blue jumpsuit, is partially visible on the right side of the image. He is engaged in the act of loading or organizing the garbage into the truck. Only his back and part of his profile are visible as he leans into the truck.\n\nThe street itself is lined with various garbage bins and bags placed neatly along the curb, waiting for collection. The bins vary in size and color, containing assorted items including brooms and multiple pieces of small scrap lumber. Visible in the background are suburban houses with a clear sky overhead, and a few leafy trees scattered around, suggesting a well-maintained neighborhood.VERTISEMENT","title":"Curb-only pickup speeds work of sanitation crew.
