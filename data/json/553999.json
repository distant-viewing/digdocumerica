{"path":"553999.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an old, weathered church set against a backdrop of tropical palms. The church exhibits a traditional wooden architecture with a steep, front gable topped by a steeple and bell tower. The wooden siding is worn and aged, injecting a sense of historical decay into the image. The front entrance consists of a small porch with steps leading up to double doors, slightly ajar, inviting a glimpse into the shadowed interior. In the foreground, various objects are scattered around: a broken wooden cart, reminiscent of a bygone era, rests on its side, alongside a barrel and other wooden debris. This setup, amidst the lush palms gently swaying in the background, conveys a serene yet abandoned atmosphere, hinting at a once vibrant community life now stilled. The sunlight dapples through the trees, casting patterns of light and shadow across the scene, enhancing the ethereal, timeless quality of the setting.","title":"Old church in keomuku, a \"ghost town\" on the island's east shore, where developers plan to build a hotel.
