{"path":"545563.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a scene through an arch in what appears to be a rocky, desert landscape. The arch is broad and naturally formed from reddish-brown rock, framing the view beyond it. Through the arch, a rocky landscape is visible, consisting of various shades of brown and red stone formations, which create a rugged and undulating terrain. In the middle distance, there are several mound-like rock formations that taper off into flatter land toward the horizon.\n\nBeneath the arch and part of the framed view, a person is seen. They are standing on a slope of the rock, slightly leaning as they navigate the rocky surface. The individual is small in the frame, showing the scale of the arch and the expansive landscape.\n\nBeyond and below the arch, there's a sprinkling of greenery in the form of bushes, which contrasts with the mostly barren, rocky environment. The sky is a clear blue, hinting at a dry, sunny day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph uses the natural arch to create a window-like effect, drawing the viewer's eye through the rock to the landscape and person beyond, emphasizing themes of exploration and the vastness of natural formations.","title":"Double o arch, one of many windows carved into vertical redrock by centuries of erosion","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"Arches National Park, Utah","nn1":["545555","544939","545578","545572","545568","545584","545566","545580","553077","545711","544935","545585","545577","545825","545554","545570"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["arch","rock","formation","taper","person","form","landscape","mound","navigate","exploration"]}
