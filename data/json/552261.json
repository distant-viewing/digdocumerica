{"path":"552261.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image captures a vibrant and picturesque scene of a cityscape as viewed from a body of water. The foreground features dark blue water with waves gently breaking against rocks at the edge. Splashes of water can be seen as the waves hit these rocks, creating an active and dynamic element within the tranquil watery expanse.\n\nThe skyline of the city in the background is presented under a bright blue sky scattered with fluffy white clouds. Notably, the city features a variety of buildings, including tall skyscrapers, some of which are reflective, capturing the sunlight and adding to the vividness of the scene. A notable structure within the city's skyline is a tower with a large, futuristic top—presumably an observation or telecommunication tower—which stands out due to its distinctive shape and prominence.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph balances the natural beauty of the waterfront with the urban architecture of the city, all under an expansive sky that adds a sense of depth and openness to the image. The settings and clarity of colors suggest a clear, sunny day, ideal for capturing such a scenic view.","title":"Seattle's Elliott Bay, rated as having the cleanest water of any major industrial port in the United States","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552260","552265","552251","555716","557273","552268","552252","547967","547932","556188","553677","550754","553790","557274","549480","553788"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","skyline","telecommunication","tower","wave","prominence","rock","openness","ideal","vividness"]}
