{"path":"554541.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a landfill setting with various discarded objects scattered across a vast area. In the foreground, there is an abundance of trash, including numerous plastic bags filled with waste, cardboard boxes, household items, and miscellaneous debris. Some boxes have visible labels and text, suggesting they once contained electronic devices or consumer products.\n\nTowards the middle of the image, there is a white truck, which appears to be either dumping more trash or involved in managing the landfill operations. The truck is surrounded by more piles of refuse, which extend into the background. \n\nThe scene is set against a natural backdrop featuring a clear blue sky and a dense forest of dark green trees. These trees line the horizon and provide a stark contrast to the man-made waste in the foreground, highlighting the environmental impact of such dumping grounds. The setting is sunlit, indicating the photograph was taken on a clear day.","title":"Accumulation of trash and garbage after one day on the weekend at the Old Forge, New York, sanitary landfill, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548210","549936","550256","546246","543832","549750","544637","557307","544799","550801","546761","546235","545299","550248","549748","552446"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["landfill","trash","box","waste","dumping","truck","consumer","abundance","refuse","household"]}
