In the image, a man is standing and eating from a black pan. He is dressed in a green raincoat and wearing a whimsical hat with red and white stripes and blue adorned with white stars, resembling designs often associated with the American flag. The environment around him is lush, with trees surrounding the area and autumn leaves covering the ground, suggestive of a cool weather setting.\n\nBeside him is a red pyramid-style tent, fully set up with ropes securing it in place. In front of the tent, there is a camping gear setup on a tarp, including a silver cooking pot on a portable stove, and various other items like a blue towel, a brown bottle possibly for water or another beverage, a white plate, and some cutlery laid on the tarp.\n\nThe setting seems tranquil, located in an area with mature trees and foliage. The ground is scattered with fallen leaves, indicating either autumn or a rainy environment due to the man's attire. Overall, it depicts a moment of outdoor living and self-sufficiency, with the individual managing his cooking and dining amidst nature.","title":"Hunter-camper eats his pancakes in the rain at Moose River Plains in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554511","545497","554682","542726","554863","544855","545523","545500","549451","554540","548796","554480","543230","542727","550977","545786"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["cooking","tarp","tent","camping","autumn","pan","pyramid","raincoat","stove","self"]}
