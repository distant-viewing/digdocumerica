{"path":"555599.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene at a historical building with a distinct architectural style. In the foreground, three elderly men are seated on a wooden bench. They appear relaxed in casual summer clothing; two wear hats, and all are focused on something off-camera. The bench is situated on well-maintained grass beside a pathway inside a public space or possibly garden grounds.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a prominent statue mounted on a multi-tiered stone base. The statue seems to depict a figurative scene, possibly a historical or allegorical figure made from lighter-colored material, contrasting with the darker stonework of its base. The inscriptions and any details of the statue itself suggest memorial or commemorative significance, but specific details are not clearly visible.\n\nThe background provides a view of an impressive building made of dark stones or bricks, with ornate window surrounds and architectural embellishments. Features such as steps leading up to the entrance and large pillars supporting an upper balcony element suggest that this might be a significant public or government building. Large windows, multiple stories, and overall styling suggest 19th to early 20th-century construction. The setting is sunny with a clear sky, contributing to the warm and tranquil atmosphere of the scene.","title":"The Cadiz, Ohio, town hall is the backdrop for three senior citizens enjoying the summer weather.","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["555991","547359","553208","552722","552736","552727","550067","553158","552718","551646","547885","557713","548615","548647","545870","547870"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["statue","bench","base","stone","embellishment","stonework","styling","inscription","government","pillar"]}
