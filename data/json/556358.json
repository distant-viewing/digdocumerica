{"path":"556358.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely inside a mine or a similar underground setting. A miner is visible in the image, engaged in work. He is wearing a safety helmet with a mounted light and is dressed in dark overalls with highly reflective safety stripes on the arms, legs, and back. The miner is using a tool or a device, and he appears to be looking upward while handling the equipment.\n\nThe environment around the miner is dark and characterized by heavy industrial elements, such as metal cylinders and beams, some of which are reflective and illuminated possibly by his helmet light. The ground and surfaces appear wet or oily, adding a gritty texture to the surroundings. The space is tight and predominantly enveloped in shadows, highlighting the challenging working conditions typically found in such industrial settings.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the miner at work, emphasizing themes of labor and industry, while the low-light conditions evoke a sense of isolation and the intensity of underground work environments.","title":"Sherman M.
