{"path":"547326.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor rural scene, capturing a moment in the life of a farmer and his livestock. The central figure is a middle-aged man, dressed in work clothes that include a gray zip-up jacket, blue jeans, gloves, and a red baseball cap. He stands in a muddy field, looking up with a serene expression, possibly towards the sky or someone out of frame. Adjacent to him is a white lamb, standing close and seemingly attentive to the man. The lamb's presence adds a sense of pastoral life and care to the scene.\n\nThe field itself is heavily muddied, likely due to recent rainfall, with visible puddles and clumps of earth, emphasizing the rural, working nature of the environment. In the background, simple farm structures, possibly stables or storage sheds, can be seen, along with wooden fences that demarcate enclosures across the expansive farmland. \n\nThe backdrop shows a misty, overcast sky and hints of rolling hills, contributing to the atmospheric depth of the scene. This gray overcast might suggest early morning or a rainy day, common conditions in pastoral and farming settings. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the interaction between the farmer and the lamb amidst a rugged landscape, highlights themes of rural life, agriculture, and the natural connection between humans and animals.","title":"John Dolezal in muddy sheep-pen of his farm near Bee, Nebraska.
