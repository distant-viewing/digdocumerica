{"path":"546095.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a bison standing in a natural, wild grassland setting. The bison, appearing large and robust, is shown in left profile, highlighting its dense, shaggy fur which is primarily dark brown in color. It has a prominent, heavy head, with visible horns and a beard-like feature on its chin, characteristic of bison.\n\nThe setting is an open field with tall, dry grass coloring the lower portion of the image in shades of light brown and amber. Small, sparse trees and bushes dot the landscape, which extends into the background. These trees have thin branches and are relatively barren, suggesting a late fall or winter season. The background shades into lighter tones of purple and brown, indicating a diverse and somewhat arid ecosystem, typical of grassland environments.\n\nThe overall colors in the image lean towards a natural and earthy palette, enhanced by the lighting which appears soft, possibly indicating either early morning or late afternoon. The composition places the bison squarely off-center to the left, making it the main focal point while also allowing one to appreciate the expanse and quiet solitude of the surrounding landscape.","title":"Buffalo on Bell Ranch","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["546099","546091","552559","546123","552558","546129","550380","543022","542964","550452","550385","550384","550494","550436","543726","545902"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["grassland","horn","chin","fur","beard","shade","profile","fall","purple","ecosystem"]}
