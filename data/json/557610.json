{"path":"557610.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a dark, almost entirely black background, illuminated by patterns that resemble the silhouette of fireworks or sparkling lights. These patterns are sporadically placed across the frame with varying densities and tones. The overall impression is one of looking at lights from a great distance or through a heavily textured glass, which creates a blurred and scattered effect.\n\nThe photo has a very low-key lighting approach, overarching with dark and mysterious tones. The lights within the image suggest a celebration or event occurring at a distance, or possibly a stylized portrayal of city lights or reflections off of a body of water at night. The composition focuses on contrasting the dark background against the tiny specks of light which create a sense of isolation or remoteness. There are no discernible human figures or distinct objects, just the abstract interaction of light and darkness.","title":"Silhouetted Douglas fir trees against sunlight reflecting off a lake in timberland on vancouver island, british Columbia.
