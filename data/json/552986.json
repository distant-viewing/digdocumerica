{"path":"552986.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a tranquil nature scene with a modern single-story house located near a body of clear water, likely a creek or small pond. The house has a sloped roof, predominantly finished in earthy brown tones, and features a large chimney protruding above the roofline. Large windows line the front of the house, allowing for an expansive view of the natural surroundings.\n\nIn the foreground, the creek or pond is distinguishable by its clear, greenish water, revealing the rocky bottom beneath. Small branches and foliage, likely early signs of spring growth, are visible in the water and along its banks. The setting includes scattered rocks and an old, cut tree trunk, adding a rugged natural appeal to the scene.\n\nThe background is rich with pine trees and hints at a mountainous landscape just beyond the immediate vicinity of the house, suggested by the presence of snow on the distant peaks visible over the roof of the structure. The environment exudes a sense of quiet and seclusion, emphasized by the natural beauty and the architectural design that complements its surroundings.","title":"Silt runoff from construction sites, causing chemical imbalance and the growth of algae.
