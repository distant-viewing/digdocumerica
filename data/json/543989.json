{"path":"543989.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a semi-arid landscape during daylight with a clear sky, penetrated by significant industrial emissions. The foreground is densely populated with native desert vegetation, including several yucca plants that appear robust and healthy, displaying a spiky appearance with sharp, linear leaves radiating outward from their bases. Also featured are taller, thin plants—likely young trees or large desert flora—with spindly trunks and minimal foliage.\n\nIn the middle distance, an industrial facility is partially visible, identifiable by its large structures and multiple smokestacks from which white and grey smoke billows. This smoke streams into the sky, forming expansive clouds that contrast starkly against the otherwise blue backdrop. The smoke’s presence introduces a stark thematic contrast, juxtaposing nature and industrial activity.\n\nThe background showcases a range of mountains, low and subdued, lying beneath the vast expanse of the sky. A highway or road runs parallel to the horizon, marked intermittently by vehicles and signposts, suggesting connectivity and human activity within this otherwise natural setting. The wide, open space conveys a sense of isolation and the expansive environment typical of desert regions. The overall mood evoked is one of quiet resilience amid growing industrial influence.","title":"Phelps Dodge Corp. smelter in background","placename":"Douglas (Ariz.)","location":"Douglas, Arizona","nn1":["543988","548968","543160","544039","543992","547198","543668","544068","549191","543733","545020","546398","544792","545013","547539","544735"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["desert","smoke","signpost","basis","penetrate","connectivity","radiate","introduce","plant","influence"]}
