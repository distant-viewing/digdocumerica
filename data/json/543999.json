{"path":"543999.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"In the photograph, a man dressed in a forest ranger uniform, complete with a badge and patches on his shirt, stands prominently in a forested area. He wears a yellow hard hat and speaks animatedly, gesturing with his right hand, as he appears to explain something to an attentive audience. The ranger is Caucasian, with a confident expression.\n\nIn the foreground, part of the audience can be observed; there is a Caucasian woman with long brown hair, wearing a white blouse, who is turned mostly towards the ranger, listening intently. Another individual, likely a man, is partially visible to her left, wearing a blue shirt and dark pants.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, surrounded by tall pine trees and scattered underbrush, indicative of a forest or park environment. The lighting suggests it is daytime, with sunshine filtering through the canopy, creating a bright and natural atmosphere. The scene depicts a likely educational or informational session led by the ranger, aimed at engaging and informing visitors or a group about the forest and its management or conservation activities.","title":"Members of the South Pine Association take a tour of a forest management area.","placename":"Happy Jack (Ariz.)","location":"Happy Jack, Arizona","nn1":["542781","544003","554446","545269","542789","542772","553371","542563","542603","554665","553357","557005","542716","542607","557007","553638"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["ranger","audience","forest","sunshine","session","explain","badge","pine","conservation","listen"]}
