{"path":"548489.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures a serene urban street scene that appears to date back a few decades due to the style and condition of the vehicles and architecture. It looks like a quiet, possibly early morning or overcast day. The street is lined with several older-model cars parked along the curbside, with a large delivery truck prominently parked on the left, featuring the logo \"EMERY\" on the back.\n\nThe street is nestled between two rows of traditional, multi-story wooden houses, characteristically of a style seen in many American neighborhoods in the mid-20th century. The houses have siding exteriors, and some have visible front porches and staircases. There’s also a small, grassy area next to the sidewalk, enhancing the quiet, residential feel of the area.\n\nOn the left side, there's a sign on a lamppost at the foreground, clearly stating \"DEAD END STREET\", indicating the street doesn’t continue through to another outlet. Overhead, utilitarian features like street lamps and multiple power lines crisscross above, typical of a residential area from this era.\n\nOverall, the composition gives a nostalgic feel, capturing a slice of everyday life in what could be any number of small to mid-sized American towns during this period. The scene is devoid of people, adding to the stillness and quiet mood suggested by the overcast lighting and empty road.","title":"Near the Wood Island station of MBTA (Metropolitan Boston Transit Authority).","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557155","556435","549829","558028","548238","557655","548500","545419","556709","555584","549287","542900","548889","552933","557288","552526"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","outlet","lamppost","delivery","house","staircase","crisscross","date","decade","continue"]}
