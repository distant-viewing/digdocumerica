{"path":"542828.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of heavy deforestation, likely taken from an aerial perspective. The image shows a landscape covered with numerous fallen trees, stumps, and scattered debris across a muddy terrain. Patches of intact forest with tall green trees are visible, sharply contrasting with the devastated areas stripped of vegetation.\n\nWithin the cleared area, there are several heavy machinery pieces, likely used for logging. The machines and fallen logs create a chaotic and disrupted appearance. You can make out a curve in the dirt road snaking through the scene, lined with additional machines parked alongside, suggesting ongoing logging activities.\n\nThe remnants of the forest and soil have a dark, moist look, indicating either recent rainfall or a naturally damp environment, common in forested regions. The background is denser with foliage, showcasing a possible boundary of the area currently being logged, providing a glimpse of what the landscape might have looked like before the deforestation began.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["550354","542827","545272","542949","542840","542851","542948","546060","555208","542833","542947","555148","542823","542839","542832","545138"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["log","deforestation","machine","begin","disrupt","stump","forest","rainfall","snake","clear"]}
