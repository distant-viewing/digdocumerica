{"path":"545060.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged outdoor scene, presumably in a wooded area. In the foreground, a chaotic array of weathered and broken logs and driftwood dominates the scene, creating a textured mosaic of aged wood, interspersed with small patches of green plants and grass. Seemingly wet from recent rainfall or moisture in the air, the logs have a darkened tone and glossy appearance. \n\nCentrally positioned in the middle of the log pile stands a person, who appears to be a middle-aged man. He's dressed in outdoor work attire, including a dark and light green plaid shirt, dark trousers, and a hat with a brim which is possibly a helmet. This suggests he might be involved in some form of forestry work or outdoor exploration. His stance is relaxed yet attentive, hands seemingly resting at his sides or perhaps holding something indistinct.\n\nBehind the man, the background is populated by a mixture of tall, dense trees, which cast a shadow over the area, contributing to the dim lighting of the scene. The overall atmosphere feels remote and natural, with a sense of quiet isolation suggested by the dense forest and overcast sky. The lack of visible modern elements or other people reinforces the impression of a secluded, possibly wild area. This setting, combined with the timber and tree fragments, could suggest recent forestry activity or the aftermath of a natural event like a storm or flood that left wood scattered.","title":"Farmer Gary johansen near Big Creek, below a temporarily halted gravel operation.
