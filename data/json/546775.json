{"path":"546775.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a strong graphic composition featuring the silhouette of a bridge structure against a bright sky. This bridge shows a harmonious geometric pattern of trusses made from triangular shapes and cross beams, emphasized by the dark outlines against the lighter background.\n\nOn the bridge, there are three figures walking. The people are shown as silhouettes, and their activities or identities are not discernible beyond their basic human forms. What stands out is the dynamic contrast between the rigid, angular lines of the bridge and the organic, moving shapes of the humans.\n\nThe background is relatively uniform with what appears to be a twilight or dusk sky, which allows the primary focus to remain on the silhouette of the bridge and the people crossing it. The overall feeling is one of stark, graphical interpretation of an everyday scene, transformed into a more dramatic and abstract visual experience.","title":"Swinging railroad bridge across Curtis Creek leading into Baltimore Harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["555937","553226","555725","544722","546203","552064","548207","557275","546139","544671","555730","555751","557096","553256","557969","543087"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","silhouette","interpretation","shape","identity","truss","cross","experience","twilight","outline"]}
