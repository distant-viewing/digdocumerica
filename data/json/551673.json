{"path":"551673.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a large outdoor event, likely a concert, with a vast audience gathered in front of a stage set in an urban park at dusk. The stage is somewhat lit, indicating that some performance is happening, with figures that can be seen performing to the crowd. There are substantial audio and lighting rigs flanking the stage on either side.\n\nThe audience is densely packed, seated on the ground, stretching back from the stage area and filling a considerable portion of the open space. Most people appear to be focused on the stage, suggesting engagement with the performance. The seating isn't structured, which hints at a more casual, open-entry sort of event.\n\nIn the background, the skyline of a city, featuring various skyscrapers and towers, suggests the park is situated in a significant urban center. The buildings, illuminated by the evening light, provide a dramatic backdrop to the event, blending the natural and urban environment impressively.\n\nThe general ambiance of the setting, with the lighting and density of the crowd, conveys a lively and communal atmosphere typical of outdoor public concerts. The image captures a moment of cultural and social interaction within the heart of a bustling city.","title":"Crowd gathered at the Schaefer bandstand in Central Park to hear singer Judy Collins also get a dramatic view of the towers of Midtown Manhattan.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551674","553296","551672","551708","553297","553259","551671","551670","553265","553284","551675","553298","553264","550076","551012","551707"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["stage","concert","audience","performance","event","crowd","rig","happen","entry","heart"]}
