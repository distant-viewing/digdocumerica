{"path":"543908.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and intense scene of a large fire. The focus of the image is on the massive, roaring flames consuming what appears to be a vast area. The fire is emitting a dense, swirling cloud of smoke that rises into the sky, glowing ominously from the bright, fierce blaze below.\n\nIn the foreground of the photo, we can see a large, white pipeline that arches across the frame. This pipeline perhaps suggests an industrial setting or an emergency response effort to combat the fire. The contrast between the dark, night-time environment and the bright, orange-yellow hues of the fire creates a stark visual impact.\n\nThe background is dominated by the dark silhouette of a landscape, possibly hills or a distant horizon, barely visible through the thick smoke and flames. The scene conveys a sense of urgency and devastation, highlighting the scale and power of the fire.","title":"A texaco crude oil tank blazes against the night after being struck by lightning","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["543900","555160","543933","555156","543904","557577","553843","548854","542712","547728","548591","548590","545924","553128","548597","555157"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["fire","pipeline","flame","response","smoke","urgency","emergency","bright","devastation","swirl"]}
