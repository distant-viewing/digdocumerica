{"path":"547060.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene, likely a steel mill, punctuated by complex structures and heavy machinery. The image is set against a backdrop of immense blast furnaces and towering silos shrouded in a haze that likely emanates from the processes being carried out.\n\nIn the foreground, a large water body reflects some of the industrial structures lending a slightly eerie glow to the scene. On the right, next to the water, piles of scrap metal are visible and are probably waiting to be processed.\n\nThe heart of the activity in the image appears to be centered around molten metal being handled. Bright orange flames and molten metal can be seen in at least two different locations, illuminating parts of the structures and reinforcing the industrial nature of the work being conducted.\n\nThe structures themselves exhibit a variety of forms and shapes, likely representing different parts of the millâ€™s operation. There are smoke and steam, evolving into the air, contributing to the industrial atmosphere of the setting.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph sheds focus on the central and right parts while the left remains relatively in shadow, creating a contrast that highlights the flames and molten metal even more. The photograph conveys a strong sense of industrial might and the gritty reality of heavy manufacturing.","title":"Steel mill on the Calumet River","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["549966","547702","547069","557399","543996","557397","544045","544049","550225","557395","557227","547101","557216","549511","546769","547010"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["flame","mill","metal","might","furnace","heart","reality","scrap","silo","part"]}
