{"path":"545561.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph presents a striking and expansive view of a canyon landscape, characterized by its rugged and arid appearance. In the foreground, there is a collection of rough, red rock formations. Among these rocks, positioned prominently and slightly to the right, is a coiled snake, blending in somewhat with the reddish-brown color of the stones. \n\nBeyond the immediate rocky foreground, the landscape descends into deep canyons and plateaus. The terrain is textured with various shades of browns and reds, interspersed with shadowed areas that add depth and dimension to the scene. The canyons and rock formations stretch extensively towards the horizon.\n\nIn the distance, flat-topped mesas stand out against a hazy sky that suggests either the early morning or late afternoon light. The sky is a muted blue, partially obscured by light clouds or haze, contributing to a sense of vast, quiet isolation typical of such desert environments.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the snake in the close foreground and the expansive view in the background, creates a dramatic contrast between the immediate detail of wildlife and the immense scale of the natural landscape. This scene captures the essence of a remote, untamed wilderness.","title":"A gopher snake crawls along the canyon's rim at the Needles Overlook.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544950","545750","545800","544745","545760","545802","544908","544429","545761","545799","545787","544917","545765","545790","552690","545783"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["canyon","snake","rock","mesa","formation","plateaus","coil","dimension","descend","wildlife"]}
