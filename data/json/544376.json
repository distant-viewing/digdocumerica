{"path":"544376.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic natural landscape under a cloud-filled sky at either sunrise or sunset. The main focal point is a striking rock formation standing prominently in the center of the image. The rock formation is jagged and towering, with multiple peaks and ridges that create a silhouette against the lightened sky. The colors in the sky shift from deep blue at the top to subtle lighter blues and patches of oranges and yellows, possibly due to the sunâ€™s position near the horizon.\n\nThe foreground is a flat, expansive terrain covered with sparse, scrubby vegetation, suggesting a desert or arid environment. The landscape around the rock formation gently rises, creating soft undulations on the surface. The ground appears dry and rugged, supporting only low-lying bushes and scrub, characteristic of harsh, dry climates.\n\nOverall, the composition, with its vast sky and dominant landscape feature, evokes a sense of isolation and the stark beauty typical of desert landscapes. The image could be reminiscent of scenes from the American Southwest, well-known for such iconic rock formations and vast, open spaces.","title":"Church Rock at sunrise","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545775","544363","545805","544392","545801","545804","545797","545696","552444","544429","552890","550428","543127","544359","544745","545792"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["formation","rock","desert","undulation","scrub","shift","blue","sunrise","landscape","ridge"]}
