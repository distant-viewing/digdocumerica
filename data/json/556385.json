{"path":"556385.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures an evocative architectural space, seemingly within an industrial or abandoned setting. The main visual element is a curved staircase framed by an arched metal structure, typical of corrugated materials, which simultaneously offers strength and texture to the composition.\n\nThe arch-top design of the staircase and the juxtaposition with the vertical grooves of the corrugated metal creates a strong visual rhythm, guiding the viewer's eye along the descending stairs. The staircase itself features lined treads that emphasize its circular design, leading downwards to an obscured, shadowy area that remains largely in mystery due to the low-light conditions.\n\nThe upper part of the image shows the same corrugated metal texture as the surrounding structure, with visible aging and some corrosion spots, accentuating the sense of decay and oldness. The overall lighting is dim, with spots of light penetrating through openings in the structure, and highlighting segments of the stairs and railing, create a chiaroscuro effect that adds to the atmosphere of the scene.\n\nBelow, darkness dominates, suggesting an environment that is less frequented, or perhaps neglected, enhancing the mysterious and somewhat eerie feel of the place. The photographâ€™s composition, focusing on lines, patterns, and textures, along with the play of light and shadow, makes it artistically rich and open to various interpretations related to themes of decay, passage, or transition.","title":"Conveyor belt at the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company mine","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["552493","546528","557391","558117","546510","546517","553374","550719","543258","546519","546525","557976","546501","546576","546511","556165"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["staircase","stair","spot","decay","metal","corrosion","tread","interpretation","rhythm","groove"]}
