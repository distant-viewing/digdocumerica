{"path":"543564.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up view of tiny water droplets delicately poised on what appear to be narrow green blades of grass or plant stalks. There are several blades in the image, angling diagonally across the frame at various depths which causes some to be in sharp focus while others blur into the background. The droplets themselves are clear and spherical, evenly spaced along the edges of the stalks, catching light in such a way that they appear luminous against the darker green background.\n\nThe image has a soft focus and features dreamy, blurred background elements that convey a sense of an early morning or a damp environment, possibly after rain. The lighting is subtle, enhancing the translucency of the water droplets and creating miniature reflections within each droplet. This bokeh effect, where the out-of-focus light forms abstract circular patterns in the background, adds an artistic quality to the photograph. \n\nOverall, the composition and focus on the minute details of nature, combined with a balanced interplay of light, give the image a serene and delicate aesthetic.","title":"Water drops on grass","placename":"Tahoe National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe National Forest, California","nn1":["553853","543565","555184","558077","543629","547312","547287","555032","543623","557592","543560","555044","555021","543562","557593","551357"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["droplet","stalk","minute","bokeh","catche","dreamy","angl","poise","abstract","spac"]}
