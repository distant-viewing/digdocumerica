{"path":"552024.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene of a casual baseball game taking place in what appears to be a grassy park area. In the foreground, a woman with a baseball glove stands in a ready position to catch or field the ball. She is wearing a dark t-shirt and light blue shorts, engaged in the play. Running towards her is a young girl in a white tank top and shorts, who also seems ready to participate in the game, possibly running bases.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, two young boys are also involved in the game. One of them is in the motion of pitching the ball; he is wearing a white shirt with dark pants. Nearby, the second boy is wearing a stripe-patterned shirt with dark pants, standing alert and ready for action.\n\nIn the background, the setting includes several other elements that enrich the context. There’s a red playground structure that partially obscures additional people, suggesting the park is well-utilized by various groups. Trees are scattered throughout the background, providing greenery and some shade. To the far right, a large, gray industrial-like structure dominates the view, possibly a water storage facility, contrasting with the park’s natural and recreational environment.\n\nThis scene is likely from a familial or community gathering, emphasizing leisure and active participation in sports, indicating a warm and communal atmosphere. The grass is noticeably green, and the sky, while mostly overcast, hints at a comfortable, mild day perfect for outdoor activities. Overall, the photograph tells a story of community, recreation, and perhaps a typical weekend day in a suburban or semi-urban area.","title":"Baseball game in Ferry Street Park, one of the two playgrounds in Sewaren.
