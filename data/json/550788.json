{"path":"550788.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat somber wetland or marshland scene during what appears to be either dusk or dawn, given the low light levels and the overall tone of the environment. The main focus of the image is a large body of water, which reflects the dark, silvery light of the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, there are tall grasses, primarily in shades of dark green and brown, creating a textured border at the bottom of the image. The water, which could be a river or lake with a calm surface, dominantly occupies the middle and background of the image. Scattered across the water are numerous tree stumps and remnants of trees, submerged and protruding from the water surface, adding a sense of desolation or aftermath of ecological changes, such as logging or natural decay.\n\nThe background reveals a distant tree line with dense woodland, hinting at an extensive natural habitat. The scene does not include any visible human activity or animals, focusing instead on the quiet and stillness of the landscape. This type of environment might typically host various wildlife species, particularly those adapted to wetland ecosystems, though none are depicted in this photograph.\n\nThe overall mood is tranquil yet somber, with a strong impression of isolation and untouched natural beauty despite signs of ecological change or disturbance. The color palette is subdued, with deep blues, grays, and earth tones dominating, enhancing the atmosphere of tranquility and the poignant beauty of a natural scene.","title":"River flowage (an overflowing onto adjacent land) is a result of destruction of forest cover--in this case by reckless lumbering practices of the 19th century.
