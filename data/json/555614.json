{"path":"555614.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive quarry or mining site. The scene is characterized by large mounds of unearthed earth and debris, with different shades of brown, gray and slight greenery. The terrain is rough and uneven with visible tracks from machinery or vehicles, suggesting recent activity. The appearance of dirt paths winding through the site contributes to a sense of ongoing operation.\n\nIn the background, there is a dense line of trees atop the higher borders of the quarry, offering a sharp contrast to the barren, excavated foreground. The skyline is clear with a few scattered clouds, indicating good weather conditions at the time of the photograph. The visual perspective of the photograph encompasses a wide angle of the site, showing both the depth and breadth of the excavation. There are no visible people or moving machinery, giving the area a deserted feel, although it is clearly a site of industrial activity. The absence of vibrant colors or vegetation in the excavation area highlights the industrial nature of this environment. Overall, the photograph conveys a robust industrial atmosphere focused on mining or resource extraction.","title":"Buttes, mesas and canyons remain after coal companies have strip mined off route #800 near Barnesville, Ohio","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["555622","545529","555625","554833","552422","543674","554765","543861","545533","555621","552004","544139","554836","553784","554804","549148"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["quarry","site","excavation","mining","breadth","excavate","machinery","encompass","extraction","resource"]}
