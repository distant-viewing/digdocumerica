{"path":"552137.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This image features a river with turbulent, foamy water flowing downstream. The scene is captured from a high vantage point, possibly a bridge or a similar structure, giving a direct view over the river. The river is flowing rapidly, evidenced by the white foam and swirls marking the water's surface. On either side of the river, there are dark, solid embankments which confine the water, possibly part of the bridge's infrastructure.\n\nIn the background, under a gloomy sky with hints of blue and pink hues near the horizon, there's a partially visible bridge crossing the river in the distance. This backdrop also includes sparse trees without leaves, suggesting a colder season, and a strip of forested land which can be seen extending across the horizon behind the bridge.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo carries a sense of somber tranquility mixed with the powerful movement of the water. The photograph seems to have been taken during dusk, adding to the dramatic and slightly ominous quality of the scene.","title":"From the weyerhaeuser company kraft pulpmill secondary- treated water is discharged into a slough in the snohomish estuary at everett","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["550367","550742","547650","547502","550698","549550","544856","553388","549482","549542","553855","550658","553416","547526","553395","553653"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["bridge","river","turbulent","flow","embankment","foamy","swirl","strip","foam","water"]}
