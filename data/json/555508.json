{"path":"555508.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The image shows a close-up of a vintage gas pump meter. The panel's main color is an off-white or cream, with black numbering and lettering providing contrast. \n\nOn the upper part, the text reads \"AMOUNT OF SALE\" with a mechanical counter underneath showing \"00 00,\" presumably indicating the total cost spent in dollars and cents. Just below it, \"GALLONS\" followed by a similar counter reads \"00.00\" indicating the volume of fuel pumped. \n\nTo the right side of the gallon counter, there is a price indicator stating \"29 9/10 CENTS PER GALLON ALL TAXES INCLUDED,\" again showcasing the units cost per gallon plus taxes.\n\nOn the upper left, there is a circular seal which reads \"STATE OF OREGON\", \"DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE”, \"ESTD 1889\", \"TESTED\", “1965”, probably certifying the accuracy or servicing of the pump. Below the seal, it is faintly legible and reads, \"ACCURATE DELIVERY FROM 3 GALLONS PER MINUTE TO FULL FLOW AT ANY PRESSURE,\" which suggests the pump’s capability or specification in delivering fuel.\n\nThere are slight visible signs of wear and aging on the machine, evidenced by small scratches and a faded surface. The bolts and assembly parts are subtly visible on the sides. The minimalistic and functional design of the panel reflects the utility-oriented design of past technology.","title":"Sign of the past is this abandoned gasoline pump with a price of 29.9 cents per gallon.
