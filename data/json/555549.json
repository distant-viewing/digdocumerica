{"path":"555549.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The image presents a tranquil natural scene featuring a body of water, likely a stream or river. Its surface primarily mirrors the sky but maintains a distinct reddish-brown hue, possibly indicating either a reflection of sunlight at dusk or a characteristic of the water's composition, such as sediment or pollution. Along the foreground, various-sized rocks and boulders are scattered both within the water and along its edges, creating a rugged, uneven riverbank.\n\nThe left side of the image shows dense collections of debris, including dead leaves, branches, and possibly trash, accumulating along the water's edge, highlighting potential environmental neglect or natural accumulation. Directly above this, the reflection of trees can be observed in the water, suggesting that there are wooded areas nearby, contributing to the scenery's secluded and serene atmosphere. In the distance, the watercourse appears to be bordered by vegetation, enhancing the sense of a natural and undisturbed location, save for the signs of pollution.","title":"Olentangy river was polluted june 20, 1974, when fire and explosions desTroyed a pennwalt corporation chemical storage building and chemicals spilled into the river, causing a major fish kill for four miles downriver.
