{"path":"557908.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures a scene set in an urban car service area, likely during nighttime, given the illuminated setting and artificial lighting. In the foreground, a young woman stands facing away from the camera toward a large, gold-colored classic car—possibly from the 1970s with its distinctive elongated body shape and shiny chrome details. The woman is dressed in a light pink jacket over a floral dress, white footwear, and has long, brunette hair. She holds what appears to be a matching white handkerchief or cloth partially over her head, suggesting she might be shielding her face or wiping something away, adding a sense of mystery or personal moment to the image.\n\nThe car’s driver is visible through the open driver’s side window, looking straight ahead with his hands attentively on the steering wheel, seemingly waiting or about to drive away. This interaction or lack thereof between the two individuals invites various interpretations, perhaps hinting at a narrative or connection waiting to unfold.\n\nThe setting includes neon lighting and mechanical infrastructure typical of a gas station or a car service bay, conveying a somewhat industrial atmosphere. The photo also features elements like bright red gas pumps and a street-lit ambiance that accentuates the vintage feel and the Americanness of the scene. The dark, yet vivid colors create a visually striking contrast, highlighting the main subjects and setting a mood that resonates with themes of nighttime solitude or urban life.","title":"Woman waits for her car to complete testing at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Since January, 1975, all light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must be tested annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, and be given a safety check. All other vehicles in the city must undergo only the safety check. The Cincinnati air agency had added four new emissions officers to the staff to look for vehicles with visible emissions and outdated stickers.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557874","546849","557847","557900","545316","557766","548958","557863","552412","557927","555475","557871","557841","556703","545337","545321"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["nighttime","driver","gas","car","service","footwear","interpretation","neon","cloth","pump"]}
