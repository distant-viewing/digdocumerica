{"path":"544632.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photo captures an outdoor scene within a dense forest or wetland area that likely features an elevated wooden walkway or boardwalk stretching into the background. The setting is rich with tall trees, some of which are very thick and have textured barks, likely indicative of an old-growth forest. The trees are densely populated with a mix of green and brown foliage, suggesting either a seasonal change or a diverse species composition.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is standing on the wooden boardwalk, which appears weathered and lightly covered with moss or discolored due to exposure to the elements. The man, wearing khaki trousers, a grey buttoned shirt, and sturdy black shoes, is focused on photographing the scene above him with a camera. He seems engaged in his task, possibly documenting the forest canopy or wildlife. His pose indicates concentration and a keen interest in his surroundings.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph evokes a sense of tranquility and exploration, with human interaction that is respectful and attentive towards the natural environment. The image provides a glimpse into a moment where nature and human interest intersect gracefully.","title":"Fahkahatchee stRand of cypress in big cypress ben, a national historic site","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["547011","553464","543452","543446","545488","553752","546947","553373","549234","542791","554134","542716","555116","545512","554958","554976"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["boardwalk","forest","interest","buttoned","khaki","indicative","species","bark","document","intersect"]}
