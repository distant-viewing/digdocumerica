{"path":"543318.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene with a group of cattle grazing on a hill. The foreground is dominated by a vibrant, dense field of yellow flowers that spans across the frame. Three cows, two of which are almost entirely black and one with a distinctive white face, can be seen amid these flowers. Beyond the cows, the land slopes gently upwards, leading to a tree that stands alone near the top of the hill. The sky is overcast, giving the entire scene a soft, diffused light that enhances the color of the flowers. The composition of the image, with its contrast between the bright yellow of the flowers and the darker tones of the cattle and the landscape, creates a serene and picturesque rural setting.","title":"Flowers along Swanton Road","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["542627","542626","552566","550833","545153","554560","542628","554071","557022","557749","548984","557012","555645","546102","542652","545905"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["flower","cattle","cow","graze","hill","yellow","diffuse","span","slope","land"]}
