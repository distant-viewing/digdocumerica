{"path":"544841.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a large informational sign displayed prominently in the foreground. The sign is titled \"HARVEST\" and includes a detailed message about the process and philosophy of timber harvesting, comparing it to wheat harvesting but on a temporal scale of decades. The text highlights the potential temporary loss of beauty when timber is cut, but presents an optimistic view of future forest regeneration and management ensuring continued availability of timber and natural beauty for future generations. The sign specifically mentions \"Uncompahgre National Forest,\" and is sponsored by \"Colorado Timber Products Co.\"\n\nThe sign is dark brown with white lettering, and features a graphic illustration depicting a historical image of timber harvesting; trees being felled and transported. The title \"HARVEST\" is at the top in bold letters, and at the bottom, there are additional identifying greens signs indicating the forest and company involved.\n\nIn the background, behind the sign, a sparse forest can be seen. The trees are thin, fairly uniform in size, and appear to be leafless or bare, suggesting a dormant period or the aftermath of timber harvesting. The natural landscape suggests a rugged, possibly mountainous area. The sky is not visible in the image, emphasizing the focus on the sign and the tree-covered landscape behind it.","title":"Public relations by a logging company","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["544913","545045","544239","542823","542789","542834","555198","553573","543724","543637","550354","555143","550664","556922","542624","555146"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["timber","harvest","sign","title","forest","wheat","loss","availability","harvesting","illustration"]}
