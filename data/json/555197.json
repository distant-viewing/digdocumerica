{"path":"555197.jpg","date":"August 1967","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a frog peeking out from muddy water, photographed at a close-up angle giving a detailed and focused view on the subject. The frog's head and front limbs are visible above the surface, showing its colorful skin patterned with shades of brown, black, and patches of vibrant orange. The eyes of the frog are protruding and glossy, adding a vivid element to its appearance.\n\nThe muddy water and the terrain around the frog blend in shades of deep brown and red, with textures that suggest a soft, possibly wet mud. There are subtle disturbances in the mud around the frog, indicating recent movement or adjustments in its position.\n\nDue to the close proximity of the shot and the angle, the background is uniform and mostly out of focus, emphasizing the frog and its immediate surroundings. The lighting seems natural, highlighting the wetness of the environment and the reflective quality of the frog's eyes. Overall, the composition of the photograph centers on the vivid details and textures of the frog against the muddy background, capturing a moment of stillness in a natural setting.","title":"Frog in a silted stream--one that is permeated with topsoil that has been eroded down hillsides and into water courses, in olympic national timberland, Washington.
