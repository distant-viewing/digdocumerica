{"path":"552298.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph features a man engaged in the task of handling fishing nets aboard a boat. The man appears focused and intent on his activity, manipulating a line of large, spherical white buoys attached to a net. He is casually dressed in a red and black plaid shirt paired with blue jeans, which suggests practical work attire.\n\nThis scene takes place on a boat, as indicated by the watery backdrop and part of the boat visible in the lower portion of the image. The background is a blurry natural landscape, likely a river or lake setting, given the presence of the water and forested area on the far shore.\n\nThe composition of this photo focuses on the man by placing him centrally. The nets and buoys create a repeating pattern and textural element that draw the eye, while the natural light illuminates the subject and nets, emphasizing the details of the fishing equipment and the manâ€™s engagement in his task. The overall atmosphere is one of a calm, quiet day likely dedicated to the maintenance or setup of fishing gear, a pivotal activity in a fisherman's routine.","title":"Nick Jerkovich, Jr., of Gig Harbor, a small fishing community in southern Puget Sound, works on seine net for salmon fishing in southeast Alaska.
