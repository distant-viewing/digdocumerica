{"path":"548859.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is a photograph of a laboratory scene, taken from an observerâ€™s point of view peering through a window in a wooden door. At the bottom of the doorframe, there is a yellow caution sign saying \"Radioactive materials,\" with the radiation symbol prominently displayed. \n\nThrough the window, the lab is visible; it's a neatly organized but utilitarian space typical of research or clinical environments. Inside, one individual, dressed in a white lab coat, is standing and seems engaged in some activity at a bench or counter that is cluttered with various laboratory items like bottles, containers, and possibly scientific equipment. The person is slightly bent over the workspace, focusing attentively, suggesting an ongoing experiment or task.\n\nThe laboratory itself is equipped with cabinets, shelves filled with supplies, and further scientific apparatus. It has a simple tile floor, and the overall lighting appears to be artificial, typical for an indoor work environment. The image creates a sense of curiosity and caution, accentuated by the presence of the warning sign on the door about radioactive materials, suggesting the sensitive and potentially hazardous nature of the work being carried out inside the lab.","title":"Laboratory at EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["546303","555254","549332","546278","555249","549608","548865","548860","555265","546344","555253","555281","547710","549342","546284","543834"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["lab","laboratory","caution","door","cabinet","observer","peer","experiment","counter","say"]}
