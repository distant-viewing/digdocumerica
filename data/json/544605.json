{"path":"544605.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a striking scene of numerous birds in flight against a golden sky. The birds, possibly cranes or herons, are silhouetted and scattered across the image, giving a sense of movement and grace. There are varied poses among the birds, with wings at different stages of the flapping cycle, suggesting the simultaneity of motion.\n\nIn the middle lower part of the image, there is a prominent white circle, which is likely the sun, rendered softly to avoid overpowering the scene and provide a calm center to the busy sky. The sun's placement adds a tranquil mood to the dynamic activity of the birds.\n\nThe background of the image shows a faint outline of tree tops at the bottom edges, adding a slight contrast and a hint of the landscape below this aerial dance. The monochrome yellow-to-orange gradient of the sky enhances the silhouette effect, focusing the attention entirely on the shapes and movements of the birds without distraction from colors or other elements.\n\nOverall, the image creates a poetic interplay of light, shadow, and form, capturing a moment of natural beauty and freedom.","title":"Chokoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Mexico, Gulf of","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553875","544609","550382","550888","554646","557208","544601","549772","544597","557203","544834","552238","543922","544612","550887","553776"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","heron","grace","dance","cycle","sun","distraction","circle","freedom","movement"]}
