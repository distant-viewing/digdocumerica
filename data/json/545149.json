{"path":"545149.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a serene and picturesque sunset scene over a body of water, possibly a lake. The sky above displays a magnificent transition of colors, from a deep blue at the top, blending into vibrant oranges and reds near the horizon where the sun has recently set behind distant hills or low mountains.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a wooden pier extending into the water, supporting a solitary structure that resembles a small boathouse or covered dock. The silhouette of the boathouse and pier are stark against the glowing colors of the water, which reflect the sky with varying hues of pink, orange, and deep blue.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful and somewhat melancholic, likely capturing the quiet moments of twilight. No human activity or movement is discernible in this tranquil setting, emphasizing a sense of calm and stillness. The waters are gently rippled, suggesting a mild breeze may be present.\n\nThis composition skillfully plays with light and shadow, while the natural colors of the sunset provide a dramatic backdrop that highlights the simple, yet striking architecture of the boathouse and pier.","title":"Fishing dock at sunset","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["554404","543143","545911","554759","550299","557447","557497","550296","544711","552294","543613","545000","552263","552277","551280","545019"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["boathouse","pier","sunset","orang","breeze","water","strike","resemble","transition","stillness"]}
