{"path":"548532.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures an engaging scene of a sailing competition. It features a man controlling a small sailing dinghy with a white hull and a sail marked prominently with the number \"20.\" The man is looking towards the camera with a focused expression, wearing a white shirt and dark shorts. He's actively involved in maneuvering the boat, using his body weight by leaning out over the water.\n\nThe sail of the boat is predominantly white, fitted with a red lower part that provides a striking contrast against the neutral tones of the sail and the deep blue sea. The background shows other boats participating in the race, hinted at by several colorful sails scattered across the depicted seascape. The sea itself is textured with small waves, suggesting mild to moderate wind conditions, ideal for sailing. In the distant background, a buoy or a small marker is also visible on the water, possibly indicating the race course or a point of navigation.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a dynamic and focused moment in a sailing race, highlighting the sailor's concentration and the vibrant setting of competitive sailing.","title":"Sailboat race on chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549425","548522","548526","549421","549426","543953","549389","549404","547450","549082","549424","548513","549409","544029","548519","549405"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","race","sail","boat","competition","sailor","sea","weight","buoy","fitte"]}
