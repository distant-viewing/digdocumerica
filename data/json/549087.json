{"path":"549087.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man, laughing joyfully as he engages in a manual task. The man has a full beard and mustache, both streaked with gray, and he wears a green woolen hat and a red and black checkered flannel shirt. He is holding what appears to be a metal tool or part of some equipment. His surroundings suggest a rustic and possibly maritime setting, with various objects and containers that resemble workshop or ship-repair materials around him, such as ropes, a bottle, and metal items.\n\nUnder a structure that provides partial sunlight, the background shows glimpses of a bright and clear blue sky. The man is partially bending over a workspace or bench crowded with items, imparting a sense of a busy, functional environment. His gleeful expression and active engagement with his tools suggest a moment of contentment or accomplishment within his craft.","title":"Murl Emery of Nelson, Nevada, runs a museum, collects old mine machinery, works mining claims, and goes adventuring by pickup and motorcycle.
