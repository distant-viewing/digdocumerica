{"path":"552732.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a bustling urban setting, potentially a busy street in a city. A police officer, dressed in a light blue shirt, dark vest, and matching helmet, mounted on a brown horse, is raising his hand as if signaling or directing traffic. The officer and horse are positioned on what appears to be a grassy median between lanes of traffic.\n\nIn the foreground to the right, there are two women and a small child in a stroller. One woman, wearing a white and brown striped sweater, glasses, and dark pants, is pushing the stroller. The other woman, dressed in dark, flared trousers and a brown vest over a long-sleeved white shirt, is standing beside her, looking towards the mounted officer.\n\nThe background reveals a busy street scene with numerous pedestrians crossing the road and walking along the sidewalks. Various vehicles, including cars and buses, hint at a period setting that might suggest the 1970s or 1980s, judging by their designs and colors.\n\nThe composition conveys a moment captured during daily city life, juxtaposing the traditional policing method of a mounted officer with the typical urban environment, filled with pedestrians and modern vehicles. The image captures a diverse array of activities and modes of transport within a single urban setting.","title":"Mounted policeman on busy downtown thoroughfare","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["554354","556277","554293","546635","549932","547205","555461","546661","557276","546743","546637","546634","546633","546631","550098","544395"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["officer","stroller","vest","horse","pedestrian","mount","median","woman","mode","traffic"]}
