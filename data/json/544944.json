{"path":"544944.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic landscape scene dominated by an expansive sky filled with striking cloud formations at dusk. The clouds, which range in color from deep orange to dark purple and black, suggest the possibly impending or ongoing storm conditions. The light from the sunset casts a gradient of colors across the sky, creating a visual contrast between the dark clouds and the glowing horizon.\n\nThe landscape beneath is composed of layered silhouettes of hills or low mountains, which stretch across the frame, receding into the distance. The terrain is dark and barely discernible due to the low light conditions, focusing the viewer's attention on the vivid sky above. The image conveys a sense of serene yet powerful natural drama, suggesting the quiet moments that often precede or follow a storm. There is no presence of people or human-made objects in the scene, reinforcing the natural and untouched essence of the environment. The composition and mood of the photograph suggest themes of tranquility, awe, and the potent forces of nature.","title":"Shiprock in smog - photographed from mesa verde","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado","nn1":["544123","550390","552896","544119","552483","544359","545375","557575","547352","543023","547356","546100","543712","550391","557182","545000"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["storm","drama","reced","awe","beneath","hills","cloud","force","condition","orange"]}
