{"path":"543862.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of agricultural workers hoeing a field of crops under a bright, sunny sky filled with cumulus clouds. The setting is a large farm with a vast expanse of cultivated land. In the image, there are six workers spaced evenly apart, engaged in the task of hoeing. They are lined up along a long, straight, narrow dirt path that extends toward the horizon.\n\nThe workers are wearing informal, lightweight clothing suitable for field work and sun hats to protect themselves from the sun, which suggests that the weather is warm. Each one is using a long-handled hoe to tend to the crops, which appear to be some type of broad-leafed plant, likely a vegetable.\n\nThe soil in the rows between the plants looks dry and crumbly, indicating arid or semi-arid conditions or a recent lack of rainfall. In the distant background, the flat landscape is interrupted only by a few structures, possibly farm buildings, and minimal vegetation other than the cultivated plants. The vast open sky and the flat terrain give a sense of openness and scale to the farming operation. The overall composition of the photo captures the labor-intensive nature of farming and the rural setting.","title":"Migrant workers weed sugar beets from dawn to dusk for $2.00 an hour","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["553879","543858","557478","554108","557696","543845","543481","553659","548900","546964","553665","549050","552812","548997","554054","544246"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["cultivated","worker","farming","crop","plant","cumulus","vegetable","tend","sun","interrupt"]}
