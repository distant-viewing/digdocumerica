{"path":"556492.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a woman engaged in the gentle act of smelling a flower. The woman appears introspective or possibly enjoying a quiet moment. She has dark, smooth hair and wears dark-framed glasses; her visible attire suggests a black, knitted sweater. In her hand, she delicately holds a small branch or stem with a cluster of white flowers and some green leaves, which she brings close to her nose, likely taking in the scent.\n\nThe background is softly focused and shows natural tones that might suggest a field or a wooded area, with shades of earthy browns and greens, providing a calm, unobtrusive backdrop to the subject.\n\nThe lighting in the image is subtle, highlighting the woman's face gently from the side and casting some shadows while illuminating the flowers, enhancing the intimate feel of the moment being depicted. The overall composition combines the natural beauty of the environment with a human element, creating a serene and thoughtful scene.","title":"Martha ann crider comes from a coal mining family and is the wife of a retired miner living in fireco, near Beckley, West Virginia.
