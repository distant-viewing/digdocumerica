{"path":"557729.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures an active construction site scene, predominantly featuring a large crane operation. On the left side of the image, a man is seen operating the crane from within its partially enclosed cab, which is painted white with red and includes the number \"65-B\" printed on its side. The operator, a Caucasian man wearing a sleeveless shirt and brown pants, is seated, focusing on his task.\n\nThe crane itself, predominantly metal with a lattice structure, is seen lifting a large bucket filled with earth. The bucket, suspended by chains, hovers mid-air, capturing the action of moving dirt, indicative of land excavation or site preparation.\n\nThe background of the photograph presents a rural or semi-rural setting, with green, tree-covered hills in the distance that suggest a spacious environment. On the right side, further into the background, there are two structures indicative of ongoing construction or recent development. One building, directly in view, displays wooden framing and roofing in progress, suggesting a new build or an expansion.\n\nThe overall setting and equipment suggest that this scene is from a development or construction project, likely residential given the size and structure of the buildings in the background, focusing on earth moving as part of the site preparation work. The environment is somewhat muddy, typical of construction sites, with track marks from vehicles or machinery present in the foreground.","title":"Dragline operator works on a moat and canal system for a new alpine village at the outskirts of Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown.
