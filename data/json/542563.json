{"path":"542563.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people gathered by a water body, likely during an outdoor excursion or educational field trip. The setting appears to be in a natural environment with hills in the background and lush greenery around. There are about 18 individuals in the group, displaying a mix of attentiveness and casual interest towards a man standing in the front, who seems to be addressing the group. The man addressing the group is wearing a fishing vest and a hat, suggesting that he might be talking about a fishing-related topic or nature.\n\nThe group consists of a diverse range of ages and appearances, including children, middle-aged adults, and seniors. They are dressed in casual, outdoor-appropriate attire, such as jackets, sweaters, and hats. Some individuals are standing, and a few are sitting on the ground. The expressions on their faces range from curious to attentive, and they are all facing towards the man who is speaking.\n\nIn the background, beyond the water, a mountain or hill covered with trees can be seen, enhancing the scenic beauty of the location. To the right edge of the frame, you can see part of a vehicle, which, along with the presence of the group in such a setting, suggests that this might be part of a planned outing or educational trip. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the soft, diffused lighting and the shadows.","title":"Streamside meeting of \"fly fishermen for conservation\" with fame warden john peabody","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["544529","558066","543736","557005","554670","554665","557036","543236","554672","543234","544003","543609","543181","554517","556526","543238"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["group","address","trip","fishing","few","topic","excursion","attentiveness","range","outing"]}
