{"path":"557096.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric view of a multi-span bridge crossing a calmly flowing river. The image is taken during either dawn or dusk, as indicated by the soft pastel colors of the sky, which has hues of pink and blue blending into each other, providing a tranquil backdrop.\n\nThe bridge itself is an engineering marvel, featuring a series of trusses that include both triangular and rectangular shapes, suggesting it is likely designed to accommodate both road and possibly rail traffic. The series of spans increases in height and complexity towards the middle of the river, where the main navigation channel might be located, facilitating the passage of taller vessels.\n\nIn addition to the bridge, the surrounding environment plays a significant role in the composition. The forefront is somewhat shadowed and features deciduous trees that are either in a state of autumnal decline or early spring growth, indicated by the sparse leaves. The water of the river reflects a slight shimmer of the sky's colors, enhancing the overall peacefulness of the scene.\n\nThis photograph likely aims to convey the interaction between human-made structures and the natural environment, highlighting both the utility of such constructions and their aesthetic integration into natural sceneries. The ambiance created by the lighting and colors evokes a sense of calm and quietness.","title":"Early morning view from a Bluff at Atchison, Kansas overlooking the Missouri river and plans to the east.
