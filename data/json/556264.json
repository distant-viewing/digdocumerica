{"path":"556264.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph shows a woman engaged in writing or reviewing a document. She appears focused on the content of the papers she holds in her left hand, while her right hand holds a pen, poised to write. This indicates she might be either studying, taking notes, or possibly correcting a document.\n\nHer attire includes a vividly patterned blouse with floral designs under a dark vest; the combination suggests a professional or semi-formal setting. Additionally, she wears large, round, hoop earrings that add a personal style element to her appearance.\n\nThe background is minimally detailed, showing a plain door and a part of what appears to be a simple, dark-colored cabinet or shelf, suggesting this activity is taking place indoors in a utilitarian space, possibly an office or a classroom. There is some natural light, as indicated by the subtle highlighting of her features and documents, enhancing the focus and concentration on her task.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image centers on the womanâ€™s engagement with her work, using a shallow depth of field to blur the background and emphasize her and the activity she is involved with.","title":"Black student in a black studies history class in a west side Chicago school with her classwork.
