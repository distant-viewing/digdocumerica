{"path":"547191.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an urban street scene that appears to be from an earlier decade, given the vintage of the cars and the style of clothing. A woman stands in the foreground on the right side of the image. She is dressed in winter clothing, including a black coat and a colorful knitted hat. The woman is looking over her shoulder towards the camera, with a somewhat serious expression on her face.\n\nThe setting is a busy city street lined with shops and cars. The street is filled with a variety of cars that suggests the photo might be from the 1970s or 1980s. There's a visible sign above one of the storefronts that says \"Money Orders Checks Cashed,\" indicating a financial service location, and there are yellow posters with prices of different items or services displayed in large black text.\n\nIn the background, there is an elevated train track structure, suggesting this might be in a city with an elevated transit system like Chicago or New York. Pedestrians can be seen walking along the sidewalk and crossing the street. There is a mix of architecture styles in the buildings across the street, including a notable building with a large front window and a classic detailing above it.\n\nOverall, the photograph presents a dynamic city environment showing a combination of daily life and commercial activity.","title":"Sheridan road bus stop at layola elevated train station","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["549863","556726","548369","546626","556711","547190","556199","556224","548399","556710","549645","546672","556808","549882","554329","551125"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","city","service","cash","car","clothing","price","say","poster","storefront"]}
