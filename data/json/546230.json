{"path":"546230.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph showcases an old, rusted car positioned in front of a wooden building. The car, which appears to be from the early 20th century based on its design, has a deep rust color with aged paint peeling off in places, adding to the artifact-like feel of the scene. It features a classic convertible body style with spoked wheels, suggesting it might have once been a prestigious model. Notably, the car is missing its windshield, and the interior is exposed to the elements.\n\nThe building behind the car is constructed from weathered wooden planks, with variations in color ranging from light gray to dark brown, indicating long-term exposure to the weather. Part of the building includes a door or large window which is slightly ajar, adorned with netting that seems to have a pelican shape cut into it, perhaps serving as a creative, decorative element.\n\nBeneath the car and around the scene is well-kept green grass, suggesting the presence of a maintained property despite the age and condition of the structures and vehicle. The overall environment has a rural or rustic quality, evocative of a bygone era, possibly maintained partly for its historical interest or as a relic from the past. The composition of the photo, with the vehicle in the foreground against the textured backdrop of the building, creates a strong nostalgic feel.","title":"Abandoned auto","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["552995","545540","553008","550797","554920","547481","555922","544641","546405","550683","546177","546318","547601","553002","549107","551021"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["car","netting","pelican","artifact","windshield","past","building","term","variation","feel"]}
