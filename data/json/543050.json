{"path":"543050.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric view at either sunrise or sunset. The central focus is a famous suspension bridge, partially obscured by low-lying clouds or fog, over a large, shimmering body of water. The sun, positioned at the right of the frame, casts a warm golden glow onto the clouds and the water, creating light reflections that emphasize the tranquility of the scene.\n\nThe terrain surrounding the water features softly outlined hills and mountains, contributing to the depth and the layers in the composition. The fog adds a mystical quality, partially enveloping the land and the bridge, revealing only parts of its structure and cables.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is peaceful and somewhat otherworldly, owing to the dreamlike quality of the light and the ethereal nature of the fog. It provides a perspective that places emphasis on natural beauty and the impressive engineering of the bridge as it connects the two obscured landmasses.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542807","542798","542804","548415","547669","548335","544722","543087","557096","552598","547703","546810","552846","545022","549547","548978"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","fog","suspension","landmass","quality","cloud","engineering","sunrise","cable","emphasis"]}
