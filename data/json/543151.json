{"path":"543151.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a multi-colored rock surface. The predominant feature of the image is the intricate pattern of the rock layers, which display an array of colors including shades of brown, beige, gray, and reddish hues. These color variations create wavy bands and swirls across the surface, indicating geological processes over time.\n\nThe rock texture appears smooth with a polished look in certain areas, contrasted by rough, pitted sections that suggest natural erosion. There are several notable dark lines and cracks crisscrossing the rock, some filled with what appears to be darker sediment or moisture, emphasizing the rock's history of stress and fracture.\n\nIn several areas, small pools of water or moisture accumulate in the depressions on the rock surface, reflecting light and highlighting the rockâ€™s uneven texture. There are also patches of what could be small marine or plant life, such as mosses or lichens, adding tiny dots of organic texture to the otherwise inorganic scene.\n\nOverall, this image provides a detailed macro perspective of a rock formation, emphasizing the beauty and complexity found in natural geological patterns.","title":"California--point lobos state park","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["555182","550474","545558","553770","544907","554410","545589","552543","543149","546165","550476","543421","545795","550483","544815","553582"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","moisture","depression","stress","lichen","texture","accumulate","surface","pit","band"]}
