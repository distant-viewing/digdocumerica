{"path":"552814.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a large-scale excavation or construction site shown in a state of activity. The foreground presents rough, muddy terrain characterized by deep tire tracks and standing puddles of water reflecting the overcast sky. The ground is predominantly brown, filled with clumps of mud and earth. \n\nIn the middle distance, several heavy construction machines, including cranes and trucks, are visible, suggesting ongoing work. These machines are surrounded by disturbed earth, likely moved during the excavation process. In the background, the landscape becomes more flat and less cluttered, transitioning to what appears to be a wooded area under a cloud-filled sky, hinting at a rural or semi-rural setting. \n\nThe scene captures the gritty reality of industrial work, emphasizing the impact of such operations on the land.","title":"Excavation of \"borrow\" pit in bohemia, in Plaquemines Parish dirt is used for building roads and levees","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["553378","549205","545665","547225","554809","543785","556939","545661","545662","547523","544812","553383","547591","556506","552004","545652"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["excavation","machine","earth","clumps","reality","construction","cluttered","become","puddle","mud"]}
