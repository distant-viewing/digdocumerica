{"path":"548497.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This is a detailed photograph depicting an osprey chick in a nest. The chick is directly positioned at the forefront of the image, showcasing a highly detailed and intense expression. The bird’s eyes are large and orange, its feathers are mottled with black and white patterns which give it a rough texture resembling its juvenile plumage.\n\nThe nest itself is composed of an assortment of sticks and small branches, creating a somewhat chaotic structure typical of an osprey’s nest. The background is simple and blurred with a gradient of blue and light color, suggesting the photo could have been taken on a clear day with a broad, open sky or near a body of water.\n\nInterestingly, attached to the man-made structure near the bird, possibly a part of a lighthouse or other navigational marker, is an old-fashioned light fixture. This includes a metallic base and a weathered, cylindrical lamp with a glass covering that's slightly cloudy and reflective. The juxtaposition of natural elements (the osprey and the nest) with human-made objects (the navigation light device) provides a compelling visual narrative about wildlife adapting to human environments.","title":"At home on a channel marker in chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548505","548490","548493","544505","544501","544513","553876","548501","555010","544547","555012","544489","555011","549231","557614","547196"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["nest","bird","lighthouse","plumage","feather","adapt","marker","navigation","fixture","assortment"]}
