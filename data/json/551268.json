{"path":"551268.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph portrays a woman sitting comfortably in an oversized, egg-shaped rattan chair. She is dressed in a sleeveless light pink or white top and white shorts, smiling warmly towards the camera. Her arms are crossed loosely over her lap, enhancing the relaxed and content vibe of the scene.\n\nThe chair features a distinctive web-like design that provides a visually appealing texture. Behind the chair, slightly out of focus but still discernible, you can see a blurred dark background that subtly highlights the chair and its occupant.\n\nThe womanâ€™s cheerful expression and casual attire suggest a relaxed, possibly leisurely setting, indicating that this photo might have been taken in a laid-back social or personal environment. The overall composition of the image, focusing on the woman and the chair, positions them as the central elements of interest against a nondescript background, which may have been manipulated to keep attention on her and the unusual design of the chair. The natural lighting in the photograph is soft, adding to the serene and inviting atmosphere.","title":"Mrs.  Charles welek in basket chair on first level balcony of the welek's house on lake ozark","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["548459","556484","544742","547340","548621","554193","551271","556482","556413","553191","546479","553541","556176","558336","553156","558337"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["chair","web","woman","manipulate","occupant","lap","keep","content","lay","design"]}
