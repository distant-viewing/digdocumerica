{"path":"546519.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of urban solitude within a modern architectural setting. The scene is composed of a series of angular, brutalist concrete structures creating dynamic lines and shadows. The image is dominated by a large diagonal concrete beam, which intersects the frame, creating a striking visual divide.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, an open concrete staircase leads up to the top of the composition, where a person in a red blouse stands at the rail, looking out of the frame. The bottom section of this staircase forms a small, dark nook.\n\nOn the right side, beneath the shadow of the concrete beam, there is a man seated at a round table, deeply engrossed in reading or writing, creating an impression of quiet study or reflection. There are a couple of wooden chairs present, one of which is occupied by the man, and a few papers scattered across the table, suggesting an academic or contemplative environment.\n\nThe background is constructed of more layered concrete platforms and elements, suggesting a multilevel structure with sparse cylindrical elements on top that might be lighting fixtures or structural decorations.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts an intriguing blend of architectural form and human presence, emphasizing themes of isolation and engagement amidst urban design.","title":"Interior courtyard of Southside Junior High School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546515","546526","546500","546511","546470","546498","546506","558211","546510","552724","546528","556027","555318","546531","551476","549317"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["staircase","beam","table","writing","round","reading","fixture","decoration","form","study"]}
