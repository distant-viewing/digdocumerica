{"path":"552228.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a moment where a German Shepherd dog is investigating an overfilled garbage bin in a park setting. The garbage container, colored yellow, is rectangular in design and accompanied by four lid-covered cylindrical bins also packed with trash, suggesting the accumulation of waste exceeds the capacity of these bins. Surrounding the bins, a significant amount of litter is scattered across the grass, including food packaging, drink containers, and cardboard boxes such as one labeled \"Root Beer.\"\n\nIn the background, we can see a body of water likely a lake or river, bordered by lush reeds and foliage that suggest a natural, possibly rural, park environment. It appears to be a sunny day given the brightness and the shadows cast on the ground. The overall scene conveys a theme of neglect or the aftermath of a heavily frequented public space, focusing on themes of environmental concern and the impact of human activities.","title":"Overflowing litter cans on the shore of Lake Washington - a dog's delight","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["548307","548305","550146","542541","550801","545494","544298","557307","547983","548131","544640","549833","548210","546382","549936","544637"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["bin","garbage","container","packaging","lid","park","capacity","theme","drink","cardboard"]}
