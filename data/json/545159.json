{"path":"545159.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a rural scene marked by a weathered fence running across an open field. To the right of the image, prominently featured is a sign mounted on the fence that reads \"NO ADMITTANCE CITY VEHICLES ONLY.\" This suggests the area may be reserved or restricted for certain uses, possibly related to municipal activities.\n\nThe fence, built with wooden posts and several rows of barbed wire, separates the viewer from a rough dirt track which disappears into the distance along the middle of the composition. The terrain is dominated by brownish grass or vegetation, hinting at either a dry season or a landscape that naturally lacks lush greenery.\n\nThe background features a dramatic sky with heavy, scattered clouds, suggesting overcast weather which may be typical of the region or season. The horizon is flat, with only the subtlest hints of distant tree lines or natural features, reinforcing the expansive and somewhat desolate nature of the location. \n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of restriction and isolation, underscored by the sign, while featuring the expansive and rural quality of the landscape.","title":"Part of the Astoria estuary (which is an old landfill.)
