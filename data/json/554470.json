{"path":"554470.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people engaged in an outdoor activity, possibly preparing for a canoeing trip in a forested area. The scene includes three vehicles each with a canoe mounted on top, suggesting an organized group outing.\n\nIn the foreground, a green station wagon has its rear hatch open, and a man in a red sweater and jeans stands on the edge of the hatch, adjusting or securing a cream-colored canoe tied to the car's roof. An older man to the left, wearing glasses, a plaid jacket, and dark pants, appears to be observing or waiting to assist.\n\nIn the background, another vehicle, possibly a green van, also features a roof-mounted canoe; a person in a red shirt is visible near this van. Next to it, there is another car, partly obscured behind trees, which also has a canoe on its roof.\n\nThe setting is deeply wooded with a mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees, and the ground is covered with fallen leaves and patches of grass, indicating early autumn or late summer. The unpaved, muddy road enhances the rustic, outdoorsy feel of the scene. Overall, the composition suggests teamwork and preparation, set against the backdrop of a nature adventure.","title":"Members of the canoe and kayak club from Vermont unload their canoes on car racks in the Adirondack Forest Preserve near indian lake","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554463","554464","554661","545225","546880","544759","558072","545734","554469","553133","549996","554683","550767","553806","554684","554681"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["canoe","hatch","van","roof","mount","next","teamwork","cream","out","trip"]}
