{"path":"552035.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures a young boy from behind as he walks away, likely exploring or playing in a park. The focus is on the boy, who is dressed in a short-sleeved white shirt and light-colored pants. His hair is cut short.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor area covered with grass, softly lit by what appears to be late afternoon sunlight. The presence of scattered leaves across the ground suggests it might be during fall. A young tree with a notably dark trunk is positioned in the foreground on the left side of the image, contributing to the composition by framing the scene and adding depth.\n\nThe background shows an open, sunlit field which appears peaceful and inviting, emphasizing a sense of freedom and exploration typically associated with childhood. The lighting accentuates the peaceful essence of the environment, casting gentle shadows and bathing the scene in a warm glow. There are no other distinct objects or people immediately visible, which highlights the solitude and simplicity of the moment captured.","title":"Midsummer evening on Goat Island.
