{"path":"542935.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a striking juxtaposition of industrial and residential areas. The upper part of the image shows a vast industrial complex situated along a body of water. The industrial area features multiple smokestacks emitting plumes of smoke, and numerous large buildings associated with heavy industry. Several large piles of red-brown earth or minerals are present, indicating some type of mining or material processing. There are large parking areas filled with vehicles, suggesting a significant workforce.\n\nIn contrast, the lower part of the photo depicts a neatly organized residential region consisting of numerous rows of identical houses, laid out in a grid pattern. Each house in the development seems to have a similar size and shape, pointing to a planned community, likely built to accommodate the workers of the nearby industrial facilities. The streets are arranged in straightforward, orderly lines, and there are no visible vehicles or people, giving it a somewhat deserted appearance, though this could be due to the perspective and distance of the aerial view.\n\nThe overall scene is enveloped by a landscape that appears semi-arid, with sparse vegetation visible in the surrounding area. The juxtaposition in the image underscores the stark contrast between industrial development and residential living, possibly highlighting socio-economic themes related to industrial communities.","title":"Stacked lumber and lumbermill","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551569","551145","545354","544059","551146","551174","552191","544502","544067","552196","550866","553968","546391","545013","551074","550945"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["juxtaposition","development","accommodate","community","house","mineral","living","envelop","lay","vehicle"]}
