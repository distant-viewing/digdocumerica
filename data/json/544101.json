The waterfall is prominent, cascading down from a cliff covered with green vegetation into a large, tranquil blue pool. The water is clear, highlighting the multi-leveled, terraced falls that create a picturesque setting.\n\nSeveral people are enjoying the water; some are swimming while others sit or stand on the edges of the pool. The foreground shows a rocky, earthy bank with small plants and debris, providing a natural frame to the aquatic vista. The backdrop features lush trees and shrubs under a bright, clear sky, adding to the calm and refreshing ambiance of the place.
