{"path":"555824.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"In the photograph, there is a man standing in a setting that appears to be a large excavation site or a trench. He is of a robust build, wearing a light blue denim shirt, jeans, and a baseball cap. The man's posture is upright, and he has his right hand slightly raised, with an expression that seems like he is explaining or presenting something. \n\nThe trench itself is deep with visibly thick layers of dark brown soil, indicative of a significant dig or perhaps soil analysis work. Small plants are scattered at the base and along the sides of the trench.\n\nThe background features lush green vegetation and trees under a clear blue sky, suggesting the photo is taken on a sunny day. The overall setting looks rural, with a hint of an industrial structure vaguely visible in the far right background through the trees.\n\nThe lighting is natural, with the sunlight enhancing the earthy tones of the dug-up ground and casting shadows of the man and other objects into the trench. This setup gives the image a dynamic and textured appearance, focusing on both the individual and the environmental context he is situated in.","title":"Somerville, New Jersey, farmer with his stockpile of sludge ash. He trucks two loads per day to his farm to spread on hay fields from a nearby sewage treatment plant incinerator. One of the industries which surround his farm can be seen in the background. He rents some farmland from industry because taxes are too high for him to own all the land he uses.","placename":"Somerville (N.J.)","location":"Somerville, New Jersey","nn1":["544154","549083","542601","554794","553618","546262","545087","556447","545269","543802","548299","542548","553093","558108","543781","544371"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["trench","dig","soil","analysis","explain","baseball","denim","man","excavation","raise"]}
