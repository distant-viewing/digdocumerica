{"path":"543855.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene where two children are engaged in a playful activity, likely playing marbles on a dirt surface. The boy on the left is standing wide-legged, intently watching, and dressed in a pale yellow shirt with dark pants. His posture and facial expression suggest concentration and eagerness. On the right, another boy, partially seen, is bending over, reaching out to the ground, possibly in the act of playing marbles or picking them up. He wears a distinctively patterned red and blue plaid long-sleeve shirt paired with vertically striped pants.\n\nThe setting is an expansive outdoor area with a vast, open sky scattered with fluffy clouds overhead. In the background, there is a field, dotted sporadically with small plants, essentially presenting a rural or semi-rural landscape. There are other children and perhaps adults in the far distance, engaged in separate activities. The mountains visible on the horizon give a peaceful and secluded feel to the scene, placing the activity in a broad, almost pastoral context.\n\nThe overall composition captures a slice of childhood play, outdoor environment, and the social interaction among children, highlighting the simplicity yet engaging nature of traditional games like marbles. The image also evokes a sense of nostalgia, underscored by the vividness of the colors and the timeless quality of childrenâ€™s play.","title":"The children of migrant workers play marbles while their parents work in fields.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["543859","544354","544424","552591","543991","547193","556287","557409","556166","554072","551128","552755","553096","556437","557987","545242"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["marble","child","play","boy","pant","nostalgia","act","childhood","game","vividness"]}
