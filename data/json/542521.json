{"path":"542521.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, you are looking at an industrial facility from an aerial perspective, likely taken from an aircraft, given the visible part of the aircraft's wing in the upper left corner of the frame. This plant features a series of large vertical structures, which are tall cylindrical towers. Each tower emits a stream of white smoke or steam that ascends into the clear blue sky.\n\nThe setting of the industrial site is a barren, rocky landscape indicative of a quarry or a mining operation. The ground is dry and dusty with patches of bare earth and limited vegetation, emphasizing the industrial use of the area. The facility itself is equipped with various tanks and interconnected buildings, possibly for processing or storage related to the industrial operation.\n\nThe natural light is bright and casts shadows from the towers sharply onto the ground, suggesting that the photograph was taken either in the late morning or early afternoon. The visibility is clear, allowing for a detailed view of the site and the surrounding terrain. The overall composition of this image highlights both the industrial activity and the environmental setting, capturing a moment of operation in a stark, rugged landscape.","title":"Central California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["544691","549713","549727","544777","557293","543011","544495","548195","548376","543872","550958","545236","543764","545841","543733","550339"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["aircraft","towers","operation","quarry","site","interconnect","ascend","indicative","facility","wing"]}
