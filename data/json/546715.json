{"path":"546715.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a dense urban scene dominated by parking spaces and high-rise buildings. The scene is likely from a city environment, given the large number of cars and the architectural style.\n\nForeground: The bottom and left section features two tall residential buildings, their facades marked by rows of windows that tower over the surroundings. Between these buildings, there are pockets of smaller buildings, possibly commercial spaces, including one with a flat red roof directly at the front.\n\nMiddle ground: The central part of the image is occupied by vast parking lots filled with numerous cars. The arrangement of the cars is orderly, positioned in rows within painted lines. Different sections of the parking area are visible, separated by small paths for vehicle movement.\n\nBackground: Beyond the immediate parking lots and buildings, there are green spaces, hinting at a park or communal recreational areas. Further in the background, one can see more high-rise buildings similar in architecture to those in the foreground, reinforcing the urban setting. The abundance of green trees surrounding the parking lots and between the buildings suggests the presence of well-maintained public spaces.\n\nOverall, the image provides a significant representation of urban density and the design often seen in metropolitan areas where space optimization is crucial, signified by the large number of parked cars and high-rise buildings. The apparent lack of people in the scene focuses the viewer's attention on the infrastructure and planning of urban environments.","title":"Suburban high rise apartment parking facility","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546671","549875","546708","546579","548434","549476","543961","549310","555743","551509","546617","542580","555449","553893","546723","551506"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["parking","lot","space","rise","building","car","number","row","abundance","section"]}
