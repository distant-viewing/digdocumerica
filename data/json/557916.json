{"path":"557916.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of automotive maintenance, likely captured in a domestic setting given the driveway and residential surroundings. A man with mid-length, shaggy brown hair is actively engaged in working under the hood of a pale yellow car, possibly a classic model given its design and the visible engine components. He appears focused, leaning over and tinkering with the engine. \n\nBeside the car stands a woman with long, straight red hair and a slightly concerned or inquisitive facial expression. She's dressed in a red and white patterned blouse and dark shorts, observing the man's actions attentively. The setting includes leafy green trees in the background, suggesting a calm, suburban area.\n\nForeground elements partially obscure the view; particularly the right side of the image is framed by what appears to be a part of another vehicle, emphasizing the automotive theme. Additionally, another car—a darker colored sedan—is visible in the background, parked under the shade of the trees.\n\nThe mood seems casual yet focused, typical of a spontaneous mechanical repair or a regular car maintenance day at home. The photograph captures both involvement in a practical task and a moment of everyday life.","title":"Woman watches as minor adjustments were made to her auto's carburetor during retesting after her vehicle had failed at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
