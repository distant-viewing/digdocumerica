{"path":"544529.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people standing on a wooden observation deck by the water in a natural environment. The setting appears to be a wetlands or marshland area. The observation deck extends over a calm body of water with clear reflections visible on its surface. The foreground shows some aquatic plants, probably lily pads, floating just above the water's surface, accentuating the natural feel of the place.\n\nThe group consists of around eleven individuals of various ages, both adults and children. They are casually dressed in summer attire such as shorts and t-shirts, suitable for a warm outdoor setting. Most people are wearing hats, likely for protection against the sun.\n\nA person, who might be a guide or a leader, is standing with a microphone or speaker, potentially providing information or guiding the group. The other individuals are listening attentively or looking around, seemingly engaged in the experience.\n\nBehind the deck, the background is filled with dense greenery, predominantly tall grass and shrubs, which suggests that this location is rich in plant life and quite secluded.\n\nThe overall composition of the image along with the natural lighting suggests that this photograph was taken during the day under bright sunlight, enhancing the vivid colors of the greenery and the blues of the water. The setting is peaceful and educational, suitable for nature observation and environmental learning.","title":"Auhinga trail","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544483","542563","554491","558066","557178","557985","557005","553415","545267","557029","543736","543892","543238","551929","553357","552033"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["observation","deck","guide","group","lily","marshland","speaker","microphone","pad","learning"]}
