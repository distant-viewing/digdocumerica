{"path":"546944.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph provides a vivid view of a contrasting urban scene. It captures a water body in the foreground, polluted with various types of debris including a half-submerged refrigerator, broken pieces of wood, and miscellaneous waste materials. The water surface is calm, reflecting some of the debris and the buildings in the background.\n\nIn the background, a large, modern multi-story building dominates the scene, suggesting an institutional or corporate setting with its plain facade segmented by rows of windows. This building is situated in a well-maintained area with a manicured green space surrounding it, indicating a stark difference from the polluted water in the forefront.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a wooden dock or jetty extends into the water, populated with a few individuals. One of them appears to be fishing, highlighting a recreational or subsistence activity occurring despite the visible pollution. The dock itself is littered with smaller pieces of debris.\n\nAbove this immediate scene, the sky is clear and blue, contributing a vibrant backdrop that contrasts heavily with the pollution seen in the water below. This juxtaposition perhaps subtly comments on environmental issues or urban neglect.","title":"Crabbing from an old dock in the Middle Branch of Baltimore Harbor. Dead fish float beside the dock.
