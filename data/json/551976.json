{"path":"551976.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph captures a panoramic aerial view of an industrial area next to a waterway. The major features visible in the image include:\n\n1. **Water Channel and Ships**: The central part of the image shows a large water channel. Several vessels are present, including barges or cargo ships situated next to docks. These vessels appear to be engaged in transportation or cargo operations, with one large ship moving through the waterway, creating noticeable ripples on the water.\n\n2. **Storage Tanks**: On the right-hand side of the photograph, a large complex of white, cylindrical storage tanks dominates the scene. These are likely used for storing oil, gas, or chemicals, indicative of industrial activities related to energy or chemical manufacturing.\n\n3. **Infrastructure**: There are docks and jetties extending into the channel, equipped with cranes and other loading or unloading apparatus, suggesting active industrial operations. Roads and pathways can be seen weaving through the area, facilitating accessibility.\n\n4. **Vegetation and Terrain**: Sparse patches of vegetation can be seen around the industrial setups, and the surrounding terrain is primarily flat, with some undeveloped land visible along edges.\n\n5. **Background and Surrounding Area**: The horizon shows a more densely populated area with structures that could either be residential or additional industrial facilities, suggesting this industrial site is in proximity to an urban setting.\n\n6. **Overall Composition**: The photo gives a sense of organized industrial activity, blending the mechanical with the aquatic environment, highlighting significant human impact through industrialization near water bodies. The overall tone is somewhat muted with grey and industrial hues, hinting at overcast weather conditions.","title":"Oil tankers provide storage for a large variety of chemicals on Arthur Kill, the waterway which separates New Jersey and Staten Island.","placename":"Elizabeth (N.J.)","location":"Elizabeth, New Jersey","nn1":["550886","552007","550890","546359","548346","551609","549725","547214","550761","555724","552181","548423","552207","555776","550864","549978"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["ship","channel","chemical","cargo","waterway","vessel","dock","tank","storage","industrialization"]}
