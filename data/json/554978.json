{"path":"554978.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dense forest scene abundant in natural greenery and trees. The primary focus is on a largely unobstructed view of the forest growth with a specific emphasis on the foliage and the textures of the tree trunks.\n\nForeground: Dominated by a large tree trunk that stands prominently off-center to the right, featuring a rugged brown bark. The base of the tree, surrounded by a variety of smaller green plants, appears well-grounded in the forest floor, which is covered in rich mulch and small green plants.\n\nMidground: Numerous trees, primarily coniferous, fill the middle area of the photo. These trees have a heavy presence of green moss that clings richly to their branches, suggesting a moist environment. The trees vary in distance from the viewer, creating a layered effect that adds depth to the view.\n\nBackground: Appears less distinct due to the concentration of trees but continues the pattern seen in the foreground and midground with densely packed trees. This area contributes to the overall enclosed and lush feel of the forest environment depicted.\n\nOverall Composition: The image portrays a serene and untouched wilderness, rich in biodiversity and natural beauty. The lighting seen filtering through the trees hints at either a morning or late afternoon setting, enhancing the deep, cool hues of green and brown throughout the scene. There is a sense of tranquility and the untouched, rugged nature of a temperate rainforest. The composition successfully communicates the complex textures and vibrancy of a dense forest habitat, inviting the viewer to appreciate the serene and wild beauty of the ecosystem.","title":"Climax forest of sitka spruce approximately 400 to 700 years old with red huckleberry, devil's club, salmonberry, western sword/fern and Oregon oxalis among the ground cover, in the pacific coast area of the Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555054","555057","555043","542958","545285","546947","542725","554992","555183","554961","555114","555133","555000","558012","554425","545271"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","tree","trunk","rainforest","biodiversity","cling","appreciate","moist","communicate","plant"]}
