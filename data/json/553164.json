{"path":"553164.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, casual moment shared between two young women who are sitting on the ground in an urban public space, seemingly engrossed in a heartfelt conversation. They are surrounded by a moderately busy environment that suggests a city square or similar public place.\n\nThe woman on the left, with her back partly towards the camera, wears a red jacket over a blue shirt, paired with light blue jeans. Her hair is brown and long, cascading past her shoulders. She is holding a small bouquet of white flowers, looking attentively at the other woman as she speaks.\n\nThe woman on the right faces more towards the camera. She wears glasses and has long, straight brown hair. Her attire includes a plaid shirt over a t-shirt adorned with visible text and graphics, white pants, and brown shoes. She is holding an individual flower in one hand and seems to be mid-conversation, her expression animated. Beside her, on the pavement, rests an open book or magazine featuring a black-and-white cover photo.\n\nIn their immediate vicinity are personal items such as a brown leather bag, presumably belonging to one of the women, and some papers or napkins scattered lightly around them.\n\nThe background shows other individuals in the setting, a couple of whom are also seated on the ground, indicating a relaxed, communal atmosphere. The architecture includes steps leading up to a building with the signs of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith notably displayed, indicating that this might be a financial district or a commercial area in a city.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph is casual and peaceful, with a touch of youthful spontaneity and the vibrancy of city life subtly encapsulated in the frame.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: a flower vender has made a sale.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551436","551472","553166","556176","551462","552962","551433","551450","554909","554900","553156","547175","553244","549290","551470","550763"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["woman","city","spontaneity","flower","magazine","conversation","graphic","leather","shirt","square"]}
