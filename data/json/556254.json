{"path":"556254.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"In the photograph, an African American woman is captured from a side perspective. She is wearing a textured cream-colored crocheted hat and has visible hoop earrings. Her attire includes a high-necked yellow turtleneck sweater under a dark tailored blazer adorned with floral embroidery and embellishments. Notably, she has several pins and badges on her blazer, including one that prominently says \"PUSH\", suggesting involvement in a social or political movement, possibly connected to the historical organization founded by Jesse Jackson.\n\nThe woman appears to be speaking or reacting mid-conversation, with her mouth open and looking somewhat expressive or animated. The background is softly blurred, but hints of an urban environment are visible, including portions of automobiles and a dusky setting that suggests this might be an evening or late afternoon.\n\nThis visual detailing focuses on personal style and perhaps a moment caught in a social or political engagement, reflected through her expressive demeanor and the badges she is wearing.","title":"Black woman at the Operation PUSH Expo annual convention.
