{"path":"547412.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a friendly interaction between two men at the entrance of a house. On the left, a man dressed in a police officer's uniform stands holding his cap in one hand. He has short dark hair, glasses, and is wearing a dark uniform with a badge and an American flag patch on it. The officer is facing the house, listening attentively to the older man on the right.\n\nThe older man, standing in the doorway, is gesturing animatedly with his left hand as if he is in the middle of explaining something or making a point. He is smiling broadly and appears to be enjoying the conversation. He is dressed casually in a cardigan over a collared shirt and slacks. His expression and posture suggest he is engaged and comfortable in the exchange.\n\nThe setting is a simple home entrance with a white door and basic, white wooden trim around the door. The lighting gives a cozy and warm feel to the scene, emphasizing the friendly and casual nature of the interaction. The background inside the house is shadowy and not detailed, keeping the focus on the two men and their interaction.","title":"Seward County Sheriff Marvin Pollock and neighbor","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547165","547410","549292","546657","547759","546680","558330","546663","557868","557128","556847","546637","557767","553153","546654","552621"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Infrastructure Maintenance"],"terms":["officer","house","entrance","uniform","man","interaction","exchange","door","cardigan","slack"]}
