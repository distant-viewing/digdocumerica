{"path":"550754.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid cityscape viewed across a body of water, likely a river or lake, under a partly cloudy sky. The foreground prominently features several small sailboats gliding on the shimmering water, all tipped at slight angles as they maneuver the breeze. Each sailboat is equipped with a single, predominantly white sail.\n\nIn the background, the urban skyline consists of various buildings, including taller skyscrapers and traditional, flatter architecture. Notable among them is a tall building with a flat facade and reflective glass surface that mirrors the sunlight, standing out prominently against the more conventional buildings nearby. This cluster of buildings suggests a dense, urban downtown area.\n\nThe water body and the urban backdrop merge seamlessly, providing a dynamic juxtaposition of nature and human engineering. The overall composition of the image, with its blending of leisurely sailboats and the bustling cityscape, evokes a serene yet vibrant urban atmosphere.","title":"Sailboats of the Charles River Basin Community Sailing Club for a dollar a year, youngsters up to age 17 can join and learn to sail.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["544697","556190","552234","550758","543305","546937","544665","552265","552261","548390","547700","557273","547932","553790","555800","552251"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","cityscape","blending","glide","tip","maneuver","breeze","downtown","building","engineering"]}
