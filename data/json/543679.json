{"path":"543679.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a moment at a livestock pen under bright daylight. The scene features a man and a young child engaged in an activity involving a lasso. The man, dressed in typical ranch attire which includes a cowboy hat, blue long-sleeved shirt, jeans, and gloves, is bending over, teaching the child how to hold and possibly throw the lasso. The child, also in a long-sleeved shirt and jeans, is focused on the lasso, guided by the man's hands.\n\nBehind them, several lambs and possibly adult sheep are present, scattered around the pen which is fenced with wooden and metal barriers. The ground is a mix of dirt and patches of scattered straw. The setting suggests a rural or farm environment, indicative of animal husbandry practices, possibly sheep farming given the presence of the sheep. The overall impression is of a pastoral, educational scene where a younger generation is being taught skills traditional to a rural lifestyle.","title":"Calf-bRanding day at ranch","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543686","552580","554894","552573","554880","552579","543682","543690","554949","552568","547396","552664","552569","552564","554883","553106"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["sheep","pen","child","jeans","ranch","skill","generation","throw","livestock","straw"]}
