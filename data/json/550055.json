{"path":"550055.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This image depicts a serene garden scene intertwined with urban backdrop. In the foreground, two individuals are engaged in gardening tasks. The person on the left, wearing a light blue sweater over a darker blue or black shirt and blue jeans, is bent over, actively digging into the earth with a gardening fork. The person on the right, clad in a dark blue sweater and flared blue jeans, is holding a shovel, appearing to be in the midst of scooping or digging the soil.\n\nThe garden itself appears to be in an early stage of cultivation, with visible patches of bare earth interspersed with patches of growing plants and flowers, including some vibrant yellow daffodils. Scattered bricks and a few gardening tools can also be observed on the ground, adding to the casual, work-in-progress feel of the garden.\n\nIn the center and background of the photo, the contrast between nature and urban development is striking. Behind the garden, a traditional brick building with a distinctive green dome can be seen, adding a historical element to the scene. Further in the background, towering urban skyscrapers dominate the skyline, with the largest building covered extensively in reflective windows, mirroring the clear blue sky.\n\nThe setting is radiant under a bright blue sky, and the bare branches of an overhanging tree at the top of the frame suggest it might be either late winter or early spring. Overall, the photograph captures an intriguing juxtaposition of urban life and recreational gardening, illustrating a tranquil yet vibrant urban oasis.","title":"\"City farmers\" tend their gardens in the Fenway administered by the Fenway Civic Association.
