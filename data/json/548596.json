{"path":"548596.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts a dense forest scene, predominantly featuring tall pine trees. A haze of smoke is diffused throughout the scene, indicating the presence of a fire within the forest. The smoke is thick and bluish-gray in color, partially obscuring the view of the trees and casting a somewhat somber tone over the landscape.\n\nThe trees themselves are of various heights, with some towering over others, suggesting a natural and uneven forest growth. The terrain appears to be hilly, as the tree lines show variation in elevation. The atmosphere created by the combination of the dense forest and pervasive smoke adds a dramatic effect to the image.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests that it might be taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, where the light is not too harsh, adding to the misty, eerie quality brought on by the smoke. There are no visible figures or man-made structures in the image, reinforcing the focus on the natural environment and the environmental incident occurring.","title":"Forest fire in the everglades, collier county.
