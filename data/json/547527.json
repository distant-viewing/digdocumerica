{"path":"547527.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a devastated natural landscape characterized by debris and environmental damage. The scene is primarily composed of a muddy terrain littered with fallen, fragmented trees and branches. These wooden remains are scattered chaotically across the area, contributing to the overall sense of destruction.\n\nIn the foreground, pools of stagnant water reflect the somber, overcast sky. Among the debris, there are several white, unidentifiable objects which could be stones or litter, adding to the pollution in the scene. Notably, a prominent feature in the photograph is a white-and-gray circular object, resembling a spiral, possibly a piece of industrial or mechanical waste, lying partially submerged in a dark pool of water.\n\nThe background features more of the desolate wooded area with bare, broken tree trunks, reinforcing the theme of environmental degradation. There are no visible living organisms in the image, emphasizing the severity of the damage to this habitat. The setting appears isolated and abandoned, invoking a feeling of neglect and the impact of human or natural disturbances on the environment.","title":"Land offered for development at point judith","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547661","545254","545264","546060","555089","555162","555092","555136","555086","557008","555852","555207","555230","550950","549119","546056"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["pool","damage","litter","spiral","organism","severity","invoke","object","destruction","debris"]}
