{"path":"546985.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat atmospheric scene, evoking a sense of peacefulness mixed with a rustic charm. The foreground is dominated by the dark silhouette of an oak tree branch draped with Spanish moss, adding texture and a touch of mystery to the image. The tree's twisted and gnarled branches stretch across the frame, partially obscuring and framing the view beyond.\n\nThe background reveals a calm, expansive body of water that reflects a muted sky, hinting at either early morning or late afternoon light. Moored in the distance are several fishing boats, docked alongside a wooden pier. These boats, characterized by their tall masts and rigging, are clustered together, which suggests a small fishing community or a marina dedicated to fishing activities.\n\nThe setting appears to be a coastal or estuarine area, likely in a region where such moss-draped trees are common, suggesting a location that could be somewhere along the Southern U.S. coast. The tranquility of the scene is palpable, and the composition uses natural framing effectively, inviting the viewer to gaze into the distance and absorb the quiet beauty of the scene.","title":"Shrimp fleet of a Black-owned cooperative anchored in the water off Hilton Head Island","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["546332","551311","546057","546059","547044","552292","548247","546340","549374","544567","546963","542870","545008","552806","546998","545096"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["fishing","moss","oak","branch","rigging","boat","marina","coast","mast","mystery"]}
