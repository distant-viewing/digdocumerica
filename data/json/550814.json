{"path":"550814.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting dominated by the Mosinee Paper Mills, as indicated by the prominent text on one of the buildings. The image features an expansive view of the paper mill complex, which includes a large factory building painted in a deep red with a visible chimney emitting smoke, thus suggesting ongoing industrial activity. Adjacent to this building is a smaller structure and a water tower, highlighting essential infrastructure for the mill's operations.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a rugged landscape with rocky terrain and a waterbody that appears to be a river or a large stream. Evidently, the river goes over a decline forming a small, foamy waterfall. This natural setting contrasts with the industrial backdrop, adding a layer of complexity to the scene.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, a more administrative or possibly commercial building is visible with a red brick and white window frame facade. The area includes a parking lot with several cars, illustrating the presence of workers or visitors during the time the photograph was taken.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively juxtaposes natural elements with industrial development, reflecting a common landscape in many industrial towns. The cloudy sky and the lush greenery surrounding the area suggest it might be taken on an overcast day, adding a somewhat moody atmosphere to the scene.","title":"Scum forms on the Wisconsin River near the Mosinee Paper Company","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550818","551578","553461","553460","553399","550335","548128","551579","554630","557222","548070","553451","546236","550340","550332","550714"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["mill","waterbody","decline","building","waterfall","river","complexity","visitor","stream","chimney"]}
