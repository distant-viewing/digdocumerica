{"path":"545247.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an environmental and industrial scene where the main focus is on a large chimney emitting a plume of white smoke. The chimney appears tall and cylindrical, colored white with grey bands. It is slightly off-center in the image, tilting towards the right.\n\nThe foreground of the image prominently features tall grass or perhaps some type of shrubbery, depicted in a golden-brown color which suggests it might be dry or in a state of autumnal decay. The perspective is from a low angle, with the grass largely filling the front and bottom parts of the frame, creating a sense of being amidst the brush, looking up at the chimney.\n\nThe background is primarily composed of a bright, clear blue sky, which contrasts sharply with the white smoke and the colors of the chimney and grass. The overall composition combines natural elements and man-made structures, perhaps to emphasize a narrative or thematic juxtaposition between nature and industrialization. The choice of focus and depth of field creates a blurred foreground while keeping the chimney and smoke sharply outlined against the sky, leading to an impactful visual statement about industry in a natural landscape.","title":"Kaiser aluminum plant smokestack","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545472","543013","546760","550938","557299","550998","550905","557301","550987","550939","552184","545990","545113","545468","553933","546237"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","smoke","grass","statement","industrialization","choice","brush","shrubbery","band","tilt"]}
