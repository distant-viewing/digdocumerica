{"path":"549419.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant maritime scene featuring a group of people rowing a large, traditional wooden boat. The boat, painted in deep red with details in black and trimmed with a red railing and a red waterline, stands out against the dark blue water. The rowers, six visible in the image, are using long oars that appear to be made of wood with a natural finish. The individuals are concentrated on their rowing, facing towards the boat's stern where a person is possibly steering or coordinating the rowing activity. \n\nThe background of the picture showcases a harbor setting filled with numerous sail masts, indicating the presence of multiple moored sailboats. Beyond the sailboats, residential or commercial buildings lined along the waterfront, and some signs including one with \"Gulf\" visible, hint at a well-developed maritime locale. \n\nThe overall composition combines elements of teamwork, water sports, and harbor life, set against a clear sky suggesting a fine, bright day ideal for boating activities.","title":"Viking image on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549416","549414","549410","549411","549418","553400","548507","548513","547456","553407","549415","548509","549413","546819","548503","553401"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["rowing","boat","harbor","sailboat","waterline","oar","stern","coordinate","steer","teamwork"]}
