{"path":"542848.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene mountainous landscape enveloped in mist. The layers of the scene include a foreground of dark conifer trees, possibly pines, which form a textured silhouette against the lighter background. Moving upwards, a blanket of low-lying clouds or mist shrouds the midground, obscuring the bases of other hills and creating a mystic atmosphere. The background is composed of larger mountain ridges, which appear in varying shades of dark blue and purple tones, suggesting distance and depth. This variation in hue might indicate the presence of atmospheric haze or the time of day possibly being dawn or dusk, which softens and blurs distant objects. The highest visible peaks are faint and blended into a slightly lighter sky, which might be suggesting early morning or late evening light. The overall composition and the interplay of light and shadow give the image a tranquil, ethereal quality, emphasizing the quiet beauty of a mist-covered mountainous landscape.","title":"California--Siskiyou National Forest","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["555110","555132","555131","552695","555536","542923","554647","546764","544070","542676","554398","555126","553825","554402","542924","557000"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mist","basis","blanket","pine","variation","ridge","midground","dawn","haze","peak"]}
