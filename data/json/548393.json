{"path":"548393.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This image captures a bird's eye view of a large ship’s bow at the foreground, pointing toward a bustling urban skyline. The ship features a classic wooden deck with several decks visible, each lined with white railings. The prominent feature of the ship is a golden-yellow funnel located centrally, identifiable as a characteristic element of luxury liners.\n\nThe front deck is mostly empty, giving an unobstructed view of the structure and design of the vessel. There's a small white vehicle, resembling a cart, positioned centrally on the lower section of the bow, likely used for transporting goods or personnel around the ship. There are also several lifeboats secured along the side of the ship, ready for emergency use.\n\nBehind the ship, the picture shows a large harbor area with another cruise ship docked nearby, suggesting a busy port scenario. The backdrop is dominated by a striking cityscape—a panorama of high-rise buildings and skyscrapers under a cloudy sky. Notably, there is smoke or steam rising amidst the buildings, adding a dynamic element to the urban scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is overcast, with a suggestion of either early morning or late afternoon light, imparting a slightly gloomy yet dramatic effect to the setting. This image powerfully contrasts the serene, organized nature of maritime transport with the bustling, chaotic energy of city life.","title":"Cruise ship in New York Harbor","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548403","548400","555789","555721","549892","555722","555800","550034","544657","546925","555810","555799","548320","555729","550910","544599"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","deck","bow","cruise","suggestion","panorama","luxury","funnel","personnel","emergency"]}
