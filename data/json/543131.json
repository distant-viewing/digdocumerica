{"path":"543131.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph features a striking view of a natural geological formation known as columnar basalt. These are tall, closely-packed columns with mostly hexagonal shapes, which are a result of volcanic activity and the subsequent cooling and contraction of thick lava flows. The columns have distinct vertical lines and are predominantly grey with parts covered in yellowish lichen or moss, indicating some degree of weathering and biological activity.\n\nThe columnar basalt formation rises at a sharp angle, almost in a tilted plane relative to the viewerâ€™s perspective, which adds to the dramatic effect of the scene. At the crest and the edges of the slope, several pine trees are seen emerging directly from the cracks between the basalt columns and atop the formation, showcasing the resilience of nature as flora thrive in seemingly inhospitable conditions.\n\nThe background is a bright blue sky dotted with soft, white clouds, suggesting a clear, fair weather day. The color contrast between the earthen tones of the rock, the green of the trees, and the blue of the sky enriches the visual appeal of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a balance between the rugged, imposing texture of the rock formations and the organic, soft forms of the pine trees, underlined by the expansive sky. It is both a testament to geological phenomena and the adaptability of ecosystems.","title":"Peculiar hexagonal columns, similar to a pile of fence posts","placename":"Devils Postpile National Monument (Calif.)","location":"Devils Postpile National Monument, California","nn1":["555084","544363","545801","552685","543504","545797","554410","544910","549228","545791","552890","544745","552444","555592","545117","544341"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","column","pine","lava","testament","phenomenon","lichen","degree","crest","plane"]}
