{"path":"549522.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The image is an aerial photograph of an industrial area situated on a narrow piece of land extending into a large body of water. The photograph offers a broad view of several large industrial structures, including buildings, storage tanks, and containers. Notably, there is a cluster of three dark-colored cylindrical storage tanks positioned near the center of the peninsula.\n\nTowards the base of the peninsula, adjacent to the waterfront, are rows of red freight train cars lined up parallel to each other. These train cars and tracks suggest the site's connectivity to rail transport. The industrial site is predominantly surrounded by water, giving it a somewhat isolated appearance.\n\nThe land around the industrial structures appears mostly barren, with few signs of vegetation or greenery. The surrounding water body is a deep blue color, emphasizing the contrast with the industrial facility.\n\nIn the background on the left side of the image, another part of the shoreline is visible, showing more developed areas with various buildings and a structured layout, possibly another industrial sector or a more urbanized area. \n\nOverall, the composition captures a vivid picture of industrial activity located on a strategically important yet minimally developed peninsula, emphasizing functionality over aesthetics.","title":"International Paper Company plant at North Tonawanda on the Niagara River","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["552245","555776","552131","548423","549526","555786","549978","550886","551574","551566","551998","552835","550890","549495","552007","547214"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["peninsula","train","tank","sector","storage","site","connectivity","freight","land","functionality"]}
