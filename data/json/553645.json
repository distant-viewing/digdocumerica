{"path":"553645.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from a logging operation. The focus is on a man measuring logs with a tape measure. He is dressed in a grey shirt with rolled-up sleeves, blue jeans, and work boots, complemented by a hard hat. His concentrated expression and the action of measuring suggest he is verifying the logsâ€™ dimensions, possibly for inventory or sale.\n\nThe logs themselves appear large and numerous, lying horizontally on the ground, covering the majority of the image's foreground. They are dark in color, hinting at moisture possibly due to recent rain or their storage environment.\n\nIn the background, a vast area stretches out filled with similarly felled logs lining a cleared landscape. The sky is dynamic, with significant cloud cover suggesting an overcast day, and there appears to be more personnel in the distance, indicating an active work site.\n\nThe photograph illustrates the scale of logging operations and the meticulous task of processing and measuring timber, showing both the labor involved and the impact on the landscape.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain range near Sonora, California. Salvage operations on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly. At Pickering lumberyard, scaler measures logs trucked in from burn area. Crews racing to beat fall snows worked so fast that logs were not stacked but dumped in Random piles.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553641","553646","553642","554419","545046","555472","553612","553647","542856","554418","548155","542769","553643","553648","553631","554427"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","tape","personnel","measure","dimension","operation","majority","timber","logging","work"]}
