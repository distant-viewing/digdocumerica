{"path":"544923.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a historical site that appears to be an ancient kiva, nestled amidst a natural landscape. The kiva, a circular structure typically used by the Puebloan peoples of the American Southwest, is constructed from stone and adobe. It has several layers of stone walls that create a descending design, leading down into the floor of the structure. The entrance is marked by a flat ground plan that surrounds the top of the kiva, which would have historically been used for religious or communal activities.\n\nThe kiva is partially reconstructed, as indicated by the more orderly layering and fitting of stones near its top, contrasting with possible original, more weathered sections below. This site is situated on sloping terrain covered with shrubbery and trees, featuring a diverse array of green hues and textures. Behind the kiva, sloping hills densely populated with shrubs and trees rise, suggesting the kiva is located in a secluded and possibly protected area. The lighting suggests the image was taken in natural daylight, which casts shadows on the kiva and enriches the texture of the scene. The composition of the photograph showcases a blend of cultural history and natural beauty, emphasizing the integration and harmony between the constructed kiva and its surrounding landscape.","title":"Cliff Palace is the largest ruin discovered in Mesa Verde.
