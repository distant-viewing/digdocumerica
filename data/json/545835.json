{"path":"545835.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This image depicts a large-scale excavation or strip mining operation viewed from an aerial perspective. The landscape is visibly altered by the operation, showing vast exposed earth with deep trenches carved into it. The trenches are filled with dark water, contrasting sharply with the lighter color of the exposed soil and rock. The water within these trenches reflects a bit of light, indicating either movement or some quantity of oil or similar substances floating on the surface.\n\nOn the surface above the excavation site, a grid-like pattern of roads and paths can be seen, some lined up very directly while others are more irregular. These paths separate various sections of the operation and seem to provide access for vehicles, which are not visible in the image.\n\nIn the middle and background of the image, the landscape transitions to a more natural and agricultural setting, with plots of land divided into farm fields. Scattered trees and small structures, possibly homes or farm buildings, punctuate this rural backdrop. The contrast between the largely untouched agricultural land and the heavily industrial excavation site underscores the environmental impact of such operations. The colors overall are muted, with earthy tones dominating and small patches of greenery indicating the presence of vegetation.","title":"Big brown coal mining operation","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549177","543674","549173","544064","543857","543758","550572","543861","554769","549172","549174","544498","552177","549171","551204","554768"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["trench","excavation","operation","farm","expose","path","quantity","site","alter","land"]}
