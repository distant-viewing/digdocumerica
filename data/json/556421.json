{"path":"556421.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph features an elderly man seated indoors, engaging with a medium-sized dog. The man has neatly combed, slicked-back gray hair and is wearing large, square-framed glasses. His attire includes a buttoned-up shirt underneath a blue cardigan. His expression is affectionate and attentive as he looks downward towards the dog he is gently touching.\n\nThe dog, appearing tranquil and well-cared for, rests closely against the man, contributing to a sense of warmth and companionship between the two. The focus and lighting in the image emphasize the interaction, casting the man's face partly in shadow and highlighting his hair and the upper parts of his attire.\n\nThe room around them is softly blurred in the background, with indistinct features possibly including a green door or cabinet, suggesting a quiet domestic setting. The overall mood conveyed is one of peaceful coexistence and mutual comfort.","title":"Edgar Zornes of Clothier, West Virginia, near Madison with his dog. A miner for 23 years, he has black lung.
