{"path":"544212.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene by a body of water. On the right, there is a white, sturdy-looking houseboat moored at the edge of the water, featuring large windows and a roof that appears flat and usable. A small red and white boat is tethered alongside the houseboat. A sign on the houseboat clearly reads \"FOR SALE BY OWNER,\" suggesting that the boat is up for sale.\n\nTo the left of the boat, a warning sign that reads \"HIGH PRESSURE GAS LINE\" is prominently displayed, giving caution about the presence of a gas line in the area. In the background, there's a heavy-duty structure that seems like a mechanical installation related to the gas line, dominating the mid-background with its industrial aesthetic.\n\nThe background further shows lush greenery forming the horizon line and is complemented by a lightly clouded blue sky, giving the scene a calm, albeit slightly industrial, rural vibe. The overall composition of the photograph, balancing elements of daily life with industrial equipment and natural beauty, offers a glimpse into a specific locale where human habitation closely intersects with utility infrastructure amidst a natural setting.","title":"Bayou fisherman's boat.
