{"path":"547488.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural landscape, primarily a wetland. In the foreground, there is a water body that reflects the sky and clouds. Surrounding the water are lush grasses and reeds. The main grassy area is vivid green, interspersed with patches of purple wildflowers or plants which add a contrasting hue to the scene.\n\nIn the middle distance, the landscape opens up to show a more expansive view of the wetland, with similar vegetation stretching across the scene. This part of the image also displays scattered water pools which further reflect the sky, enhancing the visual connection between sky and land.\n\nIn the far background, a line of trees can be seen, providing a natural border to the wetland. The trees appear sparse and are spread out along the horizon. The sky above is relatively clear with soft cloud formations, indicating a calm weather day.\n\nColors in the photo are rich and saturated, contributing to a vibrant yet tranquil atmosphere that is typical of wetland environments. The overall composition portrays a natural, undisturbed landscape that is thriving with wetland flora, and emphasizes the peaceful coexistence of water and land.","title":"Salt marsh in Tiverton","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["557498","550786","550783","550670","545033","547532","553856","547589","544515","547500","550785","546205","547489","544530","547924","553084"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","land","thrive","reed","wildflower","cloud","coexistence","water","pool","flora"]}
