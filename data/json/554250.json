{"path":"554250.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts a snow-covered landscape prominently featuring warning signs about avalanche danger. Two identical bright red signs are affixed to a slim vertical pole rising from the snow. The signs read \"AVALANCHE DANGER!\" in bold white letters and contain additional information which states \"SKIING IN AREA BEYOND THIS SIGN PROHIBITED.\" The background shows a dense forest of snow-laden coniferous trees shrouded in mist, creating a serene yet cautionary winter scene. The atmosphere is overcast and appears quite cold, suggesting harsh winter conditions suitable for avalanches. This scene likely captures a ski area where such dangers are common, emphasizing safety and restrictions on access.","title":"At some points, just skiing through can start an avalanche.
