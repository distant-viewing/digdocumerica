{"path":"551518.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures two men in a canoe on a river or lake, engaging in a kayaking activity. The scene is set against a backdrop that includes a lush, densely wooded area and a bridge. The bridge, visible in the background, appears to be a sturdy structure, possibly made of steel, with several arches that span over the water. One of the bridgeâ€™s pillars can be distinctly seen rooted in the body of water.\n\nThe men appear to be relatively young and are shirtless, likely enjoying a warm day. Both are paddling, with the man in front holding his oar on the left side of the canoe, and the man at the back holding his on the right side. They seem focused on their activity, giving an impression of leisure mixed with the effort involved in maneuvering the canoe.\n\nThe water itself has gentle ripples and splashes around the canoe, indicating movement. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, adding a soft quality to the overall ambiance of the scene. The photograph overall has a recreational, serene feel, capturing a moment of outdoor adventure and camaraderie amidst a natural setting.","title":"Canoeing on the Mississippi River","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["549996","550659","553806","546880","550772","547213","550774","554469","554465","553345","550822","553409","554468","550767","551546","550823"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","bridge","oar","man","camaraderie","overall","pillar","arch","splash","adventure"]}
