{"path":"555417.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a man seated at a cluttered desk, deeply engrossed in reading a sheet of paper. He is dressed in a light yellow dress shirt and his focus is entirely on the document he's holding. Prominent in the foreground is a briefcase with a bold, yellow sticker that humorously commands, \"TURN OFF THE DAMN LIGHTS!\" \n\nThe background of the image is blurred but suggests an office environment with various stacks of books and papers, and a large wall chart or map partially visible. The overall tone of the image is indicative of a typical office setting, emphasizing a moment of concentration amidst a somewhat chaotic workspace, highlighted by the humorous sticker which adds a touch of personality and possibly some insight into the occupant's perspective on energy conservation or office etiquette.","title":"\"turn off the damn lights\" stickers mirrored the seriousness of the energy situation in Oregon during the fall of 1973.
