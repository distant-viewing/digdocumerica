{"path":"545150.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and rugged outdoor scene featuring a motorcyclist engaged in a hill climbing activity. The setting is a steep, sandy hill with patches of grass and small shrubs. The foreground shows part of the hill's slope, characterized by loose and eroded earth, indicating frequent use for this type of sport.\n\nThe motorcyclist is positioned near the center of the image, ascending the slope. He is dressed in protective gear which includes a helmet, gloves, and long-sleeved jacket, all typical for motorcycling. His bike is equipped with a visible number plate, marked with the number \"127.\" His posture and the angle of the motorcycle suggest rapid movement and the challenge of negotiating the steep incline.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate action, there is a glimpse of a parking area with several cars, adjacent to a roadway with more vehicles in motion. This area is bordered by dense, low-lying trees and beyond this natural barrier, there's a wide stretch of a sandy beach that meets the ocean. The overall atmosphere is overcast with no direct sunlight, adding a moody tone to the scene.\n\nThe photograph provides a snapshot of adventure sport juxtaposed against a tranquil natural landscape, showcasing a moment full of energy and motion within a serene coastal environment.","title":"Motorcyclist on hills","placename":"Agate Beach (Or.)","location":"Agate Beach, Oregon","nn1":["553955","553954","545598","551382","543723","547588","544844","543727","544840","543209","548690","553056","545788","543731","545135","544038"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["steep","sport","number","slope","motion","climbing","incline","motorcycle","erod","bike"]}
