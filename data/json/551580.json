{"path":"551580.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph appears to be an aerial view of a dam on a river surrounded by dense forest. Directly observable is the water flowing through the dam, visible as turbulent white foam contrasting sharply with the dark blue of the calm river waters. The dam itself is a long, narrow structure spanning the river, and several small buildings can be seen adjacent to the dam, likely facilities associated with the dam's operations.\n\nThe river upstream of the dam shows darker water and less turbulence compared to where the water spills through the dam, indicating higher depths or slower flow before reaching the dam. Downstream, the foamy, agitated water spreads out before partly merging back with the sedate portions of the river.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is heavily forested with thick green tree cover, suggesting a deeply rural or possibly protected environment, often typical for such infrastructure which can be placed to minimize human disruption. There are no visible roads or other significant human-made structures other than the dam and the small associated buildings, emphasizing the isolated nature of this facility.\n\nThe image might have been taken during a bright, clear day, given the ample light and shadows casting over the terrain and water, enhancing the visibility of the waterâ€™s texture and the lush green colors of the trees.","title":"Northwest Paper Company on the St. Louis River at Cloquet discharges smoke into the air and sulphite liquor into the river.","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["548024","549497","548940","551212","548007","549004","548925","552471","553137","549486","550743","550701","548936","548016","553372","548003"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["dam","river","water","turbulence","disruption","facility","foam","cover","visibility","flow"]}
