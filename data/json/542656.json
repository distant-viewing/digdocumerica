{"path":"542656.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image depicts a vast scrapyard filled with stacked and crushed cars. There are numerous vehicles piled atop one another in an unorganized manner, occupying almost the entire frame of the photograph. The cars vary in color, including shades of blue, white, beige, and black, although many show signs of rust and deterioration, indicating they have been exposed to the elements for a considerable period.\n\nThe condition of the cars is poor; they are heavily damaged with dents, missing parts, and crumpled bodies, showing that they have been compressed and possibly prepared for recycling. No visible people or animals are present in the scene, focusing entirely on the discarded vehicles.\n\nThe background is almost entirely obscured by the piled cars, but slight glimpses of the sky suggest an outdoor setting. The lighting appears natural, possibly on an overcast day given the flat lighting and lack of harsh shadows. This setting evokes themes of waste, environmental impact, and the life cycle of manufactured goods.","title":"Pile of wrecked autos at Klean Steel Co.","placename":"Long Beach (Calif.)","location":"Long Beach, California","nn1":["545303","552738","554352","553005","553006","554320","554348","545365","555492","552999","545340","546268","554311","546172","547476","551547"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["car","dent","cycle","scrapyard","deterioration","manner","good","rust","vehicle","lack"]}
