{"path":"546869.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a construction worker in action. The man, who is the focal point of the image, is wearing a yellow hard hat with what appears to be a green decal or logo on the front. He is clothed in a tan or light brown jacket and is wearing heavy-duty gloves. The worker is looking upwards, his face angled towards his raised hand, which is pointing or reaching towards something not visible in the frame.\n\nIn the background, there is industrial machinery that hints at a construction or industrial site. Notable is the large orange crane structure visible behind the man. The sky is overcast, and the presence of steel structures further accentuates the industrial setting. The overall impression is one of a worker actively engaged in his job, possibly giving directions or signaling to other workers, set against the backdrop of a busy, operational industrial environment.","title":"Longshoreman unloads cargo at Dundalk Marine Terminal, a Maryland Port Authority facility, in Baltimore Harbor.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["553618","544171","542497","553634","556187","556391","556315","544835","556186","555239","553610","556903","546929","556447","555816","546414"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["worker","decal","job","tan","construction","glove","signal","duty","point","reach"]}
