{"path":"557700.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a young boy engaging in an outdoor cooking activity. The boy, who appears to be in his early teens, is using a hose to add water to a large, metal kettle filled with shellfish, which is suspended over an open fire. The scene suggests a clam cooking process, typical of outdoor seafood preparations.\n\nThe boy is attentively managing the hose, looking down at the kettle to ensure proper water addition. He wears a short-sleeved, patterned shirt featuring a geometric design and has a hairstyle typical of the late 20th century.\n\nThe cooking setup includes a rustic wood-and-metal support structure for the kettle, which directly sits over a fire built from logs. There's also an additional metal bucket positioned underneath the kettle, possibly catching drips or used for additional purposes related to the cooking process.\n\nIn the background, we see a rough, gravel-covered ground leading into a treed area, suggesting a rural or semi-rural setting. The environment is daytime with natural lighting that highlights smoke rising from the cooking area and the natural setting around the boy.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of traditional outdoor cooking, possibly during a family or community gathering, emphasizing a hands-on approach to preparing a meal.","title":"Youngster sprays water on boiling peanuts in Helen, Georgia near Robertstown.
