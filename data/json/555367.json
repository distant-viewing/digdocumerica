{"path":"555367.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a sunny desert landscape featuring varied species of cacti in the foreground and two transparent geodesic dome structures in the background. Prominently, on the left side of the frame, there's a cluster of prickly pear cacti with rounded, flat pads; some of which are bearing deep violet-colored fruits. Closer to the bottom right, a smaller cactus with sharp thorns displays several vibrant pink flowers in bloom.\n \nIn the background, the geodesic domes appear to be constructed with a metallic frame covered in transparent material, possibly for agricultural or research purposes given the desert setting. These structures are roughly centered in the image. Surrounding these domes, the land is arid, with sparse desert vegetation scattered around, including some taller brush and smaller shrubs. \n\nThe ground is dry and dirt-packed, indicative of a desert environment, under a clear blue sky with no visible clouds, emphasizing the openness and isolation of the setting. The composition suggests a relationship between the natural desert flora and the human-made structures, possibly exploring themes of ecological interaction or habitat research.","title":"Normal desert environment with cactus at the university of Arizona environmental research laboratory at Tucson contrasts with the solar heated greenhouses in the background where high intensity agriculture and aquaculture have greatly increased yields","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["544879","545709","555346","545717","555886","555307","553996","555370","545727","544401","544400","545903","545754","555353","545797","549123"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","dome","cactus","research","fruit","pad","relationship","brush","openness","explore"]}
