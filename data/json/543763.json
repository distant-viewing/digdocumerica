{"path":"543763.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape with a dramatic mountainous backdrop. In the foreground, there is a brown field which seems to be either fallow or recently harvested, containing rows of bare, wooden fence posts that hint at the area's agricultural use. This section is bordered by a wire fence.\n\nMidground of the image shows a cluster of buildings, including small houses or farm structures painted in white, which stand out against the more muted tones of the environment. These buildings are nestled among a variety of trees — some leafless and perhaps dormant, others evergreen — which add a touch of life and greenery to the scene.\n\nBeyond the immediate rural setting, the landscape ascends into forested hills, which are partially obscured by mist or low-lying clouds, creating a mystical and somewhat ethereal effect.\n\nDominating the upper portion of the image are majestic mountains, their peaks covered in snow, suggesting a cold or alpine climate. The mountains rise starkly against the sky, with their details slightly blurred, likely due to mist or the photograph's exposure to light.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is tranquil and slightly somber, with a palette dominated by earth tones and the whites of the mountain snow, contrasting with the subdued sky. The composition skillfully layers these various elements, creating depth and inviting the viewer to contemplate the quiet beauty of this natural landscape.","title":"Dallas Divide","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553073","544857","554722","543660","553811","554721","556341","550667","543654","555537","543720","557519","543827","554801","554402","552695"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["mountain","mist","snow","fence","evergreen","white","farm","wire","exposure","post"]}
