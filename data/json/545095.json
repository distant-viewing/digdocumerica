{"path":"545095.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural coastal scene. It appears to be low tide, revealing a stretch of muddy flats and algae-covered rocks. The watery area reflects the light, scattered with numerous small, shimmering pools left by the receding tide.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a person crouched down, seemingly engaged in the examination or collection of items from the flats. The individual wears a dark jacket and boots, which suggests preparedness for a potentially wet environment. The person's attention is focused towards the ground, indicating a possible interest in marine or tidal life, or perhaps in gathering shellfish or similar.\n\nThe background features calm waters that extend to the horizon, meeting a sky with subtle gradients of blue. The distant shoreline shows hints of greenery and possibly forested areas, implying a relatively remote or natural setting. The overall lighting of the scene, with cool tones and a diffuse light, suggests either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe atmosphere is one of tranquil solitude, emphasized by the wide-open spaces and the single human figure immersed in the natural setting. The composition emphasizes the vastness of the environment compared to the human presence, highlighting an interaction with nature that is careful and attentive.","title":"Bill Wick, professor of wildlife and head of the marine advisory program at","placename":"Newport (Or.)","location":"Newport, Oregon","nn1":["555400","547602","552236","545183","547504","546953","544729","550826","542556","554002","542976","547913","545294","543186","544687","557508"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["flat","tide","shellfish","preparedness","examination","algae","stretch","person","pool","boot"]}
