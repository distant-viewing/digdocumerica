{"path":"548390.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial or high-angle view of a city scene, likely a large urban center. The foreground of the image features a river that meanders through the composition, with two visible boats traveling along the water. In the middle of the river, there are two small islands or land formations, one of which seems to have the skeletal structure of what might be a demolished pier or building.\n\nThe city skyline forms the background, dense with numerous high-rise buildings that fade into a hazy, somewhat polluted air, suggesting either early morning light or atmospheric conditions typical of urban settings. Among the buildings, certain distinctive architectural features and spires can be seen, reminiscent of iconic skyscrapers, hinting that this might be a view of a well-known city like New York.\n\nThe overall color tone is subdued, with a palette consisting primarily of grays and muted blues, intensifying the sense of early dawn or dusk. The photo captures the sprawling, densely populated nature of the city and the busy, navigable waters that cut through it, reflecting the vibrancy and activity of urban life.","title":"Skyline of Manhattan, looking west above the East River","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548347","548320","552715","548407","548416","548334","553865","548384","548339","548381","548365","548412","548380","549814","548378","557273"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","demolish","intensify","spire","vibrancy","know","island","river","meander","skyscraper"]}
