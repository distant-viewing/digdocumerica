{"path":"549787.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a devastated urban scene, possibly following a fire or similar disaster. The composition centers on a large pile of debris scattered across what seems to be a damaged building's interior or an alley. Among the rubble, there are the recognizably charred and twisted remnants of various items like furniture, household items, and personal belongings.\n\nIn the middle of the debris, a prominent object is a partially burnt piano, tilted sideways with its interior exposed and keys visible. The piano's yellow paint is scorched and peeling, and numbers \"1523-10\" are painted on its side, possibly an inventory or identification number.\n\nThe background features the remains of brick walls, heavily blackened by soot and fire, with some portions entirely missing, exposing the inner frameworks of the building. Windows are either broken or completely absent, and no intact structure appears in the visible area. The ground is littered with an array of detritus, including papers, fabrics, a metal drum, and partially burned books among various unrecognizable debris.\n\nThe overall sense is one of destruction and abandonment, conveying a poignant aftermath of a catastrophic event. The lighting suggests daylight but is somewhat bleak, casting an overcast atmosphere that enhances the somber mood of the scene.","title":"Trash-filled lot behind apartment house on upper Lexington avenue at 105th street, Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557349","550260","553470","555540","557351","544797","550253","547888","551088","553548","553556","546120","557350","550263","547868","544468"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["fire","interior","debris","scorch","number","expose","blacken","sideway","tilte","detritus"]}
