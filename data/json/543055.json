{"path":"543055.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic coastal landscape. The scene is focused on a vast beach with dark sand, contrasting sharply with the white foam of breaking waves. The shoreline is gently curved, and the ocean is visible in the upper portion of the image with waves rolling towards the shore. \n\nThere are several large rocks and boulders scattered both near the water's edge and further out in the sea. These rocks break the monotony of the waves and add a rugged feel to the seascape. The beach is quite expansive and appears to be very isolated and serene, except for a single person walking on the beach to the right of the image. This person adds a sense of scale and solitude to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, closer to the bottom right corner, there are two small structures, possibly wooden, which could be parts of a broken boat or driftwood washed ashore.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful yet undeniably powerful, showcasing natureâ€™s contrast between the calm of the beach and the vigor of the ocean. The color palette features muted tones of blue, grey, and brown, enhancing the image's natural and serene feel.","title":"Solitary walker","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["551554","543287","543237","543078","543069","543250","548088","543255","545106","542890","555400","543090","546953","543092","543081","547607"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","wave","ocean","monotony","driftwood","seascape","rock","boulder","foam","person"]}
