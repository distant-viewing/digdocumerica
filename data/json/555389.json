{"path":"555389.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a prominently displayed sign from the fast-food chain Dairy Queen, set against a clear blue sky with a few clouds. The top of the sign features a large, red and oval-shaped emblem with the \"Dairy Queen\" logo in white script. Below this emblem is another board that reads \"Capitol\" in a playful, looping white font affixed to a background of vertical striped paneling.\n\nBelow the name \"Capitol,\" there is a large message board framed with light bulbs (which are off) along its edges and decorated with small, colorful balloon-like elements on the top edge. The message on the board states, \"OUR LIGHTS ARE OFF TO SAVE ENERGY! WON'T YOU HELP TOO?\" in bold black font, emphasizing an energy conservation message. There are small flags and banners visible at the edges of the frame, adding a festive touch to the scene.\n\nOverall, the sign conveys a community-minded message urging energy conservation, set in a casual and friendly aesthetic typical of Dairy Queen establishments. The overall composition of the photo, with its focus on the sign against a vivid sky, highlights the importance of the message being communicated.","title":"After the Oregon governor banned neon and commercial lighting displays, firms used their unlit signs to convey energy saving messages which could be seen during the day.
