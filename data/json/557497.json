{"path":"557497.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil sunset scene with a vibrant display of colors in the sky and their reflection on a body of water, presumably a lake or river. The upper portion of the image shows a gradient of colors ranging from deep blue at the top, transitioning through shades of purple and into a vivid, fiery red at the horizon line. The horizon is punctuated by a silhouette of a distant tree line or brush, creating a dark contrasting band between the water and the sky.\n\nThe water mirrors the dramatic sky, showing reflections of both the colors and the silhouette of the vegetation on the far shore. The overall lighting of the scene is dim, indicating that the photo was taken during twilight, just after the sun had set. There are a few pinpricks of light visible in the distanceâ€”possibly streetlights or headlights from vehicles, which add small, bright accents to the otherwise dark landscape.\n\nThe scene is serene, with no visible people or moving objects, which emphasizes the natural beauty and stillness of the setting. The composition uses a wide, panoramic perspective that allows the viewer to absorb the extensive range of colors and the peaceful atmosphere of the waterscape under the twilight sky.","title":"Sunset over Buena Vista Lagoon with Oceanside, California in the background. This wildlife sanctuary is one of the last lagoons there is concern for it because of erosion and septic tank seePage and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments. Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900. By the early 1970's that amount had decreased to about 125,000 acres.","placename":"San Diego (Calif.)","location":"San Diego, California","nn1":["554397","552335","544711","557447","554404","554759","547731","543415","552263","543062","552277","545000","552294","543577","552338","545149"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["twilight","waterscape","streetlight","reflection","silhouette","brush","headlight","accent","band","color"]}
