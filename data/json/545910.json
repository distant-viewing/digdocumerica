{"path":"545910.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene with a prominent smokestack emitting white smoke into the sky. The smokestack is tall and painted in segments of off-white and reddish-pink colors. In the foreground are stacked wooden objects, possibly lumber or timber, arranged into piles, suggesting the nearby presence of a logging or lumber processing facility. Adjacent to the smokestack, there are other industrial buildings with various structures and possibly machinery, indicating comprehensive industrial operations, possibly a power plant or manufacturing facility.\n\nThe background is filled with a clear sky that is partly cloudy. The overall composition of the image creates a juxtaposition between the natural resources (wood) in the foreground and the industrial activity characterized by the smokestack and plant buildings, potentially framing a narrative around resource usage, industrial activity, and environmental impact.","title":"Georgia Pacific lumber mill","placename":"Eureka (Calif.)","location":"Eureka, California","nn1":["550876","545925","550938","543005","550716","546236","545260","548195","550340","550998","542997","543011","543749","550905","550869","545113"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","lumber","resource","facility","timber","segment","logging","usage","plant","manufacturing"]}
