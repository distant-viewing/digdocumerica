{"path":"554248.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a wintry scene at a ski resort. A chairlift carries skiers up the slope, with multiple chairs visible, evenly spaced and attached to a cable. On the lift, we see passengers seated, bundled up in winter gear. The chairlift line travels up a snowy hill, with the landscape predominated by snow-covered surfaces and patches of exposed rock.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a skier is descending the slope, their posture leaning forward suggesting action and movement as they navigate the track. The terrain is marked by numerous ski tracks, indicating a well-used path. Snow-covered evergreen trees are sparsely distributed across the landscape, adding a touch of greenery to the primarily white and grey scene. The sky is overcast, lending a desaturated, cool tone to the image, typical of snowy, cloudy weather conditions.\n\nThe environment feels cold and tranquil, with the focus on winter sports and recreation. The composition skillfully captures the expansive nature of the outdoor winter setting, emphasizing both recreation (skiing) and the means of transport (chairlift), which are integral to the ski resort experience.","title":"All the lifts at Aspen are chairlifts.
