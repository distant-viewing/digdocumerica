{"path":"551186.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a partially constructed bridge over a river. The image shows a significant portion of the bridge structure assembled on one side, possibly a lift or drawbridge component, featuring a large metal arch framework that is incomplete on one end.\n\nTo the left of the bridge, there is a highway running parallel to the river. This highway has multiple lanes and is populated with cars moving in both directions, suggesting it is a primary route. Adjacent to the roadway are smaller structures and mounds of rubble or construction materials, possibly related to the bridge construction.\n\nThe river itself, occupying the lower and right portions of the image, appears muddy or murky. There are no visible boats or watercraft in the immediate vicinity of the bridge.\n\nThe surrounding area to the right and beyond the bridge is less developed and is characterized by dense greenery, resembling a tree-covered bank or a small patch of woodland, which contrasts with the built-up area near the bridge.\n\nThe overall composition creates a juxtaposition of human engineering and natural environment, capturing a moment of transition and construction.","title":"Kanawha River bridge under construction","placename":"Charleston (W.
