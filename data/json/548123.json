{"path":"548123.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a beautiful, atmospheric sunset scene over a body of water, possibly an ocean or large lake. The sun is setting behind a distant mountain range and a partial cityscape, creating a stunning silhouette effect.\n\nThe sky, painted with shades of deep orange and purple, is dominated by the glowing orb of the setting sun, resting just at the edge of the horizon. This creates a dramatic and warm backlight that highlights the outlines of various industrial and urban structures on the distant shoreline. Visible structures include what appear to be buildings, cranes, and possibly communication towers, outlined against the fiery sky.\n\nThe foreground shows the rippled surface of the water bathed in the colors of the sunset, reflecting the oranges and purples of the sky and adding a textured, shimmering effect to the composition.\n\nOverall, the image is rich in mood and color, capturing a serene yet poignant moment of natural beauty juxtaposed with human-made elements. It evokes a sense of calm and the fleeting nature of such magnificent daily phenomena.","title":"Sunset over the harbor at Vancouver, head of deep-water navigation on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544707","552263","551956","545030","554759","552335","545022","552294","543144","557447","552230","557497","552277","547731","544711","548909"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["purple","orange","sunset","phenomena","backlight","orb","sun","effect","communication","calm"]}
