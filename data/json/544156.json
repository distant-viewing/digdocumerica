{"path":"544156.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene dominated by a large crane during mining operations. The crane is marked with the name \"NAVAJO\" and the logo of Bucyrus Erie, a notable manufacturer of heavy mining equipment. The machinery, prominently colored white and orange, stands against a backdrop of a cloudy or dusk sky, casting a moody light over the scene.\n\nThe crane's boom extends diagonally across the frame from the bottom right to top left, with a metal hook visible at the end, holding a load. The load is suspended over a small mound of earth or rubble, from which dust or steam is rising, indicating recent or ongoing activity.\n\nThe surroundings imply a rugged terrain typical for mining areas, and the ground appears muddy and uneven, reinforcing the heavy-duty nature of the equipment and the challenges of the environment. The detailed focus on the powerful machine against the dramatic sky creates a stark image of industrial strength and outdoor labor conditions.","title":"Strip mining with dragline equipment at the Navajo Mine in northern Arizona","placename":"Shiprock Peak (Ariz.)","location":"Shiprock Peak, Arizona","nn1":["544157","544134","545887","554770","554545","545655","545883","544109","555586","555593","553027","550874","547223","544165","544127","545648"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","load","crane","hook","strength","boom","rubble","equipment","challenge","duty"]}
