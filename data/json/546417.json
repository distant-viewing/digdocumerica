{"path":"546417.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This is an evocative photograph capturing a tranquil beach scene during what appears to be the early morning or late afternoon, given the soft, glowing light that bathes the scene in a warm hue. The composition primarily features a serene beach setting with several interesting elements.\n\nForeground:\n- In the bottom left corner, there's a metallic railing that curves out of the frame, hinting at a viewpoint or balcony perspective from where the photograph is taken.\n\nMidground:\n- A tall, slender palm tree dominates the left side of the frame, anchoring the image and adding a tropical feel.\n- To the right of the palm tree, on the sandy beach, there's a small, vintage car parked, which adds a sense of period or nostalgia to the scene.\n- Further right, there is a person visible near the car, and it seems another figure, possibly a dog, is also present, lending a sense of activity and life to the scene.\n\nBackground:\n- The center and right of the photograph open up to a breathtaking view of the sea which reflects the sunlight, creating a sparkling effect on the water.\n- On the horizon, there is a small pier or dock that extends into the sea. Several figures can be seen on the pier, appearing to engage in leisure activities like fishing or simply enjoying the view.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and reflective, with human and natural elements combining harmoniously. The color palette is rich but subdued, with deep blues, greens, and earth tones softened by the diffuse sunlight, highlighting a moment captured in time at this tranquil locale.","title":"Fishing from the dock at playa de playuela","placename":"Mayagüez (P.R.)","location":"Mayagüez, Puero Rico","nn1":["548757","548698","554159","544985","543493","543287","543244","542890","557529","548221","543091","542918","548220","547600","546953","545849"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","palm","pier","sea","figure","nostalgia","locale","anchor","soften","sunlight"]}
