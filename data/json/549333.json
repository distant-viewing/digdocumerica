{"path":"549333.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a man engaged in scientific experimentation or analysis in a laboratory setting. The photo captures the reflection of the man standing behind a lab bench, looking into a glass container filled with a clear liquid. He appears focused on his work, examining the contents of the jar carefully.\n\nThe man has a mustache and wears a white lab coat, suggesting his role as a scientist or technician. The laboratory is equipped with various tools and devices; visible on the bench are a microscope, several other glass containers, and analytical instruments.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a long strip of paper with complex waveform graphs displayed vertically. This suggests that the lab work involves electronic or mechanical measurements, possibly related to the scientific research being undertaken. The laboratory environment is utilitarian, with black cabinets and a tidy, organized workspace emphasizing a professional and focused atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the photograph illustrates a moment in scientific research or experimentation, with emphasis on precise observation and analysis within a well-equipped laboratory.","title":"Technician zeljko kwokal at the pulse polagraph measures metal impurities in industrial waste water","placename":"Yugoslavia","location":"Yugoslavia","nn1":["555280","555248","546277","546278","555249","546284","555250","549608","555281","542666","549605","546296","546285","543834","546287","543801"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["experimentation","analysis","lab","laboratory","research","bench","container","microscope","tidy","technician"]}
