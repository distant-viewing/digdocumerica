{"path":"556301.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and joyful scene featuring a group of young children and a young woman, all of whom are African American. The setting appears to be an outdoor playground or schoolyard during daylight, as sunlight enriches the image with a warm hue. The background suggests an urban environment, potentially with school or residential buildings.\n\nIn the foreground, a young boy with a bright smile is centrally positioned, looking directly at the camera. He wears a horizontally striped sweater and is shown in a candid moment of happiness and motion. Surrounding him, multiple other children exhibit expressions of joy and excitement: some are laughing, others are cheering or shouting, and each face shows a burst of genuine emotion.\n\nTo the right, a young woman is smiling brightly, her face expressing delight. She wears a yellow sweater and has short hair that suggests a carefree style. She is interacting closely with the children around her, who are all engaged in playful activity, perhaps in celebration or during a lively game.\n\nEveryone in the photo is wearing casual, colorful clothing, adding a sense of liveliness and vibrancy to the scene. The overall composition conveys a moment of spontaneous, exuberant life, encapsulating youthful energy and communal happiness.","title":"South side group of black children in Chicago at a playground at 40th and drexel boulevard, part of nearly 1.2 million people of their race who make up over one third of the city's population.
