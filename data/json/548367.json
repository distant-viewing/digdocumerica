{"path":"548367.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a large, derelict waterfront complex likely damaged by fire. The main structure appears to have once been sizable, consisting of two primary buildings and an adjoining segment all displaying extensive damage. The skeletal frame of the buildings remains, revealing charred beams and exposed structural elements, devoid of most of the roof and wall claddings.\n\nAdjacent to the complex is a wide expanse of pavement, apparently a loading area or dock, showing minor debris and scattered remnants of the destruction. This area borders a body of water, suggesting that the buildings were perhaps used for industrial maritime purposes.\n\nTo the background, a highway with multiple lanes and some vehicular traffic can be seen. This is flanked by urban infrastructure, including smaller buildings and structures that give a sense of being part of an industrial district. The geographic setting around the burnt complex seems somewhat barren and industrialized, concentrating on functionality rather than aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe coloring in the image suggests it might have been taken during the mid to late 20th century. The photograph captures a scene of decay and the aftermath of a devastating event, providing a visual narrative of loss and the passage of time in an urban, industrial setting.","title":"Disuse and age rot old warehouses and ship terminals on the Hudson River.
