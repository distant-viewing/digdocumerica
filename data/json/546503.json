{"path":"546503.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of construction juxtaposed against a historical building. On the right side of the image, a large, modern steel frame structure is under construction. This frame consists of numerous vertical and horizontal beams, exposing the skeletal nature of the building in its early stages of construction.\n\nTo the left stands a striking, older architectural structure; it is an ornate building featuring a prominent tower with a clock near its peak, set at 9:22. The tower is topped with a decorative metal spire. The architecture of the tower is elaborate, with classical details such as columns, ornaments, and multiple layered sections that taper as it rises. The buildingâ€™s exterior is primarily brick, with stone trim around windows and along the corners.\n\nA construction worker is visible on the steel structure, close to the foreground but at a considerable height. He appears engaged in his work, contributing to the construction process.\n\nThe overall composition contrasts the new construction with the historic building, highlighting the blend of old and new in an urban environment. The weather in the scene suggests it might be overcast, given the muted lighting and subdued color palette.","title":"Courthouse tower with mall construction in the foreground","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["545877","550062","546499","549997","548057","555373","546411","546557","546414","555746","551442","550001","546426","556619","549912","548552"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","tower","steel","ornament","building","clock","spire","trim","column","stage"]}
