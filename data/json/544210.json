{"path":"544210.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an atmospheric and slightly foreboding scene on a bridge or pier-like structure. A dark, overcast sky creates a moody backdrop. In the foreground, a sign prominently displayed reads, “STOP DEAD END NO CROSSING,” suggesting an off-limits or hazardous area.\n\nThe bridge itself appears to be quite old and made of wood, supporting its textured and weathered look. On the bridge, there is a dog and two people. The dog is mid-way on the bridge, positioned in front of the lifting bridge mechanism which is raised, indicating the bridge is non-operational or actively in use for water traffic. The dog looks back towards the people behind it.\n\nThe two people, appearing from behind and walking towards the dog, seem engaged in their movement forward. The person on the left gestures with their arm, possibly pointing or indicating something to their companion or to the dog. Both individuals are dressed in casual, light-colored clothing, suitable for an outdoor or work-related setting.\n\nThe composition of the image, combined with the elements present (the sign, the raised bridge, and the overcast sky), evokes a sense of interrupted journey or caution, possibly reflecting a narrative or a moment of decision. The overall tone is eerily calm yet carries an undertone of tension due to the environmental and contextual cues provided by the elements within the frame.","title":"Bridge over waterway","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["542954","551423","558000","547836","548248","546859","557970","558003","546773","547904","551236","555730","547087","547918","547180","552674"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["dog","bridge","decision","undertone","caution","limit","companion","tension","crossing","people"]}
