{"path":"552983.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up image of a muddy puddle or small body of water with swirling patterns of sediment and water. The color of the mud is a mix of brown and gray hues, indicating perhaps wet earth or clay that has been disturbed. The water's surface shows active movement, evidenced by the twisting and intertwining swirls that create a dynamic texture.\n\nThere are several small bubbles visible on the surface, which could be due to air trapped under the moving water or from some biological activity in the mud. These white bubbles contrast distinctly against the darker background of the muddy water. Fine particles are suspended in the water, making it opaque and heavily clouded.\n\nThe surrounding area is visible at the edges of the photograph and consists of similarly wet, muddy ground. There are no signs of vegetation or other significant features in the immediate view, emphasizing the focus on the water and mud itself.\n\nThe image seems natural and untouched, capturing a simple yet intriguing natural phenomenon often overlooked. The photograph's texture and patterns might draw the viewer's attention to the intricate details and movements within such an everyday occurrence.","title":"Runoff from construction sites pollutes Lake Tahoe.
