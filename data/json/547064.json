{"path":"547064.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an atmospheric scene centered on maritime and bridge structures, likely taken during the twilight hours. Dominating the midground is a large cargo ship moored at a port. The ship is white and has a prominent superstructure, along with two visible funnelsâ€”one bearing visible striping. Cranes and other port infrastructure can be seen near the ship, indicating an active industrial setting.\n\nIn the background, an elegant bridge spans a river or canal. The bridge, possibly a bascule or moveable type, features a distinctive arch and a lower flat segment. The arch of the bridge supports a walkway or structure topped by what appears to be a lantern or small dome, potentially for navigational purposes.\n\nIn the foreground moving on the water is a smaller, dark-hued boat. This vessel appears to be in motion, creating a wake behind it as it navigates through the waterway.\n\nThis photograph exudes a serene yet industrial ambiance, portraying the interplay between human-engineered structures and maritime activity. The lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late evening, adding a moody, ambient quality to the scene. The overall composition balances the intricacies of industrial activities with the calm of the waterway and the elegance of bridge engineering.","title":"Calumet River","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547061","550910","555731","550906","544657","544655","547667","547572","544671","547109","548101","549303","548375","555799","550965","552262"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["bridge","ship","port","arch","waterway","funnel","lantern","intricacy","superstructure","elegance"]}
