{"path":"543286.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a snake gracefully winding its way across a rough, textured surface that appears to be a dirt or gravel road. The setting sun casts a warm, golden light on the scene, highlighting the snake's scales and the small rocks on the ground.\n\nThe snake, positioned in the center of the frame, forms a series of elegant S-shaped curves as it moves. The texture of the snake's skin is articulated with patches of light and shadow defining its scaly details. The background and foreground are both softly out of focus, which directs the viewer's attention primarily to the snake and the immediate surface on which it is traveling.\n\nThe lighting effect suggests that the photograph was taken during the golden hour, adding a rich, amber hue to the overall scene and enhancing the feeling of a tranquil yet wild natural environment. The simplicity and isolated positioning of the snake in the environment evoke a sense of calm and focus in a potentially hostile, yet beautifully lit natural world.","title":"California--Rocky Point","placename":"Rocky Point (Calif.)","location":"Rocky Point, California","nn1":["544908","544904","549459","544900","555065","545561","551375","551374","551366","545336","544528","543778","545553","553079","555552","551250"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["snake","positioning","skin","world","gravel","hour","calm","define","simplicity","way"]}
