{"path":"543026.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image depicts a traditional yellow American school bus, photographed from a front side angle. At the top of the bus, the word \"SCHOOLBUS\" is printed in black block capitals. The bus has its headlights on, suggesting it may be early morning or late afternoon. The vehicle is a classic model, identified by its distinctive grill and body style, with the emblem \"FORD\" visibly displayed on the front.\n\nThe license plate at the front reads \"WYY 328,\" and there are slightly visible marks of wear and tear on the vehicle, indicating its use over time. A driver can be seen through the windshield, likely focusing on the road ahead.\n\nThe background is hazy, potentially due to fog or mist, which partially obscures the view of a hill or mountain slope behind the bus, enhancing the mysterious or moody quality of the scene. The composition and the atmospheric conditions convey a sense of early morning activity, commonly associated with school routines. Overall, the photograph captures a moment in daily school transportation in a rustic or rural setting.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555568","558206","558208","550973","557665","558215","547136","552773","547133","558241","552505","549891","547814","544193","545385","553957"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["bus","school","grill","capital","windshield","emblem","license","front","morning","mark"]}
