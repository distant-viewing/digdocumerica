{"path":"550566.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image captures a vast expanse of dense forest as viewed from an aerial perspective. The topography is gently undulating, with subtle variations in elevation that create soft, rolling hills. The entire area is covered in what appears to be a lush, verdant canopy of trees showing various shades of green, suggesting a mix of different types of vegetation. There are no clearings, water bodies, or any signs of human activities such as roads or buildings visible, which emphasizes the untouched and natural state of the landscape. The lighting in the image suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with certain areas cast in shadow, adding to the depth and texture of the forest expanse. The overall mood conveyed is peaceful and remote, evoking a sense of quiet isolation and the expansive beauty of nature.","title":"A view west into typical interior forest.
