{"path":"547971.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a large pile of industrial waste, primarily consisting of various tangled wires, shredded metal, and crumpled pieces of cardboard and paper. The heap is disorderly, with materials sprawling across the scene. In the background and above the pile, several seagulls are flying, perhaps attracted to the site as a source of food or as a resting place.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors, under a cloudy or overcast sky, contributing to a slightly grim and muted atmosphere. There is no visible presence of humans in the image, focusing attention solely on the mass of discarded materials and the environmental implication. The ground is barren and covered with similar debris, suggesting that the location could be a landfill or a recycling facility.\n\nThe colors in the image are predominantly earth tones mixed with the metallic grays and silvers of the wires, contrasting with the white and gray of the flying seagulls. The entire composition serves as a stark visual commentary on waste, recycling, and possibly environmental neglect.","title":"Garbage is dumped in the marshes of spring creek on Jamaica bay because of ecological damage, epa plans to stop garbage disposal within the next few years","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547983","550880","547899","547611","557307","547062","554300","554318","549758","545059","542494","549953","554358","549745","547625","549737"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["seagull","fly","waste","implication","pile","gray","recycling","crumple","recycl","wir"]}
