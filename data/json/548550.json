{"path":"548550.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a group of elderly people, primarily women, during an aquatic activity in a swimming pool. The central figure is a woman wearing a dark floral one-piece bathing suit, topped with a blue, ruched shower cap and stylish, white sunglasses that resemble cat eyes. She is looking upwards, seemingly avoiding getting her face wet.\n\nDirectly behind her, another woman is visible, wearing a broad straw hat and a one-shoulder floral swimsuit with a light background. This woman's face is also tilted skyward, and her eyes are closed, adding a peaceful, relaxed element to the scene. Others visible in the background are similarly engaged, floating gently in the water, with expressions of relaxation and contentment. Everyone is in an upright, floating position, suggesting a water-based exercise session or a relaxation technique being practiced in a group setting.\n\nThe environment implies a community or public pool setting, with clear, calm water. The photograph captures a sense of calm and leisure, typical of a warm, sunny day dedicated to gentle activity and communal enjoyment, particularly among an elderly community. The focus and depth of field emphasize the expressions and headgear of the individuals, adding character and a unique charm to the scene.","title":"Residents take part in organized daily exercises in one of the public pools at century village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548583","548585","548584","548549","556295","548548","555649","558144","544339","551093","555891","552012","552706","548085","546768","548113"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["pool","woman","relaxation","float","exercise","headgear","contentment","session","get","swimsuit"]}
