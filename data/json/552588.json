{"path":"552588.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a game check station, probably during a hunting season, as suggested by the signs and activities. It features two men wearing matching orange vests with badges, indicating they are officials or staff, likely from the Game and Fish Department. The setting is an outdoor area with dirt and gravel, adorned with various signs and barrels that suggest a functional, rather utilitarian environment.\n\nOne man is standing at the tailgate of a pickup truck, on which rests a deceased deer with prominent antlers. This individual appears to be either inspecting something handed to him by the other man or taking notes. The second man is extending his hand toward the first, possibly handing over a hunting tag or some documentation, as he glances down at what appears to be a permit or tag.\n\nIn the background, another group of people can be spotted by the tailgate of another vehicle, suggesting a line or additional activity relating to game check operations. The sign prominently displayed reads \"GAME CHECK STATION ALL HUNTERS STOP GAME AND FISH DEPT\", establishing the purpose of the stop as a mandatory check for hunters to report their game. Another sign warning against littering reinforces the outdoors conservation message pertinent to such locations.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a focused, procedural interaction as part of wildlife management and regulatory efforts in a hunting context. The attire of the individuals and the setting suggest this activity is routine and organized, emphasizing responsible hunting practices.","title":"Deer hunters' kill is counted and examined at check station north of Rifle by employees of the Colorado department of fish and game.
