{"path":"545729.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an adventurous river rafting scene set against a dramatic landscape. At the center of the image, a group of six people are aboard a long, narrow boat, navigating through turbulent, whitewater rapids that dominate the foreground. The water is a frothy, muddy color, indicative of strong currents and river activity.\n\nThe occupants of the boat, wearing life jackets and helmets, appear to be actively engaged in steering and propelling the boat using paddles. They are facing forward, possibly focusing on navigating the challenging parts of the river ahead.\n\nThe background showcases a beautiful, arid landscape characteristic of a large canyon or river valley. Layered sedimentary rock formations and distant buttes stand under a clear blue sky, hinting at a dry, desert environment. The color palette of the scene is rich with earthy tones ranging from deep reds and browns of the rock to the green vegetation sparsely distributed along the riverbank.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights a moment filled with adventure and natural beauty, emphasizing both human endeavor and the powerful force of nature.","title":"A river trip into Canyonlands National Park conducted by tag-along-tours of Moab.
