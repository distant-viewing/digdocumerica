{"path":"542704.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures a vibrant field of flowers, predominantly filled with yellow blooms. The flowers have a soft, slightly blurred appearance, which gives the photograph a dreamy, ethereal quality. The composition is dense with these yellow flowers, which take up the entire frame and are interspersed with dark green foliage. \n\nThe perspective is slightly angled with the majority of the space occupied by the flowers, and there are no visible landmarks or structures that could provide a specific context to the setting. The light seems to be natural, possibly hinting at an overcast or diffused light scenario which enhances the saturation of the yellow petals. The motion blur and the soft focus contribute to conveying a sense of movement or gentle sway, suggesting a breeze could be passing through the field. The overall feel of the photograph is one of lushness and vitality, evoking the freshness of spring or summer.","title":"Field of yellow poppies blowing in the wind in Lompoc, where many of the world's flower seeds are grown","placename":"Lompoc (Calif.)","location":"Lompoc, California","nn1":["552503","542641","550781","544574","544439","544443","542645","549158","548027","557098","543596","553076","543206","545723","544938","547642"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","vitality","freshness","lushness","sway","majority","petal","breeze","field","landmark"]}
