{"path":"558000.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph presents a serene yet somewhat neglected outdoor scene. In the foreground, there's a prominent \"DANGER\" sign mounted on a wooden post, declaring \"No Trespassing, No Swimming, No Boating,\" attributed to the Clairton Works of the United States Steel Corporation. The sign, with its bold capitalized letters, adds an air of prohibition and caution to the scene.\n\nJust beyond the sign, the focus shifts to a weathered wooden footbridge, slightly askew and in disrepair, crossing a narrow creek. This bridge, with its missing planks and unstable appearance, leads to a grassy area that frames the water body. The reflected sky in the creek's calm water enhances the tranquility of the setting.\n\nOn the far side of the creek, residential buildings contribute to the semi-urban feel of the environment. These buildings, white and nondescript, stand moderately close to each other, separated from the creek by well-maintained grassy lawns. Trees and other vegetation appear on both sides of the creek, enhancing the greenery of the scene and providing a buffer between the water and the buildings.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a quiet locale, juxtaposing natural beauty and human neglect. The prohibition sign, the derelict bridge, and the nearby houses suggest a human presence that is both protective and potentially destructive, underscoring themes of environmental impact and conservation.","title":"Ohio-Erie Canal lock collects algae and debris south of Alexander Road at Valley View near Cleveland, Ohio. The building in the left center background is Wilson's Mill, formerly called Alexander's Mill. When in operation canal water dropped through a sluice which provided power to grind grain. The canal connected the Great Lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi River systems between 1833 and 1913. The site now is a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["558003","552211","547890","557995","551533","547836","551423","553393","548248","544288","547992","550688","545949","558006","550368","555730"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["creek","sign","trespassing","attribute","capitalize","buffer","neglect","bridge","caution","danger"]}
