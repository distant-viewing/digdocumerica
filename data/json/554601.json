{"path":"554601.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a dark and moody scene in a forest setting. The central focus is on a tree trunk that appears in the foreground, filling much of the frame. The bark of the tree is textured and slightly mossy, darkened possibly by moisture or the lighting conditions. Resting on the side of this trunk, slightly off-center, is a small bird. The bird, which is mostly in silhouette due to the lighting, has its head turned as if looking around or listening to the surrounding environment.\n\nThe background of the image is softly blurred, featuring shades of dark green and black that suggest dense foliage or possibly additional trees. The blurring effect creates a sense of depth, with the tree and bird sharply in focus against the indistinct backdrop. The lighting in the scene is dim, possibly indicative of twilight or an overcast day, casting overall subdued tones and a somewhat mysterious, tranquil atmosphere. The composition uses shallow depth of field to isolate the subject (the tree and the bird), emphasizing their details while the background remains abstract, enhancing the natural and serene feeling of the setting.","title":"Hairy woodpecker (dendrocopus vilosus) in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["557628","551378","547318","544547","554961","554976","543595","557622","542932","554973","542791","554998","555008","550792","543488","542929"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","trunk","abstract","darken","tree","moisture","listen","bark","remain","depth"]}
