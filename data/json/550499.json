{"path":"550499.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a majestic and expansive mountain valley from an aerial perspective. The valley is flanked by rugged mountain slopes covered in patches of snow, suggesting a high altitude or a cold climate. The mountainsides appear steep, showing signs of erosion and weathering predominantly on the left where snow has accumulated, indicating less sun exposure on that side. In the center and foreground of the image, a narrow river meanders gracefully through the valley, carving out a distinct snaking path that suggests both its persistent flow and the softness of the valley floor compared to the rocky mountainsides. The surrounding terrain of the valley is a mix of green and brown hues, indicating vegetation that can vary from grasslands to hardy shrubs, adapting to the alpine environment. The contrasting colors also highlight different elevations or possibly seasonal changes affecting the valley. No human presence or man-made structures are visible, emphasizing the natural and untouched quality of the landscape. The photograph captures a sense of serene isolation and the raw beauty of a high mountainous region.","title":"In this aerial view north from dietrich pass (mile 162), much of the southern half on the atigun valley is visible.  The pipeline will descend from the pass from the lower left corner of the frame across the snow slope to the riverbed at lower right, then follow the river vertically up the frame to approximately mile 148","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["555676","550509","550595","550634","550497","550590","550498","550528","550523","555678","550503","550500","543750","550508","543746","550487"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["valley","mountainside","snow","alpine","mountainous","accumulate","softness","grassland","adapt","mountain"]}
