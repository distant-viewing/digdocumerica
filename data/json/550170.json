{"path":"550170.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of young men playing baseball on a field. The players are seen in various baseball uniforms and positions, one of whom is mid-pitch, while others stand around or walk about the field. In the backdrop, a series of industrial structures emit large plumes of dark smoke into the sky, creating a stark contrast with the recreational activity in the foreground. The scene is enclosed by a chain-link fence, beyond which parked cars are visible. This juxtaposition highlights a sharp contrast between leisure activities and industrial environmental impacts.","title":"Clark field baseball diamond and neighboring republic steel mill","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550180","551095","551099","551096","551103","556583","551094","546272","552024","549284","553042","551721","551768","545404","556507","557780"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["baseball","player","field","pitch","chain","link","enclose","plume","uniform","emit"]}
