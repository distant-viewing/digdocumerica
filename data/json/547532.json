{"path":"547532.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a large expanse of a wetland or marsh area. The foreground and middle parts of the image are filled with dense aquatic grasses and reeds that are partially submerged in water. These plants appear to be in varying stages of growth, with some bright green and others a darker, wilted brown, suggesting different seasonal or environmental conditions.\n\nThe reflection of the sky on the surface of the water creates a patchwork of blue patches interspersed between the vegetation. The water levels vary, with some areas more flooded than others, creating small channels and pools amidst the grass.\n\nIn the background, there is a treeline that forms a darker, uninterrupted band across the horizon under a pale blue sky. It seems to be a calm day as evidenced by the still water and the sharpness of the reflections.\n\nThis landscape is likely a natural habitat for various wildlife, such as birds and amphibians, though none are visible in this shot. The image conveys a sense of tranquility and the untouched quality typical of wetland ecosystems.","title":"Tiverton salt marsh","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547500","544515","547589","550783","547488","550785","545033","547924","544530","547547","557498","542525","557445","553856","547544","550786"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","reflection","sharpness","treeline","patchwork","marsh","other","reed","band","grass"]}
