{"path":"542851.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a forested area that has undergone significant logging activity. In the foreground, there are two heavy machinery vehicles—a bulldozer and a larger logging machine equipped with wheels and a crane—operating within a muddy, debris-strewn terrain. The ground is visibly wet and carved with vehicle tracks, indicating recent use. Scattered around the machinery are numerous felled trees and logging remnants, highlighting the extent of tree cutting performed in the area.\n\nThe background shows a sharp contrast, where a dense stand of tall, uncut trees can still be seen, partially shrouded in mist, which implies that the logging activity may be progressively moving towards this area. The overall scene captures a moment of active deforestation, characterizing the environmental impact such activities have on natural forested landscapes.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550354","542947","542828","542948","553468","542949","542824","542827","542852","542624","554416","546950","555198","542850","545272","542823"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["logging","log","fell","deforestation","machinery","extent","undergo","carve","bulldozer","shroud"]}
