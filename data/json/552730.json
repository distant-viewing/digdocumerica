{"path":"552730.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a densely populated urban area, characterized by a highly organized grid layout. The area is densely packed with rows of narrow, rectangular buildings, predominantly residential, laid out in repetitive blocks. There are distinct, straight roads that neatly intersect at right angles, creating a pattern that extends throughout the visible image. Between the buildings, the roads are filled with parked cars, and the small gaps between the buildings likely represent narrow alleys or side yards. The roofs of the buildings vary slightly in color, possibly suggesting different materials or degrees of weathering.\n\nFrom this altitude, there is no clear visibility of people or small-scale street activities, emphasizing the area's overall layout and urban planning aspects rather than individual or social aspects. The surrounding urban texture is made up of similar blocks, indicating a uniform development pattern typical of certain large cities, possibly dating from periods of rapid urban expansion. The absence of green spaces in the immediate vicinity suggests high land use efficiency prioritized for housing or commercial needs rather than recreational spaces. The general absence of taller landmarks or distinct non-residential structures suggests a residential or mixed-use neighborhood with limited commercial or industrial activity.","title":"Row houses","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552729","549972","545914","552728","552734","547445","546399","548424","553971","548343","548374","548425","553673","553935","556180","551506"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["absence","block","layout","aspect","efficiency","alley","degree","expansion","gap","need"]}
