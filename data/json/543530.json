{"path":"543530.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque riverside scene. It features a family of three, consisting of a woman, a man, and a child, walking along a sandy riverbank. The woman, located in the foreground on the left side, is wearing a one-piece swimsuit with a floral design and appears to be drying her face or wiping water from her eyes with her hands. Next to her, the man is dressed in red swim trunks and walks while holding the hand of a small child, who is in the middle. The child seems to be sporting a light-colored swimsuit, possibly yellow, with red detailing.\n\nBehind them, the river curves gently around a bend. The water's surface is calm, reflecting the sunlight and bordered by natural vegetation. Sandy banks outline the river, highlighted by the bright sunlight. Tall pine trees and dense shrubbery surround the area, suggesting a secluded or less urbanized location. Further in the background, on the opposite side of the river, additional individuals can be seen enjoying the water, adding liveliness to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere communicated by the photograph is one of leisure and tranquility, typical of a pleasant day spent near water in a natural setting. The composition and natural lighting emphasize a moment of familial bonding and relaxation amidst an idyllic landscape.","title":"Family enjoying state park","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552975","553439","557740","546167","555376","553435","543943","543164","543692","551525","550827","549030","552295","550238","543892","553441"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["swimsuit","child","bonding","river","liveliness","walk","spend","shrubbery","communicate","riverside"]}
