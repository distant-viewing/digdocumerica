{"path":"544775.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial landscape under a dramatic and vividly blue sky. In the foreground, you can see a large, foamy discharge of white water pollution filling up what appears to be a water channel or ditch. The water is extensively covered with white foam that spreads across the entire breadth of the image.\n\nJust beside the ditch on its left bank, there's a solitary piece of industrial debris, possibly a wooden plank or board. Beyond the foamy water, the middle ground contains strands of grass and random vegetation scattered along the banks, suggesting a somewhat neglected area.\n\nThe background of the photograph is dominated by industrial structures. You can spot several tall chimneys or smokestacks projecting into the sky. These structures appear inactive as there is no visible smoke or steam emanating from them. The industrial facilities, characterized by their flat, boxy building structures, indicate a heavy industrial setting, possibly a factory or a plant.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is slightly bleak, emphasizing a human-impacted nature scene. The presence of pollution and industrial backdrop convey environmental concerns, potentially highlighting issues related to industrial waste and water pollution.","title":"The discharge point (into the South Platte River) of the Denver metro sewage treatment plant","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["550708","552019","552989","544779","550193","551562","549624","552194","551559","545168","550710","544294","550875","551555","544803","546080"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["ditch","pollution","bank","discharge","breadth","strand","water","foam","channel","board"]}
