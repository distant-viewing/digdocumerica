{"path":"550648.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, three-story building with white siding and a large gable roof. The building has a central tower-like structure with a separate entrance, defined by a classically styled portico that includes pilasters and a pediment. The windows of the building are uniformly rectangular and arranged symmetrically across the facade. There are several windows visible, each fitted with dark shutters.\n\nIn front of the building, there are three children on bicycles. They appear to be engaged in a conversation or gathering together around the bikes. The children and their bicycles are positioned on a paved area which could be a road or a wide path, located directly in front of the building's main entrance.\n\nThe surroundings are typical of a quiet neighborhood or a small town, with trees visible around the edges of the frame. The sky appears overcast, giving the photo a slightly muted quality. The overall composition and the presence of the children lend a sense of daily, casual life unfolding in this setting. The building itself, with its traditional architecture, suggests it could be an institution like a school or community center, given its size and formal entryway.","title":"Errol school house near lake unbagog, headwater of the androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["558151","549360","549626","557156","558131","557171","558099","557948","545870","558146","558162","557641","546465","555894","546456","552507"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["bicycle","child","entrance","building","unfolding","pediment","institution","entryway","fit","bike"]}
