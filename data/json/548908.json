{"path":"548908.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a vast agricultural landscape, marked by symmetry and division. The central feature of the image is a straight dirt road that bisects the frame vertically, extending from the foreground to the far background. Fields of different hues and textures line either side of this road.\n\nOn each side of the road, the fields are organized into rectangles and vary in color and crop type. The immediately visible crops range from deep greens to golden yellows and earth tones, suggesting a variety of agricultural uses such as growing different grains, vegetables, or as fallow land being prepared for planting. Some of the fields appear freshly plowed while others are lush with vegetation. \n\nIn the distance, there is a hint of a blue water body parallel to the road, contributing a natural element to the otherwise cultivated landscape. The horizon shows a range of low-lying mountains or hills under a clear blue sky, which adds a serene backdrop to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights the scale and organization of modern agriculture, focusing on the orderly arrangement of fields and the infrastructure that supports farming activities. The photograph also subtly emphasizes the interaction between the natural landforms and human-made agricultural patterns.","title":"The All-American Canal, carrying water from the Colorado River, transformed the Imperial Valley from desert to farmland.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549098","548907","558414","542517","553047","557517","554029","548902","542710","542708","552858","549094","554055","542730","547350","548901"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["field","crop","road","vegetable","symmetry","division","landform","organization","grain","agriculture"]}
