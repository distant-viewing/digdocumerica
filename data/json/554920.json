{"path":"554920.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a vintage car, possibly from the mid-20th century, parked in a natural outdoor setting. The vehicle is captured from behind, occupying the middle of the frame and is surrounded by wild, untamed vegetation and scattered trees, indicative of a rural or wilderness area. The landscape is bathed in dark, muted tones suggesting it might be dawn or dusk, which enhances the mysterious and desolate ambiance of the scene.\n\nThe car has a distinct old-fashioned design with rounded features and a prominent rear window. Its body color appears to be dark, possibly black, contrasting with a white roof. The vehicle is nestled in tall grass and shrubs, with its surroundings unmanicured and wild, highlighting the contrast between the manufactured object and the natural environment.\n\nIn the background, the terrain gently rises, populated sparsely with trees and bushes, and dappled light suggesting either early morning or late afternoon sunlight filtering through the foliage. Behind the car, a path or a dirt road recedes into the woodland, suggesting a narrative of travel or escape into or from the deeper wilderness. The overall composition conveys a sense of isolation and abandonment, as well as a nostalgic echo of past journeys.","title":"Old car abandoned on a ranch near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553008","546405","550797","553002","553007","544641","552995","545540","548750","550795","549107","557116","546230","553010","547535","548751"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["wilderness","car","echo","manufacture","escape","journey","woodland","recede","outdoor","vehicle"]}
