{"path":"549866.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban street scene, likely from a mid-20th century American city, characterized by a sense of congestion and movement. In the foreground, a large, red delivery truck features prominently. The truck, which has visible damage on its front end, including a bent hood and grill, is adorned with a yellow license plate and seems to be making a delivery or is perhaps stuck due to the cramped conditions.\n\nAdjacent to the truck is a cream-colored delivery van with the text \"Snicker Inc.\" scripted in an elegant, cursive font along its side. Behind these vehicles, the street is crammed with a variety of other cars and trucks, depicting a typical congested, urban scenario. Some vehicles, like the blue car behind the red truck, further enrich the scene's color palette and contribute to the bustling environment.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, two individuals, a man and a woman, are walking past the Snicker Inc. van. They appear engaged in conversation, adding a human element to the composition amidst the mechanical congestion. The man is dressed in a dark suit and the woman wears a light colored top with dark pants, both reflecting the fashion of the era depicted.\n\nThe buildings flanking the street are tall and constructed from dark, possibly brick materials, typical of urban industrial areas. The photograph uses a wide-angle lens, evident from the curvature of straight lines like the road, which adds a dynamic feel to the scene, emphasizing the cramped, confined space and the mixture of vehicles and people. \n\nOverall, the image is a vivid snapshot of urban life, capturing the interplay of human and vehicular activity within a densely packed city environment.","title":"In midtown Manhattan's crowded Garment District, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554309","554310","547651","547369","549882","556724","556714","548388","548410","549853","549267","549886","547666","554297","548272","545216"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["delivery","truck","congestion","street","script","vehicle","font","curvature","grill","confine"]}
