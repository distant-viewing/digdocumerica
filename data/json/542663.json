{"path":"542663.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an older man engaging in an activity that seems both scientific and technical in nature, set in an outdoor environment likely characterized by a warm or mild climate, given the presence of palm trees. The man, appearing focused and intent, wears a white short-sleeve shirt, dark trousers, and thin-rimmed glasses as he makes notes on a clipboard.\n\nHe stands beside a table on which various pieces of electronic equipment are arranged. These devices include what appear to be meters, dials, and other monitoring or measuring apparatuses, potentially related to environmental studies or telecommunications, given the antenna-like structure visible on one of the machines.\n\nIn the background, lush greenery, several palm trees, and distant mountains under a hazy sky set a serene backdrop. This tranquil outdoor setting contrasts with the meticulous, perhaps research-oriented work being conducted by the man. The scene likely takes place in a valley or plain judging by the flatness immediately beyond the manicured grass area and the mountains in the further distance.","title":"Edgard stephens, professor of environmental science at the statewide air pollution research center, using optical particle counter","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["549625","542661","542662","542776","558108","554797","549628","542691","548956","544499","547740","553907","552110","548873","542716","542777"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["palm","telecommunication","intent","judging","clipboard","meter","rim","antenna","dial","monitoring"]}
