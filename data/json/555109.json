{"path":"555109.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph displays a sweeping view of a forested landscape from an elevated vantage point. Most of the image is covered by dense conifers which predominantly appear to be pine trees, showing rich green hues. To the left and central parts of the image, thereâ€™s a cleared area where trees have been cut down, characterized by a more barren appearance with scattered debris and remaining stumps. These logged sections starkly contrast with the surrounding lush forest.\n\nThe background reveals a gentle rolling hill landscape stretching into the distance under a slightly overcast sky. There are lighter patches of rural land or fields visible, possibly indicating human activity or settlements in the far distance.\n\nThis photograph may provoke a narrative or commentary on environmental issues such as deforestation or forest management, illustrating the intersection of natural landscapes and human interventions. The overall composition of the photograph combines elements of undisturbed nature with those impacted by human actions, offering multiple focal points of natural beauty and environmental change.","title":"Douglas firs, 20 to 40 years old, in the foreground in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555147","555135","557003","555150","542834","555133","542835","557574","557001","545283","542833","542937","556907","556920","555085","555138"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["deforestation","commentary","stump","forest","conifer","point","intervention","settlement","intersection","issue"]}
