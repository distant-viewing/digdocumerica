{"path":"549119.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a bleak and barren landscape possibly following a natural disaster. The foreground consists of a muddy terrain strewn with scattered patches of greenery, some of which appear to be uprooted and lie flat on the ground, suggesting recent disturbances. The vegetation that remains is sparse and does not cover the dark soil extensively.\n\nThe middle ground is largely empty, reinforcing the sense of desolation, and leads to the background where a series of hills or mounds are visible. These formations are primarily grey and devoid of vegetation, featuring steep, eroded sides that expose lighter-colored soil or rock. The gloomy sky contributes to the somber mood of the scene, indicating possibly inclement weather or a lack of sunlight.\n\nOverall, the scene emanates a sense of devastation and harshness, possibly caused by an environmental disruption such as a landslide, earthquake, or other geological activity. The absence of any visible human presence or activity underscores the desolate nature of the landscape.","title":"Reclamation effort at the Peabody Coal Company strip mine south of Colstrip.
