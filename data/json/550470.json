{"path":"550470.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a small, ground-dwelling rodent, likely a gopher, in its natural habitat. The animal is captured in a close-up view and is dramatically positioned in the center of the frame amidst lush, dense grass. Its keen eyes are visible and focused, adding a vivid expression to the image. The gopher is holding a bundle of grass or hay in its mouth, which it might be gathering for nesting or feeding purposes. The foreground of the image is dominated by the tall, vibrant green grass lightly swaying or bending, likely under a gentle breeze. The background is softly out of focus, enhancing the depth of the scene and drawing more attention to the gopher and its activity. The lighting in the photo, possibly from a setting sun, softly illuminates the scene, casting a warm hue and creating a natural, serene atmosphere.","title":"This parka squirrel is gathering green grasses to eat during the 9-month winter.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550472","550469","543265","550468","545564","542629","554599","555668","550467","545556","545560","551376","554597","544738","547043","550471"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["grass","bundle","dwelling","hay","breeze","mouth","habitat","animal","purpose","sun"]}
