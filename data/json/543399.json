{"path":"543399.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant coastal scene. In the foreground, there's a lush patch of bright yellow and pink wildflowers, possibly ice plants, spread out over a sandy terrain. The flowers form a dense, colorful carpet that provides a stark contrast to the blue ocean in the background.\n\nBeyond the floral foreground, the scene opens up to a dramatic coastline featuring rugged cliffs and a natural arch. The archway, formed by erosion, connects one side of a rocky outcrop to another, framing the sea behind it and creating a visually striking natural feature. The waves from the sea can be seen crashing against the base of the cliffs.\n\nIn the distance, along the cliff tops, the outline of a small structure, potentially a lighthouse or a small house, is visible. This adds a human element to the otherwise natural landscape.\n\nThe sky above is partly clear with some haze near the horizon, suggesting a bright, sunny day. Overall, the composition of the photograph, with its layers of natural beauty from the sandy flower-covered floor to the rock formations and the expansive sea, combined with the warm tones and natural lighting, evokes a sense of serene and rugged coastal beauty.","title":"Southern California -- Natural Bridges Beach, near Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz County (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz County, California","nn1":["543401","543066","543199","542968","543202","545101","543196","543346","547592","543184","543404","543389","542917","543419","554081","543363"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","sea","flower","lighthouse","archway","carpet","outcrop","ice","wildflower","arch"]}
