{"path":"555357.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts the interior of a greenhouse filled with lush cucumber plants. The plants are growing vertically, supported by strings or thin ropes that are tied to an overhead structure, likely made of metal poles that form part of the greenhouse framework. The foliage is dense, with large leaves displaying a rich, dark green color, which dominates the frame. Some leaves near the top appear lighter, possibly due to lighting or the angle of the photo.\n\nIn the mid to upper parts of the frame, many plants show tendrils and younger stems stretching upwards, indicating healthy growth. A few yellow flowers are visible among the leaves, signifying the flowering stage of the plants. The background shows the curved structure of the greenhouse roof covered with a translucent material, which softly diffuses sunlight over the plants.\n\nThe overall composition provides a view filled with greenery, emphasizing the thriving growth conditions inside the greenhouse, made possible by controlled environmental factors. No people or other objects are visible in the image; the focus is solely on the cultivation of the cucumber plants.","title":"View inside one of the solar greenhouses at the university of Arizona environmental research laboratory at Tucson.
