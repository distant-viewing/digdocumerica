{"path":"549886.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph depicts a bustling urban street scene, likely from the late 20th century based on the style of the vehicles and overall quality of the image. The street is packed with a variety of colorful vehicles, including cars, taxis, and several large transport trucks, indicative of a busy metropolitan area. The vehicles are varied in design and color, featuring white, yellow, red, and blue autos, with one particular vehicle in the forefront being a bright yellow sedan.\n\nRows of identical silver street lamps line the wide avenue, arching elegantly over the multilane roadway. These lamps create a visual rhythm, leading the viewer's eye through the scene. Traffic signs are visible, including specific instructions like \"SNOW EMERGENCY STREET\" and direction signs warning against left turns, reflecting structured urban traffic management.\n\nIn the background, modern buildings with reflective glass surfaces can be vaguely seen, suggesting a city environment with substantial infrastructure. The sky is clear blue, suggesting a calm, sunny day which contrasts against the hustle of the street level.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the essence of a busy, dynamic urban environment that was undergoing growth and expansion, likely in an American city based on the appearance and design of the street signs and vehicles.","title":"On Queens boulevard in Queens, headed toward the east river and Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555782","545216","556724","546716","547369","554310","549874","551135","553681","549853","556681","548410","547651","555450","551478","554297"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["street","vehicle","lamp","avenue","multilane","auto","warn","traffic","rhythm","taxi"]}
