{"path":"554486.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene, framed by the dark silhouettes of trees on each side, creating a natural vignette around the central image. On the beach, there's a small sailing boat pulled up onto the shore, its white sail partially unfurled and flapping in the breeze. A woman, wearing a red and white top, is seated on the boat, engaging with the sail, perhaps preparing to set it or securing it after a journey.\n\nThe lake itself stretches expansively across the middle of the image, its surface reflecting a palette of subdued blues and grays, muted by what appears to be an overcast sky. This gives the scene a somewhat moody atmosphere. The far bank of the lake is lined with dense foliage and trees, which are predominantly green, suggesting a season of late spring or summer.\n\nThe foreground of the image features a sandy beach with scattered patches of grass, some rocks, and a visible tree stump, hinting at past natural changes or landscaping. The colors throughout the image are somewhat subdued, with the exception of the womanâ€™s bright clothing which adds a vivid splash against the natural hues around her. The atmosphere is quiet and pensive, possibly hinting at solitude or a moment of pause in a natural setting.","title":"Sailboat beached at Raquette Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["557562","550324","548118","543951","551207","543618","550674","547754","547757","557416","544266","543531","552345","543626","547273","552038"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sail","subdue","beach","vignette","lake","stump","landscaping","pause","journey","breeze"]}
