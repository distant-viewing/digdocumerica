{"path":"553611.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a man standing in a devastated forest landscape. The man is dressed in a light-colored work shirt and dark pants, both appearing slightly worn and soiled, which suggests physical labor. He is wearing a white hard hat with a mounted headlamp, commonly used in mining or construction environments, and heavy duty work boots. He holds a thick cord or cable in one hand, hinting at some type of work involving machinery or equipment.\n\nThe background reveals a harshly lit scene under a clear blue sky, characterized by burned or dead trees standing with little to no foliage, scattered across a barren, earthy terrain. The remnants of underbrush and small plants are visible, but overall, the area appears desolate and affected by fire or logging activities.\n\nThe image conveys a strong sense of solitude and possibly reflects themes of environmental impact, forestry, or land recovery efforts. The focus and framing on the man, coupled with the stark, damaged natural environment around him, highlight the human interaction with nature and the challenges associated with managing and recovering natural habitats.\n","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora. A \"cat skinner\" works in post-fire salvage operations. Caterpillar tractors are used to haul logs to \"landing area\" (seen here), where they are loaded onto trucks.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553639","545269","542771","545258","550348","542772","542864","553596","553584","542716","553599","553635","542938","553597","553614","553602"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["cord","work","recovery","headlamp","forestry","burn","affect","duty","cable","boot"]}
