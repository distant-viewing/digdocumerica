{"path":"543544.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a construction scene where a wooden house is being built. The house is in an unfinished state with visible framework and partially completed walls. There are several workers who appear to be busy with construction tasks, wearing white protective helmets, indicative of a safety protocol. The house is two-storeyed, with the second level appearing less developed than the first.\n\nThe surrounding area is fenced off, suggesting either a safety perimeter or property boundary, likely indicating ongoing construction activities. Beyond the fence, a dense treeline provides both a backdrop and a contrast to the construction site, emphasizing the blend of natural surroundings and human activity.\n\nThe photograph is taken during daytime under bright lighting conditions, possibly suggesting morning or early afternoon due to the strong shadows cast by the workers and the building. The scene captures a moment of daily labor and construction progress, highlighting the process of building or renovating a residence.","title":"Construction site on coast guard shores of lake tahoe","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["557730","550269","543594","546988","553922","547858","553702","543583","550273","556619","543584","548294","553924","555373","547989","546414"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","house","safety","worker","fence","protocol","first","treeline","perimeter","residence"]}
