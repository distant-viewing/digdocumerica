{"path":"549860.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Morgan, Hank","caption":"This photograph shows two prominent signs displayed against a dark background, possibly at a transportation facility such as a train station or bus depot. The signs appear to be temporarily mounted, composed of white paper with black lettering, and attached to a background structure with either tape or pins at the corners.\n\nThe sign on the left reads: \"CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY PATH POLICE\". This indicates restricted access controlled by transportation authority police, perhaps due to a specific event or circumstance.\n\nThe sign on the right reads: \"PATH SYSTEM NOT OPERATING DUE TO STRIKE PLEASE USE ALTERNATE MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION\". This suggests that the normal operation of the PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) transportation system is interrupted because of a strike, and it advises passengers to seek other transportation options.\n\nAt the bottom of the image, in the foreground, there are some scattered items on the ground. These items include pieces of paper or trash and perhaps discarded tickets or brochures, adding a sense of disarray or neglect.\n\nThe background appears to be a chain-link barrier or fencing, ensuring that access to a certain area is physically restricted. The overall lighting is low, with the primary illumination falling on the signs themselves, creating a focus on the messages regarding operational disruptions and restrictions.","title":"(port authority trans-hudson corporation) trains are on strike","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555404","557879","554103","557474","556788","557412","548175","555464","544228","555856","556761","547081","555858","549129","554789","548951"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["transportation","restrict","sign","strike","paper","access","tape","seek","path","authority"]}
