{"path":"550441.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and expansive landscape that captures the rugged beauty of a mountainous region. In the foreground, there is a diverse terrain covered in colorful vegetation that includes various shades of green, red, and brown, hinting at alpine tundra or a similarly harsh, yet biodiverse environment. The ground appears uneven and rocky with a few prominent stones scattered throughout.\n\nThe middle ground features a winding river valley that snakes its way through the flat land, filled with dark patches which could be water or dense vegetation. This river leads the eye towards a mountain range that dominates the horizon. The range includes several peaks, each showing different stages of erosion and diverse geological formations, underlayed by a broad valley that gently slopes away from the river.\n\nDominating the left side of the photograph is a towering, rugged mountain. Its surface showcases a mix of sharp rocky exposures and areas covered with grass or moss, suggesting a dynamic ecosystem that supports various forms of life despite the harsh conditions. This mountain, along with the surrounding peaks, radiates under a vast, almost cloudless sky that occupies the upper third of the image. The lighting indicates either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and enhancing the textures of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the tranquil and untouched nature of this wilderness area, inviting contemplation of the natural processes that shape such environments. The absence of any visible human activity or structures reinforces the remote and pristine character of the scene.","title":"Looking west in the direction of Galbraith Lake from the Atigun Gorge. The east end of peak 5308 appears at left. Without the re-routing of the pipeline that occurred this year, the line would have run through this valley. Now it will bypass the gorge and follow the central Atigun Valley to Galbraith Lake and continue north beside the lake.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550497","550511","550513","550592","550415","550629","550596","550516","550510","550512","550500","555696","550523","555681","555690","550609"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","peak","valley","tundra","river","range","radiate","third","snake","moss"]}
