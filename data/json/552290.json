{"path":"552290.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a young man in an outdoor, coastal setting. He appears to be engaged in examining or collecting specimens in a shallow body of water, likely a tide pool or a similarly low-depth area along the shore. The individual is squatting, with one knee submerged in the water, and is closely inspecting something held in his hands.\n\nHe is dressed casually for a rugged, outdoor activity: he wears a light-colored jacket over a shirt, dark pants possibly jeans, and durable boots that are partially submerged in the water. He carries a red backpack, suggesting he is on a hike or conducting fieldwork.\n\nThe environment around him is typical of a coastal tidal area with visible seaweed and several large, open oysters or similar shellfish directly beside and in the water around him. The background features a large body of water that recedes to a distant shoreline across the bay. A slightly overcast sky suggests cool or temperate weather, and a faint silhouette of mountains or hills is visible across the water.\n\nOverall, the composition and the subject's focus intimate a moment of scientific inquiry or nature exploration, emphasizing a connection between the individual and the marine environment he is studying.","title":"Jim Poth of Seattle shucks and eats oysters on the public tidelands of the Hood Canal at Brinnon, on the east coast of the Olympic Peninsula. Oysters must be shucked on the beach and the shells left there so that the spat (young oysters) have a place to attach themselves and grow.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552289","552288","545077","558108","545095","546308","545080","551406","546847","547504","542556","546334","548734","552278","543492","548956"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["shellfish","water","inquiry","specimen","oyster","hike","seaweed","fieldwork","tide","backpack"]}
