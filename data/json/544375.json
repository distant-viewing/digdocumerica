{"path":"544375.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene centered on large heaps of mining materials, most likely coal, under a clear sky. Dominating the foreground and middle ground are massive, undulating mounds of dark, granular material that give the image a rough texture. Perched near the crest of the central mound is a solitary, large yellow bulldozer. The vehicle appears tiny against the vastness of the black hills, emphasizing the scale of the heaps it's working on.\n\nThe bulldozer, equipped with tracks and a large front blade, is angled towards the viewer, suggesting activity or movement across the material. The photo's background is relatively empty, with only the faintest hints of a lighter horizon where the dark ground meets a pale blue sky. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting subtle shadows and giving the coal a slightly glistening appearance. This composition skillfully contrasts the human effort represented by the bulldozer against nature's grand scale.","title":"Coal truck drives along man-made cut in Moenkopi Wash.
