{"path":"547503.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling day at the beach, with various beachgoers engaging in typical seaside activities under the striking summer sun. The foreground features two individuals seated on the sand under a large two-toned green and white umbrella. They appear relaxed; one is turned slightly towards the other, suggesting a moment of conversation or shared observation.\n\nThe beach is densely populated, bathed in sunlight that enhances the vividness of the scene. People are spread out across the sand, primarily lying on towels or beach blankets, with some sitting and chatting in small groups. There is a notable diversity in swimwear styles, reflecting a mix likely indicative of the era the photo was taken. \n\nNear the water's edge, individuals can be seen walking along the shore and children playing, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil setting. Some adults and teens are closer to the waves, possibly about to enter the water or just enjoying the cool ocean breeze.\n\nIn the background, the ocean appears calm with moderate waves, meeting a clear sky on the horizon which suggests good weather conditions typical of a beach day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph gives an expansive view of the beach scene, filled with life and the casual repose that comes with a day spent by the sea.","title":"Misquamicut State Beach","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["550931","547491","547628","546942","546874","547482","546794","553685","550243","548541","553686","550919","550930","550932","547680","555923"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","ocean","wave","teen","beachgoer","chat","spend","towel","umbrella"]}
