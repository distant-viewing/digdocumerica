{"path":"545613.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a wooden sign with white lettering that reads \"VANDALISM SPOILS YOUR PARK,\" mounted on two vertical wooden posts. The sign is positioned in front of a large rock surface that has been extensively vandalized. Various graffiti, including scratched names, initials, and symbols, can be seen covering the rock face. The setting appears to be in a natural park environment, evidenced by the presence of wild grasses and small plants in front of the rock. The overall lighting in the image suggests this photo was taken on a bright day, enhancing the colors and textures of both the reddish-brown rock and the contrasting white lettering of the sign. This scene poignantly contrasts the natural beauty of the surroundings with the destructive human impact of vandalism.","title":"Vandalism is a problem, as most of the Canyonlands National Park area is unsupervised.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["557118","557536","557534","545617","552084","542915","550699","543504","548846","544845","557551","546386","548158","554103","547854","543079"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["rock","lettering","sign","front","graffiti","symbol","post","name","park","face"]}
