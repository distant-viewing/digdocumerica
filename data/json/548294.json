{"path":"548294.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph displays a two-story building under construction, shown in broad daylight under a clear sky. The structure features a symmetrical layout, with two visible sections: the left section appears completed with a white fa√ßade and decorative elements such as balconies with railings, doors, and windows framed in a classic style. The right section still has its wooden frame exposed, indicating that construction is ongoing.\n\nThe building is approached by a straight, concrete pathway cutting through a well-maintained lawn. This pathway starts from a chain-link fence in the foreground, which limits access to a public or private area. There are two more visible pathways on each side of the lawn parallel to the central path, suggesting a formal garden or communal area.\n\nOn the left side of the building, construction materials are scattered on the ground, and a scaffold is erected against the front of the building for ongoing work. A ladder leans against the balcony, and building equipment is visible. No construction workers are seen in the shot.\n\nBehind and to the sides of the building, there are other residential structures visible, hinting that this building is part of a larger residential or possibly a resort area. The overall scene communicates a moment caught in the development and expansion of a community space.","title":"Old Paulina School, built around 1880, is being torn down.
