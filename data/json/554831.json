{"path":"554831.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene of a large strip mining operation. In the image, two large bucket wheel excavators dominate the center and left side of the composition. The machines are massive, with visible wheels and multiple supporting structures, including long booms equipped with buckets used to excavate the earth.\n\nThe setting is a large, open pit area. The ground appears rugged and uneven, with various piles of dug-up earth and rock debris scattered around. The landscape surrounding the pit is barren, with a few leafless trees in the distance, suggesting the photo was taken in a colder season or in an area where vegetation is sparse.\n\nBoth the machinery and the environment are cast in natural lighting, with shadows indicating that the sun is either rising or setting. The overall atmosphere feels somewhat stark and desolate, emphasizing the industrial and harsh nature of the mining site. The sky is clear and offers a bright contrast to the darker, earthy tones of the excavated ground and the heavy machinery.","title":"\"The Tiger\" coal shovel, owned by the Hanna Coal Company working in its self-made valley off Route 800, near Barnesville, Ohio and Steubenville","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["552417","552418","552416","554826","555606","554772","549124","554773","549171","554769","544099","545831","555644","554828","554812","549245"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["excavate","pit","bucket","wheel","mining","earth","machinery","excavator","boom","dig"]}
