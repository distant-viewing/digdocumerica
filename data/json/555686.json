{"path":"555686.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural landscape featuring a glacier descending through a mountainous valley. In the foreground lies a large body of water, possibly a lake or a fjord, reflecting a hint of the blue sky above. The far shore of this body of water hosts a small cluster of what appears to be industrial or residential buildings, possibly a remote community or a facility.\n\nThis series of mountains, draped with lush green slopes at the lower regions, rises steeply from the water's edge into rugged peaks. Several of the peaks are capped with snow, indicating higher elevation. One prominent glacier, in the center of the image, is nestled between two peaks, flowing down from the snow-covered mountain top like a frozen river. Its white and blue tinted ice contrasts starkly with the surrounding rocky outcrops and greenery.\n\nThe overall composition of this photograph draws the viewer's eye from the water at the base up through the verdant mountain slopes and towards the icy peaks, creating a vivid portrayal of an alpine landscape interfacing with human habitation. The presence of the glacier underscores the wild beauty and ruggedness of this scenic location.","title":"View northeast toward old Valdez and camicia glacier in the distant center of the picture.  During the gold rush, the Valdez glacier reached tidewater, but has since retreated (melted faster than it advanced) more than five miles to a position that places it just out of view behind the first ridge in the left portion of the picture.
