{"path":"549834.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures an urban street scene from an elevated perspective, likely taken from a nearby building or a bridge. The image shows a narrow road bisecting two sidewalks, with parked vehicles lining one side of the street. These vehicles include an array of vintage cars in dark and light colors, notably a white car resembling a Volkswagen Beetle, adding a classic feel to the scene.\n\nOn the right side of the street, a gush of water bursts from a fire hydrant, spraying across the pavement towards the road. A man in light-colored clothing is seen engaging with the hydrant, perhaps trying to control or utilize the water flow. Across the street, another individual, dressed in dark clothes, walks along the sidewalk, seemingly undisturbed by the water scenario.\n\nThe background features a building with a three-color striped pattern – red, white, and blue – suggesting a patriotic theme or possibly a barbershop, given the typical color association. The street appears slightly wet, possibly from the water spillage or recent rain, and various urban elements like street lamps, curb poles, and small bits of litter can be seen, contributing to the gritty, detailed urban vibe of the photograph. The overall atmosphere invokes a sense of everyday city life, possibly from a bygone era, captured in the midst of an uncommon but intriguing moment.","title":"Local \"supers\" flush litter from 172nd Street with fire hydrant water.
