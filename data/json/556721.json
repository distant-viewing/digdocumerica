{"path":"556721.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a densely packed car park, filled almost completely with cars. The cars vary widely in color, including shades of white, red, blue, gray, black, and green, among others. The vehicles are tightly arranged in rows, with very limited space between them, which suggests a highly organized parking scheme likely in an urban or semi-urban area. No people or other distinct landmarks are visible in the image, accentuating the focus solely on the multitude and diversity of the vehicles. The photograph captures an expansive view of the lot, displaying an overwhelming array of mostly vintage cars, indicative of the photo being taken several decades ago, possibly in the 1970s or 1980s. The scene transmits a vivid impression of busy vehicular storage, possibly during a significant event given the fullness of the parking area.","title":"Cars were jammed into every spare space at a downtown commercial parking lot during a bus strike in Washington, District of Columbia, in May, 1974. Some 250,000 people who normally rode the buses were forced to find alternate forms of transportation, usually the car. Monumental traffic jams were the result as drivers learned there were more autos than places to park legally. As a result, they used bus lanes, traffic \"islands,\" \"no parking\" zones, sidewalks, and lawns.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["553303","546879","554349","547826","546813","546685","548432","556722","547480","556773","550100","546900","547686","542635","556197","556790"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","parking","multitude","landmark","scheme","diversity","decade","vehicle","lot","array"]}
