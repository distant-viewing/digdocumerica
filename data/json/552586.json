{"path":"552586.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals, wearing bright red and gray uniforms, engaged in a close examination or treatment of wildlife. They are both wearing red baseball caps, and their jackets have patches that suggest they might be game wardens or wildlife officers. The focus of their attention is a large animal, specifically a deer, which seems to be sedated or restrained and lying on its side with a number of metal bars or poles surrounding it. This setup suggests that they are perhaps either tagging, medicating, or performing some kind of health check on the deer.\n\nThe person on the left handles a syringe or injector aimed towards the deer's head, possibly administering a substance or taking a sample, while the person on the right is focused on observing or assisting in the procedure. The setting appears to be outdoors during daylight, with trees visible in the background alongside a somewhat cloudy sky, conveying either a rural or wildland area. Additionally, the foreground shows part of a vehicle, which further explains their ability to handle wildlife with such tools and restraints readily at hand, indicating a professional, field-based wildlife management situation.","title":"Hunters taking their deer back to Denver must stop at a check station north of Rifles, where their kill is counted and examined.
