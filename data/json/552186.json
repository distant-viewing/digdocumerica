{"path":"552186.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph offers a panoramic and striking view featuring a large, snow-capped mountain and an expansive city below. The mountain, which dominates the upper portion of the image, rises majestically with a noticeable cap of cloud or mist encircling its summit. Its slopes are distinctly marked with snowy ridges and darker patches indicating rocky or vegetated areas.\n\nIn the foreground and filling the lower part of the frame is a dense urban landscape. The city is spread out and composed of numerous buildings which vary in size, interspersed with areas of greenery. From this perspective, the buildings appear closely packed together, creating a somewhat textured appearance of the urban structure. The image is cast in a dusky light suggesting either early morning or late evening, casting gentle hues over both the city and the mountain, enhancing the contrast between the natural and man-built environments.\n\nThe color palette is somewhat muted with blues and grays dominating, likely due to the lighting conditions and the vintage quality of the photograph. Overall, the composition juxtaposes the grandeur of the natural environment against the densely populated human settlement, illustrating the scale and impact of human habitation at the foot of such a natural monument.","title":"Smog covers Tacoma, obscuring the foothills below Mount Rainier.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544791","544073","542674","544783","553811","542673","548094","553060","557340","552144","553728","543750","552231","545243","552171","543640"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["city","mountain","dominating","summit","monument","foot","settlement","habitation","ridge","grandeur"]}
