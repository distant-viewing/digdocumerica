{"path":"553671.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a tropical urban coastline, likely taken from a high vantage point looking down onto a dense cluster of modern high-rise buildings typical of a city's skyline. The architecture is varied, with some buildings featuring modern facades of reflective glass, while others have traditional rectangular contours in concrete.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a sandy beach bordering calm ocean waters, where several people can be seen enjoying the beach. The coast is lined with tall palm trees, adding to the tropical allure of the scene. Nearby, there's a noticeable series of wave breakers jutting into the ocean, creating gently lapping waves at the shoreline.\n\nThe beach is adjacent to an area with more low-rise buildings, possibly hotels or residential areas, painted in light, neutral colors that blend with the beachfront aesthetic. The urban area behind displays a mix of green spaces among the buildings.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a harmonious balance between urban development and natural beauty, characteristic of a well-developed seaside city. The atmosphere suggests a vibrant, possibly touristic, area catering to both leisure and business activities.","title":"Massed highrises of Waikiki district, favorite of tourists seen from top of Diamond Head, the famous extinct volcano. The Waikiki Improvement Association has formed an architectural design review board to oversee such building, but it is probably too late. In 1963 there were 9,203 hotel rooms in all of Oahu Island. Today there are some 26,000 rooms, most of them here in Waikiki.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["555756","544638","555757","553672","553689","553679","551587","553982","557463","553983","553677","553675","553790","553680","553791","547640"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["beach","rise","ocean","wave","allure","hotel","coast","city","palm","building"]}
