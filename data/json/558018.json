{"path":"558018.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph shows a gothic-style wooden church, likely from the late 19th or early 20th century. The church is painted in a light color, possibly white, and features a steeply pointed roof with a belfry at the peak where a simple cross is placed atop. The facade includes a centrally located entrance decorated with a pointed arch and trim, giving it a classic gothic revival detail. Above the church door, there is a large circular stained-glass window with a star design.\n\nOn either side of the central entrance, there are elongated, arched windows allowing light into the building. The church is situated on a flat area, possibly a lawn, as evidenced by some patches of grass visible in the foreground and the sides. No people are visible in this image, and the sky appears clear. The picture exudes a peaceful and serene atmosphere, commonly associated with religious structures. The composition focuses squarely on the church, with minimal distractions in the background, enhancing the singular importance of the building in the photograph.","title":"Copy of a black and white photograph taken of the mother of sorrows roman catholic church along Akron-Peninsula road in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.
