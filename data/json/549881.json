{"path":"549881.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a busy urban street scene filled with cars and pedestrians. Central to the image is a vibrant red car, which appears to be a vintage convertible sports model. Notably, the convertible top is partially covered with a large cardboard box or a similar item, somewhat awkwardly placed and secured to the car.\n\nSurrounding the red car are various other vehicles, predominantly yellow taxis that characterize many city settings, suggesting this might be a scene from a place like New York City. The taxis have markings and advertisements on top; one is prominently marked \"Art Car Corp.\" which helps in setting a commercial tone to the scene.\n\nIn the background, pedestrians can be seen walking along the sidewalk, dressed in typical street attire from what could be guessed as possibly the 1970s or 1980s, based on the overall ambiance and style of the cars and peopleâ€™s outfits. The buildings in the backdrop have retail shop signs, one of which is legible as \"Brothers.\"\n\nOverall, the composition captures a lively street atmosphere, detailing an intersection of daily life, commerce, and a splash of personal narrative with the uniquely loaded red car.","title":"Triple-parked car with hazardous load in Midtown Manhattan street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554310","554314","554297","549882","549872","548331","549876","557882","550139","551913","556709","548410","556724","555944","554331","549873"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","taxi","pedestrian","street","cardboard","commerce","place","secure","marking","intersection"]}
