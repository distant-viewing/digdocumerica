{"path":"546321.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, a person is holding several sea urchins in their hands underwater. The person's hands are visible slightly beneath the water's surface, one hand cradling three sea urchins while the other hand holds two more. The sea urchins appear to be black with long, spiky protrusions.\n\nThe background is blurred but shows a sandy, wavy sea bed, suggesting that the photo was taken either in shallow coastal waters or in a controlled underwater environment. The lighting in the photo is natural, probably sunlight, lending a soft, diffuse quality that enhances the textures of the sea urchins' spines. The color palette is predominantly earth tones, with the sandy background and the dark color of the sea urchins. The image captures a moment of marine exploration or study, showcasing the intriguing form and texture of these marine creatures.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory: bioassay wet lab.
