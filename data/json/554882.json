{"path":"554882.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph portrays a rural, agricultural scene involving sheep and farmers. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Sheep:** A flock of sheep, predominantly with white wool, is at the forefront of the image. They are tightly packed within a wooden fence enclosure, indicating they may be either being prepared for shearing or herded for relocation or management.\n\n2. **Farmers:** There are two men visibly engaged in activities related to sheep farming. \n   - The first man, wearing a yellow shirt and a cowboy hat, is standing within the enclosure, partially obscured as he leans into a wooden structure, possibly adjusting or retrieving tools or materials associated with sheep farming.\n   - The second man, wearing a plaid shirt and straw hat, is positioned above the fence on a raised platform or the roof of the adjoining shed. He is looking down, possibly supervising or about to engage in an activity related to the enclosure or the sheep.\n\n3. **Background and Environment:** The scene is set outdoors under clear skies, indicated by the abundant sunlight and shadow interplay. Surrounding the main activities are various rustic elements like wooden sheds and possibly farming storage units or additional enclosures, painted a dark color. Trees and foliage are partially visible, suggesting a rural setting.\n\n4. **Structure and Building:** Next to and above the men and sheep is a simple, single-story wooden structure, possibly for storage or as a cover for the livestock. The structure's rustic appearance, with worn wooden planks and a metal roof, complements the overall pastoral setting.\n\n5. **Attire and Tools:** The attire of the men and their positioning hints at an ongoing farming operation. Accessories like hats indicate it's a sunny day, while their casual and practical clothing suggests physical work.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures a moment in the daily life of rural farming, highlighting interactions between farmers and livestock within a functional and natural environment.","title":"Sheep being herded into loading pens on a ranch in the Leakey, Texas, area near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554894","554880","554883","544391","554881","557747","554928","547326","552568","552573","547396","554886","554779","554884","554892","554885"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["sheep","enclosure","farming","farmer","livestock","shed","hat","man","breakdown","fence"]}
