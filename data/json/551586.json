{"path":"551586.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph displays an old, large industrial building, possibly a warehouse or factory. The structure is prominently defined by its three-story height and a wide, central open gateway that allows entry into the building. The building's fa√ßade is constructed from concrete and brick, exuding an aged, rugged industrial aesthetic.\n\nThe windows of the building, arranged in grids, are a significant feature, covering nearly the entire face of the structure. Many of these windows are broken or have panes missing, which suggests the building is abandoned or in disuse. The roofline of the building is equipped with a triangularly shaped pediment that houses a smaller, shuttered window, possibly for attic or upper-level ventilation.\n\nThe surrounding area appears overgrown with grass and small bushes, indicating neglect or minimal maintenance. A sign next to the open gateway, presumably for safety or warnings, is visible but the text is not readable in the photograph.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the picture suggests a bygone era of industrial activity, now quiet and somewhat forlorn in its present state, under an overcast sky.","title":"Abandoned factory in Riverside, a suburb of Duluth on the st louis river","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["547985","547969","547894","557348","550129","550023","554707","554785","551944","557412","555952","556351","544719","557139","557344","549864"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["building","pediment","window","ventilation","roofline","entry","disuse","pane","warning","miss"]}
