{"path":"554838.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a classroom scene, showing young students engaged in a learning activity. The image is taken from the perspective of looking over the shoulder of a student with long, straight blonde hair, providing a partial view of her side profile as she focuses forward.\n\nIn the foreground to the right, a girl with long, wavy light brown hair, wearing an orange t-shirt with text on it, is in the process of raising her hand and holding a pen, suggesting she is eager to answer a question or contribute to the class discussion. She appears attentive and ready to engage, her face showing a slight smile.\n\nBeside her, slightly blurred and in the background, there is another student, a boy who is also raising his hand. He has long dark hair, tied back neatly and is dressed in a white long-sleeve shirt. His expression and posture also indicate readiness to participate, as he sits up straight looking slightly towards the teacher's direction as indicated by his gaze.\n\nThe classroom setting includes traditional wooden desks, filled with textbooks and notebooks, indicative of an ongoing lesson. The walls of the classroom are a dark color, and there is a chalkboard just visible at the edge of the image. A globe and some books are faintly visible on a shelf in the far background, suggesting a well-equipped learning environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts an engaging classroom environment, with students in the middle of a learning interaction, and it captures a moment of active student participation in an educational setting.","title":"Students in a classroom at Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio.","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["558214","546556","546548","548243","543920","543919","558212","544798","553911","544322","554332","552590","551766","558216","548227","545547"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["student","classroom","learning","hair","teacher","globe","question","notebook","class","readiness"]}
