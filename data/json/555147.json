{"path":"555147.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This landscape photograph depicts a mountainous forest scene dominated by coniferous trees. The foreground to the right features a steep slope with many tall, thin trees, primarily upright but some fallen, indicative of natural forest dynamics or logging activity. In the middle ground, a cleared area with patches of brown earth is visible, showcasing signs of logging or land clearance, with visible dirt roads or paths crisscrossing the area and winding into the distance. This cleared patch is contrasted starkly against the surrounding dense forest.\n\nThe background features rolling hills and mountains densely covered with dark green trees, stretching into the distance under an overcast sky. This scene communicates a sense of remoteness and human interaction with natural landscapes, possibly for resource extraction. The overall atmosphere, enhanced by the subdued lighting and grey sky, evokes a somewhat melancholic or contemplative mood, reflecting on the impact of human activity on natural forests.","title":"View of recent clear-cuts on the Canyon River drainage system in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555135","555109","555133","542604","555163","557001","555201","555146","554459","555138","554461","555198","555221","555143","555139","555150"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","clearance","remoteness","dynamic","extraction","resource","patch","distance","slope","tree"]}
