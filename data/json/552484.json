{"path":"552484.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a serene rural landscape under a wide, expansive sky. The dominating feature in the middle ground is a large, dense tree or clump of trees standing prominently in the center of a plowed field. The field is expansive, stretching across the foreground with patches of vegetation or crop residue scattered across its surface, indicating it might be either freshly harvested or prepared for sowing.\n\nBehind the tree, the land appears slightly elevated and merges into a tree line that forms a boundary stretching across the horizon. The skyline is vast and dramatic, filled with large, fluffy clouds scattered across a blue sky, which suggests it could be a clear day transitioning towards evening due to the darker tone on the bottom side of the clouds.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph subtly highlights the silhouetted tree against the sky, creating a contrast between the dark foreground and the brighter sky. The overall mood of the scene is peaceful and pastoral, typical of agricultural landscapes. The composition of the photo, with the tree centered, draws attention to the natural element amidst the expanses of cultivated land, emphasizing the intersection of natural beauty and human activity in rural environments.","title":"Farmland","placename":"Kickapoo (Ill.)","location":"Kickapoo, Illinois","nn1":["552541","547649","552466","552520","545040","549181","557013","549142","555537","555567","547546","547291","550390","550604","552483","557023"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["tree","residue","plow","clump","harvest","land","elevate","stretch","field","cultivate"]}
