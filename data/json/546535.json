{"path":"546535.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features a park-like setting under bright daylight conditions. The foreground is dominated by a large, rectangular glass structure enclosed within a perimeter of tall, metal fencing. Nearby, on a neatly paved pathway, an elder man wearing a dark suit and carrying a bag is walking. His deep focus and solitary presence add a serene feel to the scene.\n\nThe middle ground shows an expansive, well-maintained grassy area dotted with uniformly planted, young trees. These trees appear lush and healthy, indicating a well-kept environment. Beyond these natural elements, there's a partial view of a lamp post on the left.\n\nThe background is populated by a distant cityscape which includes various buildings with traditional and historic architectures, among which stands a prominent building featuring a tower with an ornate dome. The skyline suggests an urban area not immediately adjacent, but within view of this serene park setting. The overall composition highlights a contrast between the peaceful, natural park environment and the distant urban architecture, suggesting perhaps a blend of natural and urban elements within a city context.","title":"Guardhouse; courthouse in background","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["550298","553469","557257","547784","544808","546450","550075","546539","553043","549516","551776","557271","551940","551767","546457","557281"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["park","fencing","perimeter","paved","architecture","dome","lamp","keep","plan","enclose"]}
