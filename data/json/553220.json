{"path":"553220.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The image presents a detailed view of a multi-story building's facade, distinctly featuring a series of horizontally elongated, dark-colored windows against a darker exterior wall. The architecture gives an impression of a modern office building. Each window pane reflects various other buildings, giving a mosaic of different structures including what appears to be parts of other high-rise buildings, possibly in an urban setting.\n\nThe reflection in the windows suggests a dense, built-up area, typical of a cityscape. The array of windows displays a repetitive pattern that is broken only by the variances in the reflections and the slight differences in lighting and items visible inside some of the windows. The overall mood conveyed is architectural and urban, with a focus on design elements and the interaction of light, glass, and urban environment.","title":"Carew Tower, built in the 1930's, is reflected in the Du Bois Tower, built in the 60's.
