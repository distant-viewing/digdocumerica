{"path":"545263.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a large billboard set against a strikingly blue sky with scattered clouds. The billboard displays two prominent messages with vivid images. On the left side, there's an announcement \"Coming Soon!!\" along with an image of a snowy mountain. Underneath the mountain, text states \"22 Million Dollars Worth\". The right side of the billboard advertises \"CLEANER AIR FOR TACOMA\" beneath byline \"ST. REGIS\" and the slogan “A COMPANY THAT CARES”. The St. Regis logo is visible at the bottom right.\n\nIn the background, immediately next to the billboard, there's a large pile of logs, suggesting recent logging activity in the area. This juxtaposition might be pointing to environmental themes or industrial activities in the region. The overall lighting and composition suggest the photo could have been taken in favorable weather conditions, possibly late afternoon, given the deep blue sky and the angle of the light.","title":"Advertisement at st.
