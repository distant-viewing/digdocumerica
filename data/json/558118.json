{"path":"558118.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph showcases a bustling street scene in a town during what appears to be a street fair or market day. Taken from an elevated position, the image overlooks a main street that is teeming with activity. People are scattered throughout, many browsing and shopping at various makeshift stalls and tables set up along the street where vendors are selling a variety of goods.\n\nThe architecture is typical of small-town America with two- to three-story buildings lining the street. Prominent business signs include \"Sears\" and \"J.C. Penney,\" indicating these are likely anchor stores in this area. The buildings have a classic mid-20th-century commercial style.\n\nThe street itself is closed to vehicular traffic for the event, allowing pedestrians to freely roam the area. The crowd is diverse, with adults and children visible. Some are walking, others are standing and chatting, and many are engaged in transactions with vendors.\n\nThe sky is clear and the weather sunny, casting strong shadows on the buildings and street, which adds to the vibrant, dynamic atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThis image captures the essence of a community gathering, where commerce and social interaction blend on a beautiful day, reflecting a slice of life in a typical American town.","title":"Minnesota street in New Ulm, Minnesota, is blocked off for one day each summer for \"crazy days.\"  Merchants move bargain merchandise onto the street and sidewalks to sell in the summer promotion.  The business section is some eight blocks.  The town was founded by german immigrants in 1854 and still retains an ethnic charm.  The business section has been revitalized since the 1960's.  All stores are occupied and many of the fronts have been Renovated to show a german influence","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558119","551686","546428","557655","556422","545614","551694","550114","551125","552602","546672","554691","550115","550045","551691","551749"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","vendor","town","transaction","robe","teem","chat","sell","stall","anchor"]}
