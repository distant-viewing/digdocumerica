{"path":"544741.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This image captures a dramatic scene featuring a helicopter involved in an operation within a natural rugged setting. The helicopter, equipped with long cable lines, is suspended in the air, slightly tilted to one side, indicating a mid-action moment. Below the helicopter, a cloud of dust and debris is visible, suggesting that the helicopter may be engaged in construction, extraction, or similar outdoor activities.\n\nThe background shows a massive rock formation, potentially a cliff or canyon wall, characterized by its dark color and rugged texture. The rock formations have natural arches and crevices, creating a monumental and imposing backdrop. The dark, shadowy nature of the cliffs contrasts with the dust and activity centered around the helicopter, pulling the viewerâ€™s focus directly to the aerial activity. The lighting appears natural, adding a dynamic and intense atmosphere to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is both dynamic and tense, capturing a moment of human and mechanical interaction with the challenging elements of the natural environment. The vertical orientation of the photo accentuates the height and the scale of the operations within the grandeur of the natural setting.","title":"Colorado--clear creek","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["545642","544771","544737","545638","545637","544754","552372","544766","552393","552365","547533","544109","555835","553027","545649","545648"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","dust","cliff","tense","dynamic","formation","orientation","crevice","involved","tilt"]}
