{"path":"544289.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a stark industrial scene juxtaposed against a natural landscape. On the left, there is a wide expanse of a marshy wetland, characterized by long, dense reeds growing thickly along the muddy banks of a water channel. The water reflects a silver-blue hue under the overcast sky.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a stark contrast with the presence of industrial machinery and infrastructure. This includes a series of large, metallic tanks and cylindrical structures, likely for storage and processing purposes. There are also multiple pipes and conduits, some vertical and others horizontal, connecting the tanks. The ground is covered with light-colored gravel, which separates this constructed area from the natural marshland.\n\nThere is no human activity evident in the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet tension between industrial development and the natural environment, accentuated by the differing textures and colors on either side of the photograph. This invites reflection on the impact of industrial activities on natural ecosystems. The sky, somewhat gloomy and overcast, adds a moody overtone to the setting.","title":"Placid oil company facility near Louisiana highway 56","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["546974","546978","545996","550995","546207","555542","546064","545997","545989","545854","546118","552040","546073","545862","545993","544179"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["differing","tank","conduits","marshland","tension","reed","stark","silver","channel","wetland"]}
