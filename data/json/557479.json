{"path":"557479.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a construction scene dominated by earthy tones and a clear, sunny sky. In the foreground, there is a yellow construction vehicle, similar to a road grader, with a person seated in the operator's cabin. The operator, who is not distinctly visible, appears to be maneuvering the vehicle. The ground around is rough and muddy, indicative of recent excavation or construction work.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple buildings in various stages of construction. The buildings have red-tiled roofs, suggestive of a residential area under development. Some of the buildings are partially scaffolded, indicating ongoing work. To the right, an exposed side of a building shows what seems to be the wooden framing of the structure, underscoring the unfinished nature of the construction.\n\nOn the right side of the image, in the muddy terrain, is a sign with the words \"YOU DAM IT, YOU DAMN IT,\" possibly warning against improper handling of construction materials or disruption of the work in progress.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a busy construction site likely in the process of developing a new residential area, with attention drawn particularly to the use of heavy machinery and the intricate details of building construction in a suburban setting.","title":"New housing development arises near one of the few remaining farm fields in fast growing orange county.  Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast resulting in increased land use pressure.  Since november, 1972 regulatory commissions have been charged with determining development within 1,000 yards of the coast.  The commissions must submit a report to the legislature by january, 1976, recommending a plan for future coastal development","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["544812","553378","553382","550274","553383","543107","545665","552814","545652","547833","556939","546252","553394","553391","543593","548431"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","operator","warn","work","scaffold","around","exposed","disruption","maneuver","building"]}
