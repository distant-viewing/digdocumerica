{"path":"552604.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a vintage, streamlined passenger railcar, prominently featuring colors of yellow and silver, with some black accents near the base. The car is marked with the text “Rio Grande” at the top part near the roof on both visible sides, suggesting it was once operated by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. On the side of the railcar facing the camera, large block letters spell out \"RIFLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,\" indicating that the car is currently used as an office or meeting space for the Rifle Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe passenger car is parked on what appears to be a foundation or platform made of concrete, delineated from a surrounding area of dirt or finely graveled ground by a series of rectangular concrete blocks arranged in a simple, unadorned pattern around the railcar. At the front side of the railcar, touching the platform, a small tree and some low bushes can be observed; these elements introduce a bit of greenery to the otherwise industrial or utilitarian scene.\n\nThe background shows clear, blue skies without any visible clouds, and there are tall trees further back, suggesting the presence of a park or wooded area nearby. There is also a notable tree immediately adjacent to the railcar, contributing to the composition's mixture of natural and man-made elements.\n\nThe atmosphere conveyed by this image seems peaceful and static, likely captured during a daytime moment with bright sunlight casting clear shadows and highlighting the car's details and colors. No people are visible in the frame, which focuses primarily on the railcar as a stationary structure serving a repurposed function in a community setting.","title":"Rifle, the major community of the piceance basin, is a small town with a one-street business district","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["556784","555986","556058","556857","556782","556851","542899","556111","556009","556124","556101","556063","554834","557966","555971","542898"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railcar","car","block","passenger","platform","repurpose","spell","delineate","foundation","introduce"]}
