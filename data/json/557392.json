{"path":"557392.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial scene featuring a large manufacturing or processing plant situated near a body of water. The plant is predominantly built of metal and painted in a light color, possibly white or grey, which helps it stand out against the natural greenery in the background. The architecture of the building is pragmatic and functional, with several large, rectangular structures interconnected and equipped with various chimneys, vents, and other industrial fittings. The rooftop appears to have multiple levels with platforms and catwalks that have safety railings.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a water body, likely a small man-made lake or retention pond, reflecting some of the plant's structures. On the left side, the ground slopes into the water with several large rocks and patches of dirt visible, suggesting some form of land manipulation or construction activity, possibly related to the industrial processes or environmental management.\n\nThere is visible industrial detritus and materials around the plant, indicating ongoing operations or maintenance. Multiple power lines and utility poles crisscross above the factory, connecting the infrastructure necessary to run such a facility. The surrounding landscape features lush green hills, indicating that the plant is likely situated in a valley or a similarly enclosed natural space.\n\nNo humans are visible in this scene, focusing solely on the industrial elements and their interactions with the natural environment. This setting evokes themes of industry, technology, and their impact on natural surroundings.","title":"Settling pond for the wet scrubber operation of furnace #36 at the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant.  The pond is dredged periodically and the sludge is used for landfill.  Total plant emissions were reduced 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975.  A compliance schedule was reached between the company and the West Virginia air pollution control commission.  Epa stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards.  (see fiche #141 to 146)","placename":"Alloy (W.
