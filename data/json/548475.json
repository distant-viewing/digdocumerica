{"path":"548475.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts a train station scene. From the viewer's perspective, we are on a train platform looking down a set of multiple railway lines, which converge in the distance. A train is approaching on the nearest track, moving toward the station.\n\nThe platform shelter, visible in the right foreground, has a white underside with several hanging dome-shaped lights. The platform itself looks clean and is marked with a safety line close to the edge. There's a sign that reads \"DANGER DO NOT PASS,\" mounted on a pole by the track, indicating a safety warning for passengers.\n\nBuildings surround the train station. To the left, there is a narrow multi-story residential building with balconies. In the background, various other buildings can be seen, some of which appear residential, contributing to a sense of an urban environment.\n\nThe surrounding area includes lush green trees under a clear, sunny sky, which gives the scene a pleasant, lively atmosphere despite the industrial elements of the railway tracks and the train infrastructure.","title":"MBTA (Metropolitan Boston Transit Authority) tracks cut across Neptune Road","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["556768","556129","556090","556125","556767","556673","556120","556854","556841","556772","556100","556021","556692","556124","556846","556670"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","platform","station","track","railway","safety","underside","danger","warning","dome"]}
