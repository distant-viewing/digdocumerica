{"path":"544461.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of disaster aftermath, possibly due to a natural calamity like a flood. In the foreground, there is a notable accumulation of damaged household items and debris scattered outdoors. This includes various pieces of furniture such as overturned cabinets, chairs, and desks, all in a state of disarray. Among these items, there is a distinctive, large chair with a tall, ornate backrest standing upright. Additionally visible are household items like a small wooden drawer unit and a toppled lampshade. These items are set against a background featuring residential single-story houses.\n\nThe general landscape suggests a serene neighborhood with mature trees providing ample shade. The sky is somewhat clear, indicating that the event might have passed. There are two main houses visible; the closest one is a light-colored building with a slanted roof, while the other house visible in the background has a similar architectural design and color. The lawn areas visible are well-kept and the region appears generally residential.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a dramatic moment of loss and disruption, common in areas struck by severe weather or similar events, highlighted by the contrast between the calm environment and the chaotic debris in front.","title":"Household goods salvaged after flooding of Guadalupe River","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["544797","547079","544464","547868","547888","544463","544583","552829","543165","544467","557162","553470","557993","545966","544458","547872"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["item","household","house","chair","loss","event","cabinet","disarray","flood","disruption"]}
