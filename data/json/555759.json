{"path":"555759.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a densely organized logistics and transport hub, characterized by vast parking lots and cargo storage areas. The image features multiple sections of rectangular plots filled with neatly arranged rows of colorful shipping containers that vary in hues of blue, red, white, and green. To the right of the image, the containers are significantly organized into larger blocks, some grouped under long roof structures, perhaps to protect them from weather elements. \n\nAdjacent to the area with shipping containers, there are extensive parking lots filled with cars, providing an indication of a high volume of workers or visitors to the area. At the upper left side of the image, there is a race track visible, identifiable by its oval shape and the grandstands adjacent to it.\n\nAlongside, there are buildings that appear to be warehouses or industrial structures with flat roofs; these are likely used for storage or processing goods related to the operations seen. In the far background, multiple aircraft can be glimpsed, indicating the proximity of an airport, further asserting this area as a major transport hub.\n\nThe horizon shows a vast landscape giving a sense of scale to the area, highlighting the massive operations and organizational complexity of this logistics center. The color palette of the photo is dominated by earthy tones contrasted sharply by the colorful man-made elements (containers and vehicles), and the overall impression is one of industrial activity and structured logistics on a large scale.","title":"Elizabeth, New Jersey, port authority.
