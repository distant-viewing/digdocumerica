{"path":"542695.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a river valley surrounded by heavily wooded hillsides. The river meanders through the valley, characterized by its light blue water which contrasts with the surrounding terrain. The banks of the river appear rocky and sparsely vegetated in some areas, providing a stark contrast to the dense, dark green foliage of the trees that cover the hills.\n\nThe terrain is rugged and undulating, with various shades of green suggesting a mix of different types of trees and vegetation. There are no visible buildings or human activities, emphasizing the natural and untouched aspect of the landscape. The topography and the winding course of the river suggest this could be a location favored for activities like hiking or nature photography, although no trails or paths are immediately discernible from this perspective.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken on a day with clear skies, as the landscape is well-illuminated, and the shadows cast are sharp and distinct, suggesting midday or early afternoon. This natural setting exudes a sense of tranquility and isolation, ideal for someone seeking solitude or an escape into nature.","title":"Conservationists & sportsmen claim this area to have some of the best trout fishing in the country.
