{"path":"549000.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a large, prominent metal pipe labeled \"HIGH PRESSURE GAS LINE\" running diagonally across the foreground against a rugged natural landscape. The metal pipe appears smooth and reflective, capturing some of the light and texture of its surroundings. The background is composed of dark, craggy mountains that fill the horizon under a deep blue sky. The terrain is rocky and barren, typical of a desert or arid mountain range. The setting suggests a remote or sparsely populated area, emphasizing the isolation and perhaps the significance of the infrastructure in such a location. The overall composition highlights the contrast between the man-made object and the natural environment, illustrating a theme of industrial intrusion in a natural setting.","title":"Land section of high pressure gas line that crosses the Colorado River","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545615","543170","552432","545997","542528","543759","548932","546402","549118","547571","549204","553902","545827","548843","545949","545167"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["pipe","pressure","intrusion","mountain","significance","metal","gas","desert","range","isolation"]}
