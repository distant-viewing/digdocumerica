{"path":"555043.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a dense, lush forest scene characterized by an array of textures and botanical diversity. At the forefront of the photograph is a rich underbrush, densely packed with verdant, small rounded leaves which seem to be thriving under the shade provided by the towering trees. Bright spots of sunlight filter through the canopy, dotting the forest floor and illuminating patches of the undergrowth in a dappled pattern, enhancing the varying shades of green.\n\nSeveral ferns with their distinct, feather-like leaves can be seen scattered around the area, adding to the variety of flora present. The forest is dominated by tall trees with rugged, moss-covered trunks suggesting a mature, temperate rainforest environment. These trees rise stoutly into the frame, their bark dark and textured, providing a stark contrast to the soft, green carpet below.\n\nIn the middle of the scene, a tree leans diagonally across the frame, possibly fallen or simply growing at an angle. It is heavily draped with moss, emphasizing the moist, possibly humid conditions of the area. The background reveals more of the forest with similar characteristics: more trees standing close together with a somewhat eerie, yet serene quality brought about by the shadows and natural light filtering through their high canopies.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a serene, untouched wilderness, offering a glimpse of a temperate rainforest ecosystem where the interplay of light and shadow, along with the rich biodiversity, creates a peaceful and almost mystical woodland tableau.","title":"Oregon oxalis and western sword fern ground cover in a climax Sitka spruce forest in the Queets River Valley of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545285","555054","554970","554957","555057","555028","554972","555000","554958","554425","554978","545271","554961","555058","546947","554992"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["rainforest","forest","moss","canopy","present","biodiversity","tree","leave","carpet","feather"]}
