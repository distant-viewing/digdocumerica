He is wearing a gray hoodie under a darker gray or navy blue jacket, blue jeans, and brown muck boots. The man is also wearing a baseball cap and is smiling while looking slightly to his left. He appears to be holding a pitchfork partly sunk into a hay bale on muddy ground with scattered straw.\n\nIn the background, there is a large, traditional barn made of red wooden boards with a steep gabled roof. The roof has a small cupola on top. The barn features rows of small square windows on its side and a sliding door that is slightly open. The area surrounding the barn is muddy, suggesting recent rain or damp conditions. The sky is overcast, giving the scene soft, diffuse lighting.","title":"Baling hay in the rain on his farm near Bee, John Dolezal pauses to joke with photographers.
