{"path":"554553.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a woman interacting with a natural water body, possibly a pond or a small lake, in a wooded environment. The woman, who appears to be middle-aged, is squatting by the water's edge. She is dressed casually in a red and white horizontally striped t-shirt and denim shorts. One of her hands seems to be reaching towards the water, while the other supports her weight on rough, wet ground.\n\nThe setting is mostly natural and rustic, with dirt and debris visible near the pond edges, suggesting an undisturbed or wild location. The pond itself has clear greenish water, reflecting its clean, natural surroundings, and there's lush green vegetation closely encircling the water, including shrubs and small bushes that seem to thrive in this moist environment.\n\nHer attention is focused intently on the water, indicating that she may be engaged in an activity like washing, exploring the waterâ€™s contents, or possibly engaged in a moment of personal reflection. The lighting in the scene indicates daytime with natural sunlight filtering through the vegetation, enhancing the vividness of the greenery and the reflective quality of the water.","title":"Local inhabitant tests septic system with packet of Pylam dye and sees it leach into lake, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546335","546223","544345","546320","552026","550242","546316","545286","546347","557755","542739","548956","548291","542556","546338","543468"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["pond","water","washing","weight","squat","encircle","thrive","explore","vividness","t"]}
