{"path":"543743.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an underground mining scene. The primary focus is a heavy-duty mining vehicle equipped with a large mechanical arm, possibly a drill or excavator. The vehicle appears robust with rugged tires, designed for navigating through the harsh and dusty environment of a mine. \n\nA person is seated onboard the vehicle, operating the machinery. The operator wears typical mining gear, including a helmet and reflective clothing to ensure safety under low light conditions. \n\nThe background of the image shows a roughly hewn cave with exposed rock faces, illuminated unevenly. The surrounding area is littered with rocks and debris, suggestive of recent excavation or digging activity.\n\nA striking aspect of the photo is the effect of long exposure on the light sources, which creates bright, streaking lines across the image. These lines likely come from headlights or portable lamps, adding a dynamic and almost ethereal quality to the otherwise dark enclosure. This photographic technique captures the movement and vibrancy often unseen in the stagnant darkness of subterranean work environments.","title":"Time exposure of mining operations","placename":"Colorado Springs (Colo.)","location":"Colorado Springs, Colorado","nn1":["556510","556397","556360","556359","556513","556396","556511","556446","556364","556319","556515","556358","556365","556357","556366","554828"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["mining","cave","vehicle","operator","excavator","enclosure","mine","technique","rock","headlight"]}
