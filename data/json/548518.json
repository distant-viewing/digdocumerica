{"path":"548518.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a leisurely scene at a busy marina filled with various sailboats and yachts docked along wooden piers. In the foreground, a small motorboat is cruising through the waterway, with two occupants onboard. The person driving the boat, a shirtless man, is seated at the rear, handling the boat's controls next to an outboard motor. Next to him, facing forward, is another individual wearing a wide-brimmed, white hat, which suggests they are taking a relaxed role in the excursion.\n\nAmid this serene setting, a prominent white sign mounted on a yacht reads \"SLOW, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR WAKE,\" indicating a caution for boats to reduce speed to minimize the impact of their wake on surrounding boats and the marina's tranquility.\n\nThe atmosphere of the image is one of typical marina life on a clear, sunny day, with the sun casting strong light and causing reflections on the water. The variety of yachts and sailboats, distinguished by their different sizes and builds, adds to the scenic diversity and richness of this maritime environment.","title":"Chesapeake bay marina","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["552028","548515","542912","548525","542871","546388","544130","548736","549407","554659","552050","548078","543545","546935","542902","542904"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["yacht","marina","boat","wake","sailboat","minimize","excursion","caution","cruise","reduce"]}
