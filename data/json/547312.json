{"path":"547312.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of multiple green grass blades partially covered in droplets of water. The blades of grass are arranged diagonally across the image, creating a textured pattern of green lines enhanced by the glossy reflections of the water droplets. These droplets vary in size and are distributed unevenly across the grass surfaces, catching light and adding a dynamic sparkle to the otherwise dark, moody background. The overall lighting is subdued, emphasizing the vivid details of the droplets and the fresh green of the grass. There's a notable sharpness in the foreground where the largest droplets reside, while the rest of the image softly fades into a darker, blurrier background, focusing attention on the foreground elements. The photograph conveys a tranquil natural scene, rich in detail and texture, and evokes a sense of freshness and calmness.","title":"Grasses after spring rain in the farmlands north of Garland","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547287","553853","543565","555184","543564","558077","552485","544884","543852","557499","557442","543629","557592","543562","543560","555044"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["droplet","blade","grass","freshness","sharpness","sparkle","distribute","calmness","detail","catch"]}
