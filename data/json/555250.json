{"path":"555250.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In the photograph, there is a scientist working in a laboratory setting. The person, wearing a white lab coat and glasses, holds a rounded flask filled with a blue liquid, examining it closely. The scientist, who appears to be male based on hairstyle and facial features, is standing beside a large analytical instrument that includes various knobs and dials, suggesting complex functionality. This instrument is mounted on top of a colorful cabinet with drawers in shades of green, yellow, orange, and beige.\n\nThe background is relatively simple, focusing on the functional aspects of a lab environment, such as a white wall and additional nondescript laboratory equipment partially visible. The setting indicates an organized, equipped scientific or research facility, where experiments or analyses are conducted using sophisticated equipment. This setup captures a typical moment in scientific research or laboratory analysis, emphasizing the meticulous attention to detail required in scientific experiments.","title":"An atomic absorption spectrophotometer is used to detect metals (such as arsenic) in pesticide samples by the environmental protection agency at their Mississippi test facility laboratory in bay st.
