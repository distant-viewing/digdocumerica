{"path":"552467.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph portrays an old, weathered wooden door painted in white, although much of the paint has chipped away revealing the bare wood beneath. Two vertical planks appear in the composition, separated by a narrow gap where the door panels come together. On the left side of the door, at eye level, there is a discolored metal sliding bolt lock secured with a rusted padlock.\n\nIn the center of the door, a faded poster is affixed, appearing worn and slightly torn, held in place by four pieces of black tape at its corners. The text on the poster indicates it is an advertisement for a semi-professional motorcycle race event. Words on the poster highlight information about the event, such as the date (\"Saturday, May 12, 1973\"), the time for practices and races, ticket prices for adults and children, and a contact phone number. The location mentioned is the \"Fon du LAC FAIRGROUNDS, Illinois Fairgrounds Grandstand.\"\n\nImagery on the poster includes a stylized drawing of a motorcycle and racer in action. The poster also promises various attractions and experiences like trophies, refreshments, and entertainment, emphasizing that it is a family-friendly event (\"fun for all\"). The overall rustic and weathered aesthetic of the scene provides a sense of age and abandonment.","title":"Announcing a motorcycle race at the fairgrounds in Henry","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552463","552511","545821","554231","550008","543330","549804","552455","554707","557217","554561","543986","547894","556761","558022","549870"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["poster","door","race","motorcycle","event","lock","refreshment","drawing","tape","bolt"]}
