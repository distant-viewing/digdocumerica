{"path":"542614.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a construction scene in a forested area. In the background, there are numerous tall pine trees under a clear blue sky. In the foreground and center of the image, a large bulldozer or crawler is actively engaged on a steep dirt hill. The bulldozer, emitting dark smoke from its stack, appears to be either moving earth or clearing a path.\n\nThe terrain is rough and uneven with various mounds of dirt and rocks scattered throughout the scene. In the forefront of the image, partially cutting through the bottom of the frame, is a large flexible white pipe, possibly for drainage or other construction-related purposes.\n\nThe environment indicates that this is likely a logging operation or a similar activity involving significant alterations to the natural landscape. The setting suggests a remote, wooded location, emphasizing the impact of industrial equipment on natural settings.","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["543105","546950","547000","554544","545665","545652","555608","543114","556456","542624","553619","555601","551947","542948","543760","553624"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["bulldozer","related","drainage","dirt","construction","alteration","clear","mound","logging","pine"]}
