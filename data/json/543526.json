{"path":"543526.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a modern house set in a natural, wooded environment, possibly during late winter or early spring given the presence of snow on the distant mountains. The house has a low-profile design with a flat roof and large, floor-to-ceiling windows which suggest an emphasis on integrating indoor and outdoor spaces. Its exterior walls are paneled with wood, blending organically into the surrounding forest of coniferous trees.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a pond or small body of water reflecting a vibrant green due to aquatic plants, and bordered by rocks and some bare-branched bushes. The terrain around the pond appears rough and natural with scattered vegetation and pine needles, likely a reflection of the untouched natural setting.\n\nThe angle and composition of the photo place the house in the background, highlighting its architectural features and its harmonious relationship with the surrounding landscape. The image contrasts the man-made structure with the rugged natural beauty around it, illustrating a peaceful coexistence.","title":"New house on the lake","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552986","556645","543543","557327","544448","543587","556644","553458","557669","554232","554233","557326","545066","543529","543336","554549"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["pond","house","relationship","needle","coexistence","profile","emphasis","ceiling","winter","spring"]}
