{"path":"543768.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial area set in a vast natural landscape. The main focus is a large industrial facility, which includes several tall structures with visible emissions rising from stacks, suggesting some kind of processing or power plant. There are various roads surrounding the plant, including a prominent highway that curves around the area. Adjacent to the facility there are patches of different land use including agricultural fields, sparse greenery, and forested areas. The plant directly borders a water body, though it is not extensive, more reflective of a river or large stream than a lake.\n\nIn the background, the landscape transitions into rolling hills that stretch far into the horizon under a slightly overcast sky. The photograph captures a mix of developed, industrial, and natural environments coexisting, highlighting the intersection of human activity and nature. The image is taken from a high altitude and includes part of the aircraft or glider structure at the top of the frame, adding a framing component to the overall composition. The photo possesses a slightly dim and cool tone likely due to the time of day or weather conditions at the time it was taken.","title":"Soft coal burning power plant","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["551567","545013","550706","550339","543872","550860","551192","543733","551998","543764","544059","551202","552246","556980","544788","544058"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["plant","facility","aircraft","time","kind","intersection","emission","altitude","stream","stack"]}
