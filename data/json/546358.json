{"path":"546358.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a scientific environment, likely a laboratory focused on marine or environmental sciences, as suggested by the maps of water bodies hung on the wall in the background. A person, visible from behind and to the side, is engaged in conducting an experiment or processing a sample. The individual is wearing a red short-sleeve shirt and is busy handling scientific equipment.\n\nThe workspace is cluttered with various laboratory equipment and tools. Visible apparatus includes a stirring device, large graduated cylinders, several flasks with different colored liquids (one particularly with a reddish liquid), and containers labeled possibly with sample information or chemical names. There is also an electronic device, likely a heating or mixing plate, branded \"CORNING\" with multiple dials, suggesting temperature or speed control.\n\nThe bench the person works on appears worn, covered with scattered papers and small equipment, emphasizing a busy and active research environment. The laboratory setup, combined with the nautical maps, implies analysis related to water quality, maritime studies, or similar fields emphasizing environmental assessments and research.","title":"Mobile lab of the southeast water laboratory in Athens, ga the biologist is preparing a chemical analysis of the industrial waste being used in a static bioassay.
