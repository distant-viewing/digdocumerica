{"path":"555034.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a single white flower set against a softly blurred natural background. This flower, which is in focus, has delicate white petals marked with thin, radial purple or pink lines converging towards the center. These petals are arrayed around a cluster of yellow anthers and a greenish central part, likely the pistil, atop a slender, green stem.\n\nThe stem bears several small, ovate, dark green leaves that appear slightly glossy, suggesting they might be thick or waxy. Below the flower, additional buds are visible along the stem, indicating potential further blooms.\n\nThe background is a diffuse mixture of greens and browns, creating an abstract backdrop with no distinctive shapes or hard outlines, typical of a woodland setting or underbrush. The overall lighting in the photo is soft, suggesting an overcast day or shaded conditions, which helps in reducing the contrasts and gives the flower a gentle, serene look.","title":"Siberian miners lettuce growing in old growth forest in olympic national timberland, Washington.
