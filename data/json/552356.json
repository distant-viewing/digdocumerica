{"path":"552356.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts two men working in a room filled with scientific or technical equipment. The foreground features a man with glasses, wearing a blue sweater over a shirt, who is seated at a desk. He is closely examining or annotating a large paper printout, which appears to be coming from a machine resembling a polygraph or seismograph, indicating it may record data or measurements. The device has various dials and a numerical display ranging from 0 to 100.\n\nIn the background, there's another man, also wearing glasses and casually dressed in a yellow shirt. He is seated at a separate desk positioned behind the first man, absorbed in work that involves scrutinizing papers or perhaps operating another piece of equipment that is mostly obscured from view.\n\nThe setting seems to be an office or laboratory with practical furnishings, including desks and chairs typical of a mid-to-late 20th-century workplace environment. The walls are paneled with wood, and there is a subdued tone of focused, professional activity in the ambiance of the scene.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552377","549367","542665","555334","552386","549610","549378","542659","551905","556557","549627","551900","555233","551904","546285","551594"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["desk","paper","workplace","furnishing","man","datum","measurement","glass","dial","equipment"]}
