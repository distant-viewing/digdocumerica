{"path":"553377.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a pleasant moment of three people—an older woman, a younger woman, and a baby—amid a forest setting. They are on a dirt path that carves through a dense, lush forest marked by tall trees and thick underbrush, giving a sense of tranquility and natural beauty.\n\nThe older woman, positioned on the left, is casually dressed in a light blue button-up shirt and blue pants. Her gray hair is styled in a curly, short fashion. She is engaged with a camera, checking or adjusting it, suggesting a moment of documenting their walk or the natural surroundings.\n\nNext to her, in the center, is a younger woman carrying a baby in a backpack-style carrier. She wears glasses and a horizontally striped shirt with dark sleeves, suggesting practicality and a style that suits an outdoor activity. Her expression is neutral, and she seems focused on her walk or perhaps something out of the frame. \n\nThe baby, securely strapped to her back, is visible over her shoulder, wearing a light blue jacket and a hat, looking curiously towards the camera. The baby’s eyes are wide open, showing intrigue or perhaps a reaction to the camera.\n\nThe backdrop of the path is dappled with sunlight that filters through the trees, creating patterns of light and shadow on the ground, enhancing the serene and peaceful atmosphere of the setting. The overall composition uses natural light to highlight the subjects and the verdant environment they are in, emphasizing an enjoyment of nature and family time.","title":"\"Fern freaks\" follow the shore of the Nissitisset River, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553376","553364","543455","545512","543456","543467","553357","544230","543233","553755","544739","552295","553496","551942","547045","551027"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["baby","walk","woman","camera","intrigue","practicality","reaction","underbrush","path","forest"]}
