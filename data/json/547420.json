{"path":"547420.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, gloomy scene of a cemetery. In the foreground, numerous tombstones varying in size and shape are scattered across a grassy area. The tombstones include both upright markers and flat plaques, some of which are adorned with floral arrangements.\n\nTall pine trees, positioned on the left side of the image, tower over the scene, their dark silhouettes contrasting against the overcast sky. The atmosphere is enhanced by the gray sky, which casts a melancholic light over the entire cemetery, evoking a feeling of solemnity and quiet.\n\nThe cemetery is spread over a gently rolling terrain, giving a sense of depth to the picture. No people are visible, reinforcing the tranquility and desolation often associated with such settings. The background includes a slight rise, where additional tombstones can be seen dotting the landscape, some partially obscured by the distance and gloomy light conditions.","title":"Cemetery of immanuel lutheran church outside garland","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557184","557942","547417","554790","554824","552451","558040","554792","550731","557089","550364","546147","552683","552017","545322","557185"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["tombstone","cemetery","plaque","solemnity","marker","pine","desolation","reinforce","arrangement","associate"]}
