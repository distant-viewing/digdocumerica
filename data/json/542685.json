{"path":"542685.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image features a close-up of a potted plant, particularly focusing on its foliage, which exhibits signs of pest or disease infestation. This plant, which appears to be housed in a small, round black pot, has vibrant green leaves that are substantially covered with white speckled markings. A few leaves show signs of curling or wilting, which might indicate poor health or a response to the infestation.\n\nThe plant is placed on what seems to be a wooden surface, possibly a table or bench, with a vague, indistinct background that suggests an indoor setting or a greenhouse, given the soft-focus view of additional wooden surfaces in the deep background. The setting, combined with the condition of the plant, may suggest a cultivation or a recovery effort to deal with the health of the plant. A narrow wooden stake or marker is barely visible at the back of the pot, potentially used for support or identification purposes. The overall appearance of the photo conveys a natural yet somewhat unkempt botanical environment.","title":"\"Smog-damaged\" petunia at the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["542693","542694","542692","542689","542686","544731","542688","553361","555053","552111","555884","554575","551356","543622","555359","555548"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["plant","pot","health","stake","greenhouse","recovery","identification","response","leave","cultivation"]}
