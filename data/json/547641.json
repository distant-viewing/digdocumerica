{"path":"547641.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph showcases a serene beachside setting with a row of quaint beach houses. These houses feature a traditional architectural style with visible wooden exteriors and pitched roofs. Each house has its unique color; for instance, the closest house is painted red, emphasizing its individuality against the backdrop of similar structures.\n\nThe beach houses have multiple levels, and some possess external staircases leading to upper floors or balconies, from which residents can likely enjoy views of the surrounding beach and ocean. The environment seems well-maintained, with constructed wooden pathways likely serving as walkways over the sandy terrain, facilitating easier access to the beach and preventing disruption to the natural dune grass.\n\nThe foreground of the image reveals a natural beach landscape, covered with sand and dotted with clumps of dune grass bending in the wind. This hints at a coastal ecosystem that is preserved despite human habitation.\n\nIn the background, the ocean is visible, accompanied by a clear sky that blends subtly into the seaâ€™s horizon. Farther along the beach, more houses can be seen, suggesting a continued residential area. This scene evokes a peaceful coastal living ambiance with a touch of rustic charm, providing a blend of natural beauty and human construction that coexists at the edge of the ocean.","title":"Houses on the dune","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547645","547633","547636","553967","547644","549987","547567","543361","543362","545110","553982","557523","543337","547030","543066","553766"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","house","dune","ocean","beachside","instance","possess","clumps","prevent","liive"]}
