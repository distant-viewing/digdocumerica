{"path":"547610.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a sprawling industrial scene focused on a large scrapyard filled with heaps of compressed and mangled metal objects. These objects, which appear to be mostly cars or parts of cars, are densely packed and create an irregular terrain of rusted and variegated metals, reflecting various shades under a cloudy sky.\n\nTo the left side of the image, thereâ€™s a notable presence of a tall crane with its boom extended over the piles, suggesting ongoing work in moving or managing the scrap metal. The crane stands beside a body of water, reflecting the industrial use of rivers or canals for the transport or processing of materials. This water body appears slightly muddy, possibly due to runoff from the scrapyard.\n\nThe background shows a mostly overcast sky with slight breaks allowing for some light. To the right, there are additional visible industrial structures, probably part of the same facility or related operations. These structures are functional, with little to no distinct architectural detail, reinforcing the utilitarian nature of the location.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts an active, large-scale industrial operation involving the collection and processing of scrap metal, emphasizing themes of industry, reuse, and environmental management. The cluttered and gritty feel of the scene is typical of such industrial environments.","title":"Scrap metal yards at Fields Point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547611","545059","547625","546256","554318","542660","546267","547062","546255","547621","554301","548110","557308","554300","548422","553012"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["scrapyard","scrap","metal","crane","processing","runoff","boom","operation","object","canal"]}
