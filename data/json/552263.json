{"path":"552263.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene evening scene by a body of water, likely a river or a lake, with a striking sunset in the background. The horizon is painted with a gradient of deep blues and purples merging into hints of orange near the skyline of a distant city. The skyline is characterized by silhouettes of several buildings and possibly a tower, rendered as dark outlines against the lighter sky. \n\nThe foreground features gently rippling water that reflects the fading light of the sunset, adding a sense of calm and movement. The ripples are more pronounced near the edge, where the water meets a shore, possibly a beach or riverbank, as suggested by some small, indistinct objects that could be rocks or debris at the waterâ€™s edge.\n\nOverall, the composition and the subdued lighting cast a tranquil and somewhat melancholic mood, inviting the viewer to reflect on the quiet end of the day. The silhouette of the skyline adds a touch of intrigue and depth, hinting at the presence of urban life in the distance, yet separated from the peacefulness of the natural setting in the foreground.","title":"Elliott Bay at sunrise.
