{"path":"545737.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic river scene with a group of three rafters navigating the turbulent waters of a brownish river. The rafters are in a large, inflatable, gray raft and are equipped with life jackets. The rafters, two of whom are paddling, are focused on maneuvering through the swift current. The river appears to be in a rugged, natural setting.\n\nThe background shows a rocky terrain with different layers of rock, primarily in reddish and brown hues, indicating possible sedimentary rock formations typical of canyon areas. The landscape is barren with sparse vegetation, including a few shrubs primarily near the river's edge. The sky is clear, suggesting a sunny day, which casts sharp shadows and highlights the rugged textures of the rocks.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the adventurous activity of river rafting within a desolate yet beautiful natural environment.","title":"A river trip into Canyonlands National Park conducted by Tag-A-Long-Tours of Moab.
