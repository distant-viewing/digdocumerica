{"path":"557862.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in an indoor car cleaning or detailing facility. In the center of the image, a conversation involving three individuals takes place alongside a vintage car. Two men and one woman stand beside the open ajar door of a large, polished purple car with a silver top, which appears to be from the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nThe woman, dressed in a white and black patterned dress, stands on the yellow demarcation line on the floor, conversing with two men dressed in casual attire, consisting of shirts and trousers. The men's attire and body language suggest they might be employees or mechanics at the facility.\n\nThe background features a row of car servicing machines or vacuum cleaners placed against the left wall, with various hoses and nozzles attached. To the right of the car, another employee in a light blue shirt and dark trousers observes or waits nearby. The setting is also characterized by industrial elements such as concrete floors, yellow lines indicating lanes or work areas, and fluorescent lighting overhead that casts a bright, even light throughout the facility. The confined indoor space suggests the building is solely dedicated to car servicing tasks.","title":"Unhappy car owner discusses the status of her car which had failed a second inspection at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557860","557918","557850","557861","557906","557921","557864","557865","542763","557885","557900","557905","557874","557927","557915","557891"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["employee","car","facility","trouser","nozzle","floor","demarcation","mechanic","cleaning","language"]}
