{"path":"552902.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This image depicts an expansive landscape viewed from an elevated or aerial perspective. The foreground is dominated by a barren, uneven terrain dotted with sparse vegetation, predominantly in shades of brown and green. Patches of dry, white soil suggest arid conditions, possibly salt flats or sand.\n\nA vast body of water, likely a large lake or sea, stretches across the middle ground, extending into the distance with clear blue tones reflecting the sky. The background is marked by a mountain range spanning the horizon, its ridges appearing somewhat hazy, possibly due to atmospheric conditions such as heat or distance.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph conveys a sense of remote wilderness, captured under bright sunlight that enhances the stark contrasts between the arid land and the body of water.","title":"Fox bay at the south end of Pyramid Lake.
