{"path":"550249.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph portrays an outdoor urban setting that appears to be an alley or back street filled with debris and discarded objects. The ground is paved with bricks, and two African American boys are visible, engaging in playful activities despite the desolate surroundings.\n\nThe boy on the left is energetically running towards the viewer, his expression is lively and he seems to be in mid-stride. He is dressed in a patterned shirt and darker pants. The other boy, on the right, is seated on a bicycle looking more composed. He is wearing a darker, possibly black, outfit that includes a jacket and pants. The bicycle has a large front basket filled with what looks like a white container or box.\n\nAround them, the environment is cluttered with a variety of discarded items including a couch, mattresses, pieces of wood, and general rubble. Behind them, there are urban residential buildings with visible features like stair steps, doors, and windows. The buildings seem aged and weathered, indicating a potentially neglected or economically disadvantaged area. The scene is lit by natural daylight, lending clarity and vividness to the photograph. Despite the background of urban decay, the focus on the playfulness of the children adds a contrasting element of vitality and resilience.","title":"The way home from school -- crumbling sidewalks and piled up trash. 73rd Street Court in inner city.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["556166","555950","547170","556163","545319","545404","551726","550283","544432","552755","551031","553510","553495","545348","556159","553526"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","bicycle","discard","couch","playfulness","vitality","alley","stride","pant","basket"]}
