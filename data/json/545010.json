{"path":"545010.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a birdâ€™s-eye view of a scrapyard overflowing with discarded metal and debris. Central to the scene is a light blue GMC truck that is surrounded by a mass of compressed cars and various metal scraps. The vehicles around the truck are mostly flattened and stacked, with visible rust and paint degradation suggesting they have been exposed to the elements for a considerable time. Various bits of debris such as worn-out tires, bits of metal, wooden planks, and some foliage can be seen interspersed among the crushed vehicles, contributing to the chaotic and dilapidated state of the area. The setting implies an industrial or outskirts-of-town type of location, primarily focused on the recycling or disposal of vehicles and industrial waste. The dominance of cool tones through the blues, greys, and rusty browns suggests a cold, metallic atmosphere typical of a junkyard. The image captures the bleak and discarded essence of the area, emphasizing themes of waste, decay, and the lifecycle of man-made products.","title":"Zidell ship-wrecking yard","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["542590","546267","554357","542656","552740","554320","545365","549023","546249","554301","542585","555492","547611","547621","554300","542660"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["bit","waste","lifecycle","metal","dominance","truck","vehicle","junkyard","scrapyard","mass"]}
