{"path":"543085.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph presents an expansive aerial view of a coastline, possibly captured during late evening or twilight given the subdued lighting and atmospheric conditions. The coastline stretches horizontally across the image, delineating the boundary between the ocean and land.\n\nTo the left, steep cliffs dominate the frame, casting shadows over the narrow beaches below. The texture of the cliffs appears rugged and uneven, suggesting they might be composed of layered rock formations. Above these cliffs, the terrain rises gently and is covered in what appears to be dense forest or vegetation, shrouded partially by mist or low-lying clouds.\n\nThe central and right sections of the image show a wide beach that spans the length of the photograph. The beach appears deserted with no visible human activity or structures, maintaining a raw, natural state. Details such as small waves breaking gently on the shore and patterns in the sand from water flow or wind are visible, enhancing the scene's tranquil and untouched appearance.\n\nThe ocean, occupying the top right corner of the image, merges with the horizon in a hazy, seamless transition. The water exhibits variations in surface texture and color, possibly indicating differing depths or seabed features.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a serene and somewhat solemn mood, highlighting the vast, uninterrupted natural beauty of the coastline and the interplay of light and shadow. The perspective offered by the aerial view emphasizes the grand scale and isolation of the landscape.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543300","543051","543328","543090","553910","557508","543045","545934","545222","543424","545226","543080","543061","545125","543435","554023"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["coastline","cliff","beach","ocean","differ","delineate","shroud","merge","variation","boundary"]}
