{"path":"552659.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant parade scene, likely from a community or town event. In the foreground, a vintage red Ford truck is featured prominently, and a sign on the truck's side indicates \"Queen Candidate Katrina Larson.\" Atop the truck's cab, a woman, presumably Katrina Larson, is seated with her legs crossed, showcasing a casual yet cheerful demeanor, dressed in a dark sweater, light-colored pants, and dark loafers.\n\nThe background of the image is bustling with activity and people. A dense crowd of spectators lines the street, watching the parade. The adults and children show varied reactions; some are clapping and smiling, while others are engaged in conversation or watching attentively. The man closest to the truck, who appears to be a parade official or organizer, is wearing a beige outfit with a badge, indicating his role in the event.\n\nThe setting reveals a small-town atmosphere, with vintage storefronts and signs visible in the background, including one that reads \"Texan Cafe,\" hinting at a southern or southwestern American location. The scene is bathed in bright sunlight, contributing to a lively and festive mood typical of such community celebrations.","title":"Labor Day weekend brings the annual Garfield County Fair parade.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552660","552657","546991","557715","557712","557045","557710","552653","557709","557714","549572","556274","552654","557716","557711","549566"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["parade","truck","town","official","reaction","event","cab","community","storefront","badge"]}
