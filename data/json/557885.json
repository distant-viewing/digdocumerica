{"path":"557885.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph is set in a car service station, likely captured during the mid-to-late 20th century going by the style of the cars and the clothing of the people. The scene is indoors within a large, open garage area lined with multiple service bays. There are dynamic red and silver mechanical elements, possibly car lifts with red spherical accents that look like they might be part of the lifting apparatus or serve as indicators.\n\nThe main focus is on two vintage cars; one is clearly visible in the foreground being serviced by an individual, and the other is partially in the frame at another bay. The car in the foreground is a dark colored sedan, possibly an American make, suggested by its distinctive square body and chrome detailing. A mechanic in a white shirt and dark pants is bent over, appearing to work on one of the car's front wheels.\n\nIn the background, another individual, also in dark pants and a lighter top, is standing near the car, observing the mechanicâ€™s work or possibly waiting for his turn. The environment includes bright daylight coming from outside, indicating large open doors or windows on the side of the building. The floor of the station is marked with different colored lines for safety or organizational purposes.\n\nThe overall aesthetic, signage, and structure of the station suggest a functional, efficient workspace typical of the period, with a focus on automotive maintenance and customer service. The station is orderly, with necessary tools and equipment likely placed just out of view but within easy reach of the service professionals. The overall environment looks busy and industrious, emphasizing a typical day at an automotive service station in that era.","title":"Interior of an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
