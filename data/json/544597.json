{"path":"544597.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene at dusk, featuring a beautifully silhouetted natural environment. In the foreground, there is a dense thicket of trees and shrubbery extending across the frame, atop which several birds are perched, visible as dark silhouettes against the dimming sky. Above these perched birds, numerous other birds can be seen in flight, forming a scattered group as they soar across the sky.\n\nThe background consists of a vibrant evening sky painted in gradients of orange and deep red hues, suggesting that the sun has recently set. This colorful backdrop subtly transitions into darker shades at the top, reinforcing the tranquil and slightly somber ambiance of twilight. There appears to be a reflective water body at the bottom edge of the photograph, which hints at a calm lake or river that complements the sky with its subtle reflections.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the contrast between the dark silhouettes and the vivid sky to emphasize a peaceful close to the day in a natural setting, capturing a moment of collective motion among the birds as they settle for the night or continue their migration.","title":"Chokoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Mexico, Gulf of","location":"Mexico, Gulf of","nn1":["544601","553875","544609","544612","553776","550888","550382","555013","554646","543062","542992","544605","554731","547744","543063","551379"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","perch","soar","thicket","dim","settle","silhouette","shrubbery","flight","night"]}
