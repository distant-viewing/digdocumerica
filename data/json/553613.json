{"path":"553613.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows a scene of manual labor in a wooded environment. A man is actively engaged in splitting a log using a splitting maul. He is positioned at the center of the frame, bent over the large log that lies horizontally in front of him. His attire consists of a sleeveless top and jeans, complemented by a protective helmet with a face shield, indicating a focus on safety while undertaking this physically demanding task.\n\nThe setting is a forested area with numerous cut logs and tree stumps surrounding him, suggesting that this location is used for logging or similar forestry activities. The ground is covered in dirt and is uneven, filled with debris from the trees. In the background, partially blurred trees hint at the dense forest environment, reinforcing the rugged, natural setting of the activity.\n\nThe image has a slightly blurred quality, especially noticeable in the movement of the man and the maul, emphasizing the action and the physical effort involved in splitting the log. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of hard work in a solitary, rustic setting.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora.
