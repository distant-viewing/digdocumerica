{"path":"546296.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scientific or laboratory scene. A man, perhaps a scientist or researcher, is closely observing a row of conical flasks placed on a bench. Each of these flasks contains a yellowish liquid, and the openings of the flasks are covered with white, fluffy material, possibly cotton wool to prevent contamination. The flasks are labeled with handwritten text, which seems to include dates and possibly names or chemical notations, though the exact content is not clearly visible.\n\nThe man is wearing rectangular eyeglasses and has medium-length hair combed to the side. He appears focused and attentive to his work, closely examining one of the flasks in particular. He holds the flask gently with his left hand, possibly assessing the progress of whatever reaction or process is occurring inside.\n\nThe composition of the photo places the flasks in the foreground, while the man's face and upper body form the midground, creating a sense of depth. The background is softly blurred, ensuring the focus remains on the man and the flasks. Overall, the image conveys a moment of scientific inquiry or experimentation, highlighting the meticulous and careful nature of laboratory work.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Terry Hollister, fishery biologist, studied flasks containing marine algae and pesticides.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543801","546284","555281","543834","549333","546277","542666","549605","546287","546278","549604","555251","555250","549608","545002","549612"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["flask","laboratory","inquiry","researcher","experimentation","wool","reaction","eyeglass","scientist","date"]}
