{"path":"547223.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene featuring heavy machinery and steel structures under a sky filled with sparse clouds. The dominant feature is a large crane prominently displayed against the sky. The crane's lattice boom towers above, contributing a sense of vertical grandeur to the image. Leading up to the crane are multiple beams that appear to be part of either a bridge or an overhead structure, which diagonally crosses the frame, enveloping the crane and adding depth to the composition.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, construction or maintenance work is visible, characterized by workers on the beams. This inclusion illustrates the scale and human element within the industrial setting. The machinery, steel structures, and workers are silhouetted against a light sky, making their outlines stark and dramatic. \n\nThe lower right corner contains industrial architecture, possibly part of the crane's base or an adjacent building. Labels and marks can be seen on the surface, including one that reads \"700-T,\" likely referring to a weight or model indication of the equipment or capacity.\n\nThe lighting in this image is moody and evocative, with the majority of the scene darkened against the brighter sky, highlighting the structural and mechanical elements majestically. The play of light and shadow creates a strong contrast, emphasizing the industrial theme.","title":"Workmen fit girder on new span over the Shirley Highway","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547615","550874","544127","544109","553027","550907","555269","548559","555273","555285","554435","544157","544378","544131","547113","546030"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["crane","steel","beam","worker","capacity","machinery","weight","lattice","indication","inclusion"]}
