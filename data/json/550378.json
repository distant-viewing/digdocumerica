{"path":"550378.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph features two large reindeer engaged in a bout, possibly a display of dominance or competition for mating rights. These majestic animals are closely interlocked by their impressive antlers, which are large, branched, and appear quite robust. Each reindeer is pushing against the other in a grassy field.\n\nThe setting is a natural, outdoor environment with a field of green grass, subtly illuminated by what seems to be either early morning or late afternoon sunlight, casting a somewhat dimmed, natural lighting over the scene. The focus and depth of field highlight the reindeer, making them the clear subject of the photo, with a slightly blurred background that hints at a vast, open landscape.\n\nThe coloring of the image leans towards darker tones, especially in the animals' fur, which ranges from dark brown to patches of gray. The overall mood conveyed by the colors and the interaction of the animals is one of raw, natural intensity.","title":"Caribou feed near the sagavanirktok river.
