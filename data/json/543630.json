{"path":"543630.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up view of a white, fluffy dog thoroughy engaged in sniffing something while standing in shallow water. The dog, appearing to be a large breed possibly similar to a Great Pyrenees, has a dense, predominantly white coat, with hints of dirt on its fur, suggesting active, outdoor exploration. Its snout is submerged in the water, indicating a high level of curiosity or interest in whatever it has found.\n\nThe water in which the dog is standing is dark and clear enough to lightly reflect some of the dog's underbody and legs. The surface of the water around the dog's feet is disturbed, with small ripples and some splashes, most likely caused by the dogâ€™s movements.\n\nThe background of the image is quite uniform, being overall dark which contrasts starkly against the brightness of the dog's fur, emphasizing the subject. There's no discernible texture or objects in the distance, ensuring all focus remains on the dog and its actions. The overall lighting in the setting is somewhat dim, possibly suggesting the image was taken during twilight hours or under overcast conditions.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["551516","543261","546382","548307","542874","554627","547148","547059","553348","553089","548305","549928","549954","549716","543519","550756"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["dog","fur","breed","dark","foot","curiosity","water","splash","brightness","hour"]}
