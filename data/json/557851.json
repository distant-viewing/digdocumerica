{"path":"557851.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph contains a mysterious and dimly lit interior setting, featuring a focus on advanced technical equipment along with a subtle human presence. On the right side of the image are two large pieces of machinery, each labeled \"Sun Infra-Red.\" These devices, identified as exhaust performance analyzers, are equipped with multiple round gauges with needles, presented in a red, black, and white color scheme. The gauges are arranged symmetrically on each piece, presumably to monitor and analyze vehicle emissions or engine performance.\n\nThe general ambiance is industrial, hinted by the presence of these technical diagnostic tools. The backdrop has a dark greenish hue and appears to be a solid wall, reinforcing the industrial atmosphere. This setting suggests a workspace, likely a garage or a specialized vehicle maintenance facility.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left side of the frame, part of a person's silhouette is visible. The silhouette is out of focus and only a portion of the profile (presumed to be the back of the head and shoulder) is shown. The presence of the person adds a layer of human interaction with the technology, hinting at an ongoing activity or inspection involving the machines.\n\nOverall, the composition makes use of a dramatic perspective with a deep focus on the equipment while utilizing the human element to enhance the mysterious and professional mood of the photo. The lighting, dark and with specific emphasis on the machines, adds to the intensity and focus of the scene.","title":"Driver of this 1975 van watched as his vehicle failed the carbon monoxide portion of the test at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio. Since January, 1975, all light duty, spark ignition powered vehicles in all of Hamilton County must be tested on an annual basis. If his vehicle had also failed the hydrocarbon emissions test, a second light would have glowed on the exhaust analyzer. The owner has 30 days to repair his vehicle and have it retested.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557859","557829","552382","557857","555332","542765","549364","553329","555330","549692","549684","549367","546344","544818","549627","555374"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["gauge","performance","machine","focus","exhaust","silhouette","piece","presence","inspection","equipment"]}
