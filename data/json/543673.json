{"path":"543673.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image provides an aerial view of a striking landscape, likely captured from an aircraft. The photograph focuses on a series of large, terraced earthworks that dominate the foreground. These terraces appear to be methodically carved into a layered, sedimentary hill which reveals a mixture of dark and light striations, emphasizing their geometric precision and scale.\n\nThe terrain around the terraced hill is mostly dry and barren, with sparse vegetation. A twisting river or canal cuts through the scene, reflecting light and contrasting sharply with the dark, rugged textures of the landscape. Adjacent to the river, a road snakes along, partially tracing its route, and extending towards the horizon.\n\nAt the middle right of the image, the landscape transitions into a more cultivated area with patches of agricultural fields. These fields are greener and are segmented by what seems to be fencing, suggesting some human habitation and land use. There are a few small structures and possibly vehicles near these fields, indicating some degree of rural activity.\n\nThe background merges into a distant landscape of rolling hills and open spaces, hinting at a vast and minimally developed region. The lighting in the photograph casts shadows that accentuate the topographical contours, and adds a dramatic effect to the already rugged and imposing natural scenery.","title":"Peabody Coal Company strip mine","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543868","549175","553050","549170","545626","544063","547724","545329","554164","552548","552560","555873","555594","557548","555845","555863"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["field","hill","terrace","striation","degree","precision","snake","cut","canal","aircraft"]}
