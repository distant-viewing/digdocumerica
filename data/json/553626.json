{"path":"553626.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a somber and melancholic scene following a forest fire. The forest landscape shown reveals a large number of trees that have been burned, with most trees stripped of their foliage and showing blackened, charred trunks. Many of these trees are standing upright, but quite a few have also fallen over, likely weakened from the fire damage.\n\nThe ground is covered with a layer of ash and debris, and little to no undergrowth is visible, indicating the intensity of the fire which destroyed the lower vegetation layers. No greenery is apparent in the photo, reinforcing the impact of the fire on the area.\n\nThe lighting and colors in the image are subdued, featuring mostly dark and gray tones that contribute to the grim atmosphere of the aftermath of a forest fire. There are no human figures or animals in the photo, emphasizing the desolation and absence of immediate life. The background continues with more of the same burnt forest, and no structures or water bodies are visible in the immediate area, suggesting this might be a remote or natural forest region. The sky is not clearly visible, but the overall light suggests either an overcast day or smoke haze remaining in the air.\n\nThis scene captures the destructive aftermath of a forest fire, highlighting environmental loss and the resilience needed for a natural recovery process to begin.","title":"In August 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora, California. Salvage operations on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly. Cut logs in burn area. Foresters estimate that 90 percent of lumber can be salvaged if harvested before insects further weaken the fire-damaged trees.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["555113","553571","555159","555202","553561","542598","555162","542819","553583","555088","553572","546065","555230","545264","548590","555157"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["fire","forest","burn","aftermath","char","ash","destroy","blacken","loss","recovery"]}
