{"path":"549461.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and scenic river setting. The river winds gently and has a dark blue hue, indicating possibly deep or swift waters. There are multiple rafts, each occupied by several individuals, navigating a relatively calm section of the river. These rafts seem colorful and are filled with people wearing life vests, suggesting a group recreational activity such as rafting or river touring.\n\nThe riverbanks are lush and steep, with the right bank visible in the image showing a slope covered in dry grass and scattered rocks. The slope is interspersed with shrubs and small bushes, adding a touch of greenery, which contrasts with the blue and grey tones of the river. The shoreline is rocky, and it appears there are small white rocks at the water’s edge, likely worn smooth by the water’s constant flow.\n\nThe overall setting suggests a remote or natural area, ideal for outdoor activities and untouched by urban development, providing a serene escape into nature. The focus on the rafting activity, combined with the natural landscape, evokes a sense of adventure and relaxation.","title":"Boaters on a trip through hells canyon pause for a rest on a quiet stretch of the snake river","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["549460","545745","549441","545737","544925","545744","545733","549447","545933","544749","549532","545741","545729","545941","550988","545908"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["rafting","raft","river","slope","escape","rock","vest","ideal","navigat","relaxation"]}
