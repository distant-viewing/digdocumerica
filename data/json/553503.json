{"path":"553503.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph depicts a woman standing in the doorway of a building. She appears to be of middle age and has a slightly concerned or pensive expression. The woman is dressed in a horizontally striped, short-sleeved shirt and navy blue pants. The shirt has a zipper partially down the front, adding detail to its simple design.\n\nThe doorway in which she stands is framed by worn and slightly damaged brick walls that convey a sense of age and possibly neglect. The door itself is wooden and vintage, with a handle visible and half open, suggesting the woman might be either entering or leaving, or perhaps pausing to look out.\n\nThe lighting is soft and natural, indicating the photo was likely taken during the day. Overall, the image has a candid, unposed quality, capturing a moment in the womanâ€™s daily life within a rustic or historically aged setting. The elements combine to provide a strong sense of place and character.","title":"Residents of mulky square, a low-income neighborhood on the city's west side, face large scale displacement by a new interstate highway (i-635).
