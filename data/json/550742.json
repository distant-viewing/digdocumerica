{"path":"550742.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a tumultuous river scene, characterized by heavy and rapid water flow. The river is swollen, possibly due to recent rainfall or snowmelt, creating turbulent and foamy water that covers most of the image. Prominent in the foreground are large, rounded boulders, partially submerged by the rushing water, indicating the force and height of the river's current flow.\n\nThe background features a dense line of trees consisting mostly of conifers, suggesting a forested, possibly remote location. The sky overhead appears overcast, contributing to the somber and moody atmosphere of the scene, with no sunlight penetrating the clouds, resulting in muted, cool tones throughout the photograph.\n\nThe overall composition highlights the raw power of nature and the river's overwhelming force at this moment, emphasizing the dynamic and untamed aspect of natural landscapes. No human presence or human-made objects are visible, reinforcing the natural and wild setting of the scene.","title":"Androscoggin river, below the bridge at north leeds","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["553416","549550","542743","553855","550698","544856","550658","550367","549442","553420","548156","542537","553653","544871","553136","549482"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["force","river","flow","penetrate","reound","objects","result","rainfall","boulder","conifer"]}
