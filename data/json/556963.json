{"path":"556963.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene rural landscape during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the warm lighting and long shadows. The focal point of the image is a group of rustic farm buildings situated in a sprawling field.\n\nThe composition includes three main structures, all traditional in design with pitched roofs and wooden facades. The building closest to the left of the frame is a large barn with visible sliding doors and a few windows. It's painted in a faded red color with white trim around the doors and windows. Adjacent to this main barn is a smaller building, similar in style but painted white, which might serve as additional storage or a stable.\n\nTo the right of the frame, at a slight distance from the first two buildings, is another large barn identical in design and color to the first, suggesting they might be part of the same farmstead. This barn is also flanked by smaller, similarly styled buildings. One of these annex buildings, visible in the background next to the second barn, features a second story, potentially used for hay or equipment storage.\n\nThe background consists of gently rolling hills partially covered by trees that are likely entering the early stages of fall foliage, yielding a palette of green and brown tones. A fence line can be spotted running beside the barns, likely used for corralling livestock.\n\nThe entire scene is set against a lush field of tall, wild grass, which is overgrown and varies in color from deep amber to golden brown, adding to the pastoral feel of the landscape. The colors in the photograph, combined with the soft, diffuse light, invoke a calm and timeless rural charm.\n\nNo people are visible in the scene, which emphasizes the tranquility and the natural beauty of this rural environment.","title":"Fields and barns adjacent to Luoto Road and near naval installations.
