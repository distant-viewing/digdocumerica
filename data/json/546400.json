{"path":"546400.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene that juxtaposes urban development and abandonment. Central to the image is a large, unfinished building that stands tall with its exposed skeletal concrete panels and visible scaffolding. The structure, which appears to be a high-rise possibly intended for residential or commercial use, dominates the sky as the most imposing figure in the photo.\n\nIn the foreground, the viewer's attention is drawn to a derelict blue car. The vehicle is heavily damaged, with its front hood crumpled, revealing the engine beneath, and the entire vehicle propped up on blocks, suggesting it has been abandoned for some time. Empty spaces indicate missing parts, while rust and dirt cover the car, further emphasizing its neglected state.\n\nThe setting around these two main elements consists of a dusty, unpaved road that curves slightly around the car and leads towards the building. This gives a sense of linkage between the forgotten and the in-progress. To the left, a rugged, rocky mound partially covered with sparse grass separates the road from the backdrop, giving a slightly wild, untamed edge to the urban environment.\n\nThe colors in the image are quite vivid, with the bright sky providing a stark contrast to the earth tones of the construction site and the vivid blue of the car. This photograph evokes themes of urban decay, the passage of time, and perhaps the socio-economic contrasts within a city.","title":"New high rise apartments on southern outskirt of the city","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["547917","547587","552043","547921","549958","553470","552997","553007","553557","552044","553555","557283","554302","547914","550279","549638"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","derelict","emphasizing","prop","crumple","scaffolding","beneath","dusty","intend","hood"]}
