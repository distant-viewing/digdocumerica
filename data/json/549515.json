{"path":"549515.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic riverscape, likely depicting a section of a large river where the water features swift currents and noticeable whirlpools. The vantage point is from a high position, looking down upon the scene.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a derelict industrial structure with prominent tall, cylindrical structures that might be chimneys or silos. This structure is partially covered by lush green foliage and is situated on a cliff overlooking the river. This combination of industrial decay with the natural environment creates a dramatic contrast.\n\nThe river itself curves around the base of this cliff, flowing from the background towards the foreground. The water has a turbulent appearance with swirling patterns indicative of strong currents.\n\nAt the far background, on both sides of the river, are heavily wooded riverbanks that rise steeply from the water. Landmarks visible in the distance include modern structures such as tall towers, one with a spherical topâ€”likely observational or telecommunication towers.\n\nThe sky above is overcast, contributing to a moody and somewhat gloomy ambiance. This landscape suggests a blend of natural beauty and human industrial history, possibly indicating the environmental impact of human activities on natural sites.","title":"Waste water from City of Niagara Falls sewage treatment plant flows into the Niagara River from a discharge point below the falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549514","548061","550710","553393","553462","550673","549482","552441","547242","550367","548098","547238","552213","557233","551519","550366"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["current","river","cliff","telecommunication","riverscape","tower","landmark","silo","history","structure"]}
