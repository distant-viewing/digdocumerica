{"path":"551536.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This image features a tranquil river scene framed by leafy tree branches in the foreground. The river appears slightly rippled, reflecting a gentle flow, and occupies the majority of the lower portion of the photograph. On the far side of the river, a sandy bank is visible with sparse vegetation. Closer to the left side of the frame, what appears to be a low concrete structure or bridge extends partially into the river.\n\nThe background includes more dense greenery, and a variety of trees are visible, giving a remote, lush appearance to the setting. Structures that might be small houses or sheds can be glimpsed through the trees in the distance, hinting at a nearby settlement. Overhead, the sky is clear and brightly lit, suggesting a sunny day, which enhances the overall serene mood of the image. The photo composition uses natural framing with the tree branches encroaching into the view, focusing attention on the peaceful river and the natural landscape beyond.","title":"Sunken barges are located on Upper Mississippi River chart at mile 858 1/2 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: chart #160)","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["545861","550656","550839","557996","552953","542523","557106","550845","551348","550782","557250","542653","557485","557239","546171","555075"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","branch","majority","settlement","tree","shed","framing","flow","bank","portion"]}
