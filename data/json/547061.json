{"path":"547061.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial maritime scene. In the foreground, there is a body of water with a small boat speeding along, creating a wake behind it. The boat appears to be a tugboat based on its compact size and robust design.\n\nIn the middle ground, a much larger freight ship is anchored. It has a high superstructure including a bridge and possibly some communication or navigational equipment on the top. The ship has multiple visible decks, and its hull is painted in a contrasting color at the waterline, typically a hallmark of many sea-going vessels.\n\nIn the background, a bridge spans across the water. This bridge has an arched, modern design with supports that rise above the roadway, and it features street lamps along its length. There are round structures with domed tops, possibly control rooms or decorative elements, part of the bridge's architecture. A bird can be seen flying in the distance near the bridge, adding a touch of natural life to the industrial setting.\n\nThe overall color tone of the image suggests it could be either early morning or late evening, providing a soft, somewhat dim lighting that mutes the colors. The environment and the structures depicted suggest a busy, working waterfront area, likely in an urban setting.","title":"Universal Cement (division of U.S. Steel) and N.
