{"path":"542501.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and dynamic scene featuring an aircraft in action during what appears to be dusk. The aircraft, a small, propeller-driven biplane, is angled sharply towards the left in a steep, acrobatic dive. A pronounced trail of white smoke emits from the aircraft, enhancing its motion and adding a dramatic effect against the evening sky. This smoke trail curves elegantly in the air as the plane performs its maneuver.\n\nThe background is marked by a softly fading sky, transitioning in color from a rich blue at the top to warm orange and yellow hues near the horizon, suggesting that the time is either sunrise or sunset. Silhouetted against this colorful sky are various elements typical of a rural landscape, including sparsely spaced utility poles, and a few trees. The horizon is lined with more trees and a few structures, possibly farm buildings, which are also in silhouette due to the backlighting of the setting or rising sun. The entire scene is imbued with a serene yet energetic ambiance, given the calm environment and the dynamic action of the aircraft.","title":"Sulfur-dusting of grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542500","549072","542496","553873","548884","542506","542793","548883","542717","548841","548215","542718","548881","544491","542719","542502"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["aircraft","trail","action","biplane","dive","propeller","smoke","backlighting","plane","sunrise"]}
