{"path":"543677.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene featuring two young boys near a flowing stream. The setting is natural and appears to be a wooded area, possibly a picnic or camping site given the presence of a wooden table on the left side of the frame.\n\nOne of the boys is standing in the foreground, seen from behind. He is very lightly dressed, wearing only a diaper, and holding a yellow toy truck in his left hand. He has curly blond hair and is looking towards the other boy.\n\nThe second boy is positioned slightly ahead and to the left of the first boy, also viewed from behind. He is similarly lightly clothed, wearing a blue and white patterned short. His hair is also blond and curly, suggesting they may be siblings or close in age. He appears to be looking at something to his left, outside the frame, possibly an adult or another part of the site.\n\nThe background prominently features a sparkling stream with patches of sunlight highlighting the movement of the water. Thereâ€™s a sense of tranquility and a warm, sunlit day by the texture and quality of the light in the photograph. The ground is covered with dirt and some grass patches, typical of a riverbank or a forest clearing.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a serene, candid moment of childhood play and exploration in a natural setting, underlining a sense of freedom and curiosity. The arrangement of subjects and their engagement with the surroundings provides a narrative of youthful adventure and casual outdoor activity.","title":"Children on camping trip","placename":"Boulder (Colo.)","location":"Boulder, Colorado","nn1":["547692","553430","551544","547727","544352","553431","543685","553435","544221","551857","545539","551159","551032","550830","543466","544200"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["boy","stream","toy","site","freedom","picnic","hair","childhood","camping","curiosity"]}
