{"path":"553193.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant nighttime scene in an urban park setting. People are scattered throughout the space, some standing in groups conversing, while others are seated around the periphery. The image is illuminated mostly by ambient streetlighting and possibly lights from nearby buildings, casting a warm glow over the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a group of three individuals engaged in a conversation. Two women and one man, the latter dressed in a short-sleeved shirt and slacks. One woman is wearing a long, patterned dress and the other is in a light-colored outfit. Their attire suggests a casual gathering or social outing.\n\nThe background features trees that are lush and green, suggesting it could be late spring or summer. The trees are lit from beneath, highlighting their leaves and branches against the darker sky. Various people can be seen in the background, some standing and some sitting on raised circular planters that double as seating. The setting looks peaceful yet lively, typical of a pleasant evening in a city park.\n\nThe ground surface has a patterned design, adding texture to the overall scene. The composition of this photograph, with its focus on both the individuals in front and the ambient activity in back, gives a sense of the social atmosphere of the place. It conveys a moment of leisure and community in an urban environment.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: Saturday night rendezvous.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["550074","550075","555947","553194","553260","551713","550302","552036","553259","551771","553065","553298","550076","550051","556296","548568"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["park","planter","periphery","slack","standing","seating","group","outing","woman","spring"]}
