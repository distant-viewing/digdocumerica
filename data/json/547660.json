{"path":"547660.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a coastal scene characterized by a rugged, natural environment. The focus of the image is a trail or pathway covered with a large amount of dark, wet-looking seaweed and organic debris stretching along the shoreline. To the left side of the path, there is a blend of grassy terrain and barren ground leading up to the water's edge. A sizable, weathered log lies across the path, adding to the untamed character of the scene.\n\nThe background includes calm water, hinting at an ocean or large lake setting, and just beyond the water, the contours of rocky outcrops can be seen faintly due to the mist or haze in the air, suggesting a chilly or damp climate. The light in the photograph is soft and diffuse, possibly indicating an overcast day, which contributes to the somber tones and the wet appearance of the materials in the scene. Overall, the mood is quiet and a bit desolate, capturing a natural and undeveloped coastal environment.","title":"Oil spill from tanker in Narragansett Bay","placename":"Warwick (R.I.)","location":"Warwick, Rhode Island","nn1":["542884","545294","547602","542887","550345","542889","543134","543078","543090","543153","542886","554774","549353","543292","545095","543186"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["path","seaweed","outcrop","trail","amount","contour","character","bit","log","pathway"]}
