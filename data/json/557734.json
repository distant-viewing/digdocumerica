In the foreground, there is a significant amount of trash scattered across the soil. The waste includes various items such as paper, plastic bottles, and cans, suggesting human negligence and littering in a natural area.\n\nIn the midst of this scene, a person is engaged in fishing in the background. This individual, dressed in light-colored pants and a darker top, stands in a shallow river casting a fishing rod. The river flows gently and is bordered by a rocky riverbank on one side and lush greenery on the other.\n\nThe surrounding area is richly forested with dense, green trees which create a vibrant backdrop. The natural beauty of the setting emphasizes the discord brought about by the foreground litter, highlighting a narrative of environmental pollution juxtaposed with human recreation and the natural landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements in the image underscore a critical commentary on environmental issues while illustrating a serene, yet marred, natural setting.","title":"Pipeline construction for the first sewage treatment system for helen.
