{"path":"547125.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This is a photograph featuring a young girl engaging with a high-power telescope labeled for public use. She is peering into the eyepiece of the telescope with an expression of curiosity and fascination. The young girl has mid-length brown hair and is wearing a dark blue winter coat with a patterned design on its sleeves, and a bright red knitted hat with a colorful pom-pom on top. The telescope is mounted on a grey structure and has a utilitarian appearance.\n\nThe background is washed out, primarily consisting of a dull, possibly overcast sky which suggests a cold or misty day, contributing to the need for warm attire. The setting is likely in a public space where such telescopes are typically found, such as parks or scenic viewpoints for observing distant landscapes or cityscapes. Clearly, the focus of the image is on the young girl and her interaction with the telescope, capturing a moment of wonder or discovery.","title":"Looking out at the Ludington Consumer Power Plant on Lake Michigan","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547070","547124","546835","543494","543740","557179","543495","553592","552943","543180","552941","551766","548119","542677","543979","555398"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["girl","discovery","wonder","peer","wash","need","curiosity","viewpoint","find","length"]}
