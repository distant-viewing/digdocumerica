{"path":"553182.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures a gathering of four men engaged in a conversation outdoors during daylight. The men are dressed in business attire, which includes suits and ties, suggesting a formal or professional setting. The man facing the camera wears glasses and a tie with a geometric pattern, and he is smiling, actively involved in the conversation.\n\nThe man directly facing him, partially visible from the back, wears a jacket with a patterned design, and he seems to be the central figure in the conversation based on his body orientation. To the left, another man is visible in profile, his face expressing engagement as he listens or speaks.\n\nThe background of the scene is dark and slightly out of focus, indicating that the photograph was taken with a focus on the subjects, allowing the background to recede and enhancing the emphasis on the groupâ€™s interaction.\n\nThe ambient lighting and shadows suggest that this photo was taken in a well-lit outdoor setting, possibly in a courtyard or near a business venue, during midday when the sun is strong, casting sharp shadows and creating a contrast of light and dark on the subjects' faces and clothing.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["549908","551853","557856","553189","553167","547443","557030","542562","557145","545672","551854","542607","551459","556731","554026","557727"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Groups Of People"],"terms":["conversation","tie","business","man","courtyard","subject","face","orientation","venue","midday"]}
