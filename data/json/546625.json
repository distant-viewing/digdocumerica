{"path":"546625.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image provides an aerial view of a river winding through a landscape, captured during either dawn or dusk as indicated by the dim lighting and shadowed areas. The river meanders gracefully through the scene, bordered by dense patches of trees that show dark against the water. Two bridges span the river: one closer to the viewer appears to be a road bridge with multiple arches, while the further one, also likely a transportation bridge, connects two land masses. Notable on the river is a large, brightly illuminated, oval-shaped structure on an island, which sharply contrasts with the dark surroundingsâ€”highlighting its unique architectural features.\n\nThe sky above the river is dramatic, filled with clouds that are lit from above in hues of white and gray, possibly hinting at a setting or rising sun out of frame. There are also birds flying, visible as small silhouettes against the bright patches of the sky. The foreground displays the tops of buildings, suggesting a densely populated area adjoining the riverbank, which fades into darkness towards the edges of the image. The overall mood conveyed by this photograph is serene yet mysterious, emphasizing nature intertwined with human construction.","title":"Anacostia river looking west.
