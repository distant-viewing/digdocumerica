{"path":"545255.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a striking urban scene under an expressive sky. In the foreground, there's a large pile of what appear to be logs or timber, occupying the lower third of the image. These logs are stacked haphazardly, creating a textured and rugged appearance.\n\nAbove this foreground, the middle ground features a city skyline consisting of several buildings of varying heights. Notable structures include tall skyscrapers and possibly towers, which mark a distinct contrast against the natural elements in the foreground.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dramatic and moody sky. The sky is filled with dark, billowing clouds suggesting an impending storm or bad weather. These clouds are dense and occupy most of the upper two-thirds of the photo, casting a shadow over the cityscape and creating a somber tone.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes natural elements against urban development, highlighted by the dramatic weather, suggesting themes of contrast between nature and human-made environments.","title":"Log storage at the St. Regis pulp mill, with Tacoma skyline visible beyond.
