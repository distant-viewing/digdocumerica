{"path":"546055.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial landscape, likely capturing a large industrial plant in the background. This facility is characterized by multiple towering structures, extensive piping, and several smokestacks, suggesting it may be a chemical or manufacturing plant. The sky above the plant is clear, showing minimal pollution at the moment of capture.\n\nIn the foreground, there is rough, uneven terrain covered in patches of grass and wild shrubbery that appear somewhat dry and beaten, indicating possible environmental degradation or a neglected tract of land. The area shows signs of excavation or construction-related activity, suggested by mounds of earth and scattered debris.\n\nA dominant feature in the image is a conveyor belt system that stretches across the mid-ground from one side of the composition to the other. This system is raised above the ground on a linear structure supported by numerous poles. The conveyance system is likely used to transport materials either to or from the nearby plant.\n\nProminently placed in the right foreground are two utility poles equipped with several round signals or lights, which might be part of a warning or notification system for the industrial operations or transport systems in the area.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys an atmosphere of industrial activity juxtaposed against a natural, albeit disrupted, environment. It suggests themes of industrial expansion and the impacts such endeavors might have on local landscapes.","title":"Kaiser aluminum plant behind landfill area where industrial waste is dumped","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["546122","545992","557293","557374","545998","549168","552544","545442","555542","550168","544068","554630","549710","545993","545989","557373"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["system","plant","transport","pole","disrupt","manufacture","expansion","piping","mounds","warning"]}
