{"path":"547015.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a coastal landscape dominated by sand dunes. These dunes are covered with sparse vegetation, primarily clumps of grass that appear well adapted to the sandy environment. The foreground of the image shows several patches of this grass, protruding through the sand, which is textured and uneven, indicating the natural shifts caused by wind and weather.\n\nThe middle part of the image features a winding semi-path created by the natural contours of the dunes, leading toward the beach, which is visible in the background. The beach itself merges with a large body of water, likely an ocean, under a cloudy sky. The overcast conditions suggest a moody, perhaps cold day, as there is no direct sunlight visible.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of remote, untouched natural beauty, emphasizing the quiet solitude of the beach landscape under a gloomy sky. The focus and exposure are somewhat soft, giving the photograph a somewhat dreamy, timeless quality.","title":"Sea oats growing here deter beach erosion.
