{"path":"549477.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of a dense urban cityscape. The picture is taken during the day, as evidenced by the clear, sunlight conditions. At the forefront, there is a prominent, tall building with a modern architectural style, characterized by its rectangular shape and large windows. This skyscraper stands beside a body of water, likely a river or lake, which stretches into the distance along the left side of the photograph.\n\nSeveral other high-rise buildings populate the central area of the photo, indicating a bustling downtown or central business district. These buildings vary in height and design, suggesting a mix of commercial, residential, and possibly governmental functions.\n\nThe landscape is crisscrossed by major roadways filled with cars, indicating active traffic and urban mobility. To the right, these roads extend into a more densely packed residential area with smaller buildings and green spaces.\n\nThe backdrop of the photograph reveals more of the city extending far into the distance, where numerous other small and medium-sized buildings can be seen, interspersed occasionally with visible green areas or parks. The horizon shows a clear sky, further emphasizing the vibrancy and expansive nature of this urban environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights both the architectural diversity and the bustling atmosphere of a large, modern city.","title":"Downtown Buffalo looking north","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["551509","549476","553559","551510","549478","548392","547253","555743","551506","552233","549979","551507","553673","547765","548364","547445"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["building","mobility","city","downtown","district","vibrancy","diversity","skyscraper","roadway","function"]}
