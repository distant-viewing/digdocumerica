{"path":"546329.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph showcases a mid-20th century scene focusing on a single-story building, presumably a school or government building, framed by natural elements. In the foreground, parts of Spanish moss-laden oak trees obscure the view slightly, contributing to an almost picturesque, typical Southern U.S. ambiance. The building itself appears functional and modernist for the era, with a central section slightly recessed and flanked by two protruding wings.\n\nA large American flag flies prominently in front of the building, suggesting a sense of officialdom or patriotism, possibly indicating a public institution. The building's facade is composed of several large windows and doors, reflecting architectural trends aimed at utilitarian design and indoor natural lighting.\n\nIn front of the building, there is a spacious parking area filled with cars typical of the era, indicating the photograph was taken during a busy time of day when many people were present inside. The composition and exposure of the photograph suggest it was taken from a shaded area looking out towards the sunlit building, highlighting the contrast between the dark, verdant foliage and the brightly lit structure and its surroundings.","title":"EPA Gulf Coast Water Supply Research Laboratory","placename":"Dauphin Island (Ala.)","location":"Dauphin Island, Alabama","nn1":["549626","548866","546448","546702","546460","546542","550038","545376","556046","546456","557873","549360","557156","551613","558146","546464"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["building","oak","patriotism","trend","institution","era","government","front","school","wing"]}
