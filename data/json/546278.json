{"path":"546278.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a scene inside a laboratory. A man, dressed in a white lab coat and glasses, is focused on his work. He is standing between two rows of laboratory equipment that consist of numerous glass or plastic cylindrical containers lined up on shelves. These containers contain a red-pink liquid, possibly a chemical solution or a medium for experiments.\n\nHe is engaged in a task that involves handling or examining these containers. His posture and the concentration on his face suggest the precision and attention required for this activity. He appears to have pulled out a sheet or label, possibly checking documentation or recording results related to the containers he is managing.\n\nThe lighting in the laboratory is subdued and focused, highlighting the area where the man works and casting much of the surrounding space in shadows, which enhances the focus on the immediate activity. The background is filled with equipment and possibly other laboratory materials, although it is not sharply defined, emphasizing the action in the foreground.\n\nThis setting clearly implies a research or clinical environment, where meticulous handling of materials and detailed observation are key aspects of the work being done.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: microbiology lab.
