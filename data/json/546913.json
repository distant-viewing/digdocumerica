{"path":"546913.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban decay and pollution, likely resembling a wasteland or scrapyard near a body of water. The foreground and middle of the image are cluttered with various types of debris: numerous tires, both intact and torn; parts of vehicles including bent and rusted car frames; and assorted pieces of trash such as wooden planks and random metallic objects. Puddles of water scattered throughout the area reflect the overcast sky, suggesting recent rain.\n\nThe general mood conveyed is somber and melancholic, emphasizing environmental contamination. The background features a body of water, possibly a river, that extends to an overcast sky. There are faint silhouettes of buildings or industrial structures in the distance, along with what appears to be a bridge, contributing to the industrial atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe image is shot during daylight with a gloomy sky, adding to the bleakness of the setting. There's a notable lack of any human presence or wildlife, which underscores the severity of the pollution and abandonment. The color palette is predominantly dark with blues, grays, and browns, enhancing the dismal, neglected vibe of the scene.","title":"A storm sewer drainage line leads into the middle branch of Baltimore Harbor.
