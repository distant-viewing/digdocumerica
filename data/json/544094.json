{"path":"544094.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a man walking along a dusty, reddish-brown road in what appears to be an industrial or mining area. The man is dressed in a light blue short-sleeve shirt, beige pants, and brown boots, complemented by a white hard hat, indicating his role as a worker or inspector in this environment. He is looking down at a small, dark object that he holds in both hands, appearing to examine it closely as he walks.\n\nThe surroundings are barren and dry, with sparse vegetation visible in the distant background. Directly behind the man is a large pile of what looks to be gravel or crushed stone, suggesting ongoing excavation or construction work. The sky is clear and bright, casting harsh shadows on the ground which reinforce the intensity of the outdoor work conditions.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of solitary inspection or analysis, highlighting the isolation and scale of industrial operations in harsh environments.","title":"Worker carries souvenir waste rock at the Anaconda Co.'s Twin Buttes mine","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["543802","556329","544160","543648","556320","555563","552545","545371","556893","553611","546262","553639","556447","556427","545269","552004"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["analysis","inspection","work","intensity","gravel","boot","man","excavation","role","mining"]}
