{"path":"552242.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph provides a scenic aerial view of an industrial harbor area with a stunning natural backdrop. In the foreground, a large body of water features two major elements: a long pier extending into the water from the right side of the image, and a large red and black cargo ship moored alongside this pier. The pier is equipped with multiple docking structures, likely for loading and unloading cargo. \n\nBehind this maritime setting, a vast array of cylindrical storage tanks dominates the middle ground. These white storage tanks are symmetrically arranged in rows, suggesting an oil refinery or similar facility. There is industrial activity visible, indicated by plumes of smoke rising near the background of these structures.\n\nFurther enhancing this composition, the background is graced by a dramatic mountain range with snow-capped peaks, suggesting that this location might be near a coastal region with significant elevation nearby. The natural rugged terrain contrasts sharply with the industrial foreground.\n\nThe overall composition is well structured, presenting an intersection of human industrial might against the backdrop of natural grandeur. The image captures a moment where commerce, technology, and environment intersect.","title":"Tanker off-loading at Atlantic Richfield oil tank farm at Cherry Point on Puget Sound","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["552244","551609","549472","555724","552349","556912","552245","555766","552193","546359","547058","551577","547958","552181","552196","552008"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["pier","cargo","tank","might","refinery","storage","docking","commerce","maritime","harbor"]}
