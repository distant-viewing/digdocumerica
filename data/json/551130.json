{"path":"551130.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from a residential area, likely in an urban setting. The composition features three individuals, two children and one adult, interacting near a wooden fence that appears somewhat aged and weather-worn.\n\nThe background is dominated by a two-story house built from dark wood, exhibiting signs of wear and aging, with visible damage and makeshift repairs on its structure. A screened door stands open, and various items, including clothes, are hanging from the house, which indicates it might be a living space. Near the doorway, decorative elements like a small, reflective object that may be a mirror or a decorative plate, and a piece of fabric, possibly a towel or curtain, add a touch of personalization to the otherwise rustic facade.\n\nThe adult, a woman wearing a loose yellow dress with white stripes, leans on the fence with a relaxed posture, directing her focus away from the camera, suggesting an engagement with her surroundings or companions outside the frame. She stands on the right side of the composition, appearing contemplative or engaged in casual observation.\n\nThe children, one boy and one girl, stand leaning on the fence, looking towards the camera with expressions of curiosity and candidness. The boy is dressed in a red top and dark shorts, while the girl wears a white top with navy stripes paired with a lighter bottom. Their interaction seems casual and comfortable, indicative of a moment captured during their daily routines.\n\nThe setting, attire of the individuals, and the informal nature of their postures and expressions contribute to a depiction of a moment in everyday life, highlighting a sense of community and family in a residential neighborhood. The environment suggests a working-class area, with the house and fence providing a personal yet communal backdrop to the lives of its inhabitants.","title":"Substandard house in the triangle section of town is due to be torn down in urban renewal program.","placename":"Charleston (W.
