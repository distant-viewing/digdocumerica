{"path":"543324.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural scene involving a lone worker harvesting crops in a field. The worker, a male wearing light-colored pants, a long-sleeve shirt, and a straw hat, is actively picking red vegetables, which appear to be tomatoes, from low-lying plants. He is bending over, reaching towards the plants.\n\nMultiple large round buckets are spread out across the field, each filled with a mix of green leaves and red tomatoes. The buckets are positioned amidst patches of plants in an otherwise bare, brown soil environment, suggesting a selective harvest focused on ripe tomatoes.\n\nThe background features a vast, flat field stretching towards a clear blue sky, gradually transitioning to a slightly darker shade near the horizon. Sparse vegetation and distant trees line the horizon, beyond which are faint hints of buildings or farm infrastructure.\n\nThe entire scene is illuminated by bright sunlight, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the vivid reds of the tomatoes against the earthy brown soil and the subdued colors of the worker's clothing. The composition conveys the labor-intensive nature of manual crop harvesting in a vast, open agricultural setting.","title":"Radish pickers","placename":"Moss Landing (Calif.)","location":"Moss Landing, California","nn1":["552812","554047","543454","549036","557478","546964","549048","549084","557696","543480","544371","553879","552574","543481","549050","547734"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tomato","harvest","worker","bucket","crop","field","plant","soil","vegetable","harvesting"]}
