{"path":"557569.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an early morning scene of a calm and misty lake, depicting a beautiful mirror-like reflection of the surroundings on the water's surface. In the foreground, the lake reflects the silhouettes of tall trees, predominantly eucalyptus, based on their slender forms and distinctive foliage. These trees are densely clustered on a narrow strip of land which appears to form the edge of the lake.\n\nBeyond the trees and reflected in the lake as well, a hill rises covered with more trees and bushes, suggesting a rather wild, natural environment. The hill is bathed in a soft, cool light indicative of either early morning or late evening, creating a peaceful and somewhat ethereal atmosphere. The sky above the scene is dimly lit, suggesting that the sun has not fully risen, contributing to the overall serene and tranquil mood of the landscape.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or man-made structures in the scene, which emphasizes the untouched and serene nature of the location. The photo effectively conveys a sense of solitude and calmness through its composition, lighting, and the stillness of the waters, making it a powerful display of natural beauty and tranquility.","title":"Early morning at Malibu lake in the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county.
