{"path":"546532.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an educational or institutional building characterized by its modern architectural style, evident from the use of plain, dark brick walls and simple, unornamented design. The photo shows a spacious outdoor walkway that bends around the building, leading into a wooded area visible in the background.\n\nThe time of day appears to be either dusk or an overcast day, as the lighting is dim and the sky has a bluish-grey tint, suggesting either early morning or evening light. This ambiance contributes a somewhat serene and quiet mood to the scene.\n\nSeveral people are present in the photograph, most likely students. They are scattered along the walkway, either walking solo or in small groups, suggesting casual, possibly after-class movement. The individuals are dressed in typical casual attire, which includes jeans and jackets suitable for cool weather.\n\nThe surrounding environment adds a natural touch to the architectural setting with lush green trees framing the right side and background of the scene, providing a contrast to the man-made structures. The walkway itself is constructed from large concrete slabs, which are slightly wet, perhaps due to recent rain.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of modern architecture and natural beauty, encapsulating a typical academic campus atmosphere.","title":"Lincoln Elementary School, built in 1966","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546522","546531","546464","546460","546470","546702","546539","546461","546515","546456","546473","558033","546506","546559","546541","546431"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["walkway","campus","slab","student","class","tint","rain","dusk","jean","evening"]}
