{"path":"548571.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a scene taken from a low vantage point which includes the silhouette of a person in the foreground observing a performance. In the distance, the main focus is on a male figure who appears to be a performer, dressed in a flashy red suit with a bright, wide-spreading bow tie and a flower on his lapel, indicating he might be an entertainer, possibly a singer or a showman based on his expressive pose with outstretched arms. He seems to be in a mid-performance moment, possibly speaking or singing to an audience, standing in a well-lit space with plain ceiling panels visible overhead, possibly inside a hall or theater. The overall ambiance is dim, focusing the viewer's attention on the brightly dressed and lit performer in contrast with the surrounding darkness and the silhouette of the observer in the foreground.","title":"Evening entertainment at the clubhouse of the century village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["556310","556251","558261","551479","551318","556252","553231","549578","556318","556306","553217","558387","558263","554283","553710","554345"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["theater","singe","performer","silhouette","observer","hall","overhead","audience","bow","performance"]}
