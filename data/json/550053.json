{"path":"550053.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts a gritty urban scene that appears to be from the 1960s or 1970s. The main focus is on a row of weathered multi-story brick buildings, characterized by their uniform structure and aged appearance. The buildings have multiple rows of windows, many of which are dirty or show signs of neglect. Some windows have air conditioning units protruding, and the rooftops are equipped with various chimney stacks and vent pipes, indicating a possibly dense residential or mixed-use area.\n\nIn the foreground of the photograph, there is a large, open parking lot filled with cars typical of the 1960s and 1970s design, featuring sleek bodies and chrome detailing. These cars vary in color and model, predominantly American makes, reflecting the automotive design and consumer preferences of that era. A couple of visible signs, including a neon sign, indicate parking and possibly a restaurant, suggesting the buildings may house businesses on the lower floors.\n\nThe overall color tone of the image, combined with the style of the buildings and cars, provides a historic feel, capturing an essence of urban American life during a particular past decade. The setting is devoid of greenery or any modern digital technology, which solidifies its period setting. The atmosphere carries a sense of urban decay but also captures a slice of daily life in what might be a lower-income neighborhood.","title":"Commercial street - slated for renewal","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["556709","549287","548330","552965","554297","556718","557278","555748","553840","547651","550138","549785","556717","545326","551135","545216"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["1960","parking","preference","conditioning","protruding","income","1970","consumer","row","sign"]}
