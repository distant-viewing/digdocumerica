{"path":"552951.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a group of young people engaged in a cleanup activity near a beach setting. The image shows these individuals working together to lift and carry heavy, soiled burlap sacks, likely filled with collected debris. The youths appear to be primarily teenagers, with a mix of boys and girls, dressed in casual attire typical of warmer weather, such as jeans and t-shirts.\n\nThe location is characterized by its proximity to the beach, evident from the sandy coastline visible in the background along with the ocean and breaking waves. There are a few other people seen in the distance on the beach, contributing to a relaxed atmosphere despite the group's manual efforts.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by a number of parallel pipes laid out on the ground, indicating some form of industrial or construction activity, possibly related to the work the youths are engaged in. The scene is framed under an overcast sky, suggesting a cool or mild weather condition, which might contribute to the comfort level of the physical labor being performed.\n\nPower lines running parallel to the beach add an industrial element to the otherwise natural seaside landscape, hinting at human impact and possibly the reason for the cleanup activity. The presence of these elements together with the youthful energy of the group conveys a sense of community involvement and environmental conservation efforts.","title":"8th grade students pick up litter.
