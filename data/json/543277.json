{"path":"543277.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant underwater scene featuring a large jellyfish. The jellyfish is positioned near the center and appears translucent with a tint of pink coloring its dome-shaped bell. Thin, delicate tendrils dangle from the bell, some extending toward the clear blue water around it.\n\nThe jellyfish is floating near the surface, which is evident from the patterns of light diffraction and the visible sparkling water surface in the upper part of the image. The ripples on the surface create a dynamic texture, infusing the scene with a sense of movement.\n\nBeneath the jellyfish, the undersea environment can be seen. The water is clear, allowing the rocky seabed below to be prominently visible. This seabed is textured and has a rugged appearance, with various shades of brown and patches of marine growth.\n\nOverall, the photograph is rich in natural beauty, highlighting the delicate balance and serene environment of an underwater ecosystem.","title":"Jellyfish","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["544972","548713","548722","548719","548682","548717","555069","543187","548676","548721","548677","555060","548678","548683","548680","548679"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["bell","infus","underwater","surface","sparkling","dome","tint","rocky","rugged","marine"]}
