{"path":"557504.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal area. On the left side, a long, sandy beach runs along the edge of the ocean, with waves breaking near the shore. Parallel to the beach, there is a roadway and a compact residential area featuring rows of houses. The neighborhood looks well-developed with a variety of building types, including what appears to be single-family homes and possibly some smaller apartment buildings, interspersed with areas of vegetation and trees.\n\nTo the right, the landscape transitions into a more industrial and agricultural environment. Several large, rectangular fields, likely agricultural plots, are visible and display different colors that may be indicative of various crop types or stages of growth. These fields are organized in a clear layout bordered by roads.\n\nFurther right, there is a body of water that seems to be a river or a large water channel, separating the residential and agricultural zones from other industrial structures. Along the water, large white buildings, possibly warehouses or factories, can be seen, indicating an industrial area.\n\nThroughout, there are various roadways that cut through the landscape, facilitating connectivity between different areas. The overall impression is that of a diverse region where residential life, agriculture, and industry coexist closely. The natural beauty of the coastline contrasts with the orderly human-made agricultural plots and the industrial infrastructure.","title":"Aerial of Batiquitos Lagoon, one of the last few Bodies of water of this type in the southern part of the state. It suffers from nearby freeways and developments as well as farm erosion and septic tank seePage. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and it has resulted in increased land use pressure. Coastal wetlands totaled about 125,000 acres in the early 1970's compared to some 381,000 acres in 1900.","placename":"Carlsbad (Calif.)","location":"Carlsbad, California","nn1":["547508","557453","557452","555757","557451","553974","554057","543427","554156","543438","557505","555756","553945","554058","543084","556953"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["plot","roadway","beach","type","connectivity","field","apartment","agriculture","channel","crop"]}
