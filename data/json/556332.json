{"path":"556332.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene with a series of row houses lining a dirt road that snakes through a small town. The houses appear aged, with weathered wooden sidings, and are built close to each other. Each house features a front porch, and several have stairs leading up to their entrances, indicative of their adaptation to the sloping terrain. The roofs are primarily metal, and some have visible rust, adding to the look of a working-class community from a bygone era.\n\nThere's an unpaved main road running parallel to a set of railroad tracks, upon which coal cars are stationed, hinting at the town's industrial or mining background. The railroad and coal cars reinforce the industrial theme, suggesting that the town might rely on coal mining as a primary economic activity.\n\nAround the houses, there are various signs of daily life such as clothes hanging on the lines, personal vehicles parked nearby, and piles of firewood indicating preparation for colder weather.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is wooded, indicating that the town is nestled in a valley surrounded by forested hills. There are no visible modern technological infrastructures like cellphone towers or satellite dishes, which can suggest either a historical setting or a contemporary but isolated and economically stagnant area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere seems quiet and somewhat desolate, reflecting a slice of life in a possibly economically declining industrial or mining town. The image might evoke themes of community resilience, historical economic transitions, or the decline of industrial sectors in rural America.","title":"Closeup of an old coal company mining town of Red Ash, Virginia, near Richards in the southwestern part of the state. This is a classic picture of a company town with a railroad in the valley flanked by miners' homes. These houses are two-family dwellings; the road is made of red dog, a mining byproduct.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556331","556438","556333","556582","556578","545522","556394","556434","551001","557154","556580","556313","547658","551000","551050","551110"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Residential Neighborhoods"],"terms":["town","coal","mining","house","railroad","sector","dish","class","adaptation","decline"]}
