{"path":"548746.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a leisurely outdoor scene beside a body of water. On the right side of the image, a prominent element is the rear end of an old-fashioned van, characterized by its sturdy design and two-tone color scheme of white and red. The van has a California license plate that reads \"934 GMV\".\n\nTo the left of the van, there are two people engaged in fishing along a narrow coastline. The first person, closer to the foreground, wears a wide-brimmed hat and a light-colored shirt with dark trousers. The second individual, who is further away and slightly closer to the water, is dressed in a red top and dark pants.\n\nThe environment features calm blue waters, a clear sky with a few scattered clouds, and a flat landscape that does not show much vegetation, except for some sparse grass along the roadside. A series of utility poles stretches into the distance alongside the road, reinforcing the linear perspective and guiding the eye toward the horizon. The natural lighting suggests it might be midday or early afternoon, lending a bright and clear quality to the image.","title":"Leaving their \"travel-trailer\" on the side of the road, this retired couple from California stops to fish off the embankment at spanish harbor key.
