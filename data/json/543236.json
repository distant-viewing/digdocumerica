{"path":"543236.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a group of five adults in an outdoor, natural setting. They appear to be engaged in an observational or educational activity, likely related to the environment or nature around them.\n\nThe people are clad in casual, outdoor gear suitable for a cool or temperate climate. From left to right: the first person, a woman, wears a dark top and has her hair tied back; the second person, man with reddish-brown hair, wears a green and yellow button-up shirt and carries a backpack; the third person, a woman, has long blonde hair and is dressed in a flannel jacket while reading from a paperback book; the fourth person, a woman, wears a bright red jacket and a broad-brimmed yellow hat; the last person, a man, sports a blue zippered jacket.\n\nEach individual is partially surrounded by dense shrubbery and wild vegetation, typical of a coastal or mountainous region. The flora includes various shrubs, small bushes, and several types of wildflowers, creating a rich tapestry of greens and yellows.\n\nIn the foreground, prominently placed within the foliage, is a sign that reads \"SCENIC AREA | NO FOOD OR BEVERAGE.\" This suggests the location is a protected or preserved natural area, possibly a national park or nature reserve, where regulations aim to minimize human impact on the environment.\n\nThe background of the image is softly out of focus, emphasizing the subjects and their interaction with the natural environment. The overall composition and the attire of the individuals suggest that this image might have been taken during the 1970s or 1980s, given the style of clothing and the photographâ€™s coloration and grain.","title":"Sierra club nature hike","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["557005","554665","543234","557985","554672","543440","557007","545308","544739","553357","543238","543379","544003","558066","554662","558096"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["person","jacket","hair","flannel","minimize","woman","read","regulation","reserve","tapestry"]}
