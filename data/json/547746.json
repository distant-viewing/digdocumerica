{"path":"547746.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of the rear quarter of a rich blue Datsun 280Z car. The image shows the car's distinct badging and model detail on the rear, specifically reading \"280Z\" in a stylized font and \"Datsun\" in a separate, more straightforward print. Part of a red car is also visible in the immediate foreground, contributing to a layered visual depth and suggesting a setting among other vehicles, possibly in a parking lot or car show.\n\nThe photograph features a soft-focus background that mostly blurs out any distinguishable details behind the cars. The lighting appears soft, likely either dawn or dusk, which adds a calm and understated aesthetic to the image. The image appears to have been taken on film, as indicated by the textured overlay that includes vertical lines, which might be due to the film processing or an artifact from the original picture taking.\n\nOverall, the composition seeks to highlight the design and lines of the 280Z, a model popular in the 1970s for its sports car styling and performance. This perspective offers a glimpse into automotive history, capturing the essence of a classic car in its contextual environment.","title":"New Mazdas at Terminal Island, part of the Los Angeles waterfront","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["542640","547735","552787","557847","547722","557052","554384","547494","557878","554364","554389","553488","557891","545328","555922","557874"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","film","model","quarter","seek","font","styling","overlay","artifact","print"]}
