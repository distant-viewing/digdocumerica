{"path":"551951.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a city street construction scene. It captures two construction workers engaged in their tasks amidst typical urban surroundings. The focal point is a worker in the foreground who is bending over and digging into a pile of sand with a shovel. He wears a blue shirt, dark pants, work boots, and a white hard hat. The background features another worker operating a large yellow piece of construction machinery, possibly a backhoe or an excavator, which adds a vertical element to the composition.\n\nThe setting is a busy street lined with parked cars and moving traffic that includes various models of cars typical of the era, such as sedans and station wagons, painted in an array of colors. Noticeable in the background are tall city buildings that frame the scene, along with lush green trees that suggest it might be summer.\n\nIn the foreground, to the right, there are traffic cones and a construction sign that reads \"NO PARKING\" indicating that the stretch of the street is closed for work. The entire scene is lit by bright sunlight, casting shadows and highlighting the vibrance of the urban environment. This image not only captures the essence of city life but also the often-unseen labor that maintains the functioning of urban infrastructures.","title":"Work crew installs new water main on Sheridan road in rogers park, slowing early morning traffic toward the loop","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547693","551631","547240","547498","553886","544968","549309","557735","554313","546252","557479","553887","544959","553138","549664","556893"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","worker","city","street","infrastructur","traffic","digge","cone","excavator","shovel"]}
