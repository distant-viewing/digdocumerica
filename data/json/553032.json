{"path":"553032.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph shows a human hand holding a large, brittle-looking mushroom. The mushroom is predominantly pale, possibly a shade of off-white or light gray, with a porous and pitted surface featuring darker spots and irregularities that suggest it might be old or decaying. The texture across the mushroom cap appears crumbly and cracked, indicative of dryness or age.\n\nThe mushroom's cap is unusually shaped, presenting an irregular, somewhat oblong form with curvy edges that curl slightly upwards. It also displays a deep notch on one side, contributing to its asymmetrical appearance. At one point on the mushroom's surface, there is what looks like a hole or a deep crack, possibly from natural decay or physical damage.\n\nThe mushroom is held in a gentle manner, with fingers supporting from beneath to presumably avoid causing further damage to the fragile fungal body. The background of the image is very dark, almost entirely obscured, focusing all visual attention on the mushroom and the holding hand. There is no discernible activity happening other than the holding of the mushroom, and no other objects or people are visible in the shot. The lighting seems to be soft and directed, enhancing the texture and details of the mushroom's surface.","title":"Normal lung used for comparison with \"black lung.\" (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
