{"path":"558001.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil rural scene centered on an old, white, multi-story building situated next to a small waterfall. The building appears to be a historic mill, as it is positioned directly adjacent to a flowing body of water which cascades beautifully over a small, man-made drop. The waterfall flows into a stream that winds away into the foreground.\n\nThe architecture of the mill is traditional, with a gable roof and numerous windows scattered symmetrically across its façade. Adjacent to the mill is a wing or extension of the structure that is partially obscured by foliage. This extension includes a chimney visible at the far end.\n\nSurrounding the building, there is lush greenery, with a variety of trees that suggest the photo was taken during late spring or early summer. The trees and dense shrubbery frame the scene, adding a sense of seclusion and natural beauty. The landscape around the mill appears well-maintained but still rustic, with a grassy field visible in the background.\n\nOverall, the setting conveys a sense of peaceful, pastoral life, possibly indicative of a location used for its water power in bygone days. The composition and lighting—somewhat dim and shadowy, possibly due to the time of day or cloud cover—emphasize the quiet and serene atmosphere of this rural locale.","title":"Wilson's Mill, formerly known as Alexander's Mill, on the Ohio-Erie Canal south of Alexander Road near Valley View and Cleveland, Ohio. When it operated, canal water dropped through a sluice which provided power to grind grain. The canal connected the Great Lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi River systems between 1833 and 1913 when a flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business. The site is now part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550211","557745","550858","544796","553393","547519","555535","554703","553462","558005","545137","558109","543543","554767","555577","546126"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["mill","extension","waterfall","drop","locale","seclusion","wing","shrubbery","façade","stream"]}
