{"path":"550145.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint and serene alleyway, lined with brick buildings, which presents a charming slice of urban life. The focal point of the image is a young child being pushed in a stroller by a woman, likely his mother. They are navigating down the narrow, concrete pathway between the buildings.\n\nOn the left of the image is a green folding lounge chair, indicative of domestic life and leisure. Around the chair, various shrubs and small bushes add a touch of nature to the urban environment, enhancing the alley's cozy atmosphere. On the right, there's a large, leafy tree that bridges over the pathway, casting shadows and playing with light, which adds texture and a dynamic quality to the scene.\n\nIn terms of lighting, the photograph captures strong contrasts; it is taken on a bright sunny day which creates distinct shadows and patches of light along the alley, providing depth and a sense of the time of day. The architecture of the buildings is typical of mid-century, utilitarian design, characterized by the use of red brick and straightforward, functional styling.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its interplay of light and shadow, the natural elements juxtaposed with the urban environment, and the human element of care and companionship, evokes a feeling of warmth and peacefulness amidst the busyness of urban life.","title":"Metropolitan housing on st.
