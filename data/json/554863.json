{"path":"554863.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic camping scene, likely from a past decade given the style of the items featured. The setting is an outdoor area with dried leaves and grass covering the ground. At the center of the image, thereâ€™s an active campfire with a metal pot on it, hinting at meal preparation. Beside the fire, there are two large metal sheets, possibly used as a makeshift windbreak or cooking surface. Scattered around the fire are various objects including plates, a plastic jug, a peanut butter jar, and other small containers, suggesting a recently had or soon-to-be-had meal.\n\nTo the left, an older red sedan car with an open trunk and doors is visible, indicating the mode of transportation used by the campers. Behind the vehicle, a green-and-yellow tent is pitched, providing shelter. Inside the tent, two adults and a child can be seen, suggesting a family outing. They appear casually dressed suitable for camping and relaxed, sitting within the tent, perhaps resting or engaging in a light conversation.\n\nThe background is composed of a grove of thin, fairly tall trees, and an expanse of grass extends towards a vanishing point, giving an open, airy feel to the campsite. The overall atmosphere is casual and slightly disorganized, typical of a family enjoying time outdoors away from urban settings.","title":"Wife and child of an itinerant sheep shearer who is working for a rancher in the Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio area.
