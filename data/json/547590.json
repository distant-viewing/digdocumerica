{"path":"547590.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted shoreline. The ground appears muddy and littered with various trash items. Prominently in the foreground, there is a large, deflated, and dirty rubber tire next to what might be an old, rusted wheel rim. Another smaller piece of a tire, and possibly a section of black wire or cable, are also visible. A crumpled and weathered sack, possibly made of canvas or burlap, lies near the center. There are numerous unidentifiable small debris and fragments scattered around, hinting at a general state of neglect and pollution.\n\nThe shoreline meets a body of water, which can be seen occupying the upper right quadrant of the image. The water is very murky and dotted with similar types of debris and discoloration as found on the shore, indicating possible water pollution. The overall atmosphere gives a sense of environmental degradation and neglect. \n\nThere are no visible human figures or explicit activities occurring, which emphasizes the stillness and abandonment of the scene. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, given a somewhat soft light, enhancing the rather melancholic feel of the scene. The color palette is muted with drab earth tones, blues, and the rusts of the debris contributing to the grim and neglected ambiance of the setting.","title":"Dumped at Fields Point on Narragansett Bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["546913","547846","546838","547689","547493","551440","548741","547897","550352","547626","550812","550197","547907","547521","547517","547525"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["tire","debris","neglect","shoreline","pollution","quadrant","sack","rim","rubber","discoloration"]}
