{"path":"554514.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque and serene mountainous landscape, likely taken during dusk given the soft, dim light and subdued color tones in the sky and surroundings. The setting is a rugged terrain with large, moss-covered rocks forming the foreground, creating a slightly uneven yet naturalistic ground. In the middle to the right of the image, a small bright orange-red tent is pitched on a relatively flat area, adding a vivid splash of color contrasting with the more muted natural tones.\n\nTo the left, a person wearing a red jacket is seen from the back, sitting near a crack between rocks and possibly engaging with the environment or adjusting their sitting spot. The personâ€™s presence adds a human element to the scene, highlighting the interaction between humans and nature.\n\nThe background features a vast expanse of layered mountain ranges stretching into the horizon, under a vast sky that transitions in color from a deeper blue at the top to a softer lavender near the mountains. The layers of mountains, along with the shifting hues, create a deep sense of distance and vastness, emphasizing the solitude and quiet beauty typical of such high-altitude environments.\n\nOverall, the photograph communicates a sense of peaceful solitude, adventure, and the beauty of the natural world, inviting viewers to contemplate the quiet moments of being in such majestic locations.","title":"Backpacker camp at the summit of Algonquin Mountain looking west towards Lake Placid, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, second highest point in New York State","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554515","554507","542751","543376","545753","545780","554460","557558","550441","554398","544070","554402","555131","542681","554513","557000"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["mountain","solitude","crack","tent","rock","person","world","splash","moss","altitude"]}
