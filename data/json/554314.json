{"path":"554314.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling city street scene, most likely set in New York City during an earlier decade as suggested by the style of the cars and fashion of the people. The image features a lively street filled with cars and pedestrians, imbuing a sense of everyday urban life.\n\nIn the foreground, a bright yellow taxi is prominent, positioned in the center of the road, with its distinctive checkerboard trim connoting its identity as a classic NYC cab. The taxi is surrounded by other vehicles, including sedans and vans, indicating a busy traffic scene typical for a city. The cars display a variety of colors—red, blue, brown, and more—typical of the automotive palette of the time.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a group of pedestrians waits to cross the street. This diverse group, comprising about eleven individuals, is dressed in the fashion of the period, with men in suits or casual wear and women in dresses and skirts. Their attire varies: some wear bright colors, while others are in more subdued shades. One individual is noticeably wearing a bright red outfit, standing out amongst the crowd.\n\nThe architecture surrounding the scene is typical of mid-to-late 20th century American city structures—tall, with a mix of stone and metal facades, featuring elements like large windows and adornments reflective of the era’s commercial buildings. There are several American flags hanging from one of the buildings, invoking a patriotic ambiance.\n\nThe street is lined with trees adding a touch of greenery against the concrete backdrop, and the scene is also marked by urban elements like road signs and street lights. The road itself includes typical markings and the ambiance is one of a lively, dynamic urban environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph effectively conveys the vibrancy and energy of a major American city in a past decade through its depiction of architecture, street life, and automobiles.","title":"Taxi ties up two lanes at corner of 48th Street and Fifth Avenue.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554310","548331","548410","554315","554331","554330","549848","554316","549876","549873","554297","554293","548369","549882","549872","549881"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","taxi","city","decade","fashion","pedestrian","road","car","identity","cab"]}
