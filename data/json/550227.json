{"path":"550227.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene of recreation at a freshwater location, possibly a river or lake edge. In the foreground, two children are in the water; one is walking deeper into the water with a careful stance, while the other appears more playful, carrying a yellow object, potentially a toy or floatation device. There is also another person, seemingly walking, caught mid-step in the water, heading toward a more crowded area.\n\nIn the middleground, several other individuals are enjoying the water, with some walking and others standing or splashing. The area is populous and indicates a popular spot for cooling off.\n\nTo the right side of the image, a partially submerged tree with exposed roots suggests recent changes in water levels or erosion. The land on the bank is densely vegetated, providing a rich green backdrop that contrasts with the muddy water.\n\nFurther into the background, the scene continues with more people wading and socializing in the water, stretching back to where the crowd becomes indistinct. The further side of the water body features a treeline suggestive of a forested area, enhancing the sense of a natural retreat.\n\nNear the front, the edge of the water is lined with large rocks, framing the lower part of the image. The overall ambiance is summery and casual, with people dressed in swimwear, suggesting warm weather and a communal spirit of leisure and relaxation.","title":"Huntington beach on lake erie.
