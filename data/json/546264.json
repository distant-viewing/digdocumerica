{"path":"546264.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a large-scale construction scene, specifically focusing on a vast grid of metal rebar laid across a prepared ground base. The rebar is arranged in a regular, linear pattern that extends toward the horizon, creating a sense of depth and leading the viewer's eye to the distance. Each joint where the bars intersect is secured with ties, ensuring structural stability.\n\nThe rebar is set on a surface that appears to be compacted soil or a finely crushed stone base, typical of initial stages in highway or large pavement constructions. The background shows a rural or semi-rural setting with trees lining the edge of the site and roads parallel to the construction zone. Clear skies and bright sunlight saturate the scene, casting sharp shadows from the metal bars which accentuate the geometric precision of the rebar grid.\n\nItâ€™s a clear daytime shot with no visible personnel or machinery, emphasizing the readiness of the groundwork for subsequent phases of construction, likely a foundation for a roadway, runway, or large building. The lack of active construction elements suggests the photo was taken either before work commenced for the day or after work had paused.","title":"Steel rods, made from shredded autos, are being used for reinforcement in this section of i-55, north of durant.
