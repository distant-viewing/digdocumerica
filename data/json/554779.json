{"path":"554779.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural, pastoral scene featuring a small flock of sheep grazing in a field. The environment is a grass-covered pasture with slight undulations in terrain. In the background, there is evidence of a rustic, wooden fence that is partially collapsed and in disrepair, adding to the rural charm of the scene. Adjacent to the fence, there are various outbuildings or farm structures that appear old and weathered, with visible wood panels and possibly metallic elements, suggestive of farm storage or shelter areas.\n\nThe overall lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken during a bright day, as there are clear shadows under the sheep and the colors in the image are fairly vibrant, showing the green of the grass and the earthy tones of the wooden structures. The composition of the shot focuses mainly on the central and left sections where the sheep are concentrated, using natural lighting to enhance the textures of the landscape and the animals' wool. The seasonal setting could be late summer or early autumn, indicated by the condition of the grass and the warm, almost golden hue of the lighting.","title":"In addition to once being good farmland, once was famous for its sheep.
