{"path":"553192.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"In the photograph, a young girl in a bright yellow-orange dress with patterned trim stands beside a dark bronze statue next to a fountain. The statue is of a young child in a dynamic pose, suggesting movement, and it appears to be part of the fountain structure with water flowing near its base. The girl is observing the fountain or interacting with the water, extending her hand towards it. She is wearing white sandals with red straps.\n\nThe scene occurs in an urban setting evident from the background, which features indistinct buildings and a glimpse of what seems to be a shopping area, given the presence of storefronts and signs. A man in the distant background is partially visible; he is walking away from the camera and seems unconnected to the main action in the image.\n\nThe atmosphere evokes a casual, public space, likely a city park or square frequented by pedestrians and shoppers. The lighting suggests it could be an overcast day, softening the shadows and colors in the image. The focus and composition emphasize the interaction between the child and the sculpture, creating a poignant moment of curiosity or playfulness amidst the urban environment.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: Tyler Davidson Fountain.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553229","551467","552700","551638","553219","551446","551857","551468","550748","549985","551484","552737","553224","551639","549982","551449"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","statue","girl","shopper","bronze","playfulness","frequent","sandal","child","strap"]}
