{"path":"550099.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a suburban street scene with a strong presence of vibrant green trees under a clear blue sky, suggesting it is a sunny day. In the foreground, a paved road stretches horizontally across the frame. The focal point is an outdoor advertising structure for Shell, a well-known gas station brand, featuring its iconic yellow and red logo on a rounded sign mounted on a brick base with post caps.\n\nThe advertising structure is surrounded by a freshly manicured lawn, enhancing the appeal of the location. Directly behind the sign, there is a well-maintained brick wall enclosing what appears to be a commercial property. This wall connects to a broader setting that includes similar architectural style structures, suggestive of a quaint and orderly neighborhood.\n\nOn the left side, beyond the sign, and a part of the landscape, there are residential houses visible, consistent in design with pitched roofs and a traditional appearance, blending seamlessly into this serene suburban environment. The presence of mature trees around adds a sense of tranquility and privacy to the area.\n\nNo people are visible in the frame, which focuses on architecture, commercial signage, and landscaping. Overall, the composition emphasizes a clean, organized, and peaceful suburban setting.","title":"Well-designed gas station harmonizes with neighborhood","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546430","558057","548477","550073","556426","556433","545419","557668","556448","553705","547021","558157","547567","558059","556950","549279"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Residential Neighborhoods"],"terms":["advertising","brick","privacy","sign","wall","brand","landscaping","appeal","gas","property"]}
