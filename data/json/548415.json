{"path":"548415.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a panoramic view of a long bridge stretching over a body of water during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the low light and warm tones in the scene. The bridge curves gently, connecting the land from the left side of the image to the horizon in the upper right.\n\nIn the foreground, a highway runs parallel to the shoreline, dense with headlight trails from vehicles, suggesting a busy traffic scene. This highway leads towards the bridge, emphasizing the connection between different regions or areas. \n\nThe water itself sparkles with reflections of sunlight, creating a shimmering path that follows the bridge. The light playing on the water adds a serene and almost mystical quality to the scene.\n\nThe background features distant hills or mountains, faint under a hazy sky that blends similar tones of dusk or dawn light, transitioning into the darker blues and purples of the upper atmosphere. The view is atmospheric and moody, evoking a sense of quiet despite the implied busyness of the traffic. The overall composition is peaceful yet dynamic, merging natural beauty with human engineering.","title":"Tappan Zee Bridge at sunset.
