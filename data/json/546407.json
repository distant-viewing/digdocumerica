{"path":"546407.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The image provides an aerial view of a landscape featuring both developed and natural areas. The foreground shows a large development consisting of rows of similar structures, likely residential housing, arranged in a neat, orderly pattern. Adjacent to this are what appear to be partially developed or undeveloped areas with bare earth and sparser vegetation, suggesting ongoing construction or preparation for further development.\n\nBeyond the immediate developed area, there is a more densely vegetated region with numerous trees and greenery, interspersed with scattered buildings, which blend more seamlessly into the natural environment compared to the structured development in the foreground.\n\nThe background is dominated by mountainous terrain covered with lush green forests and hills that roll into the distance. The mountains provide a stark, natural contrast to the human-made structures and development in the foreground.\n\nThe sky above is vivid, filled with dynamic and voluminous clouds, suggesting a robust, possibly tropical climate. The overall composition of the photograph highlights the juxtaposition between human habitation and the natural environment, featuring elements of development, nature, and a dynamic skyscape.","title":"Bayoman housing development","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["553938","542674","557516","557532","553778","556919","553059","553945","557518","556915","556953","556938","550553","556916","553779","557003"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["development","develop","housing","preparation","vegetate","habitation","compare","climate","roll","intersperse"]}
