{"path":"556045.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a train station where luggage handling activities are underway. In the image, two individuals are prominently featured interacting with each other beside a train car. A man wearing a blue uniform and a red cap, likely a porter or baggage handler, is engaged in moving baggage. He appears to be loading or unloading a brown suitcase onto the train. Facing him is another man, perhaps a passenger or a fellow worker, standing in the doorway of the train. He is dressed in casual attire, a striped, untucked shirt with dark pants.\n\nThe setting shows several large suitcases piled up on a luggage cart in the foreground, indicating a significant amount of travel activity. The train itself is sleek and modern-looking, with a shiny, metallic exterior. The station has a large overhead canopy casting shadows, and there's visible industrial architecture in the background that includes other trains and tracks.\n\nThe atmosphere seems busy yet organized, with clear sunny weather enhancing the visibility of all elements in the photograph. The composition of the photo, with its focus on the action and interaction between the two men, suggests a narrative of travel, labor, and the hustle and bustle typically associated with train stations.","title":"Baggage handling is one of the many chores that needs attending as the Lone Star passenger train (#15) arrives in Fort Worth, Texas, enroute from Chicago to Houston, Texas. Amtrak is using airline techniques and other modern methods in working to upgrade rail service and attract passengers. Since it took over most U.S. intercity passenger service, the decline in ridership between the end of World War II and 1970 has been reversed.","placename":"Fort Worth (Tex.)","location":"Fort Worth, Texas","nn1":["555984","556044","556089","556831","556025","551921","556827","556845","556026","556855","556846","556041","553733","556110","556087","556091"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","suitcase","luggage","station","travel","bustle","cart","hustle","handling","doorway"]}
