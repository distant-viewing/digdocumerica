{"path":"555275.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a striking upward view of the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. The perspective is from ground level looking almost directly upwards, emphasizing the immense height of the buildings as they stretch up towards the sky. Each tower appears as a tall, narrow rectangle with a slightly reflective surface, marked by countless windows that create a grid pattern across the facades. The sides of the towers are aligned almost perfectly, such that the building edges create sharp, clean lines against the backdrop.\n\nThe sky above and between the two towers is a deep blue, dotted with fluffy, white clouds that appear to emanate from the point where the towers nearly meet in the perspective of the shot, giving a dramatic contrast to the smooth, metallic texture of the buildings. The light and shadow on the towers give them a luminous quality, reflecting the bright sunlight of what seems to be a clear day. Also visible are subtle details on the buildings, like slight curvature at the corners and very faint vertical lines, possibly indicating structural elements or minor variations in the facade.\n\nThere are no visible activities or people in the photograph; the focus is solely on the architectural form and the skyscape, creating a composition that conveys both the formidable human achievement embodied by these skyscrapers and their integration into the natural environment above. This image captures a sense of towering ambition and the serene beauty of the skies, communicating an interplay of human endeavor and the broader, natural context in which it exists.","title":"World Trade Center in New York City","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549302","555274","547691","548409","555278","549301","549915","548387","550116","546491","548319","549764","548408","549317","555736","548386"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["tower","facade","achievement","curvature","integration","perspective","building","endeavor","variation","skyscraper"]}
