{"path":"548479.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph features an urban landscape where various forms of transportation and residential living converge. It seems to have been taken from an elevated position, possibly a bridge or a station platform.\n\nIn the foreground, part of an overpass or pedestrian bridge is seen with a metal railing and what appears to be graffiti painted on its surfaces. Below and to the right, there is a train line with a moving train consisting of multiple carriages of the iconic blue and white variety, suggesting a public transit system.\n\nParallel to the railway, a road carries multiple vehicles, including trucks that are clearly visible due to their large size and vivid colors, such as red and white. On the left of the image, residential buildings in various shades of gray and blue, typical of urban environments, can be seen. The architecture is characteristic of densely populated city neighborhoods with tightly packed three-story buildings that have external fire escapes.\n\nIn the distance, the city extends with more buildings visible under a slightly hazy sky, which could indicate either weather conditions or air pollution. No specific natural elements like trees or parks are directly visible in this section of the image, emphasizing the urban character of the setting. The entire scene captures a typical day in a bustling city with active transportation and residential life.","title":"20 years ago the MBTA (Metropolitan Boston Transit Authority) line from Revere to Boston was allowed to go above ground at Neptune Road.
