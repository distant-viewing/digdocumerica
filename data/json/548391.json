The highway, marked with multiple lanes in each direction, is filled with dense traffic. Vehicles, including cars and several large trucks, are visible moving in both directions. The various vehicles come in different colors, adding vibrancy to the view.\n\nThe road is delineated by clear white lane markings between the lanes and along the sides of the highway. Roadway barriers are visible on the outer edges, aiding in separating the highway from its surroundings.\n\nThe outer areas adjacent to the highway feature lush greenery with trees and grass visible, suggesting that the highway might be located in a suburban or a semi-urban area. A small path can be seen winding through the grassy areas adjacent to the road, likely for pedestrian use or maintenance access.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph showcases a bustling transportation artery crucial for commuting or travel, encapsulated by a serene green landscape. The aerial perspective provides a comprehensive view of the traffic flow and the organization of the highway system.","title":"Causeway of the triborough bridge.
