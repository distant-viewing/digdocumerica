{"path":"544669.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of sailing at what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft, warm lighting. Two sailboats are depicted on a calm body of water, likely a lake or a calm sea bay. The nearest sailboat, prominently featured, is a small craft with a single sailor dressed in a red jacket. The boat has a pointed bow and a single white sail which bears the numbers \"5441\" in bold black digits. There is a small red up-pointing arrow above these numbers, which could indicate some form of racing or club sailing designation.\n\nThe second boat is further in the distance, showing similar construction but less distinctly visible due to the distance. Both boats gently disturb the water, creating light ripples around them. \n\nThe background of the photograph features hills and a variety of waterfront structures which could be related to maritime activities, likely a combination of commercial and possibly recreational facilities. The silhouette of a large building and a ferry boat suggest a fairly well-developed area near the waterfront. The setting is tranquil, with a soft palette dominated by the pastel hues of the sky reflecting on the water, enhancing a sense of peacefulness and isolation away from the busier backdrop.\n\nThis image, rich in hues and tranquil maritime activity, evokes a sense of peaceful solitude amidst natural beauty, juxtaposed against the more industrial or commercial signs of human activity in the distant background.","title":"Sailboat race","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["552345","548118","552346","549411","542903","547757","543941","550758","548247","552343","544663","547273","547754","544665","552293","548521"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sailboat","boat","number","ferry","sailor","club","racing","pastel","arrow"]}
