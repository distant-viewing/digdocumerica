{"path":"547449.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic and active moment at sea featuring a sailing yacht named \"WANDELAAR Wickenburg.\" The boat, with a vibrant red hull, is heeling significantly to its port side due to strong wind conditions. The sea around the yacht appears rough with waves, enhancing the dynamic and somewhat challenging sailing environment.\n\nOnboard, there are several crew members actively engaged in navigating the yacht. The person at the helm, located at the stern, is handling the steering wheel, and his attention is focused on guiding the yacht. A few other crew members are distributed strategically across the yacht, some adjusting the sails and others possibly managing other navigational duties. The attire of the crew includes casual and practical sailing gear, suitable for the wet and windy conditions.\n\nThe sky is overcast, creating a moody and intense atmosphere for the scene. The sails of the boat are fully unfurled and filled with wind, indicating good sailing speed despite the rough conditions. The action and composition of the photograph convey a sense of adventure, teamwork, and the exhilarating challenge of sailing in demanding weather.","title":"5 classes of boats competed in this year's Annapolis--Newport race.
