{"path":"543858.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts several agricultural workers in a field, engaged in the task of tending to crops. The workers, positioned in a line extending across the frame, are using long-handled hoes to cultivate the soil around the plants. There are at least seven individuals visible, each wearing wide-brimmed hats and casual, loose-fitting clothing suitable for outdoor labor and protection from the sun.\n\nThe environment is an expansive field under a clear blue sky. The crops, reaching low to the ground, line up in neatly arranged rows that disappear into the horizon. In the background, the landscape is flat with minimal structures; only a small, distant building can be seen, possibly related to the farm's operations.\n\nThe workers seem focused and busy, engaging in persistent physical activity that suggests careful attention to the growth and health of the plants. The attire and tools suggest a setting that could be in a rural farming area, given the traditional and practical wear plus basic agricultural equipment used for the process.","title":"Migrants weed sugar beets for $2.00 an hour","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["553879","543862","557478","554108","557696","543481","553659","546964","552812","548900","543157","543845","554047","549050","554017","544246"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["worker","crop","health","protection","field","plant","farming","line","farm","growth"]}
