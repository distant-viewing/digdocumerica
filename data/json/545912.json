{"path":"545912.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The image captured displays a dramatic industrial scene, dominated by the silhouette of an elevated water tower against a moody sky. The water tower, with a classic cylindrical top supported by a network of metal beams, is highlighted against the backlight of the sky which features a mix of dark and illuminated clouds, suggesting either dawn or dusk lighting.\n\nIn the foreground, there is considerable industrial activity characterized by billowing dark smoke and steam. The smoke arises from various sources below, contributing to a visual impression of pollution and heavy industrial operation. This plume of smoke creates a sharp contrast against the lighter part of the sky, enhancing the image's dramatic effect.\n\nThe setting is insinuated to be an industrial area due to the presence of these pollutants and other obscured industrial structures, with elements like spherical tanks and additional framework hinting at a complex and possibly chemical or manufacturing plant.\n\nPower lines faintly visible in the background also suggest the presence of significant infrastructure. The overall composition of the image, combining the industrial foreground with a solemn environmental backdrop, evokes a narrative about industrial impact on the environment and possibly concerns regarding pollution and environmental degradation.","title":"Smoke from armco steel on a sunday afternoon","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["553023","550982","557374","550985","557220","545446","550195","543006","544958","550344","550168","550993","550821","552190","557373","550177"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","pollution","backlight","regard","tower","manufacture","pollutant","degradation","concern","billow"]}
