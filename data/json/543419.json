{"path":"543419.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image captures a vivid coastal scene. The foreground shows a slope covered with thick green succulent plants that have bright yellow flowers blooming atop them. Just beyond this lush greenery looms a cliff edge, leading the viewer's eye toward the main focus of the photograph — a dramatic rugged coastline.\n\nThe sea, in varying shades of blue, swirls around a distinctive rock formation located slightly off the coast. This formation consists of two main parts: a larger rock connected to the mainland by a narrow, natural stone bridge, and a smaller, standalone rock. These rocks are weathered and layered, showing different shades of brown and beige, with a hint of vegetation on their upper surfaces.\n\nThe water near the rocks exhibits dynamic white waves breaking against them, displaying the force of the ocean. This crashing action suggests a strong surf, typical of such rugged coastlines.\n\nThe sky above this striking natural scene is a clear, deep blue, adding to the overall vibrancy of the image’s color palette. The photograph conveys a sense of the untamed beauty and power of nature found along coastal regions.\n","title":"Wildflowers overlooking Natural Bridges Beach","placename":"Santa Cruz County (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz County, California","nn1":["543290","543297","543184","543291","543289","545122","545129","542917","543204","545230","545125","543067","543061","543243","545934","545130"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["rock","coastline","formation","surf","crash","coast","loom","vibrancy","strike","swirl"]}
