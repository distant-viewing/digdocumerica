{"path":"556484.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a man seated comfortably in a wooden rocking chair within a rustic setting. The man appears relaxed, dressed in a casual long-sleeve shirt and dark trousers. His arms are resting on the armrests and his legs are stretched out in front, crossed at the ankles. He has a reflective, calm expression on his face.\n\nHe is located in a dimly lit, wooden environment that suggests a porch or an old building. The wooden floor and walls are visible, showing signs of aging and weathering. To his right is a pile of chopped wood, neatly stacked, which emphasizes the rustic, possibly rural setting.\n\nNext to him on the floor are a large white plastic jug and a smaller dark bottle, which contribute to a lived-in, utilitarian feel of the scene. A window is partially seen to his right, allowing some light into the area, but the overall ambiance is somewhat shadowy, lending a moody atmosphere to the photograph.\n\nThe background and compositional elements like the color tones, textures of the wood, and the placement of everyday objects together with his relaxed posture contribute to a narrative that feels intimate and quietly powerful, illustrating a moment of tranquility or contemplation.","title":"John hoskin, jr., an ex-miner with black lung disease, lives in Rhodell, West Virginia, near Beckley.
