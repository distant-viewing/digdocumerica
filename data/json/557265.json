{"path":"557265.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with two musicians performing outdoors. Both men are seated on chairs, dressed smartly in white shirts and dark ties. The man on the left plays a clarinet, and he's captured mid-performance, with his mouth on the mouthpiece and fingers positioned on the holes and keys of the clarinet. The man on the right is playing a trombone, and is also caught mid-performance, his fingers gripping the slide of the trombone while he blows into the mouthpiece.\n\nThe setting appears to be an outdoor event, likely a festive or ceremonial occasion given the formal dress of the musicians and the gathered audience. The audience, blurred in the background, consists of casually dressed people who are watching the performance, informing us of the public nature of the event. The background is softly out of focus, further emphasizing the musicians in the foreground. The setting includes cobblestone ground and hints of greenery suggesting a park or a similar outdoor community space.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, the depth of field, and the focus on the two musicians effectively convey a lively musical performance taking place in a communal, outdoor setting.","title":"Park-like settings stressing plantings of various kinds, sculpture, and pools were features of the urban renewal renaissance program in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the early 1950's.
