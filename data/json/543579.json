{"path":"543579.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a serene lakeside scene peppered with elements of human activity and natural beauty. It features a lake surrounded by a dense forest of tall, coniferous trees. The sunlight is shimmering on the water's surface, creating numerous small, bright spots that add a lively texture to the scene.\n\nSeveral wooden docks extend into the lake, with various unoccupied small boats (such as rowboats and canoes) tied to them, awaiting use. On one of the docks near the center of the image, two individuals are seen engaging in activities; one appears to be sitting relaxedly, possibly fishing or simply enjoying the tranquil environment, while the other is more active, possibly adjusting something in or around the boat.\n\nOn the left side of the image, along the shore and partially hidden by trees, there seem to be wooden structures which could be cabins or small storage sheds, suggesting this area might be a recreational or vacation spot.\n\nOverall, the setting conveys a peaceful, leisurely atmosphere, likely a destination for relaxation and enjoying nature.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["543527","543547","551207","557562","554552","544266","553440","545229","544031","550674","553082","554635","554516","550324","551219","548034"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["spot","dock","await","pepper","enjoy","rowboat","vacation","lake","hide","canoe"]}
