{"path":"544629.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a vast, uniform housing development. Each house is similarly designed, predominantly white with flat roofs, arranged in neat, orderly rows that span across the image. The development is dense, with minimal spacing between individual homes. This grid-like urban layout is bordered by a main road with vehicles, hinting at a well-connected infrastructure.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, there is a commercial area with several low-rise buildings, which includes cars parked in front of what appears to be stores or offices. Beyond the housing development, the land transitions into open fields, likely agricultural, visible to the far right and rear of the image, emphasizing the contrast between developed and undeveloped land.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes a few scattered trees, and there are hints of other developments or wooded areas in the distance under a clear sky. This photograph captures a specific moment in urban planning, emphasizing scale and the impact of residential development in what might previously have been rural or undeveloped areas.","title":"Huge trailer park encroaches upon the boundaries of the Everglades National Park.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553934","544510","553125","545914","553693","546399","553700","548825","556183","544550","557455","544604","552728","544568","552730","544600"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["development","housing","land","rear","planning","grid","office","store","layout","span"]}
