{"path":"544698.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a solitary structure alongside a body of water, possibly a river or lake. The earth surrounding the water is patterned with sediments and erosion, featuring varying textures and tones from dark brown to deep green, potentially indicating algae or water pollution.\n\nThe focal point is a dark, almost black shack-like building situated right at the edge of the water. The building appears to have a wooden construction with a slanted roof, under which a few collapsed or sloping structures resemble simple docks or platforms extend into the water. The crude rustic appearance of the building, combined with its isolated location, gives it a somewhat abandoned or utilitarian look.\n\nThe surrounding landscape lacks vegetation, and the soil and mud visibly mix into the water, suggesting low water levels or possibly a drought effect. The contrast between the dry, cracked earth areas and the muddy wet zones highlights environmental variability, possibly hinting at issues such as water mismanagement or natural seasonal changes.\n\nThe image exudes a calm yet eerie mood due to the solitary structure and the expansive, somewhat desolate surrounding environment. This landscape likely represents an area of ecological and environmental interest, potentially indicating human impact or natural transformations influencing the area's condition.","title":"Leslie salt ponds","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["546109","547038","544751","545137","549457","554788","545680","551519","544733","547098","544445","545647","548030","550368","547040","547053"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["water","variability","drought","shack","earth","transformation","algae","mud","sediment","issue"]}
