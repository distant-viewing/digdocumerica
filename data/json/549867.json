{"path":"549867.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a busy urban street scene, seemingly from a city's commercial or industrial district. The street is lined with large vehicles, including a dump truck labeled \"BABACO\" on the left side and a black transport vehicle marked \"CONBOY\" at the center. Another black truck with the number \"5\" stands farther back, partially visible. \n\nThe focal point of the image is a man pushing a heavily ornamented, round object on a wheeled platform. This object is draped with what looks to be colorful, sparkling fabrics or coverings, and it is netted with a rope, suggesting it might be some form of street vending or display cart.\n\nThe man appears focused on navigating his cart through the narrow space between the stationed vehicles. He is of a darker complexion, wearing light blue jeans, a tight long-sleeve blue shirt, and dark shoes. His hair is styled in a short, curly afro.\n\nThe setting is shadowed, indicating it might be a dimly lit street or captured during a time of day when sunlight doesn't fully penetrate the area, potentially early morning or late afternoon. The architecture of the area is characterized by tall, plain building facades that tower over the street, enhancing the sense of an enclosed space. The overall mood looks somewhat gritty and evokes a sense of routine urban life, where different activities coexist closely together.","title":"A frequent sight in Midtown Manhattan's famous Garment District (between Broadway and Eighth Avenue)","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549850","549866","547075","554309","557110","547666","551872","548272","556733","548373","547174","549859","557687","549267","550128","554310"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","cart","vending","complexion","truck","vehicle","covering","dump","object","district"]}
