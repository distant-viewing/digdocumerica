{"path":"546207.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph presents a contrasting scene where nature and industrial development coexist. In the foreground, thereâ€™s a peaceful river scene characterized by lush, green foliage and tall grasses near the banks. The water is calm with gentle ripples, reflecting the colors of the environment. The right side of the riverbank features dense shrubs and trees, adding a sense of solitude and quiet.\n\nIn stark contrast, the background is dominated by a large industrial complex with numerous tall, white vertical structures, likely distillation towers, and several spherical tanks. The facility is dense with these structures, each equipped with many pipes and ladders, typical of petrochemical plants or refineries. The industrial complex spans across the riverbank, suggesting its massive scale. This juxtaposition highlights the intrusion of industrial development into natural landscapes, presenting a visual dialogue about the balance between industrial growth and environmental conservation.","title":"The polluted lake which surrounds Eastman Kodak plant","placename":"Longview (Tex.)","location":"Longview, Texas","nn1":["550860","545996","546974","544289","546395","557377","550995","546978","551082","550694","553450","552040","552041","551192","544471","546118"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["riverbank","complex","distillation","dialogue","refinery","development","span","intrusion","ladder","conservation"]}
