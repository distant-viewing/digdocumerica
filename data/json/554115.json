{"path":"554115.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up of vibrant pink flowers, likely impatiens, surrounded by lush green foliage. Each flower has a circular center with five rounded petals, and they are bright against a dark, blurry background that helps emphasize their vivid color and delicate details. The leaves around the flowers are large, have jagged edges, and some are speckled with droplets of water, suggesting either recent rain or morning dew. The focus and lighting of the image highlight the natural beauty and freshness of the plant, providing a tranquil and somewhat ethereal quality to the scene.","title":"Flora of Akaka Falls State Park","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554843","554595","553366","543597","542970","557500","557545","554576","553588","554587","557618","557167","544875","547613","555042","547815"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","freshness","dew","droplet","petal","close","rain","up","leave","foliage"]}
