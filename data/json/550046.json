{"path":"550046.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph features a scenic public park setting. At the center, an imposing equestrian statue on a large pedestal draws the eye. The statue of the rider, clothed perhaps in historical military attire, adds a noble air to the park. In the forefront, on either side of a paved walkway, are flowerbeds colorfully speckled with mostly yellow and some purple flowers, indicating a well-maintained urban garden.\n\nTwo people, seemingly younger women, are walking towards the camera on the path, engaged in conversation. Another individual is walking away from the camera on the path that intersects near the statue. The people are dressed in casual attire suitable for a pleasant day outdoors.\n\nThe background is an interesting contrast between nature and urban architecture. Lush green trees and a weeping willow are spreading across the park area. Beyond the natural elements, the backdrop is dominated by mid to high-rise modern buildings, reflecting an urban skyline that suggests this park is within a city.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed is serene and leisure, typically found in a city's green space where people can relax, enjoy nature, and take a peaceful walk. The scene is bathed in bright daylight, enhancing the vibrancy of the greenery and the clarity of the blue sky.","title":"Public gardens - a park in the heart of the city","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["557257","552736","550067","544808","550298","550071","551713","546535","549516","557262","550302","547784","551815","550075","553043","552396"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["statue","park","flowerbed","path","pedestal","walk","rider","people","city","camera"]}
