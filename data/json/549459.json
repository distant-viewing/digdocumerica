{"path":"549459.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"In the photograph, a snake is prominently featured as it rests on a large, textured rock surface. The snake has a patterning that appears to be dark with lighter colored bands along its body, indicative of certain non-venomous species. Surrounding this central subject is an environment that conveys a natural, possibly wild habitat. On the left side of the rock, small white flowers emerge from dense, green leafy branches, suggesting a type of shrubby undergrowth. To the rear and right of the snake, there is an assortment of plant life including what looks like green, needle-like vegetation, possibly some type of moss or small coniferous growths, contributing to the image's overall lush and damp forested setting. The lighting in the image suggests a soft, natural light, likely filtered through a canopy overhead, casting a serene ambiance over the scene. No human presence or artificial objects are visible, emphasizing the untouched and secluded nature of the snakeâ€™s environment.","title":"Western garter snake on the shore of the snake river in hells canyon.
