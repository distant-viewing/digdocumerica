{"path":"551023.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor natural scene showing what appears to be a disturbed area of soil and plant life. On the right-hand side of the image, there is a fallen, decaying log largely stripped of its bark, exposing a smooth, pale wooden surface. The log curves gently toward a dug-up patch of earth. In this area, clumps of dark brown dirt and scattered debris, including twigs and a few green leaves, can be observed, suggesting recent activity, perhaps by animals or weather effects.\n\nTo the left side of the frame, the dirt takes on a wet, muddy appearance with a glossy sheen, reflecting some objects above, possibly small plants or other natural elements. This could indicate recent rainfall or a water source nearby.\n\nOverall, the setting seems to be a forest or woodsy area with some disturbance to the natural soil and vegetation, possibly due to environmental factors or the presence of wildlife. The photograph carries a raw, natural aesthetic, emphasizing textures like the rough surfaces of the dirt and the smoothness of the wood.","title":"This foul-smelling drainage ditch flows into the Kanawha River.","placename":"Malden (W.
