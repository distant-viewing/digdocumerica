{"path":"551414.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This image depicts multiple people engaged in activities along a river or stream. Three individuals are visible in the foreground on the left-hand side of the image. They are standing in shallow waters equipped with what appear to be nets, possibly involved in fishing or collecting something from the water. The person in the middle is holding a long pole or tool and the other two appear to be inspecting or handling objects near the water's edge. Each person is dressed in casual clothing suitable for outdoor activity.\n\nIn the background, slightly on the right, there is a bridge spanning the river with a vehicle visible, suggesting the proximity of a road. The riverbank is uneven and natural with patches of grass, bushes, and bare trees suggesting that this might be set in a temperate climate zone during a season when trees have not fully leafed out, possibly early spring.\n\nOverall, the scene is a blend of a natural environment and human activity, with a focus on the interaction of the individuals with the water and its possible resources. The setting seems tranquil and somewhat rural or semi-urban.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City. In mid-April thousands of fishermen gather at Whitney Drain, a manmade canal on Lake Huron, to dipnet for these small fish. A culvert pipe projects from the bank, and emits a foul odor in this area of the smelt run.","placename":"Saginaw (Mich.)","location":"Saginaw, Michigan","nn1":["546803","551430","551408","550209","545531","546338","544274","551389","551416","543164","546811","551538","551390","551415","551423","557743"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["net","person","river","resource","water","stream","proximity","riverbank","spring","climate"]}
