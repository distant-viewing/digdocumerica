{"path":"548610.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph shows an elderly person sitting on a foldable chair against a gray concrete wall, which is aged and showing signs of wear and discoloration. The person is wearing a short-sleeve shirt and shorts both with a floral print, flip-flops, and a bucket hat with a similar floral pattern. The individual is holding an open wallet and appears to be either examining its contents or looking for something specific inside it. Beside the chair, there is a closed blue umbrella and a colorful fabric tote bag hanging from the chair's arm.\n\nThe overall setting gives a sense of relaxation and casual everyday life on a possibly warm day, given the attire and the presence of an umbrella possibly for shade. The plain background brings the viewerâ€™s focus onto the central figure, their attire, and activity.","title":"Resident of a South Beach retirement hotel","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["553090","551439","557844","548621","556498","548609","548625","552648","548618","551438","551272","551828","547330","556292","556489","551825"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["chair","umbrella","discoloration","print","fabric","person","attire","relaxation","content","bucket"]}
