{"path":"548017.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a large river crossed by a series of bridges and dams. In the foreground, there's a significant dam structure that spans almost the entire width of the river. The dam features several spillways and control structures, indicative of hydroelectric functionality.\n\nBeyond the immediate dam, the river continues to flow, surrounded by relatively flat terrain on one side and more densely populated areas on the other. There are multiple bridges visible, connecting the populated areas on either side of the river. These bridges vary in size and design, including both a suspension bridge suitable for vehicular traffic and simpler, likely pedestrian bridges.\n\nIn the background, a striking snow-capped mountain dominates the skyline, suggesting the region might be within a mountainous area, which is typical of hydroelectric dam locations. The landscape around the mountain and the city appears to be a mixture of residential zones and possibly agricultural or undeveloped land, indicated by green patches.\n\nAdditionally, the far side of the river shows a more developed urban area with clusters of buildings that blend into the riverscape, illustrating a harmonious balance between nature and human settlement. The scene is enveloped in clear skies, enhancing visibility and highlighting the natural beauty of the area.","title":"The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River. In background is Mt.
