{"path":"554709.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene likely from a small town in the United States during what appears to be the mid to late 20th century, given the vintage of the cars and the style of the signage. The image shows a wide street lined with multiple lanes of traffic moving in both directions. Cars, which look to be models from the 1960s or 70s, are visible on the road.\n\nOn the left-hand side of the image, there are numerous commercial establishments. Prominent among these are signs for a diner offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner; a motel with several signs, including a large vertical one that reads \"GOLDEN ARROW\"; and a coffee shop. The architecture of these buildings is typical of mid-20th century roadside Americana, featuring prominent signage to attract passing motorists.\n\nThe right-hand side of the street also features similar commercial structures, including another motel with a large neon sign reading \"MOTEL.\" The scene is busy with what appears to be midday traffic and the infrastructure typical of a developed, commercial district, including multiple overhead power lines and traffic signals.\n\nIn the background, the street is bordered by mountains, suggesting the town's location in a valley or a mountainous area. The foliage on the mountains is a mix of green and touches of autumnal colors, indicating that the photo was likely taken in the fall.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the bustling street flanked by motels and diners under a clear blue sky and mountainous backdrop, paints a nostalgic picture of mid-century American town life and travel culture.","title":"Entrance to Lake George Village, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, is cluttered with power lines and signs.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545618","545614","554710","553017","549113","545610","551071","549017","545216","549014","544793","552601","555584","551135","555438","552602"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["motel","diner","street","town","traffic","signage","lunch","offering","coffee","70"]}
