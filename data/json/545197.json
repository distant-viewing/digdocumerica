{"path":"545197.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river scene featuring a series of houseboats arranged linearly along the riverbank. The river appears calm with a gentle ripple effect on the water surface, reflecting the early morning or late evening light. The houseboats vary in size and design, with some having gabled roofs and others flat, and nearly all featuring windows and small decks. The color palette ranges from whites and greys to more vivid blues and yellows, offering a quaint and varied residential appearance.\n\nIn the background, there is a sloped hill that is partially forested and showing signs of some clearing or development. A road runs parallel to the riverbank, suggesting accessibility to these floating homes by land as well. The setting is tranquil, with no visible movement or people, giving the image a quiet and isolated feel. The presence of utility poles along the road indicates that despite the seeming remoteness, these dwellings are likely connected to modern conveniences.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image—taken from an elevated perspective—provides a comprehensive view of the interaction between human habitation and a natural waterway, offering insights into a lifestyle that balances isolation with community in a unique riverside setting.","title":"Houseboats along the Willamette River","placename":"Oregon","location":"OTHER","nn1":["558062","548056","548052","551066","548086","548028","551067","551526","557972","542908","543529","549457","551209","552270","557485","544243"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["riverbank","convenience","dwelling","remoteness","insight","offer","accessibility","lifestyle","riverside","river"]}
