{"path":"556271.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"In the photograph, two African American men are shown seated in what appears to be a conference room or meeting setting. The man on the left is older, with grey hair, wearing glasses, and dressed in a dark suit. He is partially turned away from the viewer, facing towards the right side of the frame where the other man is looking. The second man is notably more focused in the image; he has a darker complexion, black hair, and a neat moustache. He is wearing a light gray striped suit with a light blue tie. His expression is thoughtful and attentive as he holds a pen close to his face, suggesting he might be listening intently or about to speak. The background is simple and unobtrusive, primarily in light tones with no distinct features, emphasizing the subjects in the discussion or meeting environment.","title":"Black members of the Chicago city council during a budget hearing in the fall of 1973","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557894","557037","554322","551335","547367","556266","555234","556270","545471","552390","549114","557856","556415","554339","547407","551338"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["meeting","suit","complexion","man","pen","hair","discussion","listen","face","seate"]}
