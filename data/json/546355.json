{"path":"546355.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The image captures an aerial view of a vast muddy river delta merging into a body of water. The photo shows a mix of liquid and solid textures, highlighting the dynamic blending of water currents and sediment. The upper section of the river is lined with dense green vegetation, signifying a rich, natural habitat possibly housing varied wildlife. Several small islands and river banks are visible, covered with clumps of greenery and separated by myriad streams and channels that appear to flow through the delta.\n\nThe landscape is predominantly in shades of earth tones—browns, greens, and blues—creating a natural and serene vista. There are visible patches of sandy beige along the banks, possibly indicating areas of sandy soil or eroded banks. No human activity, structures, boats, or animals are apparent from this perspective, suggesting a possibly untouched or minimally disturbed natural area.\n\nThis depiction helps to showcase the complexity of natural water systems and the diverse ecosystems these environments support. The composition of the photograph, taken from above, allows for a comprehensive view of the patterns and flows within the delta, offering insights into the geomorphological and ecological characteristics of this region.","title":"Aerial view of body of polluted water","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"Puerto Rico","nn1":["542996","552924","550582","552838","557506","550885","546351","550392","545114","551608","550545","550601","547227","544772","544760","552953"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["bank","river","blending","flow","insight","vista","clump","beige","characteristic","current"]}
