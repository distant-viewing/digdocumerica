{"path":"544576.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a dilapidated trailer amidst a lush, natural setting. The trailer, split open and appearing partially collapsed, has a metallic exterior with severe damage and dents. Its side features small rectangular windows and what appears to be an air vent or similar installation near the roof line, all in a state of disrepair with frames bent and glass missing. \n\nThe trailer is situated in a grassy area with abundant overgrown vegetation, including tall grasses and wildflowers, suggesting a long period of neglect. Two large trees frame the scene, their trunks showing directly alongside the trailer, giving a sense of solidity and permanence in contrast to the decaying man-made object. The play of light filtering through the trees creates dappling effects on the grass and trailer, enhancing the atmosphere of a somewhat serene yet abandoned space.\n\nIn the background beyond the immediate site, more foliage is visible, continuing the theme of nature encroaching upon and reclaiming the area where the trailer rests. The overall mood evoked by the image is one of quiet decay and the passage of time, marked by the gradual overtaking of nature over human artifacts.","title":"River flood damage","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["548822","554561","552673","550795","547024","551330","552494","543198","551115","550797","552102","553007","551329","552101","554707","546405"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["trailer","decay","dent","missing","encroach","artifact","reclaim","collapse","vent","wildflowers"]}
