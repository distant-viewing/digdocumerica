{"path":"547211.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a suburban neighborhood, capturing a network of roads and residential houses. The main road curves through the center of the image, lined with single-family homes on either side. The houses vary in architectural styles and colors, with some featuring brick exteriors and others with siding. Many homes have driveways leading to garages, and several have backyard spaces delineated by short fences or natural barriers.\n\nThe neighborhood is interspersed with well-manicured lawns and occasional trees, some of which appear to be in the early stages of bloom, suggesting that the photo might have been taken in spring. The roads are relatively clear, with only a few cars visible, indicating either a time of low activity or a quiet community.\n\nTowards the edges of the photo, the density of the trees increases, marking the transition to a more wooded area, possibly a natural boundary for the neighborhood. The layout of the homes and roads suggests a planned community with attention to spacing and placement, providing an orderly and aesthetically pleasing environment. The lack of people and high activity level in this still capture emphasizes the calm and serene atmosphere typical of many suburban areas.","title":"The clearing is a new suburban development near the potomac river","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["549071","547769","553699","556975","547435","548824","553970","553705","544510","553700","556956","557405","548011","556974","544550","553937"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["neighborhood","home","road","increase","delineate","backyard","driveway","community","house","plan"]}
