{"path":"553895.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor setting, specifically a vehicle emissions testing station. The primary focus is on a blue-grey station wagon car with the rear portion visible. The car's license plate reads \"BPU 232\". The vehicle is positioned on top of a large, circular metal platform embedded in the floor, likely a dynamometer used for simulating road conditions while the car remains stationary.\n\nSurrounding the car, several large, flexible metal ducts extend across the floor. These hoses appear to be connected to the car's exhaust and to equipment designed to measure and analyze the emissions produced by the car. To the left of the image is a rusty and worn metal box, possibly an electrical box or part of the emissions testing machinery.\n\nIn the background, there are various industrial elements including a red gas cylinder, concrete walls, overhead lighting, and other unidentifiable mechanical equipment. The floor is a smooth concrete surface, and the room has a utilitarian, workshop-like feel. The overall atmosphere is clinical and technical, emphasizing the functional nature of the activities being performed.","title":"An epa facility at ann arbor measures engine exhaust from a new autoMobile.
