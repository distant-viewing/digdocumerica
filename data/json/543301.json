{"path":"543301.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photo presents a stunning natural coastal landscape. In the foreground, a grouping of wild grass stands with its blades pointing upwards, capturing the light and swaying gently, suggesting a breezy environment. The grass is dense, with varying shades of greens and browns, suggesting it is wild and native to the coastal region.\n\nBeyond the grass, the topography descends sharply towards a rugged coastline. The cliffside appears rocky and steep, indicative of a less accessible shoreline eroded by waves over time. The cliff's face is partially covered with sparse vegetation, which clings to the rocky soil, highlighting the harsh growing conditions in such an environment.\n\nThe ocean spans the middle ground of the photograph, its surface animated with whitecaps indicating windy conditions. The turquoise blue water near the shore transitions to a deeper blue as the depth increases, a common trait in coastal waters.\n\nIn the distance, the shoreline curves gracefully, revealing more of the coastal cliffs which progressively fade into a misty haze, providing a sense of vastness and the expansive nature of the ocean. The horizon is obscured slightly by this mist, suggesting humidity and the presence of ocean spray in the air.\n\nThe topography, vegetation, and atmospheric conditions suggest this could be a scene from a temperate coastal area, possibly in a region like the Pacific Coast in California, where cliffs and dramatic coastal views are prevalent. The overall feel of the photograph is wild and natural, evoking a sense of serenity and raw beauty, typical of less disturbed coastal environments.","title":"California--Big Sur coastline","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["545129","545125","542917","543300","543297","543184","545222","543090","543061","543428","545215","543249","545934","545122","543304","543328"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["coastal","cliff","topography","ocean","grass","shoreline","breezy","humidity","grouping","sway"]}
