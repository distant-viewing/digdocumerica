{"path":"545857.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and crowded beach scene, likely from a past era given the style of the cars and fashion of the people. The beach is teeming with cars parked along the sand, indicating a popular destination on a busy day. The cars range in color and make, with many of them having their doors and trunks open, suggesting that people are using their vehicles for shade or as a base from which to enjoy the beach.\n\nThe people in the scene engage in various activities. Some individuals walk across the beach, while several groups are lounging on the sand, possibly sunbathing or enjoying picnics. Near the water's edge, people can be observed playing, splashing, and walking along the shoreline, and children appear to be playing in the water.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a noticeable gathering of people who seem to be relaxing near their parked cars, either sitting directly on the beach mats or using folding chairs. The attire varies from swimsuits to casual summer clothing, reflecting a relaxed, recreational setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image with its dense arrangement of cars and people spread across the beach beneath a bright sky evokes a sense of a bustling, vibrant summer day at a popular coastal location.","title":"West beach","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["550925","550934","557475","550922","547478","550933","547499","550921","548929","547495","545252","545237","546794","550931","547482","547503"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","people","cars","summer","sand","car","mat","sunbath","teem","play"]}
