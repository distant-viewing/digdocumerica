{"path":"544561.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image depicts a serene and calm landscape scene with a striking architectural structure in the background. The foreground consists of a still body of water, which perfectly reflects elements of the surrounding scenery. Scattered vegetation fringes the water's edge, including some thin branches and darker foliage that dip into or hover just above the water. This aquatic and vegetation frame adds a natural touch to the composition, enhancing the quiet and peaceful mood.\n\nThe central feature is a modern architectural structure located on the far side of the pond, composed of multiple levels and layers. This building appears to be a tower with observation decks or platforms supported by a series of concrete pillars, presenting a futuristic and constructivist design. The design includes an open framework, with staircases that spiral upwards and various horizontal platforms, suggesting that it might be an observation tower or a similar public facility designed for viewing the surrounding landscape.\n\nIn the background, dominating the skies above the landscape and the architectural structure, are large, fluffy clouds. These clouds are bright white and billowy, occupying a significant portion of the upper frame of the image. They seem to enhance the verticality of the tower, drawing the viewerâ€™s eye from the reflection in the water up towards the sky. The sky around the clouds shows a calm, clear blue, contributing to the overall tranquil and picturesque setting of the photograph. The natural light appears to be that of either early morning or late afternoon, as evidenced by the soft lighting and gentle shadows cast in the scene.","title":"The Shark Valley ranger station and tower","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544565","546530","544537","546463","546480","544690","548030","543611","557333","548870","546464","548208","546472","543580","548034","543524"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["observation","tower","platform","spiral","cloud","hover","verticality","fringe","design","dip"]}
