{"path":"545592.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a rugged, natural outdoor setting, likely a canyon or a valley with distinctive geological formations. The background is characterized by large, stratified rock faces, displaying layers of sedimentary rock that have been shaped over millennia, creating a majestic and dramatic backdrop. These rock faces are predominantly in shades of gray and brown.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is walking towards the camera along a narrow path. He is shirtless, wearing pants, and carries two white buckets, one in each hand. His posture suggests steady movement along the path, and his attire and the items he is carrying imply that he may be engaged in some form of manual work or outdoor activity, possibly related to water gathering or sampling.\n\nThe setting around the path is lush compared to the rocky cliffs, filled with tall grasses and small shrubs. The color of the vegetation varies from green to golden, indicating possibly a late summer or early autumn season. This vegetation contrasts strikingly with the barren rock faces nearby, highlighting the diversity of the environment in this region.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests early morning or late afternoon, with sunlight casting over the landscape and creating a warm, illuminated effect on the rock surfaces and grasses. This natural lighting enhances the serene yet rugged quality of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph brings together elements of human endeavor within the context of a harsh, albeit beautiful, natural landscape, combining themes of solitude, resilience, and the environment.","title":"Main valley floor of the Maze in the western part of Canyonlands National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545588","545759","544903","545762","545755","543846","545305","544898","551520","543838","544902","544899","544392","544931","545724","545758"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["rock","path","face","sampling","millennium","carry","endeavor","canyon","bring","grass"]}
