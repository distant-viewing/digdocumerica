{"path":"542739.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an elder person standing by a river engaged in the activity of fishing. The person, appearing to be a woman with short, curly, grey hair, is dressed in a dark jacket and seems intently focused on the task at hand. The setting is natural and serene with dense foliage partially obscuring the view in the foreground, creating a sense of being hidden or peering through the undergrowth. Downed tree limbs and overgrown brush dominate the riverbank adding to the rugged outdoorsy feel of the scene. The environment conveys a tranquil yet somewhat wild river setting, ideal for quiet and reflective activities such as fishing. The light suggests it might be morning or late afternoon, with sunlight filtering through the trees, highlighting parts of the river and the surrounding vegetation.","title":"Sequoia and kings canyon national parks","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["552026","554520","550665","551024","545286","542651","554519","543628","542529","550317","550666","550217","551393","545968","553332","551025"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","river","limb","pee","hide","brush","undergrowth","ideal","person","riverbank"]}
