{"path":"542723.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a large tree with multiple branches and trunks intertwining. The bark of the tree is very prominent and is marked with various carvings and initials, likely made by visitors or by local residents as a form of marking or leaving a personal imprint. Some of the markings include letters, numbers, and a heart shape encapsulating initials, suggesting perhaps romantic symbols or special dates.\n\nThe scene suggests this tree is a local landmark or holds some significance where people come to inscribe their marks. The tree's structure is complex, featuring thick, gnarled trunks and branches that twist around each other, creating visually interesting patterns and textures. The background of the photograph is slightly blurred and darker, focusing the attention on the intricate details and carvings of the tree's surface.\n\nThere's a subdued, possibly cold light filtering through which illuminates the tree, accentuating its rugged surface and the depth of the engraved markings, while the ground around the tree features scattered leaves or small branches, indicating it might be situated in a wooded or forested area. The overall mood of the photograph is a bit mysterious and historical, suggesting a passage of time and a connection to the personal histories of those who have left marks on the tree.","title":"Natural grafted tree in big stump meadow","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["544332","542715","543488","557621","542749","557622","550792","554954","551328","548709","554973","553577","543198","557623","548687","554994"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["marking","carving","tree","branch","trunk","inscribe","leave","marnks","gnarl","twist"]}
