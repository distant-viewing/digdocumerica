{"path":"555038.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph offers a lush, upward-looking view beneath a dense canopy of large, broad leaves. The perspective is from ground level, looking upward towards the sky, with sunlight filtering through the green foliage, highlighting the intricate vein patterns and shapes of the leaves. The leaves are attached to slender, sturdy stalks that appear to reach high above the ground, suggesting a dense forest or jungle-like environment. The sky visible through gaps in the foliage is a rich, deep blue, with hints of white from distant, obscured branches or clouds, giving a vibrant contrast to the vivid greens of the leaves. Shadows play across some of the leaves and the forest floor, adding depth and a sense of the sun's position in the sky. The scene is natural and tranquil, rich in green tones, portraying a quiet, sheltered understorey habitat.","title":"Vanilla leaves as forest floor canopy at Green Mountain in a private forest preserve in Kitsap County, Washington.
