{"path":"549774.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive debris field with a variety of discarded materials and objects. The foreground is cluttered with large amounts of wooden planks and boards, some of which appear broken or partly disassembled. Among the wooden debris, there is a visible crate labeled \"SCHWAN AGON4.\" Additionally, there are scattered pieces of torn and crumpled white paper or fabric interspersed with the wood.\n\nIn the midground and extending to the background, the debris field continues, appearing less dense but still extensive. Miscellaneous detritus, including what looks like more wooden pieces and random trash, covers the ground.\n\nIn the distant background, a city skyline is visible, featuring several tall buildings that rise prominently against the sky, suggesting a view from an urban outskirts or a peripheral vantage point. The sky is clear and blue, indicating a day with good weather.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a sense of desolation and abandonment, contrasting the clutter and chaos of the foreground with the structured skyline in the distance.","title":"Illegal dumping area off the New Jersey Turnpike, facing Manhattan across the Hudson River.
