{"path":"554173.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene likely from a mid-20th-century setting, based on the style of clothing and vehicles. The image shows a bustling commercial street featuring a store named \"Super Dime 'N Dollar.\" The store's fa√ßade is adorned with signs promoting various items such as jewelry, and it features a decorative red and white striped awning.\n\nParked in front of the store is a \"Wisconsin Ducks\" amphibious tour vehicle, emblazoned with promotional text announcing it as an \"adventure on land and water.\" This type of vehicle is often used for tourist rides that travel both on roads and through waterways.\n\nA man stands on the street foreground, dressed in a short-sleeved white shirt and yellow shorts, capturing the scene with a camera, likely intending to photograph the moving car or the Duck vehicle. He wears dark socks and brown shoes, and his attire, like the street setting, suggests a period aesthetic.\n\nA blue car is in motion in front of him, blurred due to its speed, emphasizing the sense of moment and activity in the scene.\n\nThe photograph overall portrays a sense of mid-century Americana, capturing a moment of leisure and commercial activity, with attention to both human interest and architectural detail.","title":"Near the town of Wisconsin Dells the Wisconsin River channels through deep, soft sandstone cliffs, cutting the rock into fantastic shapes. These natural splendors have given rise to a booming tourist industry. People come in droves, often in campers and trailers. Boat trips, shops, bars, and diversions of every kind vie for patronage in an amusement complex extending 2 or 3 miles beyond the town.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554191","545216","546428","556224","552602","549872","549882","551125","545333","556225","542900","550139","551494","551135","557705","557805"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["store","street","vehicle","announce","duck","jewelry","tour","awning","century","sock"]}
