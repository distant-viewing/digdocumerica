{"path":"557783.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph captures a serene pond in a natural, lush setting. The foreground features dense, tall green grass, partially obscuring the view into the pond. An old rubber tire is partially submerged in the water among the grasses, adding a rustic detail to the scene. \n\nThe pond itself is calm, reflecting the overcast sky and surrounding trees. In the middle of the pond, there's a simple wooden dock with a bench, suggesting a spot for sitting or fishing, contributing to the peaceful ambiance. \n\nThe background showcases a small cabin positioned on the opposite side of the pond, partially surrounded by trees and a gently sloping lawn. The setting appears quiet and secluded, with an emphasis on natural beauty and tranquility. The overall mood is placid and slightly nostalgic, evoked by the timeless elements of water, greenery, and a secluded wooden structure.","title":"Lake, cattails and an inner tube waiting for youth to use it is a typical scene in this low mountain community of some 270 people.
