{"path":"543288.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatically rugged coastal scene featuring a cluster of weathered, wooden structures that are perched on stilts above a rocky shore. The structures appear to be industrial facilities, possibly related to fishing or marine research, characterized by their utilitarian design and various levels and sections connected by external staircases and platforms. Some parts of the buildings are supported by white-painted metal frameworks which stand directly in the surf, while others extend from the rocky coastline.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows the turbulent ocean waters washing over and swirling around rounded, moss-covered rocks. The dynamic movement of the white-capped waves contrasts with the steadfastness of the old, functional buildings. Above the scene, a partially cloudy sky suggests an expansive, open atmosphere, lending a wild, natural aspect to the environment. The coastline itself is uneven and rough, comprising largely of jagged rocks that directly meet the sea.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a scene of human-built structures integrated into a harsh, coastal environment, showcasing resilience and adaptation to the natural maritime landscape.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543242","543359","543405","543364","547118","552955","543320","551953","543426","543291","549338","547040","546378","549533","548079","551963"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["coastline","surf","stilt","adaptation","staircase","rock","moss","resilience","research","framework"]}
