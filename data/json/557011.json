{"path":"557011.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic and serene forest road captured during an early morning, illuminated by sunlight filtering through mist. The perspective is from ground level, looking up the road which extends straight into the distance, slightly narrowing towards a vanishing point.\n\nThe road is unpaved with visible tire tracks imprinted into the muddy surface, suggesting recent passage of vehicles. The edges of the road are uneven, with accumulations of gravel and small stones. On the left side of the road, a low dirt bank leads up to dense tree cover, consisting of tall, slender trees that are partly shrouded in fog, enhancing a feeling of depth and mystery.\n\nThe right side of the road features a more defined edge, possibly a curb, beyond which lies thick underbrush and more towering trees. The atmosphere is damp as evidenced by the moist road surface and the mist hanging in the air.\n\nThe lighting is a significant element of this image, with sunbeams penetrating the mist and trees, casting elongated shadows and creating a play of light and shadow on the road. This diffusion of light adds a dreamlike quality to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, inviting contemplation and exploration. It captures a fleeting moment where light, nature, and atmosphere converge to create a striking and memorable visual experience.","title":"Nelson road between bucklin hill road and tracyton increased land use pressure for roads in the area is expected when the navy's trident submarine base is built nearby.
