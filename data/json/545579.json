{"path":"545579.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a semi-arid desert scene featuring a sparsely vegetated landscape with reddish-brown earth. In the foreground, a prominent cluster of dry, sparse grass is centered in the composition. Around this focal point, the soil appears to be dry and cracked, indicating arid conditions.\n\nMoving towards the midground, several similar grassy clumps are scattered, interspersed with a few shrubs. These plants appear adapted to the desert environment, showing signs of drought resistance.\n\nThe background of the photo shows a gently sloping hill that eventually leads up to a low, rounded hilltop. The vegetation remains sparse across the landscape, and the hilltop does not display any significant change in either vegetation or color. The sky is clear and cloudless, suggesting a bright and sunny day, further reinforcing the arid, dry setting of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image captures the rugged and sparse beauty typical of desert ecosystems, emphasized by the reddish tones of the soil and the resilience of the vegetation that inhabits this challenging environment.","title":"Until 1975 cattle are permitted to graze in the Maze, an area newly incorporated into Canyonlands National Park.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["549183","545843","552435","549132","544879","545724","549133","544016","544019","553057","544401","545583","545754","545789","545895","549034"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hilltop","desert","drought","soil","clump","vegetation","resilience","change","midground","ecosystem"]}
