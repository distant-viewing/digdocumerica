{"path":"543499.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a serene moment of a family on a sandy beach. The scene includes two adults and a young child, with the ocean and its waves visible in the background. The woman is wearing a light-colored jacket, dark pants, and white shoes. She is facing towards a man who is holding a small child. The man is dressed casually in a light checked shirt and brown pants. The child, held in the man's arms and looking over his shoulder towards the camera, wears a light-colored bonnet, adding to the peaceful and familial atmosphere of the image.\n\nThe ocean behind them features moderately rough sea with whitecaps visible on the distant waves, suggesting a windy but clear day. The beach itself looks relatively empty, providing a feel of privacy and calm to the family outing.\n\nOverall, the composition of the picture, with its clear focus on the family in the foreground contrasted against the vastness of the ocean and sky, evokes a sense of intimacy and the simple joy of a family spending time together in nature. The lighting suggests that this scene is taking place during the day under clear sky conditions, emphasizing the tranquility of the moment.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543517","543493","552295","548805","547009","548696","548793","547676","543225","552975","546982","547877","543395","555402","545194","552341"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["family","ocean","child","bonnet","whitecap","wave","beach","privacy","intimacy","pant"]}
