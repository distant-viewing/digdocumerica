{"path":"549137.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape, primarily featuring a large agricultural field. The field is dotted with numerous small, rectangular hay bales arranged in seemingly orderly rows. These rows stretch across the image, creating a patterned texture contrasted against the natural setting.\n\nTwo significant hay stacks, which are much larger and cylindrical in shape, sit prominently on the right side of the field. They are covered with red netting, helping to distinguish their shape and form against the grassy background.\n\nThe background includes rolling hills and a few clusters of trees, adding a natural boundary to the expansive field. The hills are adorned with lighter shades of grass, suggesting variations in vegetation or possibly the effect of sunlight at different angles. The sky is not visible in this photo, which focuses entirely on the landscape and agricultural elements.\n\nOverall, the composition offers a snapshot of farm life and hay harvesting, underlining themes of agriculture, rural life, and nature's role in providing resources. The field's vastness and the methodical placement of hay bales highlight the scale of farming operations and the beauty of organized agricultural practices.","title":"Hay fields on a ranch in Sarpy Basin.
