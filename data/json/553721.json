{"path":"553721.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban life, likely taken from an overpass or an elevated viewpoint, looking down onto a busy highway filled with a variety of vehicles. The road is multi-laned with cars and trucks traveling in both directions. In the backdrop, a dense urban skyline dominates, featuring multiple high-rise buildings, including a prominent tall tower with a unique modular architecture, which stands out as the centerpiece of the image. Farther in the distance, past the city, mountain ranges can be seen under a blue sky, giving a stark contrast between the natural and urban environments.\n\nThe image has a slightly grainy texture, typical of film photography, and exhibits the warm, muted tones characteristic of photographs from the 1970s or 1980s. The setting appears to be late afternoon, judging by the quality of the light, which casts long shadows and enriches the colors of the cityscape and vehicles. Power lines subtly crisscross the upper portion of the image, adding another layer to the vertical and horizontal lines created by the buildings and the road.","title":"On H-1 (or Lunalilo) Freeway looking west toward downtown Honolulu.
