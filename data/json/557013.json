{"path":"557013.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil and moody rural landscape, likely captured during dusk or dawn, as suggested by the dim lighting and misty atmosphere. The composition centers on an expansive field, slightly sloping uphill. There are faint dark shadows in the foreground which seem to be traces of grass or small plants, hinting that the field might be a pasture or uncultivated land.\n\nIn the middle ground, a solitary, bare tree stands to the left, adding a sense of solitude and starkness against the foggy backdrop. It is devoid of leaves, suggesting it could either be during the colder seasons or that the tree is dead. Further up the slope and more centralized in the frame, a group of trees and perhaps some shrubbery cluster together, creating a small wooded area that gives a bit of density to the otherwise open field.\n\nThe background features a dimly visible building, possibly a farm or rural home, situated near the right edge of the image. It's partially obscured by the mist, which gives the scene a ghostly and isolated feel. The sky is dominated by a pale, glowing orb, likely the sun shrouded in heavy fog, which casts a diffuse light over the entire scene, contributing to the serene yet somber mood of the photograph.\n\nThe overall low visibility and fog enveloping the landscape create an atmosphere of quiet and mystery, inviting contemplation. The colors in the image are muted, consisting mainly of deep blues and grays, reinforcing the sense of calm and stillness in a secluded natural setting.","title":"Farm pasturage adjacent to Nelson Road near Tracyton increased land use pressure for this area and others like it are expected when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby.
