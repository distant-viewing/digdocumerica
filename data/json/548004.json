{"path":"548004.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a logging scene where numerous large logs are floating in water. The logs are densely packed together, creating a makeshift surface that extends across the body of water. The logs vary slightly in color and size but are generally large and cylindrical. Many have rugged, textured bark, with ends that are cleanly cut, showing the lighter colored wood beneath.\n\nIn various positions on and among these logs, there are people who seem to be workers involved in the logging operation. They appear to be handling the logs, possibly organizing or preparing them for transportation. Each individual is dressed in work attire suitable for outdoor, manual labor, such as jeans and rugged jackets.\n\nThe setting seems to be a natural water body, likely a river or lake, bordered by a visible landmass in the background that is quite indistinct due to the focus on the foreground. The overall scene gives an impression of active, manual labor in a rugged, outdoor environment. The sky is overcast, casting diffuse, soft light across the scene, which enhances the natural and raw feel of the logging activity.","title":"Log raft on the Willamette River at Oregon City","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548018","550326","552178","552161","545037","550325","545036","548148","552197","545266","552163","552176","548162","542921","553612","554419"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["log","logging","labor","landmass","bark","position","end","worker","impression","water"]}
