{"path":"548708.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a majestic view looking up at a large tree from its base. The tree, dominating the frame, has a thick trunk with a rough, textured bark. The trunk extends upward into a network of large branches that spread out broadly, supporting a dense canopy of leaves. The perspective from the ground up gives a sense of the tree's impressive height and scale.\n\nThe canopy is lush and filled with small, intricate leaves, filtering the light from the sky above. This creates a silhouette effect against a relatively bright background, where patches of the sky are visible through the leaves. The color palette consists of dark hues of the tree trunk and branches, and lighter green and blue hues in the leaves and sky, respectively. The overall composition and angle give the photograph a dynamic and somewhat ethereal quality, emphasizing the natural beauty and grandeur of the tree.","title":"One of key largo's remaining mahogany trees.
