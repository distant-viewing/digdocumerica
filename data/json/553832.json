{"path":"553832.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and serene sunset scene with an airplane silhouetted against a golden sky. The airplane, which appears to be a commercial airliner, is in flight, descending towards the left of the frame. Its form is outlined clearly by the backlighting of the setting sun.\n\nThe background features a city skyline composed of various buildings of differing heights, creating a jagged horizon line against the sky. The tallest buildings are concentrated towards the center of the image. Behind them, the silhouette of a mountain range can be subtly discerned, adding depth to the scene.\n\nThe colors in the sky transition smoothly from warm yellow and orange near the horizon, where the sun is setting, to a darker, somewhat purple hue towards the top of the frame, indicative of the evening sky. The overall atmosphere is serene and somewhat reflective, typified by the calm and beautiful end of a day. The image evokes a sense of quietude and transition, with the airplane possibly signifying travel or the ending of a journey.","title":"Sky Harbor International Airport.
