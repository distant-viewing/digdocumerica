{"path":"544355.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph captures a dramatic view of a series of electricity transmission towers stretching across a vast, natural landscape at what appears to be either dawn or dusk. The main focus is on a large, metallic transmission tower in the foreground, characterized by its angular, geometric design. The tower is constructed of steel and designed in a triangular shape with cross-bracing, supporting numerous power lines that sag in graceful curves between the towers.\n\nThese lines extend towards the horizon, drawing the eye along their path across the landscape. There are multiple towers, diminishing in size and detail in the distance, reinforcing the depth and scale of the installation within its environment.\n\nThe setting is a wide, open field with sparse vegetation, predominantly low-lying shrubs and grasses, under a vast sky that slowly gradients from a lighter hue at the horizon to a deeper blue overhead, indicating early morning or late evening light. There are hills or low mountains in the distance, which add layers and texture to the background, and hint at the rural or possibly wild nature of the location.\n\nThe overcast sky, combined with the natural terrain and the industrial elements introduced by the power lines and towers, creates a contrast between technology and nature, suggesting themes of human influence and the reach of modern infrastructure into various environments.","title":"Power lines","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["549110","553028","553830","549011","555574","543728","548136","544300","543903","557977","546389","544405","544613","544296","547940","542643"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["tower","transmission","power","reach","line","electricity","influence","overhead","installation","technology"]}
