{"path":"550593.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents a dramatic aerial view of a river valley landscape. Visible prominently in the image is a wide, serpentine river that meanders intricately through the landscape, creating a complex pattern of water channels - some areas are broad and flowing while others appear shallower, with sand and silt deposits visible. The river originates from the foreground and extends toward the background, slowly disappearing into the cloud-covered horizon.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is diverse; there are areas covered with dense, dark green forests, suggesting a rich, moist environment. Other parts, especially closer to the river banks, are more barren, likely due to the shifting nature of the river altering the landscape. The mountains in the background rise steeply, their tops obscured by heavy, moody clouds suggesting an overcast weather condition that perhaps is common in this region. \n\nA road can be seen in the upper right part of the image, carved into the forest and following the curve of the landscape, indicating human presence and access through this remote area. The overall mood of the photograph is somewhat somber and secluded, highlighted by the muted colors and the overcast sky. This setting likely indicates a region that experiences significant natural water flow variations, possibly influenced by seasonal rains or snow melts from higher elevations.","title":"Site of pump station #10 just north of the denali fault's intersection with the delta river valley and the pipeline route view north.
