{"path":"547923.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph shows a severely damaged and abandoned car on a sandy beach. The car, which is a vintage model based on its design, is extensively wrecked. The vehicle's body is dark colored, mostly blue, with considerable damage: the windows are shattered, the roof is severely dented and partially peeled away, and the body panels are bent and rusted. Both the hood and trunk lid are missing, exposing the car's internal components.\n\nThe scene around the car includes a snowy and icy beach scattered with small stones and shells. In the background, the ocean is visible, along with a wooden pier. The backdrop also features vacant beachfront properties, which seem to be apartment buildings or hotels, standing isolated and appearing somewhat desolate. The sky is overcast, adding to the bleak and abandoned feeling of the scene. The overall composition conveys a sense of neglect and desolation, possibly suggesting this area has faced severe weather or economic hardship.","title":"Sand covers abandoned car on beach at Breezy Point south of Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547601","547035","547484","545304","547481","546318","552996","549107","547835","547839","547869","543680","553007","546406","548752","547605"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["car","hardship","beach","lid","hotel","shell","hood","apartment","desolation","damage"]}
