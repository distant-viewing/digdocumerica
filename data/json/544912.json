{"path":"544912.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural scene featuring a vibrant, leafy tree growth on a small patch of land in the foreground, alongside a body of water. The tree appears fluffy with plenty of foliage that takes on a soft pinkish hue, possibly due to the lighting or the type of vegetation. Directly behind the tree, red rocky outcrops form a dramatic backdrop with varied erosion patterns, showcasing the distinct stratification common in canyon areas.\n\nThe rocks are primarily in deep shades of red and brown, punctuated with darker patches that might indicate moisture or shadow zones. The gentle river in the foreground reflects some of the color tones from the surroundings, enhancing the serene and somewhat isolated feel of the setting. The environment suggests a canyon river ecosystem, likely characterized by a hot and arid climate juxtaposed with the life-giving river. The overall composition of the photograph, with its natural color contrast and the layered perspective of water, vegetation, and rock, creates a tranquil yet rugged landscape scene.","title":"Tamarisk tree beside the Escalante river","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["545301","544929","552692","545719","543789","543793","545640","548156","545632","542583","543647","544887","544921","545754","552548","543185"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","stratification","pinkish","outcrop","rock","canyon","moisture","leafy","zones","punctuate"]}
