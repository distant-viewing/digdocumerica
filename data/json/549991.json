{"path":"549991.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling urban scene dominated by a large, historic building with a green roof and a small dome topped with a weathervane. This building appears to be an important or focal structure, possibly a market or municipal building, given its prominent architectural style and central position in the image. It features a symmetrical facade with multiple windows and a series of flags, perhaps indicating its significance.\n\nSurrounding the main building, the scene is busy with activity. A variety of vintage cars from what appears to be the mid-20th century fill a parking lot and the surrounding streets, suggesting this photo was taken some decades ago. There are also several pedestrians visible, walking across the streets and along the sidewalks, contributing to the lively urban atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, other architectural elements include a high-rise building with a distinctive clock tower, adding a vertical dimension to the cityscape, and another large structure under construction, covered with scaffolding.\n\nThe overall composition is vividly colored with a clear blue sky, hinting at a sunny, busy day in a bustling city center. It captures a moment of everyday life, emphasizing the architecture and activity associated with a thriving urban environment. The photo is taken from a slightly elevated angle, providing a comprehensive view of the scene.","title":"Faneuil Hall (center) and Customs House Tower (right)","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["556020","546745","546743","553840","549974","548318","549659","547210","549679","551507","546440","551493","553845","549662","556030","550138"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["building","dimension","scaffolding","clock","dome","street","market","significance","decade","flag"]}
