{"path":"542856.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial logging scene with several individuals and a log-laden truck. A large semi-truck painted in blue and white colors dominates the left side of the frame. The truck is equipped with oversized tires and dual exhaust pipes, indicative of heavy-duty machinery, and is hauling a massive load of enormous tree logs secured by chains.\n\nIn the backdrop, the sky is partly cloudy with patches of blue visible, suggesting a break in the weather or a clearing storm. The ground is muddy and scattered with puddles, reflecting recent rain.\n\nOn the right, atop the pile of logs, is a man wearing a dark jacket and a hat. He appears to be overseeing the loading or securing of the logs, standing confidently with one hand perhaps holding a tool or supporting himself. Below him, on the ground, another individual, dressed in dark clothing and seemingly in sync with the operation, watches the process or communicates with the man above.\n\nThe overall composition highlights the rugged nature of lumber work and the scale of the operations, contrasting the human figures against the massive logs and robust machinery. The setting and attire of the individuals suggest a cold or temperate climate, likely in a rural or semi-rural logging area.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545046","553631","554419","542855","542616","554416","552202","554418","552583","542790","555154","548155","542854","542857","555472","554427"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","logging","truck","laden","haul","exhaust","machinery","lumber","individual","oversee"]}
