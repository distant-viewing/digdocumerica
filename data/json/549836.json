{"path":"549836.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of a man walking on a paved street. He is dressed in dark pants and a white t-shirt, and is seen from above which obscures a full view of his face. The man is bending slightly forward, carrying a box in his right hand, which seems to be balanced or supported by his left hand. An old-fashioned broom with a wooden handle and natural bristles lies on the ground next to him. To the left side of the frame, there is the rear section of a dark-colored, vintage car, visible partially and parked adjacent to the sidewalk. The pavement itself is textured and shows signs of wear with various specks, spots, and slight discolorations. The overall scene suggests a moment of daily life, potentially from a past decade given the style of the car and broom.","title":"Local \"super\" sweeps sidewalk in front of his building on 172nd Street in Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549845","552748","547816","543890","543037","549867","556733","549850","558307","547820","551869","549277","556177","547310","550128","550118"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["broom","discoloration","handle","dark","speck","pavement","hand","decade","car","box"]}
