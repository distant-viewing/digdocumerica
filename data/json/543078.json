{"path":"543078.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and misty beach scene. The beach is covered in smooth, wet sand with visible patterns created by the wind or the receding tide. Scattered across the foreground and middle of the image are various objects: a prominent driftwood piece stands vertically, creating a striking visual anchor on the right side, and several large, rounded and mossy rocks are dispersed around the space. A couple of objects that appear to be large tree trunks or possibly deceased marine life (such as seals), contribute to the natural, somewhat desolate ambiance.\n\nIn the background, amidst a foggy, diffuse atmosphere that merges the sky with the horizon, a solitary figure can be seen walking near the water's edge. The figure is small and distant, adding a sense of scale and solitude to the expansive beach. The ocean is calm, with gentle waves, and it extends horizontally across the image, its details shrouded in mist.\n\nOverall, the scene is quiet and contemplative, with a somewhat melancholic or introspective mood enhanced by the overcast sky and the diffuse, soft light. The elements in the photograph—water, rock, wood, and human—combine to reflect a natural, untouched coastal environment.","title":"Rock, fish, driftwood","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542887","542886","546953","542884","543069","542889","546970","543091","543244","543081","542890","543287","548051","543075","548757","544989"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["anchor","beach","mossy","figure","driftwood","tide","object","rock","wind","couple"]}
