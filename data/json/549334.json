{"path":"549334.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph presents a man engaging in the activity of baiting or possibly cleaning a large amount of small fish, likely sardines or a similar type, on the deck of a boat. The man, dressed in a sleeveless white undershirt, gray trousers, and sandals, is also wearing a cap. He is focused intently on his task, kneeling beside an orange plastic container filled with these small, silver fish. Situated around him are several items pertinent to his work and the marine setting: a bottle of Coca-Cola, a can of what appears to be some oil or chemical, and block-shaped wooden objects, possibly used for cutting or storage.\n\nThe background gives a view of the boat's deck machinery and safety railings, hinting at a functional commercial or fishing vessel. The scene is likely situated on a river or a lake, considering the calm water and tree-lined distant shore visible in the background. The photograph captures a moment of everyday labor, typical in a fishing environment, emphasizing both the work's demanding nature and the tranquil setting.","title":"On the adriatic sea aboard the vila velebita ii hydrobiological research ship of the ruder boskovic institute.
