{"path":"546674.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This is an aerial photograph overlooking a significant portion of Washington, D.C., featuring prominent architectural and urban elements. On the right foreground, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial is prominently displayed, characterized by its distinctive neoclassical style with a circular marble structure and a shallow dome, surrounded by a row of columns.\n\nTowards the middle ground, the large water body visible is the Tidal Basin, known for its cherry blossoms that border its perimeter. A bridge spans across part of the basin, leading into a busy network of roads and parking areas thick with cars.\n\nThe photograph's midground is filled with a mix of mid-rise office buildings, dense areas of trees, and more expansive government buildings. Notably, the United States Capitol with its iconic dome appears in the distant center, creating a focal point that draws the viewer’s gaze across the urban landscape.\n\nThe background hints at more of the city and distant wooded areas, giving an impression of the expansive urban and suburban spread. The overall tone of the photograph suggests it was taken in either late afternoon or during overcast weather, given the diffuse lighting and soft shadows. The viewpoint suggests it might be from a high vantage point, possibly another tall building or a helicopter, providing a clear, broad perspective of the national capital’s significant landmarks and layout.","title":"Jefferson memorial (foreground) to capitol, looking east","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547268","546585","546737","546577","546570","546717","547267","546584","546679","546692","547228","547226","546613","546693","546741","551137"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["dome","capital","helicopter","government","blossom","perimeter","landmarks","basin","know","overlook"]}
