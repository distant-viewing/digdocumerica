{"path":"550312.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts three men walking along a road in what appears to be an industrial or factory setting. The men, likely workers, are dressed in casual, rugged work attire including jeans and boots. Each carries a lunch box, suggesting they are either heading to or returning from a shift. They are walking in a line, with the man in the center slightly ahead, engaged in seemingly relaxed conversation or in middle of a casual moment.\n\nIn the background, the building has a prominent sign that reads \"GEORGIA PACIFIC,\" indicating the location could be a facility operated by the Georgia-Pacific company, which is known for manufacturing paper, pulp, and building products. The architecture includes a brick building with a small dome structure on the corner, alongside other industrial structure elements in varying colors including red and green.\n\nThe setting conveys a typical day at an industrial job site, with a focus on the workers in a moment of transition between work and break. The environment is utilitarian with a \"WASTE\" container visible at the right side of the frame, adding to the industrial feel of the scene. The overall composition encapsulates a slice of everyday work life in a mid-to-late 20th century industrial American setting.","title":"4 p.m. - end of a work shift at Georgia Pacific Paper Company in Woodland","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["550308","556376","546824","543995","546036","554936","556339","544022","555236","543651","556893","542989","553160","551921","557388","555561"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["worker","work","job","lunch","return","manufacture","walk","dome","company","shift"]}
