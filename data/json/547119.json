{"path":"547119.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a dramatic coastal scene with a storm heavily impacting the area. In the foreground, there's a substantial, dark-colored house, with a traditionally pitched roof and a visible chimney, sitting very close to the water's edge. The house appears dark and sturdy, possibly constructed from wood. High waves are crashing against the shore and the side of the house, suggesting rough weather conditions and possibly a storm surge.\n\nThere is significant debris scattered in front of the house, consisting of broken pieces of wood, miscellaneous rubble, and various unidentifiable objects, indicating recent destruction possibly caused by the storm. The tumultuous sea in the background stretches across the horizon, where sky and water linings merge under a cloudy, yet partially bright sky, suggesting either an advancing or receding storm.\n\nTo the right of the frame, there are bare, leafless trees, adding to the scene's bleakness, with chilled winter or late fall vibes. These elements collectively paint a picture of a harsh natural event, impacting human habitation and the environment along a coastal area. There's a sense of isolation and vulnerability conveyed through the lonely positioning of the house against the mighty forces of nature.","title":"Violent waves have already demolished all but the shell of this house","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547085","551963","547118","552955","547040","546969","547030","547071","547079","547155","547038","547036","551953","548692","543355","552436"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["storm","house","vulnerability","wood","impact","crash","rubble","positioning","destruction","pitch"]}
