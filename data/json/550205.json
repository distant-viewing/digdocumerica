{"path":"550205.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of environmental degradation and pollution. A muddy and trash-laden waterway dominates the foreground. The water is stagnant and filled with various pieces of litter and debris, including a visible red-and-white item and wooden sticks. The banks of the waterway are also covered with rubbish and discolored earth, suggesting long-standing neglect.\n\nIn the background, a group of people is seen gathered along the edge of this polluted area. The people appear to be interacting or observing the surroundings, though their exact activities are not clear due to the distance. The setting is largely barren, with only sparse greenery visible, and the sky is overcast, casting an overall gloomy tone to the scene. This scene likely highlights a social and environmental issue in an underprivileged or affected community.","title":"Unauthorized dumping ground on lake erie, north of the easterly water treatment plant, has become a breeding ground for rodents","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["544810","555547","547524","552127","551429","547907","545945","556419","550812","550800","550352","551077","551440","551531","552811","550946"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waterway","rubbish","gloomy","muddy","stick","pollute","degradation","issue","trash","litter"]}
