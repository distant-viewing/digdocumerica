{"path":"554137.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic and expansive outdoor landscape, viewed from an elevated point. In the foreground, there is a large circular stone or metal object, which looks somewhat like an ancient compass or dial. It has directional arms radiating from a central point, pointing in different compass directions, though the exact function is unclear from the image alone.\n\nIn the middle ground, descending from the viewpoint, there's a rugged terrain covered with low-lying grasses and intermittent shrubs. The area appears to have experienced some type of burning; the vegetation seems sparse and scorched, and there is visible smoke or steam in the far background, suggesting recent volcanic or fire activity. The landscape also features a few bare, leafless trees, stark against the scenery.\n\nSeveral people are present in the scene, making their way along paths or scattered throughout the landscape. They appear to be exploring or hiking, facing towards the smoke or steam in the distance, which adds an element of discovery or investigation to the photograph.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is one of mystery and rugged natural beauty, with a hint of desolation due to the charred landscape and sparse vegetation. It might be a volcanic area or a natural reserve recovering from fire, as indicated by the conditions of the environment and the interest of the visitors. The image evokes a sense of adventure and the resilience of nature.","title":"Mauna Loa (upper left), in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park still throws out smoke from its most recent eruptions.
