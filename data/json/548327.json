{"path":"548327.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph appears to be an aerial view of a busy port area set against a waterway. In the foreground, you can see dark waters surrounded by land areas covered with various types of maritime infrastructure. There is an array of docks, several types of vessels including tugboats and possibly cargo ships, and cylindrical storage tanks indicating an industrial area, possibly for fuel storage.\n\nSeveral smaller boats are scattered throughout the waterways, actively navigating or stationed by the docks. On the right side, a large land mass protrudes into the water, covered with more industrial facilities and connected by what appears to be a bridge or walkway over water.\n\nIn the background, the skyline is slightly blurred but visible, depicting a cityscape that could potentially be notable but is indistinct due to the perspective and atmospheric conditions. A notable landmark, which appears to be the Statue of Liberty, can be seen on a small island in the midground of the image, suggesting that this port could be located in New York Harbor.\n\nThe environmental lighting in the photo suggests it might be taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, as the light appears soft and the color palette is muted with blues, greys, and rustic browns. The overall atmosphere gives a historical feeling to the image, capturing a dynamic industrial and maritime scene.","title":"Abandoned small boats and barges rot in Fresh Kills, Staten Island.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555773","555764","550906","551609","555766","552020","555760","546925","555726","547998","551577","548320","555724","547061","549892","548346"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["port","waterway","dock","storage","type","mass","fuel","land","tugboat","landmark"]}
