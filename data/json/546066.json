{"path":"546066.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene wetland scene at dusk or dawn, as indicated by the soft, dim lighting. The primary feature of the photo is a calm body of water reflecting the sky and surrounding vegetation. The water is relatively still, with minimal ripples, suggesting a tranquil setting.\n\nStanding prominently within the water are several dead trees, devoid of leaves and with branches reaching starkly into the sky. These weathered tree trunks, with their bleached appearance, create an eerie, yet striking contrast against the darker tones of the live, leaf-filled trees in the background.\n\nBordering the water are various types of dense shrubbery and trees, suggesting a rich, natural environment that is possibly teeming with wildlife, although no animals are visible in this shot. The flora appears lush and contributes to the overall sense of seclusion and untouched nature.\n\nIn the water, nearer to the foreground, there is a large object that might be a rock or stump, adding a sense of depth and layering to the composition. It disrupts the mirror-like reflection on the water, adding texture and interest.\n\nThe sky, though barely visible through the foliage, seems clear with possible hints of color change, indicating the time of day might be when the sun is low in the sky. Light sparkles off the surface of the water, creating a tranquil and slightly mysterious ambiance.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a beautifully somber and contemplative landscape, emphasizing themes of natural beauty and decay.","title":"This area of the bayou segnette will be open to land development if the proposed interstate 410 loop (dixie freeway) is built.
