{"path":"545555.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque natural arch, viewed from a vantage point that allows the observer to peer through the arch and see further rocky landscapes beyond. The arch itself is large and has a rugged, textured surface, primarily in shades of deep red and brown, characteristic of sandstone formations. Sunlight illuminates part of the arch, highlighting its gritty texture and the vibrant earth tones.\n\nThrough the opening of the arch, a series of rounded, similarly reddish rock formations are visible in the middle ground. These formations create a rolling, almost rhythmic pattern across the landscape. This part of the view is brightly lit by the sun, indicating clear weather.\n\nIn the distance, under the archway and beyond the immediate rock formations, a vast, flat expanse stretches out, suggesting a desert-like environment that fades into a hazy blue horizon under a light sky. This suggests that the photograph might have been taken in a high desert region, characteristic of locations in the American Southwest.\n\nIn the foreground, just within the shadow of the arch, a person in dark clothing is visible. The individual appears quite small compared to the grandeur of the arch and the landscape, providing a sense of scale and emphasizing the massiveness of the natural structures. This person seems to be climbing or descending on the slope of the rock, participating in outdoor or adventurous activities, common in such natural, rugged environments.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its framing by the arch, the layering of rock formations, and the inclusion of a human element, combines to depict a scene of natural beauty and human interaction with a wild and rugged landscape.","title":"Double O Arch, one of many windows carved into vertical redrock by centuries of erosion.","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545563","545572","544939","545568","545580","545566","544935","545584","553077","545578","545585","545554","545711","545550","545573","545574"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["arch","formation","rock","desert","layering","sandstone","archway","observer","peer","inclusion"]}
