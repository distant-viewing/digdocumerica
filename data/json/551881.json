{"path":"551881.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a busy scene of people using an outdoor escalator on a rainy day. This escalator appears to be in an urban setting, as it is flanked by buildings, possibly in a transportation hub or near a public square, as suggested by the names noted at the top - \"Neuhauser-Straße · Kaufingerstraße · Marienplatz.\"\n\nPeople of various ages are captured in this image, predominantly dressed in coats and hats suitable for rainy weather. Many people are holding umbrellas, ranging in color and patterns, which add bright splashes of color to the otherwise overcast atmosphere. There is a mix of umbrellas including colorful ones and standard dark tones.\n\nThe crowd is diverse, consisting of both men and women in a range of attire from more formal coats and hats to more casual or functional rain-proof wear. The individuals present show a range of expressions and appear to be going about their day despite the wet weather, indicating a scene of urban routine. Some people are interacting or looking around, while others focus on ascending or descending on the escalator.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a typical urban, rainy day with people commuting or traveling, using umbrellas to shield themselves from the rain, moving along in a fluid, everyday choreography dictated by the escalator's movement.","title":"Arrivals and departures at an underground station.
