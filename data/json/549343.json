{"path":"549343.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph shows two men working to pull in a large fishing net aboard a boat. Both men are shirtless, wearing white pants, and have their backs to the camera as they use their strength to haul in the net. Their bodies are muscular and they are visibly exerting effort, suggested by their muscular torsos which are tense and flexed. \n\nThe net itself is suspended from a metal pole or boom, bulging under the weight of its catch, and is adorned with several floats arranged along its upper edge. It is made of a mesh material, typical of fishing nets, appearing heavy and laden. \n\nIn the background, the calm sea stretches out to the horizon under a light blue sky, indicating good weather conditions for fishing. The composition focuses on the physical effort involved in fishing and the vastness of the ocean around the fishermen, highlighting their work in a natural setting. The scene portrays a moment of active labor in the marine environment, capturing both the hard work and the natural setting in harmony.","title":"Scientists on the hydrobiological research ship, the Vila Velebita II, on the Adriatic Sea.
