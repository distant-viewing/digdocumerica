{"path":"555437.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a busy multilane highway viewed from an elevated perspective, likely from a bridge or another highway section. The setting appears to be in the daytime with moderate lighting, possibly during dusk or due to overcast weather given the slight dimness and shadows on the road.\n\nThe road stretches into the distance, with several vehicles of various designs and colors distributed across the lanes. The vehicles mainly appear to be from the 1970s or 1980s based on their body styles, featuring both cars and vans. The lanes are demarcated by white dashed lines which are distinctly visible against the dark asphalt.\n\nIn the distance, there are green highway signs indicating exits or directions, mounted on overhead structures across the road. These signs are not readable in the image but contribute to the typical highway setting.\n\nThe peripheries of the highway are not clearly visible but suggest a lack of immediate urban or residential buildings, hinting that the location might be a suburban or an outskirts area.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the flow of traffic and a common scene on a typical American highway, highlighting automotive travel and road infrastructure.","title":"Traffic on interstate #5 was less than normal on the first sunday afternoon of the nationwide ban on gasoline sales in december 1973","placename":"Wilsonville (Or.)","location":"Wilsonville, Oregon","nn1":["547811","549890","542764","557471","556785","547569","557230","545884","555505","556194","553727","546686","546681","544723","545455","548084"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","road","lane","dash","multilane","demarcate","periphery","1980","distribute","asphalt"]}
