{"path":"547024.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of decay and abandonment in a natural environment. At the forefront, there is a collection of various discarded items including an old rusted car, parts of which are scattered and sunk into the ground. The car's front grill and a detached car seat are noticeable among the debris. Nearby, a large, grey, metallic box and other unidentifiable junk piled up create a sense of clutter and neglect.\n\nThe location appears to be near a body of water, as suggested by the presence of water and grassy wetlands visible in the background. Several large, moss-covered trees with gnarled branches further enhance the wild and overgrown feel of the setting. These trees cast shadows and add a sense of depth and texture to the scene.\n\nThis area has the look of a wetland or swamp, characterized by the thick tree trunks, abundant green vegetation in the distance, and the damp, marshy ground, littered with pine needles and leaves, indicating a natural setting that has become a dumping ground for human refuse. The atmosphere evoked is one of serene neglect, where nature slowly reclaims the artifacts left by humans.","title":"Littered beach on Hilton Head Island","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["552102","544060","546405","550795","549307","542590","553009","555851","553007","551497","554536","546173","548751","547587","552073","549107"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["wetland","swamp","car","grill","artifact","clutter","refuse","needle","ground","seat"]}
