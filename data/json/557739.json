{"path":"557739.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals tubing on a river. The river is shallow with visible rocky patches, and its water appears clear, reflecting some light. The setting is a sunny day, indicated by the bright exposure and shadows on the water.\n\nOn the left, a young person in a light-colored t-shirt, dark pants, and a red baseball cap is maneuvering their black inner tube, half-standing as they seem to adjust their position or gain stability. Directly opposite, on the right, sits another individual in a light gray t-shirt and red polka-dotted headwrap, comfortably seated within their black inner tube. Both individuals appear engaged and occupied by their activity in the water.\n\nThe background features lush greenery extending up a slope, terminating at a road lined with a guardrail visible at the top of the bank. The natural setting and recreational activity suggest a leisurely and casual atmosphere amidst a scenic outdoor backdrop.","title":"Two youths on truck inner tubes floating down the Chattahoochee River at Helen. This is one of the favorite summer pastimes for the young residents of the small mountain community of some 270 people. In 1969 local officials, businessmen and residents endorsed the Renovation of the business district with a Bavarian Alpine theme. Success of the project attracted new businesses and a surge of tourists. Children are afraid new development will threaten use of their favorite swimming hole.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557738","545941","545933","554903","549438","549441","543946","549996","553439","554465","545734","557740","545908","543881","549461","543943"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["tube","polka","stability","guardrail","individual","baseball","standing","t","river","position"]}
