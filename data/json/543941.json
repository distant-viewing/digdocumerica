{"path":"543941.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sailing scene with two small sailboats on a body of water, likely a lake or calm river. The foreground features a man actively sailing a boat, labeled with the number \"9 52\" on its sail. The sail is mostly white with a grayish-green triangular pattern. The sailor, a focused young man, wears a white T-shirt and khaki shorts, concentrating on handling the ropes of the sail.\n\nTo the right, partially obscured by the foreground sail, is a second sailboat with a distinctively patterned sail: a red top and bottom separated by a white middle section with a dark circle containing a design, and \"US 343\" printed on it. This sailboat also carries a sailor, though only part of this person is visible, appearing to be in a relaxed posture while seated.\n\nThe background is blurred but shows a lush green tree line under a slightly overcast sky, indicating a tranquil, natural setting. The overall composition emphasizes the focus and isolation of recreational sailing in a peaceful, natural environment.","title":"Participants in the spring regatta of the Louisville Sailing Club","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["548517","548521","548510","544669","552345","549425","548514","549423","544224","548519","547757","543936","544663","548203","547273","552346"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","sailor","sailing","khaki","circle","rope","number","short","bottom"]}
