{"path":"553259.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant night scene with a densely packed crowd of people at an outdoor event. The lighting in the scene imparts a reddish hue which casts a warm, moody glow over the attendees. The illumination appears stronger in the central area, making the figures there more noticeable, and fades into more shadowy outlines as it reaches the periphery of the image.\n\nThis large gathering of people is engaged in what seems like a social or entertainment event, possibly a concert or an open-air festival, indicated by the casual attire and the overall ambiance. The crowd is diverse, with individuals of varying ages and styles, indicating a public, inclusive event. Although individual features are not clearly discernible due to the dim lighting and motion blur, the aggregation and the demeanor suggest a lively and active gathering.\n\nIn the background, a few trees are faintly visible, lit up by ambient or decorative lighting, contributing to a festive environment. There are no distinct structures visible in the immediate backdrop, suggesting that the event is happening in an open, possibly green space.\n\nOverall, the composition and the low-light photography create an impression of motion and collective enjoyment, capturing the essence of a nocturnal gathering enjoying a communal experience.","title":"August brings the \"D'aug Days\" to Fountain Square. \"D'aug Days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
