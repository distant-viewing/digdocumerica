{"path":"552590.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an educational setting where a woman appears to be teaching a small group of children. The woman, dressed in white pants and a decorative light-colored blouse, is interacting with a large, colorful learning board. The board is filled with words in various colors, designed to aid in teaching language or reading skills.\n\nThere are three children sitting in front of the teacher, focusing on the lesson. They seem to be of different ages. The youngest, a boy wearing a light colored short and khaki pants, is seated on a small bench, holding something close to his mouth, possibly a snack. Next to him, another boy is attentively watching the teacher. The third child, partly visible and seated behind a red box with “Jones English Records” printed on it, is also paying attention to the teacher.\n\nThe setting is an indoor classroom or similar learning environment, characterized by wooden floors and walls that give a slightly rustic or dated appearance. There is a blackboard in the background, indicating an educational facility. This setup suggests a focused, yet informal learning atmosphere, where the teacher uses interactive materials to engage the children actively in their learning process.","title":"Rock School, built in 1897, still serves the children of the Piceance Creek area.
