{"path":"542629.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, a small weasel-like animal appears prominently in the center, captured against a rugged and uneven dirt terrain. The animal stands upright on its hind legs, maintaining an alert posture as it faces forward towards the camera. Its body exhibits a smooth coat with reddish-brown fur covering the upper body and a lighter, cream-colored fur on the underside and part of the face. The creature's eyes are dark and round, giving it a curious and attentive expression.\n\nThe backdrop is relatively uniform, consisting of a dry, cracked earth surface that suggests a natural, possibly arid environment. The lighting on the scene casts a warm hue over the landscape, enhancing the reddish-brown tones of both the ground and the animal. Shadows and texture on the terrain indicate a combination of small pebbles, dirt clods, and sparse patches of dried grass or vegetation, contributing to the rustic and natural feel of the setting.\n\nThis image captures a moment of quiet yet keen observation, likely of the photographer, by a small wild animal in its native habitat. The composition focuses squarely on the animal, utilizing a shallow depth of field that slightly blurs the background, directing the viewer's full attention to the sharp details of the animalâ€™s features and expression.","title":"In order to eradicate squirrel colonies, poisons were added to grain.
