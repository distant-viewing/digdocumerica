{"path":"557381.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a moody, atmospheric scene of an industrial setting during twilight. In the foreground, the dark silhouettes of buildings and infrastructure typical of industrial environments can be seen. Prominent among them is a large factory or plant structure with a tall chimney from which dense smoke is billowing upwards. The smoke rises high into the dusky sky, creating a noticeable contrast against the fading light.\n\nThe background features rolling hills, which are only subtly visible due to the low lighting. They appear as dark masses against the sky, enhancing the sense of a secluded, enclosed valley typical of industrial towns. The sky itself is tinted with hues of purple and orange, indicative of the sun setting or rising behind the hills, contributing to the dramatic and somewhat somber mood of the scene.\n\nThere are some faint lights visible, likely from other parts of the plant or nearby buildings, which add a small touch of life to the otherwise dimly lit scene. There are no visible people or moving objects, emphasizing the static and solemn nature of the industrial landscape. The atmosphere of the photograph suggests themes of isolation, industry, and perhaps environmental impact, conveyed through the stark contrast between nature and human-made structures.","title":"Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant seen looking to the north from the railroad tracks in late evening. There has been a reduction in emissions from the metallurgical plant since it was photographed in 1973. Emissions have dropped 97.7 percent since 1967. The decrease occurred after agreement between the company and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission.
