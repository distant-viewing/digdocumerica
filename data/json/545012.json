{"path":"545012.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene natural landscape dominated by a scene of fog blanketing a low-lying area, likely a valley, which contrasts with the clearer, sunny skies above. In the distance, two rounded hills or low mountains covered with dense forests rise prominently. The upper parts of these hills are brightly illuminated by sunlight, highlighting the green of the trees, while the lower parts are partially obscured by the mist.\n\nThe foreground shows the top of a lush greenery, possibly shrubs or small trees, and this gives way to a wide expanse of fog. Just above this fog, the middle ground features a line of coniferous trees isolated by the fog from both the ground and the sky, creating an almost surreal, floating effect.\n\nThe fog in the valley appears thick and extensive, covering the land so densely that only the tips of some trees can be seen poking through. This creates a smooth, white surface that adds a mysterious or calm quality to the landscape. The general ambiance is peaceful and quiet, evoking a sense of isolation and natural beauty. The overall composition of the photograph, with layers of forest, fog, and illuminated hilltops, is visually striking, emphasizing the diverse textures and depths of the natural scene.","title":"Smog","placename":"Kiwanda, Cape (Or.)","location":"Kiwanda, Cape, Oregon","nn1":["555536","555110","542924","554647","542848","543312","545209","555132","555126","548025","552695","556587","557014","557537","543406","557575"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["fog","valley","hilltop","tip","forest","hill","tree","way","mist","shrub"]}
