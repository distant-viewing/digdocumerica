{"path":"552051.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph features a contrasting scene with a foreground focused on a tranquil marina and a background dominated by an industrial setting. The marina displays numerous small boats, mostly sailboats docked in slips with tall masts. Many of these slips appear empty, possibly indicating off-season or non-peak hours. The docks are fitted with utility pedestals and the ground is covered with various marina gears such as ropes, blocks, and possibly tarps.\n\nIn the background, the industrial landscape is marked by multiple large smokestacks emitting plumes of smoke or steam. This part of the scene is bustling with industrial activity, in stark contrast to the calm and leisurely foreground of the marina. Various large structures, possibly part of a factory or a processing plant, fill the industrial area. The sky is relatively clear with few clouds which makes the emissions from the smokestacks even more prominent.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes the industrial with the recreational, possibly hinting at the coexistence or the environmental impact of industrial activities near natural or leisure settings. This image captures a dichotomy within a single frame, providing both a serene view of leisure life and a stark reminder of industrial impact.","title":"Marina on the Buffalo waterfront on lake erie, with steel plant in background","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["543155","550221","547058","552191","551566","550870","551959","552347","545996","548107","544717","543156","552010","550937","544328","550902"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["marina","slip","smokestack","dock","leisure","pedestal","tarp","reminder","impact","mast"]}
