{"path":"545321.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid street scene set against a backdrop of urban architecture. A striking two-toned car, predominantly white with a red front and rear, is parked on the left side of the image, with its door open and a person leaning into the driver's side, possibly engaging in conversation with someone inside or adjusting something within. The rich, saturated hues of the car contrast sharply with its surroundings.\n\nAdjacent to the car stands a two-story building featuring an external staircase leading up to the second floor. The building has a rustic aesthetic with visible wood on the staircase and a balcony providing an outward view from the upper level. To the right of the image, a quaint, one-story blue building with three curtained, arched windows and a similarly arched doorway adds an element of historical charm. Both the door and one of the windows appear to be open, suggesting occupancy or activity inside.\n\nThe street in front of these buildings is quiet, nearly lacking vehicular or pedestrian traffic, except for a young girl walking alone on the sidewalk, carrying what might be a shallow bucket or a large canister in one hand. Her movement implies a casual, unhurried pace, and her presence introduces a human element to the urban environment, providing scale and life.\n\nThe foreground shows a blurred edge, possibly a passing shadow or a lower boundary (like a wall or roadside barrier) captured unintentionally, framing the base of the scene. Bright sunlight illuminates the upper halves of the buildings, giving the colors a warm, vivid appearance, emphasizing the contrast between the shadows and illuminated areas, and enhancing the texture on the visible surfaces. The overall composition captures a moment of everyday life, juxtaposing the vitality of urban elements with a hint of narrative through the actions of the child and the person by the car.","title":"Armijo Community Center","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["555944","545353","557882","557874","551913","555942","545333","549829","553488","551084","545337","552965","557288","546849","549881","551119"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["staircase","car","canister","story","vitality","door","building","pace","front","introduce"]}
