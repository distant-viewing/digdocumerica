{"path":"543375.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a snowy and rocky mountainside, where the snow appears to be melting in some areas, exposing the underlying rocky surfaces. There are several patches of small, green shrubs scattered across the landscape. Three people in winter clothing are visible; they seem to be engaging in a hiking or mountaineering activity, as they are walking along a narrow snow-covered path that winds through the rocks and shrubbery.\n\nThe terrain is steep and uneven, with large rocks and boulders jutting out between expanses of snow. The sky is not visible in the image, focusing the view entirely on the mountain slope and the activities taking place. The overall scene conveys a sense of a challenging outdoor adventure in a cold, rugged environment. The people are spread out along the path, each one at a different stage of their ascent or descent, underscoring the solitary nature of the activity despite the presence of fellow hikers.","title":"Packing expedition of explorer post 397 of Los Angeles area.
