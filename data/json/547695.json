{"path":"547695.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a moody urban scene, likely taken in the evening or on an overcast day. The image features a person, viewed from behind, walking away from the camera. This person is wearing a light-colored knee-length coat and carrying what appears to be a briefcase or a small bag, indicative of a professional setting or commute.\n\nIn the foreground, the most prominent feature is a manhole cover on the street, from which steam is billowing up. The steam covers a considerable area of the photo, adding a sense of mystery or isolation as it partially obscures the background and the walking figure. The sidewalk and the street are concrete, and the edge of the street is marked by a yellow-painted curb; both surfaces show signs of wear and are littered with small debris.\n\nThe scene is set in an urban environment, and you can discern storefronts and buildings shrouded in the steam's haze in the background. A dimly lit sign, likely belonging to a shop or a business, is partially visible through the steam on the left side of the image.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere of the photo is somewhat ominous and intriguing, emphasized by the misty steam and the solitary figure progressing into the obscured street. The lighting is subdued, contributing to the image's overall dim and mysterious vibe.","title":"Steam rising from sewer","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545396","548373","553188","551957","545368","549916","545415","552763","546498","543890","553537","546646","545351","552933","551856","557277"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["steam","street","briefcase","commute","belong","figure","storefront","curb","mystery","progress"]}
