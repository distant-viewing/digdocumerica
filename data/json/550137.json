{"path":"550137.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively scene in front of a weathered wooden house. The house's door is framed by faded siding, with the door itself boasting a dark brown color and a number above it reading \"5110.\" A \"For Rent\" sign is visible in the window next to the door, signaling the potential availability of the property.\n\nIn front of the entrance, several children are gathered in a variety of playful and relaxed poses. On the left, four boys are seen sitting closely together on the steps leading up to the door. Their expressions range from smiles to curious gazes directly at the camera. To the right, a girl with long blonde hair sits on the steps, her legs stretched out, and she appears to be looking slightly away from the camera with a neutral expression.\n\nCentered in the photograph is a large cardboard box that has been creatively transformed into a makeshift space capsule. This box is labeled with words including \"Kool Aid\" and \"Sears Kenmore Range,\" suggesting its origin from a household appliance or product packaging. There are playful modifications on the box, including painted controls and signs, making it resemble a child's imaginative interpretation of a space vehicle. A smaller child is partially visible inside this box, only his face showing through a cut-out window, enhancing the playful theme of a space mission.\n\nThe setting is further detailed with a brick pathway leading to the steps and another cardboard box on the ground that appears to be part of the children's play area. This scene captures a moment of childhood innocence and creativity, highlighted by the improvisational use of everyday items to fuel imaginative play. The environment and the children's activities suggest a narrative of simplicity, community, and the joys of childhood exploration.","title":"Jobs drew these children's parents from West Virginia to an apartment in this sub-divided old house on literary avenue","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553498","545509","551729","552958","553510","548312","556175","544424","556439","553096","552743","545436","550109","552830","551001","548441"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["box","child","door","step","childhood","cardboard","package","space","availability","transform"]}
