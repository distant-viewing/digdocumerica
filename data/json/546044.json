They are turned away from the camera, looking towards a distant industrial scene featuring multiple smokestacks. The man on the left wears a dark green jacket and pants, while the man on the right is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt, white pants, and dons a white hat. Both men carry items: the man in white has a black satchel over his shoulder, and the other man appears to have a camera or binoculars hanging off his neck.\n\nThe foreground features a wooden barrier partially submerged in water and a bright yellow box labeled \"OPERATION\" sitting on what looks like a sandy or slightly muddy ground.
