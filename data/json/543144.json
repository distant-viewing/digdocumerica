{"path":"543144.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and picturesque sunset over a body of water, likely the ocean. The sun appears prominently in the upper center of the image, radiating a soft, glowing light that reflects beautifully on the water's surface. This reflection creates a shimmering path of light that leads from the sun down to the bottom of the frame.\n\nThe horizon is slightly visible in the background, beneath the sun, featuring soft, hazy silhouettes of distant mountains or hills, possibly obscured by a light fog or mist, which adds an ethereal quality to the scene. The sky around the sun has a muted, orange-yellow hue, suggestive of twilight or the golden hour.\n\nTo the right side of the image, the dark silhouette of a rocky cliff or large rock formation juts into the frame. This adds a dramatic element to the composition, providing a sense of scale and enhancing the natural beauty of the seascape. The water has a textured appearance, disturbed by gentle waves or ripples, while the overall atmosphere of the photo is one of calm and serenity.\n\nThe image is framed in a way that places a significant focus on the interplay of light and shadow, highlighting the natural contrasts created by the sunset and the landscape. The photograph could evoke feelings of peacefulness and the sublime nature of coastal environments.","title":"The waterfront at sunset","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["557447","552294","550288","550296","544711","552277","552230","553992","544707","552335","543064","550292","547479","554074","548123","545030"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sun","sunset","disturb","silhouette","radiate","seascape","jut","serenity","peacefulness","light"]}
