{"path":"543169.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene, likely a mining or material processing facility. The central focus of the image is a large structure with several conveyors and chutes, colored in red and built at various angles, which are likely used for transporting materials.\n\nOn the left, a smaller blue building appears to house some operational units, with a staircase visible on its side. There is a large pile of a white substance, possibly a mineral or chemical, amassed near the center towards the right of the image. This pile is stark against the darker equipment and vegetation around it.\n\nA rudimentary bridge or wooden walkway crosses a small dip in the terrain filled with bushes and scattered vegetation, further pointing to an industrial operation that has altered the natural landscape.\n\nIn the background, dense, lush greenery suggests that this installation is located near a forested area, perhaps emphasizing the contrast between industrial activity and the natural environment. The sky above is clear and bright, indicating a sunny day, which brightly illuminates the entire scene. There are no visible people in the photograph, focusing the viewer entirely on the industrial elements and their environmental context.","title":"California--southern coastline","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549168","553013","544044","551037","545992","554764","551113","544048","554630","544702","551112","551036","551035","544124","555617","544036"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["pile","chute","staircase","conveyor","material","installation","substance","mineral","chemical","walkway"]}
