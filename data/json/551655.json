{"path":"551655.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph shows a scene in an urban outdoor setting, likely in a plaza or open space surrounded by high-rise buildings. The main foreground focuses on a black sheep standing inside a small, fenced area, with a white floor and wire mesh panels. Two people, a woman to the left and a man to the right, are leaning over the fence, engaging with the sheep. The woman is pointing at the sheep while holding a camera in her other hand, suggesting she might be taking a photo or preparing to do so. The man appears to be just observing or talking.\n\nIn the background, there's a wide ledge where multiple people are seated casually, some with their legs dangling off the edge. They are sitting against the backdrop of a towering building with a reflective glass facade that mirrors other structures and elements of the city. The environment suggests a juxtaposition of natural elements, represented by the sheep and small trees, against the urban, man-made architecture of the city. The scene has a slightly candid and casual ambiance, with people in relaxed postures and a curious interaction with the animal.","title":"Festival of folk arts and crafts at rockefeller center.
