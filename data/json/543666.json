{"path":"543666.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a mountainous landscape, prominently featuring a water drainage or discharge site. In the background, several snow-capped peaks create a dramatic skyline. The slopes are steep and mostly devoid of vegetation except for a singular leafless tree on the left side of the image. The mid-ground has scattered patches of snow, leading the eye down to where a large industrial pipe discharges water into a rocky streambed.\n\nThe discharge point is equipped with an apparent control or measurement station, indicated by a metal framework structure standing adjacent to the pipe. The streambed, filled with water flowing out of the pipe, is rocky and uneven, with glistening sunlit highlights accentuating the wet surfaces of the stones. The foreground shows the continuation of this rocky streambed, leading the viewer through the image, and suggesting a rugged, somewhat desolate terrain altered by the presence of industrial activity. The lighting and clear blue sky contribute to an overall sharp and well-defined image, emphasizing contrast between the man-made and natural elements in the setting.","title":"Water leaks from mine tailings pond at Idarado Mill","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["543670","543759","543809","543717","552134","552994","549564","543742","549065","543815","543830","550684","552349","543568","555685","544769"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["discharge","pipe","snow","drainage","measurement","continuation","alter","lead","glisten","define"]}
