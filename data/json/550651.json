{"path":"550651.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures the turbulent, frothy waters of a river or stream, featuring swirling currents and waves. The viewpoint is close to the water's surface, emphasizing the chaotic motion and the white, foamy crests that form as the water flows rapidly. The water appears muddy or sediment-rich, indicated by the dark and light brown colors mixed with white. There is no visible horizon or surrounding landscape, keeping the viewer's focus entirely on the dynamic patterns and textures of the rushing water. The overall impression is one of natural energy and the raw power of moving water.","title":"Foaming waters of the errol dam, on the upper reaches of the androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["544854","542742","553388","543563","544856","553416","552061","550742","549542","546111","549550","553855","542743","544867","557252","544862"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["turbulent","water","crest","current","swirl","keep","viewpoint","energy","stream","wave"]}
