{"path":"542582.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a detailed view of a small body of water, possibly a pond or slow-moving stream. The focal point of the image is the interaction between the dark, murky water and various forms of aquatic and surrounding terrestrial plant life.\n\nAt the center and left of the image, water ripples are visible, indicating either a disturbance in the water or a gentle flow. The surface of the water also shows several floating objects and a thin film, which might be natural oils or algae. This area is textured and feels dynamic, contrasting with the stillness of other parts.\n\nSurrounding the water are several different types of vegetation. Prominent in the foreground are what appear to be wet, algae-covered rocks and a dense tangle of black, wiry plant material â€“ likely roots or submerged branches. There is also a variety of green foliage, including small leafy branches with a brighter green hue that arch into the frame from the left side. These may be the leaves of a shrub or small tree. Additionally, there are small yellow flowers adding a touch of color to the predominantly dark and green palette.\n\nThis photograph extensively captures an intimate, natural aquatic environment, showcasing the textures and contrasts between water and plant life, giving a detailed insight into a small, possibly overlooked, ecosystem.","title":"Polluted creek","placename":"Sonora (Calif.)","location":"Sonora, California","nn1":["543561","546875","542554","543558","555626","547509","551352","554603","554623","550341","544765","549641","547541","550834","558009","550750"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["algae","water","plant","branch","insight","root","disturbance","oil","film","stillness"]}
