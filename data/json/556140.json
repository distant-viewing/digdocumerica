{"path":"556140.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up portrait of a young child. The child, who appears to be of African descent, has expressive eyes and a neutral expression. Their hair is styled with multiple small twists or braids, some of which are standing up playfully on their head. The child is wearing a light-colored, possibly white, collared shirt which is slightly visible at the bottom edge of the frame.\n\nThe lighting in the photo casts shadows across the child's face, highlighting their eyes and giving depth to their features. The background is out of focus with a smooth gradation of dark tones, ensuring that the viewer's attention is directed primarily towards the child. The overall mood conveyed by this image is one of simplicity and candidness, capturing a quiet, reflective moment.","title":"This little girl on Chicago's west side will have many hurdles to overcome while growing up.
