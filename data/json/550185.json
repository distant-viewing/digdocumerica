{"path":"550185.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a heavily industrialized landscape under a hazy, polluted sky. In the foreground, a series of power lines and possibly other utilities crisscross the view, adding a sense of clutter and industrial activity. Dominating the middle ground is a large bridge structure, which carries a hint of vehicular or train traffic. Further back, the outlines of multiple buildings and factory structures are visible, contributing to the industrial feel of the scene. Most notably, several large smokestacks emit thick, dark smoke, which billows into the sky, mixing with the ambient haze and possibly contributing to it.\n\nThe air is murky and tinged with a yellow-brown color, suggesting pollution or the presence of particulates, which cast an overall gloomy and unhealthy tone over the scene. The lighting appears to be dim, either due to the time of day or the overbearing pollution, which masks finer details and softens the outlines of structures and smokestacks. This photograph likely highlights environmental issues related to industrial pollution and its impact on air quality and visibility.","title":"Smoke over the Clark Avenue Bridge","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550181","550172","550981","550176","550982","545268","557218","550983","545265","547539","545447","546884","548321","551054","550179","550985"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["pollution","smokestack","outline","air","industrialize","mask","clutter","tinge","soften","crisscross"]}
