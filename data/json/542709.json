{"path":"542709.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph presents a tranquil rural scene, predominantly highlighting a vast field of red poppies. In the foreground, the detailed expanse of the poppy field is richly colored with bright red blossoms, with a few clumps of green vegetation sporadically interrupting the red blanket. A plain wire fence, somewhat blurred, stretches horizontally across the frame in the foreground, demarcating the boundary of the poppy field.\n\nTowards the middle ground, a single vehicle, which appears to be a classic car from around the 1960s or 1970s, is seen driving on a road that horizontally bisects the image. This road separates the sea of red poppies in the foreground from another segmented area in the middle ground, where lighter colored flowers and green patches can be seen, suggesting a more diverse flora than in the foreground.\n\nIn the background, beyond the field and the road, lies a hilly terrain. The hills are modest and sparsely covered with green vegetation, indicating a semi-arid region. Additionally, there are utility poles aligning with the road, enhancing the sense of depth and rural setting of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition and the rich color saturation give the image a vibrant, almost painting-like quality, offering a glimpse into a serene, natural landscape interrupted only by small signs of human presence and activity.","title":"Flower fields of Lompoc where many of the world's flower seeds are grown","placename":"Lompoc (Calif.)","location":"Lompoc, California","nn1":["542642","542707","545880","544574","557541","542645","542641","557433","548971","557190","544581","545040","545723","554111","554027","549182"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["interrupt","field","road","clumps","blossom","bisect","saturation","drive","separate","blanket"]}
