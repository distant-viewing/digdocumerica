{"path":"553420.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a turbulent river flowing through what appears to be a rocky landscape. The river, dominating the center of the image, shows milky, possibly sediment-laden water, suggesting either glacial input or high erosion upstream. The bank on both sides of the river is lined with large, angular rocks or possibly concrete debris, creating a stark contrast against the turbid water.\n\nThe edges of the riverbanks are uneven and rugged, indicating recent disturbances that might be natural or due to human activity. Trees and patches of greenery can be seen intermittently on the sides, partially obscured by the rocks and blending into the background, suggesting that the area might be somewhat remote or not frequently maintained.\n\nThe image quality suggests it might be a scan from an older, possibly analog source, given the grain and color saturation typical of film photography. The backdrop beyond the river and rocks is less distinct but seems to consist of dense vegetation, implying that this scene is set in a forested or wilderness area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on the natural ruggedness and possible environmental challenges within this landscape, with a significant emphasis on the texture and flow of the water and rocky terrain.","title":"Clear stream flows above the weyerhaeuser and Fitchburg paper mills","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["542743","550742","550658","548156","544856","550698","549442","553416","549550","550367","542537","550605","552061","553855","555674","553653"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["river","rock","laden","flow","ruggedness","grain","saturation","disturbance","photography","sediment"]}
