{"path":"549743.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a landfill or dump site. In the foreground, a large dump truck is pictured with its container bed tilted at a steep angle, suggesting it is in the process of offloading waste. The truck is surrounded by piles of garbage, indicating a substantial accumulation of refuse.\n\nThere is one person visible; a figure stands to the right of the truck amidst the garbage, appearing as though they might be overseeing or managing the dumping process. The figure is dressed for industrial or outdoor work.\n\nIn the background, through a haze that might be dust or smog, the silhouette of a city skyline can be faintly discerned. This background suggests an urban setting not far from the dump site itself.\n\nThe mood of the photograph is somewhat grim or melancholic, emphasized by the muted colors and the stark contrast between the garbage-laden foreground and the distant cityscape.","title":"In time this Hackensack dump will provide park and other recreational facilities to Bergen County residents.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["549940","549945","549949","549936","549749","547208","546761","550248","547899","549746","549795","547975","543828","546238","548210","546246"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["garbage","dump","truck","laden","dumping","process","smog","site","refuse","figure"]}
