{"path":"556128.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image captures a distinct architectural detail featuring a large outdoor clock and a luminous sign, both associated with a railway station. The sign, prominently displaying the phrase \"GO BY TRAIN\" in uppercase, neon-lit letters, is mounted on a dark, overhanging roof. Below the sign and part of the same structure, there is the circular, classic-styled clock with Roman numerals and slender clock hands. Its face is bright, possibly illuminated by sunlight. The clock is framed by well-crafted, ornamented brickwork that contributes a historical or vintage feel to the overall setting. The sky in the background is a clear, deep blue, emphasizing the brightness of the clock face and the glowing letters of the sign. This suggests either a sunny day or a clear evening, enhancing the visibility and striking impact of these features geared towards travelers.","title":"Sign on the union station in Portland, Oregon, one of the 450 trains stations served by amtrak in 1974.
