{"path":"556128.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image captures a distinct architectural detail featuring a large outdoor clock and a luminous sign, both associated with a railway station. The sign, prominently displaying the phrase \"GO BY TRAIN\" in uppercase, neon-lit letters, is mounted on a dark, overhanging roof. Below the sign and part of the same structure, there is the circular, classic-styled clock with Roman numerals and slender clock hands. Its face is bright, possibly illuminated by sunlight. The clock is framed by well-crafted, ornamented brickwork that contributes a historical or vintage feel to the overall setting. The sky in the background is a clear, deep blue, emphasizing the brightness of the clock face and the glowing letters of the sign. This suggests either a sunny day or a clear evening, enhancing the visibility and striking impact of these features geared towards travelers.","title":"Sign on the Union Station in Portland, Oregon, one of the 450 train stations served by Amtrak in 1974. During that year the corporation listed 8,800 employees and operated 225 trains per day. A steady decline in ridership from the end of World War II to 1970 has been reversed since Amtrak assumed responsibility for most U.S. intercity passenger service. A total of 14.5 million passengers rode the rails in 1973.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556127","542794","555445","556129","556125","546490","556701","555410","556040","556090","556131","555964","551447","556130","546557","556123"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["clock","letter","sign","face","brickwork","phrase","traveler","neon","brightness","railway"]}
