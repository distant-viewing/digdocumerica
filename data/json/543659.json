{"path":"543659.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary figure engaged in fly-fishing amidst a vast and tranquil natural landscape. The scene is set against an expansive body of calm water that reflects a dramatic sky filled with thick, dark storm clouds. The sky's monochromatic hues suggest an impending storm, adding a dynamic and somewhat ominous tone to the scene.\n\nThe fisherman, positioned slightly to the right and towards the center of the frame, is wearing a hat and a jacket, which suggests the weather might be cool or windy. He is standing thigh-deep in the shallow water, and you can see ripples around him caused by his movement. His fishing rod is bent in a curve, indicating the action of casting or possibly having just caught a fish.\n\nIn the background, the landscape features low rolling hills with no visible trees or structures, emphasizing the remote and untouched nature of this location. The predominant colors in the image are blues and grays, enhancing the feeling of a cool, overcast day.\n\nOverall, the composition centers on the human figure against the backdrop of nature's vastness, creating a poignant contrast between the solitary activity and the expansive, moody environment.","title":"Fishing in man-made miramonte lake in southwestern Colorado.
