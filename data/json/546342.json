{"path":"546342.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, three individuals are observed engaging in an environmental or scientific activity in a small pond. The setting appears remote and natural, with a large body of water visible in the distant background, possibly a lake or a large river.\n\nThe pond where the activity is taking place is shallow and round-shaped. It's surrounded by rough terrain with some sparse vegetation and a few small stones scattered around. The soil around the pond appears dry and somewhat rocky.\n\nOne of the individuals, who is shirtless and wearing shorts, is standing in the pond and seems to be securing a large stretched-out net within the water. The other two, both wearing light-colored t-shirts and darker shorts or pants, are outside the pond, each holding one end of the net, assisting to either stabilize or measure it. Their attire suggests a casual, possibly impromptu work setting.\n\nNearby, parked on a dirt road next to the larger body of water, is an old model, light-colored station wagon, which suggests this activity might be part a field trip or scientific expedition.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of focused outdoor activity, potentially related to biology or environmental studies, under a bright, clear sky that indicates favorable weather conditions for fieldwork.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory personnel are seining in a culture pond.
