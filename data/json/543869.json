{"path":"543869.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene of a small, cascading waterfall or stream. The flowing water is the central subject; it flows downward over a series of rocky steps, creating multiple small waterfalls. The water appears dynamic and frothy, highlighting the force with which it moves.\n\nThe rocks over which the water flows are uneven and jagged, varying in color from dark gray to brown, and are wet and partially covered with moss, which suggests a moist environment. To the left side of the image, there is lush foliage, predominantly green, with leaves that glisten, indicating they might be wet, possibly from the splash of the stream or recent rain.\n\nThe overall setting appears to be a forested area as indicated by the presence of numerous plants and the greenery surrounding the water. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken on a sunny day, given the presence of highlighted areas on the water and rocks, creating a play of light and shadows which adds depth to the scene.\n\nThis serene natural setting encapsulates a peaceful yet vibrant atmosphere, typical of a forest stream, providing a sense of tranquility and the beauty of a natural water feature.","title":"Falls on the San Miguel River","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["550843","554407","545839","554408","558087","544867","545874","545882","544862","554406","554409","555073","557820","555074","545878","543172"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["stream","waterfall","water","rock","force","splash","moss","rain","step","play"]}
