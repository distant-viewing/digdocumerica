{"path":"546907.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a large industrial scene focused on an array of water pipes. These pipes are dark in color, perhaps metal, mounted with various connections and hoses. The focus is on a particular section where water is being forcefully expelled from one of these connections, causing a dramatic spray and splash, shimmering under what appears to be sunlight. This gushing water creates a textured pattern of droplets and mist, illuminated against a darker background which suggests the photograph was taken either during early morning or late evening.\n\nIn terms of composition, the image uses a vertical orientation emphasizing the height and action of the water spray. The angle of the photo provides a dynamic view of this industrial equipment, possibly from an elevated perspective, adding a sense of scale and power. The backdrop is rather dark and unobtrusive, ensuring the viewer's attention remains on the dramatic interplay between the machinery and the expelled water, without any visible human activity or other objects to distract from this central focus.","title":"Water filters at the Back River Sewage Treatment Plant which serves the Baltimore area.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["543830","546829","546767","553901","542545","556361","542990","546002","543759","557387","543810","548818","552136","555792","547578","550684"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["spray","connection","pipe","orientation","water","hose","droplet","term","splash","mist"]}
