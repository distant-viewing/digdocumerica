{"path":"543933.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a dramatic night scene showing a large fire at an industrial or storage facility. The fire is expansive with high, billowing flames and thick smoke emanating into the dark sky. It illuminates the surroundings with an intense orange glow.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a faint reflection of flames visible on what appears to be a wet surface, possibly a puddle on the ground. The scene includes a road leading up to the fire area, bordered by a large hose or pipe running along the left side, suggesting ongoing firefighting efforts.\n\nTo the left, in the midground, you can see buildings that are part of the facility, barely visible under the low light conditions and possibly evacuated. These structures are lit up by the fire but do not appear to be in immediate danger from the flames. Their architecture is nondescript, typical of industrial or utility structures.\n\nThe entire area is fenced, indicating restricted access, likely for safety and security reasons. There are no visible people in the photograph, focusing all attention on the fire and the facility's stark, nighttime setting. The quiet absence of human activity juxtaposed with the violence of the fire creates a haunting atmosphere.\n","title":"A Texaco crude oil tank blazes against the night after being struck by lightning.","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["543900","543908","545528","543904","555160","543020","557577","543002","548854","545924","544008","551088","546017","545994","546146","555481"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["fire","flame","facility","reason","danger","security","nighttime","hose","puddle","night"]}
