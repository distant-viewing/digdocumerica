{"path":"542984.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque coastal scene with various elements that contribute to its narrative and aesthetics.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a weather-worn wooden fence, suggesting boundary or private property. Attached to this fence is a conspicuous sign stating “RAW SEWAGE THIS BEACH QUARANTINED,” in bold, black lettering on a white background, indicating environmental or health concerns in the area.\n\nAlong the path, next to the fence, two people are seen walking away from the viewer. The individual on the left appears in a darker outfit, potentially carrying a bag, while the person on the right wears a red outfit and is holding perhaps a purse or a camera. Their presence adds a human touch and may raise questions about their awareness or disregard of the warning sign.\n\nBeyond the fence, the middle ground presents a lush field with patches of bushes and wildflowers leading up to the edge of a cliff. The cliff itself is a dramatic backdrop, swooping down to an enclosed cove where waves break against the rocky shore.\n\nIn the background, the ocean fills the scene behind the cliffs, contributing a feeling of isolation and untouched nature, contrasting with the warning of pollution presented in the foreground.\n\nThe scene is bathed in bright sunlight, suggesting it's a clear day, which illuminates the vibrant green of the grass and the rough textures of the cliff, enhancing the natural beauty of the landscape despite the disturbing presence of a quarantine sign. The overall composition balances elements of natural beauty and environmental caution, offering a thought-provoking combination.","title":"Mendocino Beach has passed a sewage treatment plant bond issue after many years of dumping raw sewage on the beach.","placename":"Mendocino (Calif.)","location":"Mendocino, California","nn1":["553861","550280","547836","548617","547602","543389","545122","553772","543299","543287","543297","543420","543289","544263","547607","543291"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["cliff","fence","warning","outfit","disregard","cove","awareness","question","caution","purse"]}
