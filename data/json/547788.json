{"path":"547788.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s, based on the style of clothing and vehicles. Several pedestrians are crossing a city street. The group exhibits a range of fashion styles, indicative of that era, including dresses, skirts, trousers, and a blend of more formal and casual attire.\n\nOn the sidewalk, there's a notable presence of newspaper vending machines labeled \"Evening,\" \"The Dallas Morning News,\" and \"The Dallas Times Herald,\" suggesting the location might be Dallas, Texas. These bright red machines add a pop of color to the scene.\n\nThe background features some tall buildings and storefronts, one prominently labeled \"Theater\" in block letters, suggesting the vicinity of a movie theater or playhouse. The street is lined with large, vintage automobiles, typical of the mid-20th century American cityscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its mix of people in motion, classic cars, and urban environment, captures the bustling atmosphere of a mid-century American city. The image is filled with midday sunlight, casting shadows on the street and highlighting the vividness of the scene.","title":"Shoppers in downtown Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["548369","556710","549906","548368","553184","549882","549923","548388","549872","550139","550142","546626","548399","554297","551125","556199"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["theater","street","machine","label","pop","midday","storefront","city","automobile","newspaper"]}
