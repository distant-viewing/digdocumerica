{"path":"548660.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man standing behind a white fence adorned with a decorative latticework design. The man is wearing glasses and a short-sleeve, button-up shirt. He is leaning slightly forward with his arms resting on the fence, looking directly towards the camera.\n\nBehind him is a large two-story house, which appears to be clad in pale blue siding. The house has multiple windows visible, including a prominent double window on the first floor and a single window on the upper story. The roofline suggests gable-end architecture. Adjacent to the house and partly obscuring it is a large, lush bush or tree dotted with bright red flowers, creating a vibrant splash of color against the house's subdued tone.\n\nThe scene is bathed in bright sunlight, suggesting a clear day with intense, natural lighting. Shadows from the tree and the house fall sharply, indicating that the photo was taken when the sun was relatively high in the sky. The overall ambiance of the scene is warm and serene, evoking a quiet, suburban setting.","title":"Resident of Key West stands in the garden of her house sturdily constructed of native wood and designed in the bahamian style, houses like this give the town much of its special charm","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["551269","556488","556603","547792","557408","549154","556489","554192","545232","546441","557094","550124","548295","552523","546435","552113"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["house","fence","story","window","bush","roofline","button","clad","siding","splash"]}
