{"path":"542687.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up of what appears to be a blade of grain, possibly wheat, oat, or barley. The central focus of the image is a single blade partially encased in its sheath, which is still attached and hugs the stalk tightly. This blade prominently displays a series of veins or striations that run vertically, hinting at its natural texture and structure. The plant is colored in shades of green with hints of yellow, indicating maturity or the onset of ripening.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, allowing the viewer to concentrate on the details of the plant without distraction. However, one can discern a setting that resembles an outdoor environment with faint horizontal lines suggesting a fence or a structure, and a muted color palette that might suggest soil or pavement.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with the plant sharply in focus against a blurred background, puts an emphasis on the texture and details of the plant, serving not just an aesthetic purpose but potentially an educational or documentary one, illustrating the plant's growth stage or health. There is also a serene quality to the image, brought forth by the simplicity and clarity of the subject against the softly out-of-focus surroundings.","title":"Smog-damaged plant at the statewide air pollution research center, university of California, plant was damaged by fumigation with 1/2 part per million of ozone for 3 hours","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["552485","555053","555184","544884","552554","558077","553361","552458","549233","557593","543852","545713","543620","557625","546156","543622"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["blade","plant","wheat","maturity","documentary","onset","encase","striation","hug","put"]}
