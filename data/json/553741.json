{"path":"553741.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene featuring the unloading of cars from a cargo ship at a port. The central focus is a large cargo crane, which is lifting four cars simultaneously along a vertical gantry system. This complex setup includes a variety of steel beams and cables, integral to the moving and positioning of cargo.\n\nThe cars, apparently new and of various models, are stacked vertically in a carrier platform, suspended along the gantry. A heavy industrial environment surrounds the operation, with the presence of other cargo, equipment, and infrastructure typical of a busy port.\n\nIn the background, the scene shifts dramatically to a more urban and natural landscape. Distant mountains loom over the city, partially covered by clouds or smog, contributing to a stark contrast between the natural and industrial elements. The skyline features a number of buildings, presumably part of the downtown area of a large city, hinting at a bustling urban environment adjacent to this industrial port setup.\n\nThe lighting suggests late afternoon with shadows growing longer, adding a mood of concluding daily activities. The image is framed vertically, emphasizing the height of the crane and the towering mountains in the distance, creating layers of depth and interest from the immediate industrial action to the distant natural and urban landscapes.","title":"AutoMobiles, like almost all supplies for the islands, are transported by ship.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["555283","555261","555285","555284","555269","546881","555271","550910","551577","555260","552013","542639","546915","555270","555273","546917"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["cargo","port","crane","setup","car","smog","unloading","positioning","city","mountain"]}
