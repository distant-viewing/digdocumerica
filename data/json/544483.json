{"path":"544483.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a serene setting in what appears to be a natural park or wetland area. A group of people can be seen standing and walking on a wooden boardwalk or deck that extends over calm, reflective water. The deck includes railings and a covered viewing gazebo, which provides shade to some of the individuals.\n\nThe people on the deck are varied in age and attire, suggesting they might be tourists. Some are wearing hats and casual summer clothing, indicating warm weather. They appear to be engaged in activities such as observing the water, talking, or walking along the deck.\n\nThe vegetation surrounding the deck is lush and dense, featuring tall grasses and typical wetland foliage. The trees and plants have bright green leaves, contributing to the feeling of a vibrant, natural environment.\n\nIn the background, there is a clear blue sky with a few white clouds, which adds to the tranquility and beauty of the scene. The reflected sky in the water enhances the soothing and picturesque quality of the snapshot. Overall, this image captures a moment of leisure and exploration in a naturalistic setting.","title":"Auhinga Trail","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544529","557985","554491","554516","545293","558094","543892","546524","553194","553415","557779","551265","552033","554477","558095","557029"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["deck","wetland","boardwalk","gazebo","walk","talk","tourist","exploration","railing","snapshot"]}
