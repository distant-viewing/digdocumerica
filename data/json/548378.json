{"path":"548378.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph features a scenic urban landscape, capturing a smoggy cityscape likely from an elevated viewpoint. The image is dominated by the iconic outline of a tall skyscraper which, given its distinctive architectural features, appears to be the Empire State Building.\n\nIn the foreground, a river or large body of water glistens under the effect of light, possibly sunlight, reflecting off its surface. Near the riverbank, there are buildings of varying sizes and architectural styles. Notably, some of these buildings exhibit rows of white steam emanating from what appears to be rooftop setups, possibly reflecting an industrial or heating process.\n\nThe overall setting is highly urban, with dense building structures and a few visible trees breaking the monotony of the urban setup. The atmosphere of the city is slightly obscured by haze or pollution, which partially shrouds the buildings and adds a misty veil to the scene.\n\nThe coloring is predominantly muted with a bluish-gray tint dominating, which may reflect the time of day or the atmospheric conditions when the photograph was taken. The skyline is filled with various other high-rise buildings, but they fade into the background, creating a layered effect that gives depth to the composition.","title":"Chimneys of the consolidated edison plant on the east river in the background is the empire state building","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555735","548345","548360","548421","548386","548337","548408","548319","548385","548365","552394","548390","548380","552395","550198","548339"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["setup","monotony","veil","heating","bluish","building","fake","effect","coloring","reflect"]}
