{"path":"554054.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a vibrant farming scene. It captures a large agricultural field, which appears to be planted with rows of crops. The terrain is rolling, and the soil has a rich reddish hue. A group of possibly five workers is seen in the field, engaging in agricultural activities near a large truck. The truck is light brown and has a large trailer attached, suggesting it is used for transport or harvesting purposes.\n\nThe field spans over a vast area with minimal vegetation besides the cultivated crops. The background contrasts sharply with the bold blue of the sky above the horizon, emphasizing the isolation and expansive nature of the landscape. The lighting in the photograph gives a warm tone to the scene, highlighting the textures and colors of the earth and vegetation. Overall, the image beautifully illustrates a moment of agricultural activity within a scenic, natural environment.","title":"Aerial view of a tract of pineapple saved from urban development. Maui land developers petitioned the Land Use Commission (LUC) for reclassification of 659 agricultural acres. In August, 1970, the LUC approved only 300 acres. The decision was applauded by those who fear overdevelopment of the fast-growing area.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["544548","554017","555619","548820","554015","543481","544552","557521","557478","554056","555874","553665","554202","548898","553659","543845"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["crop","field","truck","harvesting","trailer","farming","transport","vegetation","worker","purpose"]}
