{"path":"556870.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph shows a railway construction or maintenance scene. A single worker wearing a dark outfit and a safety helmet of a red-orange hue is engaged in welding or cutting operations on the tracks. The worker is bent over his work, focusing intently while standing between the steel rails, which reflect a gleam probably from the welding activity.\n\nFurther down the railway line, multiple machines aligned in a convoy extend towards the horizon, appearing to furrow or condition the tracks and the embankment area surrounding them. These large, industrial machines generate some dust and smoke, contributing to the slightly hazy atmosphere visible especially in the distant background.\n\nOn either side of the railway tracks, one can spot neatly arrayed stacks of sleepers (railroad ties) ready to be laid or having been replaced. Flanking vegetation marks the peripheries of the scene, and the background fades into a soft focus, indicating the photograph might have been taken during early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the gentle lighting.\n\nThe overall composition captures a typical moment in railway maintenance, emphasizing the ongoing work and the machinery used in such operations, surrounded by a rural or semi-rural landscape.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, gets ready to take up old track after replacing it with quarter mile sections of new rails. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556881","556883","556871","556869","556901","556861","556872","556887","556897","556878","556877","556874","556899","556859","556884","556860"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["railway","track","machine","worker","maintenance","periphery","embankment","operation","work","railroad"]}
