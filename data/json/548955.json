{"path":"548955.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor rural scene, presumably on a cattle ranch. A large group of cattle, mainly brown with white markings, is enclosed in metal fencing, specifically designed for livestock handling. The fencing forms several interconnected pens to manage the cattle efficiently.\n\nIn the background, a sparse, desert-like landscape stretches far into the distance, characterized by low grass and occasional shrubs under a vast, mostly clear blue sky. The terrain is flat, and distant mountains outline the horizon, contributing to a typical arid, western American setting.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there are several vehicles and trailers parked next to the cattle pens, possibly used for transporting the cattle or for use by ranch workers. One trailer notably has a large window and might serve as a mobile office or command center for the ranch operations. Another smaller, open metal trailer sits empty in the foreground, probably used for transporting feed or equipment.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures the essence of ranching life, emphasizing livestock management and the expansive, rugged environment in which these operations take place.","title":"Annual spring roundup of cattle raised on experimental farm operated by epa's Las Vegas national research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["553104","553100","553105","548984","549033","552567","552569","548830","548878","548828","553101","548957","552565","543634","553106","548959"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cattle","ranch","trailer","fencing","pen","livestock","transport","command","interconnect","feed"]}
