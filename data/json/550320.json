{"path":"550320.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a fish market. The image features two individuals, a man and a woman, engaged in the handling and sorting of fish. \n\nThe man on the left, wearing glasses and dressed in a striped shirt with a white apron, seems focused on packing or inspecting fish arranged in a large metal tray set within a railed cart, which contains multiple layers of trays. To his right stands an elderly woman, wearing a patterned headscarf and beige outfit. She is in the process of either selecting or inspecting the fish that lay in an open, slanted ice-filled display in front of her, paying close attention to her task.\n\nIn the background, another individual, partially visible and seemingly attending to similar tasks, adds to the busy atmosphere typical of a market setting. The environment is utilitarian with no decorative elements, solely functional with visible structural elements of the market like beams and roofing in the upper part of the frame. The focus on everyday activity and the candid capture of these routine moments highlights a typical day at the market, emphasizing the direct interaction between vendors and customers.","title":"Canning sardines at the Holmes Packing Plant in Eastport","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["554098","554095","547856","545284","545065","545198","543245","545211","544995","554093","545202","546216","552810","545064","550316","552875"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["market","fish","tray","task","apron","headscarf","vendor","customer","roofing","cart"]}
