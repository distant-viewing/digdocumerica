{"path":"554406.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene featuring a flowing stream surrounded by lush forest. The stream, occupying the central and lower portion of the image, appears to be moving rapidly, indicated by its slightly blurred surface and visible white bubbles that suggest swift movement over rocks or small rapids.\n\nAlong the banks of the stream, you can see scattered rocks and patches of bright green grass, signaling it might be spring or early summer. The trees surrounding the stream are dense, with varying shades of green leaves suggesting different types of vegetation. There are blossoms visible in the foreground, possibly from a bush or small tree, adding a hint of white and yellow to the image, which contributes to the feel of a thriving, vibrant ecosystem.\n\nThe background consists of taller trees that form a thick canopy over the area and seem to diminish in clarity with distance due to atmospheric perspective, giving depth to the scene. The light appears to be dim, possibly indicating either an overcast day or a location where the thick forest canopy is blocking some of the sunlight.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements of this photograph convey a peaceful natural setting, highlighting themes of tranquility and the untouched beauty of a forest stream.","title":"North branch of the Moose River seen from the bridge on Big Moose Road.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["555218","558085","554407","546171","555222","555076","542844","554748","555211","544861","550351","543869","551348","554525","555153","549187"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["stream","forest","canopy","diminish","bubble","rapid","blossom","rock","signal","clarity"]}
