{"path":"552099.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This image captures a scene of environmental neglect or pollution, featuring a discarded, weathered Coca-Cola sign among other debris. The sign, prominently in the foreground, has vintage styling and reads \"Drink Coca-Cola, Enjoy That Refreshing New Feeling!\" in faded red and white colors, indicating it may have been there for an extended period.\n\nSurrounding the Coca-Cola sign is a variety of trash scattered across the area, including what appears to be metal parts, pieces of paper, and other unidentifiable refuse partially obscured by dense green foliage, suggesting the location is somewhat overgrown and not regularly maintained.\n\nThe background provides a contrast with a view of a tranquil river landscape under a bright blue sky. The river is calm, with visible sandbanks and a distant shoreline covered in lush greenery, indicating a natural, possibly rural setting. This juxtaposition of natural beauty with the foreground of pollution underscores a narrative of environmental degradation.\n\nOverall, the photograph likely aims to comment on the issue of littering and its impact on natural environments, utilizing the iconic branding of the Coca-Cola sign as a poignant reminder of human consumerism and its consequences.","title":"The owner of this huge junk shop on the Kansas river in bonner springs died in 1971.
