{"path":"550097.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a busy roadside scene, likely taken in the 1970s based on vehicle models and dress style. The setting is an outdoor street environment under sunny conditions. The center of the image shows a woman dressed in a striped summer dress, who appears to be inspecting or fixing a car with its hood open. The car is a classic American sedan, parked on the roadside.\n\nTo the left of the frame, a large dark blue GMC truck is partially visible, its front end facing the viewer. Its structure suggests it might be a semi-truck or a large delivery vehicle. On the right of the image, a diverse array of vehicles is seen, including a green station wagon parked in the foreground and a camper-style trailer stationed further in the background near a grassy area.\n\nAbove the street scene, a road sign reading \"271 South Akron\" indicates the direction and destination of the next roadway, hinting that this scene takes place near or on the way to Akron, Ohio. The background is less detailed, but buildings and greenery can be seen, giving a sense of a suburban or semi-urban setting. The overall composition captures a moment of stopped motion and routine vehicle maintenance, common in a bygone era of automotive travel.","title":"Busy road - stalled car","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557684","555584","553488","557705","551021","554551","544723","556709","550093","557839","556715","552800","548355","557766","551927","555459"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["roadside","vehicle","station","camper","delivery","fix","stroot","destination","hood","dress"]}
