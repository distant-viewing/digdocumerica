{"path":"547750.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph presents a serene lakeside scene with various elements contributing to its tranquil ambiance. In the foreground, a dark brown horse stands calmly, grazing on the lush green vegetation near the water's edge. The horse is on the left side of the frame, partially framed by small trees and light foliage, which adds to the natural feel of the setting.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo is dominated by a large lake, filled with numerous sailboats scattered across the water. The boats have white sails that are fully unfurled, suggesting a breezy day ideal for sailing. The composition and spread of the sailboats suggest a leisurely day of sailing, possibly a regatta or a casual group outing.\n\nThe far background features more dense greenery, likely a forest or a park surrounding the lake. Beyond the trees on the opposite bank, one can notice a very faint outline of what might be distant towers or buildings, nearly obscured by the haze and distance, hinting at a location not far from a developed area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is peaceful and leisurely, with natural and manmade elements blending together harmoniously under a bright, clear sky, which fills the scene with light and enhances the vivid colors.","title":"Sunday afternoon at White Rock Lake, one of the city's most popular weekend resorts","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["553069","547761","544290","547754","547757","543531","547781","543726","557562","550324","543059","550778","542622","548118","552222","558093"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sailing","horse","sailboat","regatta","unfurl","lake","notice","graze","ideal","outing"]}
