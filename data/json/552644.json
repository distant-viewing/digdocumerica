{"path":"552644.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image captures two women in a room, both focused intently on decorating cakes. \n\nThe woman in the foreground is standing to the left side, with glasses and wearing a patterned dress; she is using a piping bag to apply icing to a round cake, which is on a turntable to facilitate even decoration. The concentration on her face shows dedication and precision to the task.\n\nThe woman in the background, to the right side of the frame, wears a nurse-style uniform in light blue with a white apron, and is also holding a piping bag. She looks on intently at the other woman's work, perhaps learning or waiting for her turn to decorate.\n\nThe cakes are placed on a long table, covered with a simple tablecloth, surrounded by various baking tools and other undecorated cakes, which adds to the sense of a cake decorating session or workshop environment. The room appears to be a domestic or perhaps a commercial kitchen, with a simple wood paneled and wallpapered décor typical of perhaps the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nThe setting is warmly lighted, likely artificially, giving the scene a cozy, focused ambiance. The entire composition eloquently conveys a moment of skill sharing and careful attention to culinary detail.","title":"Cake decorating class, part of continuing education program of Colorado Mountain College, meets in Rifle.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552645","558348","558352","558351","557153","552635","556824","558360","558216","558362","553525","558347","558350","544364","558378","558341"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["piping","woman","bag","room","décor","dedication","tablecloth","session","kitchen","apron"]}
