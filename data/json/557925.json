{"path":"557925.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a mechanic at work in what appears to be a garage or car repair shop. The setting is characterized by typical garage elements such as concrete walls and visible piping. The mechanic, a man wearing a light gray shirt and darker pants, is intensely focused on his task. He kneels beside a silver car, his body partly under the vehicle as he reaches towards the rear wheel area, possibly making repairs or adjustments. His expression is concentrated, and his posture indicates engagement with a complex task. There is noticeable wear on his shirt, suggesting physical labor. The car, occupying a significant portion of the frame, has a sleek design with a prominent chrome bumper and a red detail near the back wheel, contributing to its vintage aesthetic. The environment around the mechanic seems wet, perhaps from cleaning or the process of the repair, enhancing the authenticity of an active workplace setting.","title":"Service station mechanic adjusts the engine for a young woman whose vehicle had failed the emissions test at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Although the station does not have the same type of exhaust analyzer that the city uses, he will be able to adjust the carburetor to pass inspection. Emissions testing has been in effect for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons since January, 1975.
