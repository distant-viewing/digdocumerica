{"path":"553986.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of an old, rusted piece of agricultural machinery, focusing particularly on its wheels and mechanical elements. The main object in view is a large wheel with a wooden frame consisting of multiple spokes converging towards a central, rust-covered metal hub. The hub has numerous bolts and is somewhat corroded, giving it an orange-brown color. Attached to this wheel is a machinery component made of metal and partially coated in flaking rust-colored paint. A noticeable chain, also rusted, connects to this component, suggesting that it is part of a drive mechanism.\n\nThe background is less focused and mostly consists of dry, brown grass and indistinct pieces of wood and metal, which could be other parts of the machinery or scattered debris. The overall scene invokes a sense of age and disuse, portraying a once-functional piece of equipment now succumbing to the elements. The colors in the image are dominated by earth tones with a deep, rich quality to them, primarily browns, rust colors, and muted yellows, reinforcing the feeling of abandonment and decay.","title":"Remains of abandoned wagon rest beside road on the \"Pineapple Island.\" 95 per cent of Lanai is owned by Castle and Cooke (formerly Dole Pineapple).
