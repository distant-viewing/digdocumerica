{"path":"556190.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a serene maritime scene captured on a hazy day. At the forefront, there are two white sailboats on a calm indigo-tinted body of water, each with their sails fully hoisted. Both boats appear to be leisurely gliding through the water, with a few people seen onboard, casually handling the vessels' operations.\n\nIn the background, dominating the scene is a tall and iconic skyscraper, presumably part of a city's skyline. This building is tall with a dark facÌ§ade and features distinctive antennae or spires at its summit, which notably extend into the overcast sky. Behind the skyscraper, faint outlines and silhouettes of other high-rise buildings suggest the dense urban setting of a large city.\n\nThe overall composition, juxtaposing the leisurely sailboats against the bustling city backdrop, captures a moment of tranquility and human engagement with nature, set against the backdrop of urban life. This contrast emphasizes the peacefulness of the sailing activity while contextualizing it within an urban environment. The haze adds a soft quality to the image, muting the colors and contributing to the calm atmosphere.","title":"Photograph of sailboats near the Lake Michigan shoreline","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544697","550754","543305","550758","544669","544665","552347","550034","542903","547781","552234","544717","555721","552345","555800","552010"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","skyscraper","city","antennae","summit","glide","hoist","mute","spire","peacefulness"]}
