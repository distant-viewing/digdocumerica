{"path":"553514.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a heartwarming and candid moment between a woman and a person holding a raccoon. The woman, visible on the left side of the frame, is smiling broadly and wearing glasses. She has blonde hair and is dressed in a light-colored blouse adorned with a floral pattern. The focus of her attention seems to be the raccoon, which is being held by another person whose back is facing the camera.\n\nThe raccoon itself is nestled comfortably against the person’s shoulder, facing the camera but looking slightly away. The animal appears calm and relaxed in the human’s embrace, with its distinctive facial mask and bushy tail visible.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly blurred, suggesting an outdoor setting with dim lighting, possibly during dusk. This provides a serene backdrop that accentuates the intimacy and tranquility of the moment being shared among the participants. The overall composition and the expressions of joy and contentment suggest a scene of casual, affectionate interaction with a touch of whimsical delight at the inclusion of a wild animal.","title":"Mulky Square girl offers her raccoon, but it still isn't good enough to win her a place in the gang.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["543847","552610","544833","553500","546218","555531","556299","553496","553481","556562","543863","542629","551334","545214","542542","554916"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["animal","person","delight","contentment","embrace","mask","intimacy","inclusion","tail","camera"]}
