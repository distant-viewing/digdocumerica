{"path":"545087.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In this photograph, there is a middle-aged man standing confidently in a rural setting. The man is wearing a light-blue, buttoned-up work shirt with rolled up sleeves which is slightly dirty, and faded blue jeans secured with a belt. His attire suggests he might be engaged in physical or outdoor labor. He has on a baseball cap with a logo that is not clearly visible. The man is standing with his arms akimbo (hands on his hips) and has a stern or serious facial expression. He is wearing rugged work boots, suitable for outdoor activities or farm work.\n\nIn the background, there's a pastoral scene with a hint of agricultural activities. You can see parts of farm equipment to his left and a structure that could be a barn or storage shed. Further back, there's a glimpse of a field with a fence and possibly more farm buildings or silos. The atmosphere is dusty and sunlit, indicating it might be summer or in a dry environment.","title":"Washington farmer on his land with aluminium plant smokestacks in background","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549051","547277","546068","547409","547734","544250","547416","549042","549120","552864","548299","547679","548876","554203","542548","547311"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["farm","work","hip","baseball","silo","shed","barn","belt","boot","man"]}
