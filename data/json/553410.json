{"path":"553410.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene, forested landscape centering on a calm body of water, which could be a small pond or a creek. The water surface reflects the dense, green foliage of the surrounding trees. In the foreground, leaves from nearby trees slightly overhang into the top of the frame, giving a framed, intimate feel to the view. The water is dark, suggesting either depth or a shadowed environment, likely due to the dense canopy above. The setting appears to be tranquil and secluded, indicative of a natural, untouched forest area.\n\nEach side of the image is flanked with thick greenery, including a variety of trees and underbrush, which enhance the sense of seclusion and peace. The overall composition of the photograph, combined with the subdued lighting and the reflections in the water, creates a calm, reflective atmosphere. It's a depiction of unspoiled nature, inviting viewers to contemplate the quiet and beauty of a forest landscape. No human presence or artificial elements are visible, emphasizing the natural beauty of the scene.","title":"Mine Falls Park consists of three miles of attractive woodland along the shore of the Nashua River.
