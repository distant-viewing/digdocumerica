{"path":"556558.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a young boy standing outdoors. He is shirtless and wears brown trousers. The boy has messy, dark hair and is squinting in the sunlight. He holds a half-eaten piece of fruit in his right hand. Behind him, the environment appears somewhat rugged and rural with a mix of tall grasses and scattered debris. In the background, there is a wooden structure that looks old and weathered, partially obscured by foliage. The overall scene gives off a casual, summertime vibe, possibly in a backyard or a similar informal, outdoor setting.","title":"Gary mckenny, 5, son of a miner, eats a green apple in Rhodell West Virginia, near Beckley.
