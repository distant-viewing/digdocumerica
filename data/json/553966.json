{"path":"553966.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a scenic view of a coastal or lake area dominated by lush greenery and several architectural structures. In the background, there are multilevel houses built on a steep hillside. These houses feature dark wooden cladding and have large decks or balconies, suggesting a residential area that perhaps enjoys a panoramic view of the surrounding natural beauty.\n\nThe middle ground is thick with green foliage, enhancing the natural, secluded setting of the houses. This layer of vegetation serves as a barrier between the homes and the water's edge, adding privacy and a touch of wildness to the area.\n\nIn the foreground, the focus is on the calm blue water where two people are seen engaging in water activities. The person on the left is lying face down on what appears to be a bright pink surfboard or floating mat, possibly sunbathing or resting. The other person, to the right, is also on a surfboard and is in a sitting position, facing forward, likely enjoying the peaceful surroundings or taking a break from more active pursuits.\n\nOverall, the composition combines residential life with recreational activities in a naturally beautiful environment, promoting a sense of tranquility and leisure. The setting might suggest a vacation spot or a community where outdoor lifestyles are integral to the residentsâ€™ daily experiences.","title":"Hotel cottages above Nawiliwili Harbor near Lihue","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["546349","553925","553931","543362","543881","553765","547984","554101","542908","556966","556953","552234","547636","551067","544554","557429"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["surfboard","house","mat","wildness","pursuit","vacation","privacy","resident","lifestyle","person"]}
