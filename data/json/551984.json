{"path":"551984.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of industrial decay along a waterway. In the foreground, there are muddy shores littered with debris, including pieces of wood, bricks, and miscellaneous fragments scattered throughout. Sparse vegetation is visible at the edge of the mud, consisting of a few grasses and small plants.\n\nThe middle of the image shows a dilapidated dock structure with broken and missing sections. Wooden pilings stand erratically, many of which no longer support any decking. This broken dock leads towards an industrial waterfront featuring large, weathered buildings and more orderly dock facilities in the distance.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, a sizable industrial crane or loading mechanism dominates beside a series of connected buildings, punctuating the sky. The overall atmosphere is bleak and abandoned, emphasized by the clear sky and the absence of any visible human activity.\n\nIn the distance, there are more industrial structures along the waterway, and a few boats can be seen moored near the docks or floating in the water. Electrical poles and lines are faintly visible against the skyline, adding to the sense of desolation in this industrial landscape.","title":"Low tide on Arthur Kill reveals oil spills on the marsh grass at the Port Reading coal yard.","placename":"New Jersey","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551985","547622","547582","547577","547579","548105","547581","547019","549307","547594","547575","552240","547890","549300","547893","547584"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["dock","waterway","piling","loading","fragment","mechanism","mud","desolation","absence","distance"]}
