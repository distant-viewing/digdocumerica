{"path":"543226.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a child walking across a rope bridge, viewed from a low angle looking up towards the sky. The child, likely a young boy, wears red pants, a green hoodie, and sneakers. His face is turned away from the camera, focusing ahead on the bridge. The bridge, made of thick ropes and smaller links, stretches from one side of the frame to the other. The background reveals a blue sky scattered with white clouds and the outlines of tree branches at the top corners of the frame, suggesting a setting in an outdoor park or playground. The photo conveys a sense of adventure and childhood exploration.","title":"Scout-o-rama","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["547188","543791","547867","553914","550830","553363","550230","545539","549674","552035","550836","544538","552833","551725","544542","544207"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["bridge","rope","playground","child","sneaker","childhood","link","adventure","exploration","boy"]}
