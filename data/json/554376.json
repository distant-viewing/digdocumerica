{"path":"554376.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor scene likely taken at a car show or dealership. In the forefront of the image, a shiny black car with highly reflective surfaces and sleek lines is prominently displayed. The sharp glossiness of the black car reflects the overhead fluorescent lights, which are arranged in parallel rows along the ceiling.\n\nTo the right, a group of three people, presumably a family, is focused on another vehicle, which is partially visible and features a light green color. A woman, wearing a plaid jacket with prominent red and white colors and a white shirt, is leaning slightly over, examining some papers or a brochure that she is holding in her hands. Next to her, a man in a plaid jacket, wearing glasses, observes the lower part of the vehicle intently. He appears engaged and possibly explaining something. Behind the woman, a young child, partially visible, seems to be held or supported by the adults. The child's face is slightly obscured, but she appears to be looking off-camera.\n\nThe setting around these individuals is busy with other attendees and vehicles, suggesting a public event focused on automobiles. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of casual exploration and interest in the vehicles displayed. The lighting is bright, with numerous lights illuminating the various chrome and glossy surfaces of the cars, enhancing the details and colors of the scene.","title":"AutoMobile show at the New York coliseum at Columbus circle in midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554388","554373","554375","554381","554372","554385","554390","554389","556703","554384","557918","554377","554387","557874","552803","557860"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","vehicle","plaid","dealership","child","jacket","explain","sleek","attendee","automobile"]}
