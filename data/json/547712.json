{"path":"547712.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a solemn and introspective scene set in a natural waterscape. A person is standing waist-deep in a body of water, possibly the ocean, given the extensive, open water and distant landforms vaguely visible in the background. The person, who appears to be a monk or someone engaged in a spiritual or religious ritual, is dressed in a dark, flowing robe that adds a sense of gravity and purpose to the scene.\n\nThe individual is looking down intently at their hands, which are submerged in water, holding what appears to be a small object, possibly part of the ritual. The focus on the hands and the object suggests a moment of deep concentration or prayer.\n\nThe surrounding environment adds to the meditative quality of the image. The water is mostly calm, with gentle ripples around the person, reflecting the soft light. The backdrop features blurred and indistinct natural elements, possibly hills or cliffs, and the open sky, which gives a sense of isolation and tranquility, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the individual and their activity.\n\nThe overall composition and muted colors of the image, along with the solitary figure engaged in a quiet act, evoke a strong sense of peace and introspection.","title":"Minister of Church of God in Christ (North Las Vegas) performs baptism ceremony in Lake Mead.","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["548992","548842","542556","550826","548291","548972","552701","550217","550940","550268","549012","545940","542509","557572","547913","549007"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["deep","person","gravity","waterscape","robe","introspection","waist","landform","peace","act"]}
