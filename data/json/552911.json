{"path":"552911.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively moment of a flock of pelicans in flight just above the surface of a large body of water. These birds have predominantly white bodies with black and white wings, characterized by their impressively long wingspan, and large, distinctive bills that taper off to a point, making them easily recognizable as pelicans.\n\nThere are several pelicans in the foreground, all captured in various stages of their wingbeats, soaring gracefully parallel to the water. Their feather details and the spread of their wings are clearly visible, emphasizing the swift motion and the coordination within the group.\n\nThe background suggests a tranquil natural setting, with a mountain range seen in the distance under a clear sky. The mountains appear mid-range and barren, somewhat arid in nature, indicating a possibly harsh yet scenic environment. Below the mountain peaks, a thin strip of vegetation suggests a transitional area possibly between a terrestrial and an aquatic ecosystem, typical of lake shores.\n\nThe water appears relatively calm with small ripples, reflecting some of the pelicans and the colors of the sky. This photo captures a moment of natural harmony and the dynamic activity of wildlife, likely in a protected or remote natural reserve where such birds are free to thrive.","title":"Pelicans in flight over Pyramid Lake.
