{"path":"551329.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene with remnants of a small, dilapidated stone building foregrounded amidst a lush, overgrown landscape. The building appears abandoned, with no roof and partial walls, showing signs of decay and overgrowth of vegetation. Significant plant growth encroaches upon and inside what remains of the structure, suggesting it has been uninhabited for some time.\n\nIn the composition, mature trees dominate the midground, with dense, rich green foliage that contributes to the overall feel of an untamed natural environment. These trees partially frame the view of the background, where a road is visible with a car passing by, hinting at the proximity to a more trafficked area yet the isolation of the building itself.\n\nThe photo captures a contrast between human abandonment or neglect and natureâ€™s reclamation, set against a backdrop that suggests a quiet, undisturbed rural setting away from bustling human activity. The colors in the photograph are rich and deep, with various shades of green and the grey of the stones providing a muted but natural palette.","title":"Abandoned and vandalized tourist cabins by the side of Route 54 at New Linn Creek, Missouri","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551330","552101","553551","554822","549195","547518","545233","551328","550279","555632","551344","554561","558013","551115","557997","556313"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["reclamation","overgrowth","stone","remnant","midground","grey","proximity","growth","abandonment","building"]}
