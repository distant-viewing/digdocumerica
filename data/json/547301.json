{"path":"547301.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene focused on agricultural activity. A farmer is operating a large tractor which pulls an implement, possibly a plow or harrow, across a field. The field appears to have been recently harvested, evidenced by the stubble and remains scattered on the ground. The action of the tractor stirs up dust and soil, creating a hazy atmosphere around the machine.\n\nAbove the field, a flock of birds, likely gulls or similar species, is in flight. The birds are attracted to the area, possibly by insects or worms brought to the surface by the farming activity. There are numerous birds at different heights and angles, adding a dynamic element to the composition.\n\nThe background features a flat, open landscape that gives way to a tree line under a light sky, which might suggest it is either dawn or dusk due to the soft lighting conditions. The overall mood is one of bustling natural activity juxtaposed with the mechanical labor of farming.","title":"Farm scene east of jansen","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547297","547436","544888","554204","548903","548898","553665","545893","555878","555879","548902","552577","544319","557521","549258","542654"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["bird","tractor","field","implement","stir","harvested","farmer","insect","flock","remains"]}
