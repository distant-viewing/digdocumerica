{"path":"542915.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, textured rock surface with graffiti spelling out \"Once and For All\" written in cursive with what appears to be white paint. The script is slightly smeared, creating a ghostly effect against the rough, dark gray background of the stone. The rock itself shows various shades of gray with some areas lighter than others, possibly due to moisture or lichen growth.\n\nThe scene is likely a coastal or beach setting, as evidenced by the presence of smaller rocks and pebbles at the base of the rock surface, and a hint of a sandy beach and water in the dim, blurred background. The overall atmosphere is somber and misty, suggesting a foggy or overcast day. The light source is diffused, producing soft shadows and a subdued color palette primarily in grays and blues. The image conveys a sense of isolation and perhaps contemplation, enhanced by the natural setting and the solitary message etched on the rock.","title":"Spray-paint artistry defaces ancient rocks","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["543079","557118","554555","543081","551946","557536","557534","542883","542887","550458","548248","545682","557986","543237","543025","554410"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rock","script","etch","spell","gray","foggy","pebble","graffito","produce","write"]}
