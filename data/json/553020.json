{"path":"553020.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a birdâ€™s-eye view of a sprawling urban landscape during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, judging by the low-angle sunlight bathing the scene in a warm, hazy glow. The primary focus of the image is a busy, multi-lane freeway packed with cars. This highway, running diagonally through the frame from the bottom left to the top right, divides a dense arrangement of industrial and commercial buildings.\n\nThe scene is shrouded in a mist or smog, which lends an almost sepia-tone to the colors, muting them and blending together the edges of the structures. This atmospheric condition suggests either significant pollution or just an early morning fog settling over the city.\n\nThe surrounding area is densely packed with low-rise buildings, including warehouses, small factories, and possibly some residential structures. There is minimal visible vegetation, emphasizing the urban industrial character of the area. No distinct landmarks are identifiable which might suggest a specific city; however, the scene is indicative of many large industrial cities. Power lines and communication poles intermittently emerge from the rooftops, cutting into the skyline and adding to the crammed, busy aesthetic of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of everyday urban activity, focused on transportation and industrial commerce, enveloped in a distinctive atmospheric light and environmental condition that softens and unifies the visual impact of the scene.","title":"(from the Documerica-1 exhibition.
