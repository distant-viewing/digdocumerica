{"path":"552661.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a festive moment during a parade. It features a group of young musicians seated on the back of a white, flatbed truck that has been modified and decorated presumably for the event. The truck's side is ornamented with a banner that reads \"Band\", and there are pink decorations and bow-tied fabrics along the sides and back of the truck.\n\nThe musicians, consisting of men and women, are dressed in semi-formal and casual attire, with some wearing white shirts and dark pants, while others are in more casual clothing. They are playing a variety of brass and woodwind instruments, including a tuba, saxophones, and clarinets. They are shown either actively playing their instruments, holding them, or in preparation to play.\n\nThe scene is set in a town with buildings lining the street that have a somewhat vintage feel, indicative of a small to medium-sized American town. In the background, a glimpse of the audience can be seen along the sidewalk, seemingly enjoying the performance and the parade. Notable signs, like those for \"Stereo\" and \"Coors on Tap,\" suggest commercial establishments in the vicinity, contributing to the ambiance of an everyday community event.\n\nOverall, the image vibrantly captures a moment of cultural and communal engagement in the form of a parade, showcasing the enthusiasm of young musicians performing for their community.","title":"Labor day weekend brings the annual garfield county fair parade","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["556279","552656","549567","547022","553173","554451","557264","556283","553713","552653","549702","557710","553297","552657","553234","556274"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["musician","parade","instrument","truck","play","town","ornament","enthusiasm","brass","flatbed"]}
