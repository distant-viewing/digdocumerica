{"path":"552694.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dense patch of an aspen forest under moody, overcast skies. In the foreground, several white-barked aspen trunks are prominently displayed. These trees have black knots and scars on their trunks, adding texture and detail. The trunks near the center of the image have a more pronounced black marking near their bases, giving them a unique appearance against the lighter upper sections.\n\nBehind these foreground trees, more aspen trunks can be seen receding into the background, creating a sense of depth. There is no visible foliage on the trees, suggesting the season could be either late autumn or early spring.\n\nThe forest floor is covered with a mix of dry, yellow-brown grass and fallen leaves, adding a natural, untamed characteristic to the scene. There are no human figures or artificial structures visible in the image, highlighting the natural and wild aspect of this woodland area. The lighting is fairly dim due to the overcast sky, casting a slightly somber and muted tone over the entire scene.","title":"Aspen trees along east Rifle creek","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["544872","544909","555121","555117","553574","555201","558103","555081","554746","554976","550603","554984","553579","553576","555133","549226"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trunk","basis","reced","forest","marking","bark","woodland","autumn","characteristic","spring"]}
