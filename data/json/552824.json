{"path":"552824.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph shows a scene of flooding around a small, pink house with white trim. The house is surrounded by water, reflecting how extensive the flooding is. In the forefront, two children observe the scene: one child, seen from the back, has long hair and wears a sleeveless striped top; the other is slightly in front, with shorter hair and wearing a blue patterned outfit.\n\nAt the center of the image, a man is wading through the water near the house, carrying what appears to be a long pole or tool, possibly for checking the water depth or attempting to clear debris. Several objects including barrels and debris float in the water around him, indicating the severity of the flood.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes dense greenery partially obscuring the background, which suggests a rural or semi-rural setting. The sky is overcast, contributing to the somber mood of the scene. Overall, the photograph captures a moment of crisis in a residential area, highlighting the impact of natural events and the response of individuals to such challenges.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
