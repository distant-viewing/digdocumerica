{"path":"547614.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental scene characterized by pollution. The image shows a body of water, possibly a pond or a small stream, with a visible sheen of oil on the surface, creating a rainbow-like effect in hues of blue, purple, red, and yellow. This oil slick appears amidst turbulent, somewhat muddy, water that is visibly agitated, possibly due to nearby activity or a natural water flow.\n\nThe water is surrounded by debris and waste materials, which include chunks of broken concrete, rebar, wires, and miscellaneous pieces of unidentifiable twisted metal. These elements suggest neglect or perhaps the aftermath of construction or demolition. The overall setting is dark and grim, with a heavy, somber tone dominating the composition due to the lack of vibrant life forms and the abundance of pollution and industrial waste.\n\nThe picture serves as a stark depiction of industrial or urban water pollution, capturing the intersection of natural water bodies and human-produced waste, highlighting environmental degradation.","title":"Oil from tanker terminal floats on Providence River","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547617","551560","544175","551561","544580","547493","547626","551559","547618","552811","546806","551077","555784","550812","544810","543819"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waste","pollution","oil","rebar","water","rainbow","demolition","chunk","abundance","sheen"]}
