{"path":"555547.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a polluted, stagnant water body, likely a small pond or slow-moving river, reflecting a dusky or cloudy sky. The surface of the water shows floating debris and some patches of vegetation, indicating neglect or environmental degradation. On the left side, there is a small group of three people standing at the water's edge, possibly investigating or observing the condition of the water. They are near a pile of rocks and rubble, contributing to a littered and unkempt scene.\n\nThe background is mostly dark with some faint outlines of trees or bushes, and the sky is moody, with daylight fading but some light still reflecting off the clouds onto the water. There are power lines visible in the distance, suggesting the proximity of this area to more developed regions or infrastructure. The overall atmosphere of the scene is somber, highlighting environmental issues and the potential impact on the local ecosystem and community.","title":"Olentangy River pollution is noted after a fire and explosions desTroyed a Pennwalt Corporation chemical storage building, June 20, 1974.
