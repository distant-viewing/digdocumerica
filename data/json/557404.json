{"path":"557404.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque view of a residential area nestled in a valley bordered by forested hills. The area features a variety of two-story houses, closely packed together, each painted in different hues such as white, beige, light blue, and mint green, adding a colorful vibrancy to the scene. The roofs of these houses are predominantly steep and gabled, typical of suburban American homes. In the background, the hills rise steeply, densely covered in lush green trees, which suggests a remote or semi-rural setting. There is a clear, blue sky above, indicating a bright sunny day. The view seems to be taken from a higher vantage point, possibly from another hill, giving a comprehensive overlook of both the community and the natural surroundings. The foreground is somewhat darkened, likely due to shading from the trees where the photo is shot from, adding a frame-like effect to the composition. This setting ostensibly provides a serene, community-oriented living space, closely interconnected with nature.","title":"Neat, well kept homes on a hillside of Boomer, near the Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant.
