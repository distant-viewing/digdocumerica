{"path":"546849.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from a vehicle parking area, likely from around the mid-20th century judging by the style and design of the cars and the overall scene. The image has a somewhat muted color palette typical of film stock from that era.\n\nIn the foreground, parts of two cars can be seen from a viewerâ€™s perspective, facing the rear of these vehicles. The car on the left side of the frame, which dominates the foreground, is a muted sea-green color with its front passenger door open. Reflected in the paintwork of the car are lighter spots that appear to be either raindrops or a textured effect of the car's paint. Through the open door, the interior details such as the seat and paneling are visible. A ticket or paper is also noticeable on the windshield.\n\nA woman is the central figure in this image. She is situated between these two cars, with just her head visible as she appears to be leaning in or looking inside the adjacent car. She is wearing a hood that covers most of her head and her expression cannot be clearly interpreted but gives off a focused or curious vibe. \n\nBeyond the immediate scene, another person who appears to be a man is visible in the background, dressed in a brown or dark colored coat and he is walking away from the camera, likely engaging in other activities in the parking area. This suggests that the location might be a public or possibly a commercial area given the structured setting and multiple vehicles present. The setting has a wide-open feeling with no visible structures immediately nearby other than the parking setup, hinting that this could be an airport or similar transit location.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph pulls attention both to the individual human interaction with the car, and the era-appropriate atmosphere and aesthetics provided by the setting and vehicle designs.","title":"Women load cars aboard freight carriers at Dundalk Marine Terminal.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["557874","557908","557850","553488","557871","547954","556736","557847","552800","557016","556723","557900","545321","555944","551913","557927"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","parking","vehicle","public","head","door","judging","stock","era","paneling"]}
