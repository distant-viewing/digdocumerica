{"path":"546109.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial or elevated view of a diverse landscape that includes water bodies, vegetated areas, and man-made structures. Dominating the bottom portion of the image is a large body of still water reflecting a muted blue-grey sky. Rising from the waterâ€™s surface are numerous vertical posts, possibly remnants of a deteriorated pier or related wooden structure, giving a sense of decay or desolation.\n\nAdjacent to the water, there is a strip of sandy land or mudflat, noticeable by its brighter color relative to the rest of the surroundings. This area is sparsely covered with patches of grass and small bushes. In some parts, the land shows signs of vehicular tracks indicating recent human activity.\n\nFurther from the water, the landscape transitions into a darker, greener area rich in denser vegetation, which could indicate a wetland or marshland ecosystem supporting different plant species.\n\nIn the distance, a more developed area can be seen characterized by the presence of multiple small, indistinct structures which could be buildings. This suggests proximity to a human settlement.\n\nOn the far right, a man-made feature, possibly a walkway, pier, or another type of small bridge, extends into the water. This structure is constructed with railings and supports, adding a linear element to the otherwise natural setting.\n\nThe background hints at a vast, flat landscape extending toward the horizon under a clouded sky, suggesting the photo was taken in a relatively open, possibly rural or semi-rural environment. The overall mood of the photograph is quiet and somewhat melancholic, emphasized by the muted color palette and the general absence of active human presence.","title":"The contaminated calcasieu river near the olin-mathieson plant","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["545008","550638","555684","552192","547960","543058","548030","552922","553086","554717","550268","545005","550788","544695","550757","544709"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pier","clouded","water","mudflat","marshland","greener","tracks","deteriorate","support","land"]}
