{"path":"554585.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph features a natural scene focusing primarily on a bush with thin, bare branches and small reddish-brown leaves, which could suggest the onset of autumn or the aftermath of winter. The bush is positioned in the foreground, covering slightly right and center, while it also extends to the left side of the image. What makes this photograph particularly striking is the bokeh effect provided by the background, which appears to be a body of water with shimmering lights or glare reflecting off its surface.\n\nThe water is partially blurred and has numerous bright white spots, resembling the surface sparkle typically observed when sunlight scatters across moving water currents. These bright highlights contrast vividly with the darker water and the subdued colors of the plant, creating a visually captivating backdrop. The overall composition blends these splashes of light with the natural elements, emphasizing textures and the interplay of focus, thus producing a surreal or dream-like quality. The photograph evokes a serene yet vibrant atmosphere, highlighting the intricate balance and beauty in natural environments.","title":"Red maple (Acer rubrum), just leafing out in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543560","542526","551365","552237","550389","547534","543607","545923","547546","551311","546963","558077","546066","543098","554603","557254"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["onset","glare","sparkle","current","aftermath","balance","highlight","water","splash","autumn"]}
