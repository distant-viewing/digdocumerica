{"path":"549307.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, cluttered area filled with debris and industrial waste. The foreground is dominated by rusted metal objects, including what appears to be a broken and decayed part of a vehicle or machinery, with curved metallic parts and jagged edges clearly visible. The ground is covered with a mix of smaller debris, possibly remnants of metal, wood, and other unidentifiable materials, all in a state of disarray.\n\nIn the middle ground, there are several vertical poles standing, suggesting this might be near a dock or a similar industrial area. Beyond the immediate clutter, the background features a view of a broader water body, likely a river or coastal area, with the far shore visible. There are structures on the far side, possibly part of an industrial complex or cityscape, and a clear sky overhead.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of abandonment and environmental neglect, highlighting the impact of industrial activities on natural settings. The composition and elements vividly illustrate a scene of decay and disuse.","title":"Rusted remains of a burnt-out pier on the Hudson River near lower Manhattan's newest giant, the world trade center","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556324","552102","547622","546854","547901","547582","546913","542585","548422","551985","547611","551984","554346","555852","552154","547581"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["clutter","disarray","disuse","debris","part","metal","jag","remnant","abandonment","rust"]}
