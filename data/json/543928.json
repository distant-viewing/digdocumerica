{"path":"543928.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures two young children, a girl and a boy, engaged in crafting a large, colorful rag rug in what appears to be a classroom setting.\n\nThe girl is dressed in a pastel green dress with short sleeves and a lace trim, and she has dark hair with bangs across her forehead. She is standing at the end of a table, actively working on the rug. The boy, wearing a bright yellow shirt and dark blue pants, stands opposite the girl. He is holding a strip of fabric, contributing to the rug as well. Both children are focused on their task, weaving or adding pieces to the rug.\n\nThe table on which the rug rests is substantial and circular, and the surface is almost entirely covered by the rug itself, which features a complex pattern of tightly wound and interwoven fabric strips in various colors and textures. Adjacent to them is a large, clear plastic bag filled with additional fabric strips, indicating more materials available for their project.\n\nThe setting includes wooden school desks arranged neatly in rows behind the children, suggesting that the photo was taken in a school classroom. There's a noticeable absence of other children or adults in the immediate area around the two children.\n\nAmbient light illuminates the indoor setting softly, creating shadows and highlighting the textures and details of the materials the children are working with. This image conveys a sense of quiet industriousness and the creative engagement of young learners in a school environment.","title":"ArKansas--Fort Smith","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["543920","543919","552946","544416","544431","544364","546548","557153","558216","546565","554838","548227","558341","553269","551677","557151"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["child","school","fabric","strip","classroom","girl","boy","table","industriousness","forehead"]}
