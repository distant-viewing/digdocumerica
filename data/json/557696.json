{"path":"557696.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural farming scene. In the foreground, we see an individual, presumably a farmer, hoeing the soil between rows of crops. The farmer wears a wide-brimmed hat, a striped shirt, and dark pants, shielding them from the sun while working. The focus of the image is on the ongoing cultivation activity as the farmer works along a row of young corn plants, prominently emerging from the rich, dark soil.\n\nThe farm field is well-organized with neat rows of various crops, displaying different stages of vegetation. In the background, there is another person visible, tending to the field as well. The immediate backdrop of the working area features more vegetation and hints of additional crops. Behind the farming area, there is a glimpse of a traditional wooden structure, possibly a barn or storage shed, with a fenced area around it and dense trees surrounding the structure, adding a lush greenery to the rural setting.\n\nOverall, the scene is vibrant with green hues, suggesting it's likely a warm, growth-promoting season. The environment evokes a sense of calm and industrious rural life, centered on agriculture. The photograph captures a moment of daily life and labor on the farm, emphasizing the connection between the land and the people who cultivate it.\n","title":"Mrs. C.N.
