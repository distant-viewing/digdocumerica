{"path":"543771.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a serene lakeside landscape at what appears to be either dawn or dusk, judging by the soft lighting and long shadows. The focus is on an impressive geological formation which rims the far side of the lake. The formation is rocky with vivid coloration ranging from deep reds at the top to lighter, pale hues towards the base. The rocks have stratified layers, some of which hang or protrude in rough stalactite-like formations, adding a dramatic texture to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there are grasses and small shrubs, slightly blurred, which suggests that they are close to the camera, adding depth to the composition. These plants are bathed in a warm light, contrasting with the cooler shadows of the rock formations.\n\nThe lake itself is calm, its surface reflecting both the rocky formations and the shadows of nearby trees or plants, producing a mirror effect that emphasizes the tranquility of the scene. The reflections are clear but slightly distort the rock textures, adding an element of softness to the otherwise rugged terrain.\n\nOverall, the composition utilizes natural light and reflections to enhance the visual impact of the geological features and to create a peaceful, timeless atmosphere.","title":"Acid and radium 226 leaking from uranium mill tailings pond into the San Miguel River.","placename":"Uravan (Colo.)","location":"Uravan, Colorado","nn1":["552893","552900","552891","552889","544392","552894","554719","542583","550428","543789","543816","544170","551207","542994","545783","553135"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["formation","rock","distort","reflection","lake","rim","softness","shadow","produce","coloration"]}
