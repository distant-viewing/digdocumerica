{"path":"545699.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph focuses on a single vibrant yellow daisy-like flower prominently positioned against a dark background, enhancing its visual appeal and prominence. The flower has numerous long, thin petals radiating around a large, textured central disc, which is filled with numerous tiny florets. The yellow petals have a slightly rough texture, evident from a few ragged edges and veins running through them.\n\nA small insect, possibly a tiny beetle, is visible on one of the petals near the flowerâ€™s center, adding an element of wildlife interaction with the plant. The slender green stem supports the flower, hinting at its growth in a natural setting.\n\nThe background is out of focus, with soft browns and greens that suggest a natural environment, possibly a field or a garden. This blurry backdrop serves to isolate the flower, drawing the viewer's attention directly to the intricate details and vibrant color of the blossom. The lighting appears soft, likely either early morning or late afternoon, which softly highlights the flower's features without causing harsh shadows or overexposure.","title":"Sunflower","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["555189","543596","554840","544590","554580","557487","551369","555061","555033","544875","554842","543623","545706","549230","547815","544579"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","daisy","insect","vein","blossom","prominence","radiate","stem","appeal"]}
