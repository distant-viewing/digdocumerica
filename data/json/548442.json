{"path":"548442.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor residential scene, likely taken in the mid to late 20th century, showcasing a blend of nature and urban living. The focal point is a lush garden situated in a small yard, surrounded by high-density housing and industrial elements.\n\nStarting with the garden, it is vibrant and well-tended, featuring an array of blooming flowers with dominant pink hues, green bushes, and a neatly trimmed grass lawn. There are also several small trees and gardening tools visible, suggesting regular upkeep.\n\nTo the right of the garden is a multistory residential building, characterized by its exterior wooden staircases and multiple balconies. These balconies are adorned with numerous lines of hanging laundry, indicating the domestic life within. The building seems to be of an older architectural style, with weathered wooden siding and worn paint, adding character to the scene.\n\nAdjacent to the garden on the left, there is a chain-link fence, behind which a large industrial type structure can be seen, possibly a factory or a warehouse, hinting that the area may be a mix of residential and industrial zoning.\n\nAbove the scene, there are multiple electric or telephone lines, crisscrossing against a bright, partly cloudy sky, further emphasizing the urban environment. The contrast between the industrial backdrop and the serene, colorful garden creates a unique urban life tableau, capturing a moment of everyday life in this particular community.","title":"Well-kept backyards are the rule in East Boston where homeowners take great pride in their neighborhood.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551743","551739","551744","551702","551685","551728","551775","551755","550764","550055","551620","551623","546505","546534","551746","551777"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","balcony","laundry","upkeep","life","telephone","gardening","tableau","tend","staircase"]}
