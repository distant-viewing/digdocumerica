{"path":"547620.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a coastal dune landscape. In the foreground, a wooden slat fence partially buried by the sand runs diagonally across the image, creating a path that leads the eye through the rough, scrubby greenery and dune grasses. The path marked by the fence seems to wind through the dunes towards the beach in the distance. On the right, the sandy beach is visible alongside a calm sea. The sky above is clear and a deep shade of blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day. Although no people are visible in the scene, the setting conveys a serene, natural coastal environment. The absence of development or large structures gives the scene a relatively untouched, wild aspect.","title":"Snow fences and brush piles are used to build up the dunes","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["557459","547015","547607","548220","547973","543192","545280","543193","555400","545215","545109","551554","543303","548230","547596","547697"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["dune","beach","fence","path","bury","slat","absence","aspect","sand","wind"]}
