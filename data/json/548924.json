{"path":"548924.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph displays an aerial view of a curving river meandering through a desert landscape. The river, marked by a deep blue color, winds through dry, sandy banks which appear light beige, suggesting arid conditions. A bridge spans the river near the center of the image. To the left of the bridge, a small cluster of buildings can be seen close to the riverbank, along with several roads that intersect nearby.\n\nThe banks on either side of the river have patches of sparse greenery, possibly small trees or shrubs. On the right side of the river are various recreational activities taking place; tiny specks that could be people or boats dot the water, indicating recreational use of the river.\n\nThe background features a mountainous landscape with jagged peaks, providing a stark contrast to the flat, sandy foreground. Further away, the river bends into a larger body of water, or possibly joins another river or lake. The scene is set under a clear, bright blue sky, enhancing the starkness and isolation of the river winding through the desert.","title":"Havasu Lake. London Bridge (background).
