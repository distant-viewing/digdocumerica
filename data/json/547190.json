{"path":"547190.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a street scene likely from a city in the United States, noticeable due to the style of the environment and attire of the people. It's centered on a group of women, predominantly middle-aged or older, standing on a sidewalk.\n\nFrom left to right, the scene features a woman wiping or shielding her face with a tissue, possibly due to cold weather, as she stands next to another woman wearing a dark coat adorned with what seems to be campaign or award pins. Both women appear to be either waiting for something or watching something off-camera. Their focus and those of others suggest something of interest is happening out of frame.\n\nBeyond them, more individuals are visible, including a woman in a distinctive hat and another partially obscured woman near the edge of the frame. All the individuals are dressed in heavy clothing, suggesting colder weather conditions. The age and style of clothing point to the photograph being taken sometime around the mid to late 20th century.\n\nIn the background, under a bridge, there is urban traffic and commercial signs that read “MONEY ORDERS CHECKS CASHED,” which contributes to the urban, somewhat bustling atmosphere of the scene. The captured moment conveys a sense of daily life and public engagement in an urban setting from a past era. The lighting is somewhat dim, indicating either early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Queuing up for the bus","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556808","547191","549855","556199","546600","557177","549863","553184","549923","551742","554691","556805","547205","548369","546672","545231"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["woman","campaign","pin","check","clothing","order","weather","style","sidewalk","interest"]}
