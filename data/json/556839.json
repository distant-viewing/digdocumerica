{"path":"556839.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a vehicle, likely a bus or train, showing two people focused on different activities. The primary figure, an elderly woman, is situated on the right side of the frame. She has short, wavy hair and wears eyeglasses, and appears to be asleep or resting. She leans against a window, with her head supported by a light-colored pillow against the glass. Her attire includes a dark coat with a patterned scarf or shawl over it.\n\nThe woman is holding a white paper cup, suggesting she either just had a beverage or might be holding it whilst asleep. Next to her, on the left side of the image, there is a younger person, visible only from behind and partly from the side. This person has dark hair and is focused on reading a book or a magazine, evident from holding it with both hands.\n\nThe interior lighting is dim, with the natural light from the window creating a highlight on the side of the woman's face and her glasses. The photograph conveys a quiet, peaceful moment during a journey, with the focus on personal activities and rest.","title":"Passengers on Amtrak's Broadway Limited enroute from Chicago to points east. In 1974 the corporation carried 18 million passengers, an increase of 10 percent from the previous year. Officials are trying to attain a 55 percent average load factor and have almost reached the 50 percent level. To achieve a higher rate would mean packing the trains that travel during peak periods. In 1974 Amtrak earned $256.9 million, but had a deficit of $272.6 million.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556796","556848","556033","556034","556097","546597","556842","556062","555975","556834","552935","555978","543898","549893","555977","554370"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["pillow","shawl","woman","hold","magazine","eyeglass","rest","glass","scarf","beverage"]}
