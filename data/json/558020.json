{"path":"558020.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a quaint, historical small-town street scene, likely captured in the early to mid-20th century based on the style of the surroundings and overall tone of the image. The scene is primarily characterized by its rural setting, showcasing early American architecture and infrastructure.\n\nThe foreground of the photo features a railroad crossing with a lifted gate, indicating no immediate passage of a train. The tracks run perpendicular to the viewer's line of sight, intersecting the town's road and leading into the deeper parts of the image. Adjacent to the railroad, on the left, there are patches of agricultural fields or grassy areas, which appear to be unkept or in a state of winter decay.\n\nA series of electricity or telephone poles with visible wires align with the railroad, extending into the distance and paralleling a street lined with wooden buildings. The buildings exhibit characteristics typical of rural American architecture from this era, including wood siding, simple, functional design, and front porches. These edifices likely served mixed uses such as residential homes, local shops, or service establishments.\n\nThe street is calm, without any visible moving vehicles or people, adding a sense of stillness and deserted atmosphere to the scene. Overhead, the sky appears clear and the trees, leafless, suggest it could be either late fall or winter.\n\nThe image is enveloped in a bluish tint, typical of early color photography processes or possibly due to the age and condition of the photograph. This tint contributes to the nostalgic and historical aesthetic of the image, emphasizing a time long past. Overall, the photograph captures a serene and typical small-town street scene from an era that focuses on simplicity and functional living, with infrastructure and architecture hinting at the early 20th-century American life.","title":"Copy of a black and white photograph taken around 1900 looking west along the main street of Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron which is also Ohio Highway 303.
