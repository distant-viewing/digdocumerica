{"path":"554403.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene twilight scene with a stunning gradient sky transitioning from a deep blue at the top to a softer pinkish-purple at the horizon. Dominating the foreground to the right, there is a tall, slender pine tree with clustered needles, which is partially silhouetted against the colorful sky. To its left there appears to be another tree, more sparse and with bare branches. \n\nThe middle ground reveals a panoramic view of a hilly landscape peppered with dark silhouettes of forests. Nestled within these hills are glimpses of a shimmering body of water that adds a tranquil element to the scene. The water reflects the colors of the sky, augmenting the overall calm and peaceful atmosphere of the picture. \n\nThis composition creates a feeling of vastness and natural beauty, emphasizing the quiet end of the day in a picturesque setting.","title":"First lake at dusk, seen from the top of Bald Mountain, near the village of Old Forge.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["543577","554397","543604","554731","543590","554760","557497","552335","543621","550646","555119","552142","555131","547705","542625","543016"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["needle","pine","purple","gradient","twilight","end","vastness","picture","feeling","glimpse"]}
