{"path":"553459.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph focuses on a wooden stake firmly planted in the ground, detailed with some handwritten markings that appear as \"10 N.\" The stake is wrapped with a blue plastic tape or binding, suggesting it may be marking a specific point or item of interest, possibly in a surveying or gardening context.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, there is a white house with a black chimney. The house features small windows and what appears to be a drainpipe or vent on one side. It is a single-story structure, typical of many suburban or rural homes.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, with visible elements of a somewhat untended environment such as fallen leaves and pine needles, which carpet the ground, and some loose branches. The natural debris and the soft, indirect sunlight filtering through the trees give the scene an autumnal feeling. The choice to focus on the stake in the foreground with the building softly blurred in the background creates an intriguing depth of field, drawing attention to the detail and possible significance of the stake in its specific setting.","title":"Ribbons mark surveyors work in this housing development in townsend","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553458","558110","556999","547522","556491","555454","558102","551091","557335","549453","554787","548656","555541","547404","548295","555632"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["stake","tape","gardening","intriguing","vent","choice","carpet","house","fallen","wrap"]}
