{"path":"547181.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a busy scene of an industrial or construction site in action, likely involved in street improvement or clearing operations. Prominently featured is a large crane, painted in vibrant yellow and marked with \"J. McDermott & Co. Bucyrus Erie.\" The crane is equipped with a massive claw (grab bucket), which is suspended in the air and positioned over a red dump truck to the right, seemingly ready to unload or collect materials.\n\nThe crane operator can be seen in the cabin, actively controlling the equipment. Around the site, several workers are visible; two workers are standing beside the dump truck, and another is walking towards the crane, indicating coordinated activity among the team.\n\nThe background of the image shows a partially demolished concrete structure to the right, with piles of rubble and debris scattered along the edge of the street. This suggests that the area is undergoing significant redevelopment or cleaning work.\n\nThe setting is urban, with buildings and trees in the background, under a clear blue sky which suggests good weather conditions for outdoor work. The presence of street lamps and a motorcycle parked beside the road enhances the urban feel of the scene. \n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of active labor and machinery at work, set against a backdrop of urban redevelopment.","title":"Repairing lakeside road, damaged by Lake Michigan flood waters","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557729","549664","549308","555593","545648","548559","545655","548773","544134","548324","547615","546833","544157","545653","546030","545888"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["crane","dump","work","street","worker","claw","truck","cleaning","team","site"]}
