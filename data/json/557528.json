{"path":"557528.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image depicts a winding road located within a hilly, densely vegetated landscape. The road features sharp curves and the terrain around it is covered with a mixture of green shrubs and trees. The aerial perspective of the photograph emphasizes the serpentine shape of the road as it cuts through the hills.\n\nIn the upper middle portion of the image, a black car can be seen navigating one of the curves of the road. The surrounding area displays varying shades of green and brown, suggesting different types of vegetation and possibly changes in elevation or soil.\n\nThere are no buildings or other man-made structures visible in the area, indicating that the location is relatively remote or natural. Overhead power lines can be seen in the lower foreground, cutting across the view and suggesting some human activity in the area, though it does not dominate the landscape.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is tranquil and secluded, with the road providing a stark contrast in its structured pathway through the wild and rugged terrain. The time of day appears to be either morning or evening, as suggested by a soft light and long shadows, which enhance the texture and depth of the hills and valleys.","title":"Highway through the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure. Several commissions have been set up to restrict coastal developments and recommend future guidelines to the state legislature.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548100","548099","550614","556579","556465","554130","551240","554566","542838","557010","555670","550600","547659","550695","553630","553785"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","curve","hill","elevation","terrain","mixture","pathway","valley","power","shrub"]}
