{"path":"543956.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a serene evening scene by the water, rich in atmosphere and lit by a dramatic sky at sunset. In the middle of the image, there is a large boat or ferry, facing towards the viewer, moored at a pier. The sky is an artistic display of clouds scattered across, diffusing the light of the setting sun, creating a spectrum of colors that range from muted yellows to soft blues.\n\nThe left part of the image has a silhouette of a waterfront structure, possibly a warehouse or a dock area, further emphasizing the industrial or shipping orientation of the scene. To the right, part of another vessel is visible, with several lines and cables shown stretching across the frame, contributing to the nautical feel of the scene.\n\nThere are several people in the foreground, appearing as silhouettes because of the backlighting from the sunset. These individuals, along with the setting, evoke a sense of contemplative observation or a casual gathering at the end of the day. The people and setting together create a peaceful, reflective mood, characteristic of moments captured by waterfronts during sunset.\n\nThe water reflects the sky's light, rippled and shimmering, enhancing the overall serene and transient nature of the setting. The composition uses these elements — the sky, the water, the boats, and the human figures — to create a narrative of life by the shore, wrapped in the beauty of a fading day.","title":"The Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543143","547110","543411","544251","551215","550303","545030","545170","547230","543119","545055","543880","552263","547142","550296","552293"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sunset","waterfront","spectrum","ferry","orientation","backlighting","silhouette","boat","shipping","shimmer"]}
