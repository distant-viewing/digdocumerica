{"path":"547381.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a vibrant outdoor scene at what appears to be a public sale or auction. Central to the photograph is an older man wearing a cream-colored short-sleeved shirt and a straw hat. He is animatedly gesturing with his right hand, pointing towards something or someone out of frame, giving the impression that he is either bidding or announcing an item in an auction.\n\nThe man stands behind a rustic wooden table littered with various items, suggesting the setting could be a flea market or an informal outdoor sale. On the table, you can see assorted books and what may be other small miscellaneous objects. Notably, a black cash box sits in the foreground, indicating transactions are taking place.\n\nAround the central figure, other people are gathered, partially visible and observing the scene. These individuals appear to be middle-aged to elderly, with one man to the right wearing glasses and a multi-colored patterned shirt, and others in the background more indistinct.\n\nThe setting includes trees and a clear blue sky, implying a nice day, conducive for an outdoor event. The overall atmosphere is busy and communal, with a focus on interaction and transaction.","title":"Auctioneer does brisk business at the hickman saturday auction, 15 miles south of Lincoln","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["550675","557163","551696","557135","550671","551694","557131","551690","550068","551750","551695","547378","547374","557161","557132","551749"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["transaction","sale","table","cash","announce","flea","item","straw","cream","market"]}
