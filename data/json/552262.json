{"path":"552262.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial maritime scene. At the foreground, there are two tugboats on the water; the nearer one prominently displays the marking \"LIT 33\" on its side, and is largely black with some white structures on board and small windows on the cabin. There is a smaller service boat next to it. The background features a large, vertically lifted drawbridge that is opened, allowing space for the passage of maritime traffic.\n\nOn either side of the bridge, there are additional industrial buildings and structures, some with visible machinery and metallic frameworks that suggest functionality related to shipping or possibly loading docks. The drawbridge itself is large and metallic, with triangular side supports, accentuating its sturdy mechanical design. \n\nThe setting appears to be a busy industrial port area, possibly involved in cargo handling or logistics judging by the presence of containers and equipment. The scene captures active waterborne and possibly vehicular transportation routes, characterized by a blend of functionality and industrial aesthetics. The sky is clear, and the overall lighting suggests daylight conditions, enhancing the visibility of the details in the photograph.","title":"Barge traffic on the Duwamish River.
