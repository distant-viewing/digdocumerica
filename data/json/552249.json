{"path":"552249.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene across a body of water. In the foreground, the calm water reflects the elements above it somewhat dimly due to the lighting conditions. Floating prominently on the water are large logs or timbers, suggesting nearby timber operations or a logging facility.\n\nIn the middleground, several vertical structures which could be poles or pilings are scattered, sticking up from the water. These structures, likely wooden, add to the appearance of an industrial or logging area.\n\nThe background is dominated by a factory complex with multiple large buildings and smokestacks emitting white smoke or steam into the sky, reinforcing the industrial nature of the scene. The silhouette of a distant tree line can be seen behind the industrial buildings, indicating that this scene might be at the edge of an urban or semi-urban area.\n\nColors in the photo are muted, with a general bluish or grayish tone that could be indicative of either the time of day being either early morning or late afternoon, or possibly the result of air pollution from the factories. The overall atmosphere of the photograph suggests a working waterfront, possibly involved in heavy industry and resource processing.","title":"Weyerhaeuser kraft pulp mill and rafted logs on the Snohomish River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550332","555165","548068","550340","557376","548070","557225","551566","552207","548106","552179","546083","550956","552174","546118","555769"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","timber","factory","piling","result","stick","resource","water","waterfront","steam"]}
