{"path":"551904.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside what appears to be a control center or operations room. In the image, two men are seated at desks equipped with various documents, phones, and other control systems.\n\nBoth men are dressed in white shirts and are engrossed in their tasks, with one man looking down at a piece of paper he is writing on, and the other reviewing a larger, flat document or map spread on his workspace. The furniture appears utilitarian, typical of an office environment from the mid to late 20th century, featuring simple desks and rolling office chairs.\n\nDominating the background is a large, illuminated map displaying numerous interconnected lines, points, and labels, suggesting a network or system being monitored and managed, possibly electrical grids, transportation routes, or telecommunications networks. This map is the central focus and most visually striking element in the image, highlighted by its bright lighting against a darker room allowing the information to stand out sharply. To the side of this map, there is a panel with rows of red indicator lights, likely representing status updates or alerts related to the network shown on the map.\n\nOverall, the setting conveys an atmosphere of serious, focused work, typical of operational hubs or command centers used for managing complex systems. The photograph may have been taken to document the operations of such facilities or to reflect technological advancements in system management and monitoring during the era it represents.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day, controls all traffic lights, receives remote TV inputs from major intersections, and maintains radio contact with all traffic control vehicles.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551902","551903","551916","551905","551898","552387","551900","551901","555334","552392","552388","552377","556758","551896","549367","552390"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["map","system","network","desk","document","office","control","room","advancement","command"]}
