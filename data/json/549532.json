{"path":"549532.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic and dynamic river scene, likely taken from a high vantage point overlooking a large river with swirling water currents and white frothy water patterns. The focus of the image is a tour boat moving through these challenging waters, filled with passengers wearing bright orange life vests, suggesting a guided adventure or sightseeing tour.\n\nThe river itself is bordered by rocky, tree-covered shores, which are visible in parts of the background, indicating a natural, possibly remote setting. The swirling patterns on the water surface are indicative of strong currents or rapids, enhancing the adventurous feel of the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there are lush green bushes and a few trees, which frame the river view and suggest the photographer's position on a cliff or steep riverbank. The vibrant greens of the vegetation contrast with the deep blues and whites of the river, enriching the color palette of the photograph.\n\nThis setting, combined with the clear, bright daylight, makes for a picturesque and vibrant outdoor scene, focusing on nature and human interaction with challenging water environments.","title":"Diesel-powered \"Maid-of-the-Mist\" sightseeing boat plies the Niagara River just below the falls.
