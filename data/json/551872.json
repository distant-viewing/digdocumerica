{"path":"551872.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene that probably dates back a few decades, judging by the style of clothing and overall ambiance. It features two men in the foreground who are pushing large, wheeled carts filled with an assortment of items, suggesting they might be vendors or deliverymen. The man on the right holds an umbrella open above his head, indicating it might be raining, although the pavements don't appear very wet.\n\nBoth men are dressed in casual blazers and trousers; one wears a printed shirt while the other sports a plain, light-colored shirt. They seem to be conversing as they walk, sharing a moment of interaction amidst their activity.\n\nThe background of the photograph is an urban setting with a pedestrian zone lined with various buildings and storefronts featuring large windows, through which a few details of the interiors are visible. People can be seen walking around them – one individual in particular is walking under an umbrella which matches the rainy context implied by the open umbrella of the man in the foreground. Benches and vibrant flowerbeds add a touch of color and life to the otherwise grey and drab urban environment.\n\nThe pavement is composed of large, regularly patterned stone tiles, and the entire photograph provides a sense of movement and everyday activity, portraying a snapshot of urban life. The light and composition imply a cloudy day, which also contributes to the atmosphere of a typical bustling city setting during unsettled weather.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgängerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. On the rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire Fussgängerzone is thoroughly cleaned. This is the time, too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551933","551836","551873","549867","551863","551856","551869","556226","551815","551477","549659","550128","551849","551871","546660","543890"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["umbrella","pavement","walk","flowerbed","imply","man","vendor","blazer","cart","storefront"]}
