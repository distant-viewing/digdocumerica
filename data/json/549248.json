{"path":"549248.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a striking, natural landscape dominated by the simplistic beauty of a single tree situated on a curved hillside. The tree stands alone near the crest of the hill, creating a clear, isolated silhouette against the sky. The hill itself covers a significant portion of the image, displaying a gentle slope. The foreground and much of the hill are bathed in shadows, hinting at either dawn or dusk, with the sunlight illuminating the top of the hill and the tree in a soft, warm light.\n\nThe background above the hill is a gradient sky, transitioning from a deeper blue at the top to a lighter, almost white near the hillâ€™s horizon. This suggests the sun is just beyond the hill or has recently set. The overall atmosphere of the scene is serene and tranquil, evoking feelings of solitude and peace. The color palette is quite muted with dark blues and greys dominating, punctuated by the warm tones where the sun hits the tree and the hill.\n\nThere are no visible activities or people; the focus is entirely on the natural landscape and the poignant, solitary figure of the tree. The composition is quite minimalist, yet it conveys a profound sense of space and isolation.","title":"The bud redding ranch at sunset","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["556473","554099","547546","555639","553593","554994","543722","552484","552520","555589","557598","543718","542644","542861","543016","544921"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hill","tree","deeper","sun","hit","crest","poignant","curved","peace","blu"]}
