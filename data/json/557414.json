{"path":"557414.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a modern, multi-story residential building with white walls and terracotta tile roofing. The architecture resembles that typical of upscale, suburban developments. The building is positioned atop a slight hill and is curved, following the contour of the landscaped surroundings.\n\nThe road in front of the building is a paved, winding street lined with lamp posts, emphasizing the well-planned infrastructure of the area. Adjacent to the street, the hill slopes down and is covered with green grass and scattered shrubs, which have been meticulously maintained.\n\nIn the foreground, prominently displayed, is a red and white sign reading “PRIVATE PROPERTY CLOSED TO ALL UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED.” It indicates restricted access, reinforcing the exclusivity of the premises. The sign also features the name \"THE IRVINE COMPANY,\" suggesting ownership or management of the property.\n\nThe background features a clear blue sky with no obvious cloud cover, likely indicating a sunny day, which adds brightness to the scene, enhancing the visual appeal of the pristine white and red building against the vibrant landscape.","title":"One of only a few construction projects completed along a section of California coastline in Orange County during 1975.
