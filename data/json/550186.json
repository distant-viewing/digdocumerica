{"path":"550186.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a cityscape shrouded in a dense, hazy atmosphere, which gives the image a sepia-toned, almost monochromatic appearance. The skyline features a variety of buildings, including a prominent, tall structure with a classic spire and a clock near its peak, which suggests it could be an iconic building in a well-known city. Many of the buildings appear to be mid-century or modern in design, characterized by their flat rooftops and rectangular shapes.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a large bridge with multiple arches, extending across the frame. This bridge, constructed from what looks to be concrete or stone, adds a sense of depth and infrastructure importance to the scene. Thereâ€™s also a hint of another bridge visible in the upper right quadrant of the photograph, but it is largely obscured by the haze.\n\nThe general atmosphere and obscured visibility in the photograph suggest either foggy weather conditions or heavy air pollution. The overall tone and quality of the image, along with the framing, also impart a vintage feel, potentially dating the photograph to the mid-20th century. The edges of the photo are rough, hinting that it might have been taken from a slide or film, typical of period photography. The scene is quiet, without any visible moving elements or people, focusing purely on the architectural and atmospheric elements of the urban environment.","title":"Hazy Cleveland skyline on july 20, 1973--day of a pollution alert","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551141","548380","548365","549970","548385","548339","545499","549620","548416","550198","552394","548360","548317","546865","548378","548384"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","quadrant","slide","century","impart","clock","spire","obscure","importance","rooftop"]}
