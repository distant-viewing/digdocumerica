{"path":"554530.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, densely forested mountain. The lower and mid portions of the mountain are covered entirely in rich green foliage, likely deciduous trees, considering their texture and color. The mountain's crest is somewhat bare, with sparse vegetation, showcasing a rocky surface that indicates it might be a rugged peak, typical of regions with significant elevation and possibly exposed to weather elements that prevent dense tree growth. The sky is clear and bright, suggesting a sunny day without clouds. Overall, the image captures a serene and untouched natural landscape, emphasizing lush greenery and a rugged mountain terrain. There are no visible human activities, structures, or people; it is purely a natural scene.","title":"Summit of algonquin mountain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve in New York state, showing balsam fir and paper birch zone up to the timBerline.
