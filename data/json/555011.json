{"path":"555011.jpg","date":"August 1969","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph showcases a close-up of a juvenile great horned owl perched quietly. The owl has distinctive mottled brown and cream feathers with concentric circles of dark and light bands around its large, compelling yellow eyes. The facial disc is pronounced and heart-shaped, characteristic of the species.\n\nThe composition is shaded, suggesting an evening or dusk setting, which enhances the mystery commonly associated with owls. The background is softly blurred with bokeh effects, likely stemming from the little spots of light coming through the dense forest foliage, creating a natural, serene ambiance. The overall mood is both serene and intense, focusing entirely on the owlâ€™s expressive face and the fine details of its plumage.","title":"Great horned owl (Bubo Virginianus) in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555012","555010","557628","548505","544477","549115","544547","552696","548885","544489","547318","554601","548497","557614","554645","544222"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plumage","heart","circle","feather","cream","mystery","band","specie","up","spot"]}
