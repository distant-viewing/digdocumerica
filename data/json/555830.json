{"path":"555830.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph presents a serene oceanic scene with clear visibility both in the air and in the water. In the foreground, there are several divers equipped with scuba gear, partially submerged in the calm, deep blue sea. Among them, visible equipment surfaces include snorkels, diving masks, and parts of their wetsuits. To their side, a large buoyant object, likely a safety or navigation buoy, floats on the water surface, marked with a vivid rendering of yellow.\n\nIn the middleground, a sizable ship, painted primarily in white, floats stationary on the ocean. Identified as the \"CALYPSO,\" the vessel is a well-equipped boat, possibly used for marine exploration or scientific research given its prominent deck structures that include cranes and other maritime-operational equipment. Flags are visible fluttering at the stern of the ship, suggesting a gentle breeze.\n\nThe background is a vast open sea stretching to the horizon under a clear sky, hinting at late afternoon or early evening light due to the soft illumination and mellow tones of the scene. The composition of the photo, alongside the calm sea and the presence of diving equipment, suggests a professional or scientific diving expedition, focused on underwater study or exploration. The overall mood is peaceful and reflects a deep engagement with the marine environment.","title":"Divers from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ship \"Ferrel\" checking current meter stations in the bight. Water circulation there is not yet fully understood. Current research will give a more accurate reading of how well sludge and waste is dispersed by natural circulation. They also hope to learn how much man's activities have disturbed the natural pattern.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555834","555833","549347","555831","549265","548681","544129","543065","548675","548727","552276","549369","548714","555832","544388","557481"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["diving","sea","ship","exploration","equipment","snorkel","wetsuit","diver","stern","expedition"]}
