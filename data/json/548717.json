{"path":"548717.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts an underwater scene, vividly capturing marine life along a coral reef. The focal point of the image is a large, patterned fish, possibly a grey angelfish, distinguished by its prominent, scalloped tail and intricate, light-dotted body pattern over a darker background. The fish is oriented towards the right side of the frame, swimming gracefully amongst the coral.\n\nThe foreground features sprawling branches of coral, which exhibit a finger-like structure and appear whitish-blue against the darker, deep blue water of the ocean. This type of coral contributes to the rich biodiversity of the reef and provides habitat for various marine species.\n\nThe background is more shadowed and muted, showing further expanses of the coral reef which fades into the gloomy ocean depth. There's a subtle hint of light filtering through the water from above, suggesting either the proximity of the water's surface or an external light source, enhancing the visibility of the fish and coral against the darker underwater environment.\n\nThe photograph overall captures a serene yet vibrant snapshot of life under the sea, emphasizing the beauty and complexity of marine ecosystems.","title":"Grey angle fish swims among branches of living coral in the protected waters of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, a few miles off Key Largo.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548719","548716","548715","548677","548711","548682","548712","548713","548722","548679","548678","548718","548676","548710","548680","548721"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["coral","reef","fish","ocean","biodiversity","finger","overall","filtering","tail","specie"]}
