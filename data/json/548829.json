{"path":"548829.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic and evocative scene of a cattle drive on a dusty road. In the center, a cowboy mounted on a horse is herding a large group of cattle. The cattle are diverse in color, including shades of brown, white, and black. The cowboy, likely dressed in traditional attire, dominates the middle of the image, establishing control and direction over the herd. The road stretches straight ahead, bordered by grass and low vegetation under a clear, expansive sky, hinting at a dry, rural environment. The backdrop features utility poles receding into the distance, emphasizing the vast, open landscape typical of pastoral or agricultural regions. The scene is imbued with a sense of movement and dusty haze, likely kicked up by the movement of the cattle and horse.","title":"Moving cattle raise dust along the highway--near Calipatria in the Imperial Valley.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548830","548828","548878","549033","552698","552565","553104","548838","543776","548954","553110","543634","553100","554128","553105","553814"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cattle","herd","cowboy","horse","kick","imbue","movement","establish","recede","drive"]}
