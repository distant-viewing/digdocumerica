{"path":"553138.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of outdoor labor involving two men and construction equipment in a desert setting. On the left side of the image, a man is seated on the operator's seat of a yellow and orange backhoe loader. He is wearing a light-colored cowboy hat, a dark long-sleeve shirt, denim jeans, and appears to be watching the work ahead or interacting with the other man. His posture is relaxed and he is clearly handling the vehicle's controls.\n\nOn the right, another man, dressed in a plaid shirt and jeans, is using a shovel near the extended arm of the backhoe. He appears to be digging or adjusting something in the dirt, working closely with the machine. The way the backhoe bucket is positioned suggests that it has recently deposited or is ready to move some earth.\n\nThe background shows a vast, open landscape typical of a desert with light vegetation and mountains far in the distance under a bright, cloudy sky. To the right background, there is a parked car next to a small mound, which adds to the sense of activity in the area.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the heavy machinery on one side and manual labor on the other, framed by a rugged natural environment, emphasizes themes of development, teamwork, and the transformation of the landscape.","title":"Buddy Vidovich is working a new field, cleared by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the land subjugation program.","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["547498","543760","545652","554856","554937","548761","555601","545665","555636","556890","556903","545677","545664","545662","553093","557735"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["labor","desert","jean","loader","transformation","operator","man","shovel","cowboy","teamwork"]}
