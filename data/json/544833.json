{"path":"544833.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a candid moment among a group of people during a daytime outdoor gathering. On the right, an adult woman is holding a small, fluffy animal, possibly a chick, which she shows to the group around her. The woman is dressed in a patterned blue and white blouse and has short curly hair.\n\nTo her left, a group of adolescents, possibly teenagers, is gathered closely to see the animal. The group is composed of four visible young individuals. The first boy, on the far left, has shaggy dark hair and wears a maroon shirt; he is smiling and looking at the animal with interest. Next to him, a boy with light brown hair, wearing a grayish-blue jacket, also watches the animal. The third person, visible only partially, seems to be wearing a pale blue shirt. The fourth boy on the right has darker hair with a bowl cut style and wears a muted greenish-yellow shirt. His expression is attentive and curious as he observes the animal.\n\nThe background is fairly nondescript but suggests a clear, sunny day with a light blue sky.\n\nThis scene evokes a sense of informal learning or a shared moment of interest and curiosity, emphasizing a comfortable and friendly interaction between the woman and the adolescents.","title":"Colorado--Denver","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["543181","551766","558189","558292","543234","543238","554497","543178","545311","557004","545214","551028","551436","545308","558245","553151"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["animal","boy","hair","group","interest","woman","teenager","bowl","learning","shirt"]}
