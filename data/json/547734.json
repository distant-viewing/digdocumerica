{"path":"547734.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, middle-aged man standing in a field with a large agricultural harvester in the background. The man is dressed in a manner typical for farm work; he wears a wide-brimmed cowboy hat, eyeglasses, a plaid shirt, and a red bandana around his neck, highlighting a practical yet distinctive style often seen in rural settings. His facial expression is serious and attentive, suggesting a moment of pause in his work.\n\nBehind him, there is a large red combine harvester, a machine used for reaping, threshing, and winnowing grain crops, parked in a field that has been recently harvested, evidenced by the short, stubbly remains of crop stalks on the ground. The landscape is vast and open under a clear blue sky, indicating a dry, sunny day ideal for farming activities. The backdrop is predominantly flat, with only a few scattered trees interrupting the horizon, emphasizing the expansive agricultural setting typical of rural farmland. The composition of the image, with the man positioned upfront and the machinery in the background, places a strong focus on the individual's connection to the land and the tools of his trade.","title":"Harvesting a Palo Verde Valley wheat field on the edge of the Colorado river.
