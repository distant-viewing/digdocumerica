{"path":"555560.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features a somber scene of multiple dead fish floating in water. The water appears dark and serene, adding contrast to the pale, lifeless bodies of the fish. There are various types and sizes of fish, some lying flat on their sides while others are partially submerged or slightly tilted, showing different patterns and colors on their scales. Light reflects off the wet surfaces of the fish and the rippling water around them. No visible vegetation or other wildlife is present in the frame, focusing all attention on the fish. The overall composition draws attention to the environmental or ecological narrative possibly suggested by the image.","title":"Dead fish were evident in a four mile stretch of the Olentangy River on June 20, 1974, when chemicals spilled into the river. The pollution was caused when a Pennwalt Corporation chemical storage building was desTroyed by fire and explosions authorities believe lightning caused the fire. EPA personnel supervised the cleanup.","placename":"Delaware (Ohio)","location":"Delaware, Ohio","nn1":["546930","547704","546846","546782","547687","546779","547737","546898","550878","542985","546784","552067","546185","548973","546792","545063"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["fish","attention","wildlife","narrative","water","size","type","scale","other","pattern"]}
