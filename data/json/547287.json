{"path":"547287.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up shot of a single, green grass blade horizontally across the frame. The focus is on a series of round, clear water droplets resting uniformly along the surface of the blade. There are five primary water droplets varying slightly in size, reflecting the light and showing minute intricate details within the droplets, such as magnified and inverted images of the surrounding environment. The background of the photograph is dark and subdued, providing a stark contrast to the luminous, reflective quality of the water droplets and the bright, rich green of the grass blade. This contrast emphasizes the droplets and the delicate veins of the grass blade, enhancing the overall detail and texture visible in the photo.","title":"Rain drops on a blade of grass","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547312","555184","553853","543564","543565","558077","543629","555032","543852","557592","555044","543562","551371","544884","551357","557499"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["droplet","blade","minute","grass","vein","detail","shot","contrast","water","series"]}
