{"path":"544594.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a colorful roadside billboard welcoming visitors to Clewiston, which it describes as \"America's Sweetest Town.\" The prominent sign highlights local attractions and activities such as flying, golfing, bass fishing, and a bird sanctuary. The composition centers the billboard against a rural backdrop, featuring sprawling fields and a partly cloudy sky. The vivid blue and yellow colors of the sign are eye-catching and create a cheerful, inviting tone.\n\nTo the left of the image, there are some dark green trees partially visible, providing a natural border to the scene. Likewise, on the right, the frame edge might suggest that this is a view from a vehicle on a road parallel to the billboard. Below the sign, there's a guardrail, hinting at the proximity of a roadway in front of the sign. This setting suggests that the photograph was taken from a car, capturing a common experience for travelers encountering welcoming signs as they enter new towns.","title":"City limits of CLewiston","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548674","548730","544551","543814","549163","553017","553669","549161","548670","544287","545622","544145","549008","558089","543874","547841"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["billboard","sign","guardrail","traveler","attraction","roadside","border","roadway","experience","bird"]}
