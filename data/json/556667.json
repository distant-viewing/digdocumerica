{"path":"556667.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This is a nighttime photograph of a train station. The scene is captured under artificial lighting, giving the photo a slightly eerie, bluish-green tint. The focus is on a modern, silver-colored train that is stopped at the platform. The train, illuminated by its internal lights and some external lights on its roof, appears sleek and futuristic. \n\nThe platform is wet, reflecting the lights, which suggests it might have rained recently. To the right of the train, there are multiple tracks that recede into the distance, converging towards a vanishing point under a series of evenly spaced overhead lights, creating a perspective effect. These lights cast a glow and long reflections on the wet surface of the platform and tracks, enhancing the depth and mood of the scene.\n\nThe platform appears to be deserted with no visible passengers, adding a sense of solitude or quietness to the setting. The overall atmosphere evoked by the image is one of nighttime tranquility and the stillness often found in transit hubs during off-peak hours. The composition leverages linear perspective, lighting effects, and weather conditions to create a visually compelling and somewhat mysterious scene.","title":"One of amtrak's metroliner passenger trains which makes round trips between Washington, district of Columbia and New York city makes an early morning stop at a suburb near the nation's capital","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555959","556778","556673","556051","556670","551889","549675","556768","556649","548263","556021","556782","556784","556660","556129","556650"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","platform","leverage","track","vanish","quietness","light","effect","perspective","converge"]}
