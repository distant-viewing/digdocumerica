{"path":"545153.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene of a large, expansive pasture under an overcast sky. The field, lush and segmented by fencing, features several cows, both black and white, scattered across the landscape, grazing or resting. Some of the cows are close to the foreground while others are dispersed into the middle and back planes of the field.\n\nIn the background, a mountain range, partially obscured by mist or low clouds, adds a sense of depth and isolation typical of a secluded rural area. This background gives a gentle rise to the landscape, hinting at a quiet, pastoral setting far from urban centers.\n\nNoticeably, the image bears signs of age or wear, with visible specks, scratches and a slight fading of color, which may suggest it was taken on film and has endured some degradation over time. This textural detail contributes to the nostalgic feel of the photograph, evoking a sense of timelessness and continuity in rural life. The horizon is nearly centered in the frame, creating a balanced composition that emphasizes the vastness of the space and the tranquil life it supports.","title":"Dairy cattle","placename":"Tillamook (Or.)","location":"Tillamook, Oregon","nn1":["554560","542627","554071","542626","550833","557012","546102","557022","548984","542628","555645","549214","552566","553100","557749","552465"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cow","pastoral","continuity","timelessness","pasture","scratch","fencing","endure","plane","graze"]}
