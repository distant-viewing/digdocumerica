{"path":"551401.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph shows an intriguing outdoor nighttime setting, viewed through two large, possibly handmade, hanging nets that frame the image. In the center, a man sits amid an assortment of objects and debris, engaging in an activity that looks precise, potentially reading or handling some small, detailed objects on a makeshift table illuminated by a dim light source suggesting a lantern or fire.\n\nThe man is wearing a jacket with a checked shirt underneath and glasses, and appears focused on his task, suggesting a setting that could be a campsite or a remote outdoor location. Around him are scattered tools, boxes, and other camping or outdoor gear, which together with the nets give a sense of a makeshift or temporary setup. The ambiance is rustic and somewhat obscure, with the darkness of the surroundings contrasting with the somewhat warm glow around the man. The presence of the fire or light source adds a warm tone to otherwise dark and cool-colored scenography. The setting and items visible imply that the man might be engaged in an outdoor or wilderness activity, such as camping or fieldwork, requiring nighttime light and intricate manual work.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
