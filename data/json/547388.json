{"path":"547388.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a tranquil suburban street scene, capturing a sense of solitude and quietude. The view is down a long, straight stretch of road paved with bricks, lined with lush, mature trees. The trees are in full leaf, suggesting that it is either late spring or summer.\n\nIn the middle of the road, a figure is photographed from behind, walking away from the camera. The person appears to be wearing a jacket and carrying something in their left hand, possibly a bag. The lighting suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, as the shadows cast by the trees are long and diffused.\n\nOn either side of the road, residential lawns and driveways are visible. Two cars are parked on the sides of the street, and there's another vehicle in the distance, moving away from the viewer.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a serene, almost nostalgic atmosphere, reminiscent of quiet, residential life. The focus on the lone figure amidst this suburban idyll adds a layer of introspection or solitude to the scene.","title":"Associate county court judge, Fred Burns, on his daily bike ride to the Seaward County Courthouse","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557432","545372","558039","556448","556435","546430","550315","558139","546545","550994","557290","548473","556950","550216","547659","547354"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["solitude","road","introspection","driveway","quietude","figure","leaf","street","stretch","lawn"]}
