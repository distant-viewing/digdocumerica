{"path":"553945.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showcasing a diverse landscape with several notable features. On the left side of the image, there is a large body of water with a curved coastline that embraces a lush green area, possibly a forest or plantation with noticeable patterns suggesting agricultural activity. The contrast between the green area and the adjoining brownish land highlights different land uses or seasonal changes in vegetation.\n\nMoving towards the center and right part of the image, the landscape transitions into a more urban environment. This region is densely packed with various structures and buildings, indicating a developed urban area. There are wide roads and possibly some industrial facilities visible, as evidenced by large buildings and storage tanks. Toward the far right, there is a complex of larger buildings that could be a commercial area or an industrial park.\n\nIn the background, merging with the horizon, there is an overcast sky casting soft lighting over the entire scene, which enhances the color contrasts between the urban and natural landscapes. The presence of clouds suggests overcast weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nThe photograph provides a comprehensive overview of a region where natural and urban environments coexist, offering insights into land use and urban planning in coastal areas.","title":"Area of H-2 Freeway and northeast corner of Kuneo Road near Waipahu. 316 acres of cleared land here, once growing sugar, has awaited development since 1968, when it was rezoned from agriculture to urban use.","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["553778","548636","544441","547508","557504","556919","557452","548779","556953","557532","553943","553974","550557","554057","554052","550550"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["land","embrace","insight","region","overview","coexist","planning","merge","coastline","develop"]}
