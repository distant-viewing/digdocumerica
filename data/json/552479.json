{"path":"552479.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph displays the front view of a modest, old building identified as the \"Church of Christ.\" The structure is painted white with black accents and has a symmetrical facade featuring a central doorway flanked by two large, shuttered windows. Above the door, a plain sign with black lettering displays the church's name. \n\nThe building's architectural focal point is its triangular gable with an overhanging eave that houses a square, vented bell tower capped with a pyramidal roof. This roof is notably darker than the facade, suggesting it might be made of a different material, possibly metal. \n\nThe entryway consists of a single, unornamented door reached by a short flight of concrete steps. Sparse vegetation, including a couple of small bushes, grows beside the staircase, and patchy grass covers the ground, suggesting somewhat neglected surroundings. The background shows a clear blue sky, indicating the photograph was taken on a sunny day without any visible clouds.","title":"Small country church","placename":"Princeville (Ill.)","location":"Princeville, Illinois","nn1":["554207","558163","545366","557083","558019","556480","558018","558034","552542","554208","547333","550376","554035","558024","558023","554000"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["eave","facade","door","entryway","gable","bell","staircase","accent","roof","flight"]}
