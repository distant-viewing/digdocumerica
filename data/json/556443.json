{"path":"556443.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up portrait of a middle-aged man. He appears to be standing, facing slightly towards the camera with a direct gaze that conveys a sense of earnestness. His facial expression is neutral with a trace of a contemplative or solemn mood.\n\nThe man has dark, slightly disheveled hair and a few days' growth of beard. His skin shows signs of weathering and there are visible wrinkles around his eyes, which adds to the character of his face. He wears a dark jacket with a lighter, fleece-like collar that seems practical and somewhat worn.\n\nThe background of the image is blurred but suggests an urban nighttime setting with soft, dim lighting and vertical elements that could be either bars or parts of a fence. The lighting casts subtle shadows and highlights on the manâ€™s face, enhancing the textures and contours of his features.\n\nOverall, the composition and the subdued color palette convey a gritty, realistic feel, focusing on the emotions and life experiences etched into the man's face. This photographic style is evocative, perhaps aiming to portray a moment of introspection or a slice of everyday life.","title":"Doren Bishop, superintendent for Robin Mines owned by the Alma Coal Corporation, sits in a beer joint in Clothier, West Virginia near Madison.
