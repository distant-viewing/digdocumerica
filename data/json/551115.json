{"path":"551115.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a dilapidated structure, likely a house, set in a verdant, tree-covered environment. The wooden building appears weathered and run-down, featuring two principal parts: a smaller section with a balcony, and a larger section on stilts, exposing its understructure. Both sections are made of old, stained wood and possess slanted, metal roofs.\n\nThe house's windows are small and square, framed with white painted wood, contrasting with the darker tones of the structure's exterior. Notably, one window pane is broken, adding to the general disrepair of the scene. A wooden staircase with missing steps leads up to the balcony of the smaller part, indicating limited accessibility and neglect.\n\nScattered around the front of the house are various objects, including an old, rusted car to the left, which looks abandoned and partially dismantled. Nearby, a wide array of debris and clutter is visible: broken chairs, barrels, a discarded refrigerator, wooden crates, and scattered smaller items, creating a sense of chaos and decay.\n\nThe overall atmosphere evoked by the photograph is one of abandonment and decline, underscored by the encroaching nature surrounding the scene. This setting suggests a remote, rural location, with little attention paid to maintenance or order. The road is paved, indicating some connectivity to broader infrastructure, yet the immediate surroundings reflect a stark neglect.","title":"Housing on Route 61 at Eagle in the Kanawha Valley region","placename":"Charleston (W.
