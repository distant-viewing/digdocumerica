{"path":"552616.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of men gathered around a long table in an indoor setting, seemingly engaged in a serious discussion or meeting. The room has a simple, utilitarian appearance with bare walls and fluorescent lighting. The table is cluttered with large sheets of paper, possibly maps or plans, and several documents, suggesting a planning session or workshop environment.\n\nThe men appear to be middle-aged and are dressed in casual and semi-casual attire. On the right side of the image, one man stands while addressing the group, gesturing with his right hand, indicating a discussion or presentation is taking place. He wears glasses and a patterned shirt. Opposite him, on the long side of the table, three men are seated closely together, all attentively looking toward the standing man. Each person shows varying degrees of engagement, with some directly looking at the speaker and others observing the documents in front of them.\n\nIn the background, additional seating is visible, suggesting the room is equipped to accommodate more people. The atmosphere conveys a sense of focus and cooperation among the participants. Overall, the scene captures a moment of collaborative work, likely involving community planning, business, or a similar professional activity.","title":"The coordinating committee, representing community and governmental groups, meets at city hall to consider proposed routes for I-70 in the Rifle area.
