{"path":"557401.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic, industrial scene, possibly inside a steel mill. The main focus is a large ladle or container suspended in the air, filled with molten metal. The container is tipping, pouring the glowing, orange liquid metal, which is creating bright sparks and a smoky atmosphere around it.\n\nThe environment is dimly lit, emphasizing the brightness of the molten metal and the sparks. Vertical beams, part of an overhead crane system, can be seen in the background, necessary for maneuvering such heavy loads within the facility. Additionally, some industrial lights and elements of the structural framework of the building are visible.\n\nThis image conveys a strong sense of industrial activity and the intense conditions typically found in metalworking or manufacturing environments. The contrast between the dark surroundings and the bright molten metal highlights the heat and energy involved in the process.","title":"\"fugitive smoke\" escapes through the top of the building during a casting operation at the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant total plant emissions for the metallurgical furnaces and the powerhouse were reduced 97.7 percent from 1967.
