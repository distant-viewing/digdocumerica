{"path":"545550.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural scene characterized by large, monumental red rock formations. The rock formations are weathered and deeply striated, suggesting erosion over many years. They tower majestically with a dramatic split between them, forming a narrow passage or gateway.\n\nSituated in this natural alcove created by the split rocks is a small, ancient-looking stone structure. This structure appears to be made of stacked stones and is positioned directly under the gap between the two massive rocks. Its placement and construction suggest it could be of historical or archaeological interest, perhaps serving as a shelter or ceremonial site in the past.\n\nIn the foreground, a person can be seen standing near the rock formations, giving a sense of scale to the enormous size of these natural features. The individual appears relatively small when compared to the grandeur of the surrounding rock environment, emphasizing the awe-inspiring nature of the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the image—with its focus on the contrast between the enduring strength of the rocks and the seemingly delicate, man-made structure—paints a picture of solitude, survival, and the passage of time within a rugged and harsh desert environment. The sky above is clear, adding a sense of openness and starkness to the scene.","title":"Keyhole ruin, on Horse Creek, was once a home to preColumbian cliff dwellers.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545554","545805","544397","544931","544898","545696","544363","545797","545566","544341","545791","543838","545801","545792","543846","545571"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["rock","formation","passage","survival","stone","strength","starkness","awe","gap","past"]}
