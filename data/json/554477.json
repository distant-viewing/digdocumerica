{"path":"554477.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and picturesque lakeside scene during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the dim, warm lighting and the silhouettes of the people and landscape. The scene is framed by the outline of a tree branch in the upper part of the image, which adds a natural border and focuses the viewer's attention towards the center of the photograph.\n\nIn the middle ground, a small group of people is gathered on a floating wooden dock that extends into the lake. There are about seven individuals visible, standing in relaxed, casual poses. Some are looking towards each other, suggesting a social gathering or conversation, while others are looking out over the water. The figures are all silhouetted against the shimmering light reflecting off the slightly rippled water surface, which gives the whole scene a tranquil mood.\n\nBeyond the dock and the group of people, the water stretches out towards a softly blurred background of hills or low mountains. The hills are layered at different distances, creating a sense of depth. The sky above them blends harmoniously with the water, unified by the muted tones of the twilight.\n\nThe overall feel of the photograph is peaceful and somewhat nostalgic, emphasizing the beauty of natural landscapes and simple moments shared among people. The image subtly plays with light and shadow, using the natural backlighting to highlight the outlines of the figures and the surrounding nature, crafting a composition that is both simple and profound.","title":"Swimmers and boat at sunset on Fourth Lake near Inlet, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545229","553440","543892","543601","554759","547052","557563","557493","549716","550299","550324","545911","544266","551207","543579","554516"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["outline","people","dock","backlighting","silhouette","figure","group","hill","craft","sunrise"]}
