{"path":"551659.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene where two women and a child are engaged in different activities, seemingly in a public courtyard or garden-like setting. The dominant features and activities within the composition can be described as follows:\n\n1. **Weaving**: Central to the image is a woman wearing a red short-sleeve shirt and a flower-patterned skirt, active at a weaving loom. She seems focused on her craft, handling what appears to be yarn or thread, integral to the weaving process.\n\n2. **Relaxation and Crafting**: To the right of the woman at the loom, there is another woman seated at a table, dressed in a blue shirt. She has an open book in front of her. Next to her is a table containing various small objects which can be inferred as craft supplies or possibly refreshments, contributing to a relaxed, leisurely atmosphere.\n\n3. **Observation**: A child is positioned slightly in the foreground, observed from the back. The child is facing towards the weaving activity, suggesting attention or interest in the process. \n\n4. **Setting**: The setting is richly adorned with greenery, primarily ferns, sprouting around the stone or concrete terrain of the courtyard. These lush plants introduce a vivid natural element contrasting with the urban-style pavement.\n\n5. **Composition and Perspective**: Taken from an elevated perspective, the photograph captures the subjects engaging intimately with their tasks amidst a background that suggests a blend of artisanship and leisure within an urban retreat. The image's composition effectively balances human activity with the natural environment, crafting a scene of tranquil productivity.\n\nOverall, the mood conveyed is peaceful, with a sense of communal and creative energy, thus illustrating a slice of daily life that underscores cultural and artistic engagement.","title":"Loom-weaving, one of the demonstrations in the Rockefeller Center Festival of Folk Arts and Crafts","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544416","551654","544360","553283","551265","551676","551677","557153","544431","549283","545372","553709","551104","544808","550076","551480"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["courtyard","craft","woman","child","table","thread","refreshment","productivity","process","retreat"]}
