{"path":"557292.jpg","date":"November 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a multilevel parking structure filled with a variety of cars. The image is taken from an elevated angle, looking down on the structure, showcasing four levels of the concrete parking garage.\n\nThe cars parked on each level display a range of colors and sizes, indicative of models from the 1960s or 1970s, judging by their design. Several cars are notable for their bright colors like red, yellow, and blue, interspersed with more neutral tones of black, white, and grey.\n\nThe lanes where the cars are parked appear orderly, arranged in neat rows confined by the concrete barriers of each parking level. There are no visible people or other activities besides the parked cars. The focus of the photograph is purely on the parked vehicles and the structure itself, emphasizing the pattern and repetition in urban design and automotive presence.\n\nThe concrete barriers have a repetitive triangular pattern underneath each level, adding a textural detail to the otherwise functional appearance of the parking garage. The high contrast between the dark shadows of the structure and the brightly lit surfaces by sunlight enhances the visual impact of the composition. This type of image often serves to convey themes of urban development, transport, or the proliferation of automobiles in urban settings.","title":"Multi-level car parking lot.
