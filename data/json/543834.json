{"path":"543834.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a detail-oriented scene inside a laboratory. In the foreground, two large glass bottles labeled \"VITRO USA\" are prominently displayed. One bottle is filled with a amber-colored liquid and is labeled with the number \"06\", while the other holds a murky grey substance and is marked with the number \"107\". These bottles also each have a glass stopper.\n\nIn the background, a man, appearing intensely focused, is examining a piece of paper (likely lab results or notes) while holding a red pen. He is wearing glasses and a light-colored lab coat striped with blue and grey, which suggests he might be a scientist or lab technician. His facial expression and posture indicate concentration and meticulous attention to the information in front of him.\n\nThe laboratory setting is filled with soft natural light, likely coming from a nearby window, and equipment such as tubing and other glassware partially visible in the very blurred background, suggesting an active scientific workspace. This light casts reflective highlights on the bottles and objects around the lab, adding a shine to their surfaces which contrasts with the more matte texture of the lab coat and the man's skin.","title":"Technician at sewage treatment plant performs a \"biological oxygen demand\" test.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["546278","555281","555253","546284","546296","549333","546277","555280","549608","542666","546285","549605","543801","542737","545002","555250"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["lab","bottle","laboratory","glass","coat","number","tubing","glassware","technician","scientist"]}
