{"path":"552313.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an early morning fishing scene on a serene, vast body of water. Two boats are featured prominently in the image. The boat on the left is a white and blue motorboat filled with several individuals engaged in fishing activities; one person is actively casting a fishing rod while another is holding a net, presumably ready to catch any fish that are reeled in. \n\nThe second boat, predominantly green with a white section near the bow, includes two individuals who appear to be tending to fishing poles. Both boats are sitting low on the calm water, indicating a quiet and tranquil environment, with no visible waves or much movement on the surface of the water.\n\nThe background is a gradient of soft purple transforming into a light blue, suggesting the time of day is either dawn or dusk. The horizon is subtly defined, blending the water with the sky in a hazy, soft focus that conveys a sense of peacefulness and isolation from the busyness of everyday life.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its muted colors and soft lighting, emphasizes a tranquil and reflective outdoor activity, offering a glimpse into a moment of leisure and connection with nature.","title":"Salmon fishermen at evening fishing the Strait of Juan de Fuca","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547549","552308","547555","552317","557565","546980","549417","546939","546976","552124","547553","547556","551350","545055","548247","554147"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","busyness","motorboat","bow","peacefulness","net","rod","water","fish"]}
