{"path":"552542.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts the facade of a Gothic-style church building. This stone structure features a symmetrical design emphasized by a steeply pitched gable roof. At the peak of the roof, there is a small triangular vent. Below the vent, centered near the roofline, is a simple round window divided into eight segments resembling a wheel.\n\nThe main entrance consists of a set of double doors made from wood, arched at the top with a fanlight window above that mirrors the arch of the doorway. This door is framed on its left and right by two tall, narrow windows. Each window is topped with a rounded arch and filled with multiple glass panes divided by lead or wooden muntins. Flanking these windows are two additional doors, both wooden and slightly smaller than the double doors, each topped with a similar arched window.\n\nOn the stone wall above the main double doors is a plaque or a decorative stone tablet, though its inscriptions are not legible from the image. Additionally, there are ornamental iron hooks, shaped like 'S,' possibly meant for hanging lamps or decorations.\n\nThe building's external walls are made of rough, gray stone, and the church appears to be well-maintained, although the doors show some signs of weathering, particularly on the paint. There is a concrete pavement leading up to the steps of the doors, reinforcing the structureâ€™s sturdy, historical appearance. The sky is overcast, giving the scene a somber, tranquil ambiance.","title":"St. John's Lutheran Church in New Minden","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["550376","558019","558018","557083","545366","558163","557088","557082","552479","554207","558034","546476","558024","557093","558162","558023"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["door","stone","window","vent","church","arch","plaque","hook","inscription","roofline"]}
