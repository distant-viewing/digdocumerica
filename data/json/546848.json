{"path":"546848.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph shows a long line of trailer trains loaded with multiple levels of new cars in an outdoor setting. Each multi-level car carrier trailer holds a variety of differently colored cars, arranged in a near-vertical stack. The vehicles exhibited include models in red, white, yellow, and several shades of blue and green. \n\nThe image is captured during daylight with an overcast sky, which casts a soft light over the scene, reducing shadow and contrast. This setup is typically found in a shipping area or industrial zone designated for transporting vehicles. In the background, there are industrial structures and what appears to be dockside cranes, indicating that this location could be near a port or a large logistics center. There are no human figures visible in the image, focusing entirely on the transportation of these vehicles. The ground is paved, and marked with parking lines, further suggesting an organized industrial or commercial space.","title":"Freight carrier, loaded with cars, ready for transfer to a ship at dundalk marine terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["549704","549688","542633","542639","542635","549696","546900","547265","547469","553741","553011","547686","553022","552063","547480","548980"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["trailer","car","vehicle","reduce","transporting","designate","logistic","shipping","port","zone"]}
