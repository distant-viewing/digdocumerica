{"path":"553825.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic aerial view of a mountainous landscape shrouded partly in clouds and mist. The foreground and midground feature undulating hills and lower mountains, some of which are cloaked in shadows. These areas are punctuated with patches of light presumably reflecting off water bodies and scattered settlements or structures visible due to their lights, creating a speckled pattern across the darker terrain.\n\nTowards the center and slightly to the left, there is a significant water body, its smooth surface reflecting the surrounding light and appearing as a muted silver or grey tone against the darker surrounding landscape. The background of the photo showcases higher mountain ridges, layered progressively into the distance, creating a sense of depth. The ridges are softer and obscured by a mix of mist and cloud cover.\n\nAbove this serene yet dramatic natural scenery, the sky is a rich gradient of blues and grays, indicative of either dawn or dusk. Large clouds hover low, casting shadows on the mountains below, and a single larger cloud formation in the upper right corner appears luminescent, likely illuminated by the sun just beyond the frame of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a tranquil and somewhat mysterious atmosphere, highlighted by the interplay of light, shadow, and natural elements. It suggests a moment of quiet solitude above a vast and timeless landscape.","title":"Copper mines and smelter, (from the Sites Exhibition.
