{"path":"551075.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a striking juxtaposition between domestic life and industrial backdrop. In the foreground, a quaint, well-maintained yard includes a short, metal-link fence surrounding a patch of lush green grass. Inside the yard, a child is seen playing, seemingly engrossed in activity on the grass. There are items of clothing hanging on a clothesline, gently breezing in the wind, which adds a touch of homeliness to the scene.\n\nTwo houses occupy the middle ground; one is painted red while the other is a neutral color, possibly white or beige. Both houses feature traditional architectural designs typical of residential constructions, with visible pitched roofs and chimneys.\n\nIn stark contrast, looming in the background are large industrial structures, possibly a factory or plant, with tall smokestacks emitting fumes. The plant stands stark against a backdrop of densely wooded hills, enhancing the contrast between the natural and manufactured environments.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph highlights the close proximity in which industrial and residential areas can exist, blending daily life activities with the realities of industrial presence. The smokestacks, significant in size and imposing, dominate the background and perhaps signify economic activity, while also imposing an environmental and visual impact on the residential surroundings.","title":"Shrewsbury homes across the kanawha river from Cabin Creek power plant.
