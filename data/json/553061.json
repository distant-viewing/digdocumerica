{"path":"553061.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a sprawling suburban development, likely in its initial or mid stages of construction. The image shows numerous winding roads and cul-de-sacs that are mostly devoid of houses or any significant structures, indicating that the area is preparing for or undergoing significant residential development. The roads are paved and distinct, forming an intricate network throughout the area.\n\nThe topography is varied, with undulating hills and flat areas, creating diverse building sites. Sparse vegetation, primarily small bushes and scattered trees, can be seen throughout the location. A notable water body, possibly a river or lake, gently curves along the bottom left of the image, adding to the scenic aspect of the environment.\n\nThere are only a few buildings visible, potentially temporary structures or early homes, mostly concentrated in one section of the development. The absence of heavy machinery suggests that construction might not be actively ongoing at the moment the photo was taken.\n\nIn the background, beyond the development, a denser collection of trees and greener terrain can be observed, contrasting with the primarily barren landscape of the suburban development. This might hint at existing natural areas surrounding the development, which could be a selling point for future residents seeking close proximity to nature. \n\nOverall, the scene captured in this photograph reflects a significant human intervention in a natural landscape, aimed at creating a residential community with its carefully planned and executed road infrastructure.","title":"Recreational development of lake travis, Texas.
