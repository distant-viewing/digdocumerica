{"path":"546070.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil outdoor scene focused on a small body of water. In the foreground, a vibrant, red and gray rowing boat labeled with the number \"6\" is the central focus, with an individual seated at the rear, actively rowing. The lake reflects a clear blue sky and the surroundings enhancing the serenity of the scene.\n\nThe background is richly decorated with lush, verdant trees in various shades of green, indicating a well-maintained park-like setting. This landscape provides a natural-frame around the lake, featuring a variety of species including what appear to be tall palms and other deciduous trees. The bank opposite the viewer has a small sandy area leading to the water, where ducks are visible, adding liveliness to the serene environment.\n\nThere's a hint of human activity in the distance, on the far shore of the lake where individuals can be seen possibly strolling or resting in the park area. The light and shadows suggest that the photograph was taken on a clear day, possibly in the late morning or early afternoon when sunlight is abundant. This setting portrays a peaceful day at a park, ideal for leisure activities like rowing and nature-watching.","title":"Pedal boat in city park lagoon","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["550054","551680","551679","550324","550975","550780","550674","553403","549417","552982","550779","557562","543579","557563","544266","554486"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["rowing","lake","duck","park","liveliness","stroll","serenity","palm","specie","decorate"]}
