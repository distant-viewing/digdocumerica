{"path":"548021.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an impressive natural scene centered around a towering waterfall. The waterfall descends sharply from the top of a rocky cliff into a dark, seemingly deep pool below. The water's flow is intense, creating a narrow, white stream against the darker background of the rock face, which is rough and jagged.\n\nIn the foreground, at the bottom right corner of the image, two people are visible. They appear to be tourists, observing the waterfall from a viewing point. Both individuals are dressed in light-colored clothing which contrasts with the darker hues of their surroundings. They are on a trail or viewing platform surrounded by lush green vegetation which adds a vibrant touch to the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photo suggests it is taken during a time of day when the sun is not directly overhead, creating shadows that enhance the depth and the rugged textures of the cliffs. The overall composition of the photo places the waterfall as the central element, framed naturally by the rocky cliff and the vegetation, with human figures adding a sense of scale and the presence of life. This setting likely represents a remote, natural environment ideal for exploration and admiration of natural beauty.","title":"Multnomah falls, which falls 542 feet into a basin which enters the Columbia River, is the second highest falls in the u.s","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["542699","544344","554113","544348","553068","544350","554512","553397","542698","549629","544346","545874","542594","544340","544456","550697"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","cliff","admiration","descend","viewing","tourist","ideal","trail","pool","jag"]}
