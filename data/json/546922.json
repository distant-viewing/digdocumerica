{"path":"546922.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a serene yet slightly unkempt outdoor scene, mainly focused on a small, narrow stream meandering through a natural environment. The stream, reflecting hints of the sky and surroundings, reveals patches of foam or some type of surface accumulation, indicating possible stagnation or pollution.\n\nIn the foreground, a makeshift barrier constructed from netting and supported by wooden poles spans across part of the stream. This could possibly be a tool for ecological monitoring, debris control, or water sampling.\n\nTwo individuals can be seen standing on one bank of the stream. They appear engaged in either observing the water or possibly discussing the environmental condition of the streambed. Both are dressed in casual outdoor attire, suitable for a day of fieldwork or a nature hike. Their attention seems focused on the water or something within the stream rather than the camera, suggesting an impromptu capture of ongoing activities rather than a posed photo.\n\nThe surrounding area is littered with leafless shrubs and bare trees, implying either a late fall or early spring season setting. This contributes to the slightly stark, dormant appearance of the vegetation, which aligns with the functional, unsentimental character of the scene. The natural light, perhaps indicating late afternoon, enhances the tranquility and slightly melancholic tone of the setting.","title":"After a spill of 4000 gallons of oil, workers have placed booms across Stony Run to contain the oil, and a special material to soak it up.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["551423","550351","547526","545473","549641","546896","553427","554406","543829","555153","545008","542526","555218","554775","550238","546338"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["stream","netting","sampling","hike","fieldwork","capture","monitoring","accumulation","foam","fall"]}
