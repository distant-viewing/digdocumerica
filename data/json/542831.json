{"path":"542831.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a rugged mountain landscape, most likely during late spring as indicated by the significant amounts of snow still covering the peaks and ridges. We see multiple mountain ranges stretching into the distance, each characterized by sharp, steep slopes and narrow, rocky ridges. The mountains are predominantly covered in white snow, contrasting with some exposed dark rock faces and patches of evergreen forest in the valleys and lower slopes. The sky above is clear with a faint presence of wispy clouds, suggesting a calm, clear day which enhances the visibility across this expansive, mountainous terrain. This image conveys a sense of serene, untouched wilderness, typical of high-altitude mountain ranges. There are no visible human activities or constructions, highlighting the natural and pristine state of the environment.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542519","550423","552144","550422","550514","542843","550501","550515","550502","542830","542520","550500","542842","544936","550413","544866"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","ridge","snow","slope","range","amount","altitude","visibility","spring","peak"]}
