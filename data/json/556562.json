{"path":"556562.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image captures a moment in a rural or outdoor setting featuring two individuals and a pony. The primary focus is on a young woman with short hair, who looks focused and slightly concerned. She is wearing a graphic T-shirt and is walking beside a small, dark-colored pony, guiding it by a bridle or harness. On the pony, there appears to be a young child or a smaller individual, mostly obscured by the woman and out of focus, adding a sense of candidness and movement to the scene.\n\nThe environment around them is natural and somewhat rugged, with a dirt track and vegetation in soft focus in the background, suggesting a countryside or park setting. The lighting suggests it might be a bright day as it creates sharp contrasts and vivid colors in the scene.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of casual outdoor activity, possibly part of a family outing or a leisure event involving horse or pony riding in a natural setting. There's an intimate feel to the interaction between the woman and the pony, emphasizing care and attention in the midst of a serene, natural landscape.","title":"Donna Smith, 16, daughter of disabled miner Jack Smith, from Rhodell, near Beckley, West Virginia, rides the family pony with a neighbor seated behind her.
