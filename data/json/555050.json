{"path":"555050.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image depicts a lush, dense display of various tropical plants, primarily dominated by large, broad leaves and tightly curled fern fronds. The leaves showcased include large, dark green ones with notable white spots and a glossy texture, possibly from water droplets, indicative of their presence in a humid environment. Alongside these are ferns with fronds that transition in color from deep green to a rusty red, particularly at the curled tips which spiral inward in a natural yet artistic manner.\n\nThe lighting in the photo suggests either a shaded environment under the forest canopy or diffused sunlight, enhancing the deep greens and highlighting the intricate water droplets, giving a fresh, wet look to the foliage. The ferns' fronds have a unique architectural quality, with their spiral growth pattern resembling organic springs.\n\nThe composition of the photo is dense and layered, giving it a textured depth, with the different plants intermingling and overlapping, creating a rich tapestry of greens and reds, interspersed with the glistening of water. There is an absence of any discernible sky, ground, or any other objects, emphasizing the focus exclusively on the botanical elements. The diversity in leaf sizes and colors creates a vibrant, dynamic visual exploration of flora in a tropical setting.","title":"Climax forest ground cover of deer ferns, western sword/ferns, and bead ruby plants on an ocean strip in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555192","555049","555368","555093","554993","554996","555191","554957","555019","555043","545285","543542","555054","554992","546014","551356"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["frond","fern","droplet","green","red","leave","tip","tapestry","leaf","plant"]}
