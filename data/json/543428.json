{"path":"543428.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph portrays a dramatic coastal landscape. It predominantly features rugged sea cliffs with a series of undulating, grass-covered hills that rise steeply from the ocean's edge. The cliffs are sharply defined, contrasting vividly with the frothy white waves crashing against their base. The hills are illuminated by what appears to be late afternoon sunlight, accentuating their contours and creating deep shadows in the folds of the terrain.\n\nThe color palette is rich, with the golden tones of the sunlit hilltops and darker greens in the shaded areas, all set against a muted blue ocean and a partly cloudy sky above. In the mid-ground, there is a small, flat pasture area where a few buildings can be seen, possibly a farm or rural dwellings, nestled quietly among the hills.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is dynamic, but peaceful, capturing both the harsh, enduring aspects of the natural landscape and the serene, transient play of light. The place feels remote and sparsely inhabited, highlighting a natural environment that seems largely untouched by human development. The overall mood is one of isolation and the sublime beauty of nature.","title":"California -- Monterey","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543431","543184","543424","543304","543249","543061","545934","543291","543328","545125","543300","545122","543433","543080","545222","543297"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","hill","ocean","hilltop","dwelling","pasture","fold","crash","endure","undulate"]}
