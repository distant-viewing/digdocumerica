{"path":"553273.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of an urban scene. At the center of the image is a large public gathering, possibly a rally or event, where a dense crowd of people is assembled in what appears to be a city plaza or park area. The people are primarily clustered around the center of the square, and their distribution thins as the space extends outwards.\n\nThe area in which the crowd is gathered is bordered by several large buildings, creating a clearly defined urban environment. The most prominent features of these buildings include a large, grey structure directly opposite the viewpoint that sports a few rows of windows at the top and a logo or sign that reads \"Macy's.\" Adjacent to it is another building with signage stating \"Standard Federal\" along with an American flag displayed prominently in front. These suggest the scene is likely set in the United States.\n\nSeveral trees provide a touch of greenery in the plaza, offering a contrast to the concrete surroundings. The viewpoints from left to right show a partial view of a window frame, indicating that the photo was taken from inside another building overlooking this scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere suggested by the composition of the photograph is one of communal activity and urban life, captured on a bright, sunny day, given the clear sky and the shadows visible on the ground.","title":"Fountain square is downtown Cincinnati's popular public plaza.
