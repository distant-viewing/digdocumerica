{"path":"542817.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph shows a scene containing a large, paved parking area with a lineup of vintage Volkswagen Beetles parked in a row. The vehicles vary in color, including red, yellow, white, and light blue. Each car is identical in model, signaling a possible gathering or event for enthusiasts of this particular car type.\n\nIn the background, an ornate building with a steep, pointed roof and detailed architectural features implies a historical or significant location, possibly a school or community building. This structure is partially obscured by modern, less detailed buildings, including one with large garage doors.\n\nTo the left side of the photograph, mature trees are visible, suggesting the location is in a well-established area. The environment around the buildings and parking lot seems well-maintained but simple.\n\nIn the foreground, the focus is brought unexpectedly close to a small dandelion growing through a crack in the pavement, highlighting a contrast between nature and the man-made environment. The inclusion of this element adds a layer of depth and perhaps a comment on resilience and natural beauty in a structured setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment that blends vintage automotive culture with distinctive architectural and natural elements, creating a visually interesting and layered scene.","title":"Californiaâ€”Eureka","placename":"Eureka (Calif.)","location":"Eureka, California","nn1":["551912","550909","542637","542634","546665","556790","550908","542638","542640","549852","553896","550796","547495","557882","547954","557692"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["parking","lineup","comment","dandelion","enthusiast","inclusion","layer","school","establish","garage"]}
