{"path":"556134.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The image depicts a side profile of an African woman smiling, captured in natural lighting that enhances the contour and expressiveness of her features. She wears a vibrant yellow head wrap made of a woven, textured fabric that fits snugly around her head. Her ear is adorned with a large, dark-colored hoop earring that appears to be made from a glossy material. Additionally, she has another distinctive accessory: a lip ring, also dark and glossy, which matches her earring.\n\nThe woman's neck is partially visible, showing she is wearing a dark jacket or coat with visible portions of a yellow garment underneath, possibly a turtleneck, suggesting the setting might be in cooler weather. The background is beautifully out of focus in hues of blue and green, providing a calm and neutral backdrop that contrasts nicely with the brightness of her head wrap.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on capturing a joyful moment, highlighted by her radiant smile and the intimate details of her adornments and attire, set against a softly blurred background.","title":"Young woman soliciting funds for a Chicago organization in a shopping center parking lot, she is one of the nearly 1.2 million Black people who make up over one third of the population of Chicago, it is one of the many Black faces in this project that portray life in all its seasons, the photos are portraits that reflect pride, love, beauty, hope, struggle, joy, hate, frustration, discontent, worship and faith, she is a member of her race who is proud of her heritage.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556150","556143","553708","551384","556254","545373","556142","553918","556470","553178","556151","553916","553760","556412","553499","554923"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["earring","wrap","head","smile","hoop","turtleneck","lip","accessory","ring","ear"]}
