{"path":"548785.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of a coastal landscape, possibly an island or peninsula, surrounded by different shades of turquoise sea water. The landscape is predominantly green, suggesting dense vegetation, which might include bushes, trees, and various types of scrubland typical of coastal regions.\n\nCurving around the greenery, there is a narrow strip of white sandy beach delineating the boundary between the land and the sea. Inland, there appear to be several small pathways or dirt roads snaking through the vegetation, although no buildings or structures are immediately visible, which could indicate a relatively untouched or conserved natural area.\n\nThe sea around the land shows variations in color, ranging from dark blue to light turquoise, indicating different depths or seabed compositions. Some areas of the sea closer to the land have a sandy, shallow appearance, while others are deeper. The top right part of the image includes another land mass across the water, suggesting this location might be part of a larger archipelago or coastal area with multiple landforms nearby.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph provides a sense of tranquil, pristine natural beauty, typical of protected coastal regions or less developed islands. The perspective offers a broad view that highlights the interface between land and sea, emphasizing the natural geographic features without any overt human impact visible in this frame.","title":"Eastern end of Summerland Key, as yet undeveloped","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548604","548630","554171","557466","554170","554023","554022","547637","553983","554156","552922","548605","554057","543427","548787","543088"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["sea","land","island","interface","peninsula","region","mass","landform","strip","variation"]}
