{"path":"546015.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an expanse of water with a notable surface disruption caused by an oil spill. The water's surface has a mix of textures and colors, primarily dark blues contrasted with swirling patterns of rusty brown and reddish hues, indicative of oil contamination. The thick oil creates glossy, iridescent patches on the water, reflecting sunlight in some areas while appearing opaque in others.\n\nThe image captures the dynamic interaction between the water's natural currents and the invasive oil, forming smeared and streaked patterns across the surface. There is no visible shoreline or other objects in the image; the focus is solely on the environmental issue presented by the oil spill, underscored by its vivid contrast and the lack of wildlife or human activity in the scene. It serves as a stark visual reminder of the impact of pollution on natural water bodies.","title":"Large quantities of oil were spilled in the Mississippi River when a Liberian tanker collided with a barge.","placename":"Kenner (La.)","location":"Kenner, Louisiana","nn1":["547617","546806","547614","553898","544580","548205","544175","546889","551560","551561","547493","550690","547618","550734","545014","555848"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["oil","spill","reminder","contamination","water","surface","disruption","current","pattern","issue"]}
