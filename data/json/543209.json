{"path":"543209.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment on a beach setting where the dominant elements include the sandy shore, the ocean's tidal waves, and a clear sky partially visible at the top. In the foreground, a rider on a three-wheeled ATV (all-terrain vehicle) is driving along the sandy beach. The rider is positioned on the right side of the frame and is moving from right to left given the visible tire tracks in the sand behind the vehicle.\n\nThe focus of the image is on the ATV and its rider, both casting shadows on the sand, suggesting the photo was taken when the sun was at a high angle, possibly around midday. The ocean in the background shows moderately rough waves cresting with white foam, indicative of an active sea. The sunlight creates a shimmer on the water, adding a dynamic contrast to the deep blue and turquoise tones of the sea.\n\nThe general atmosphere conveyed by this picture is one of leisure and adventure, possibly on a warm day given the clear skies and outdoor recreational activity depicted. The composition of the photograph, with its wide view of the beach and ocean, and the inclusion of an active element like the ATV, creates a lively yet tranquil seaside scene.","title":"Dune cycle on Rocky Point beach","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["547588","543208","550935","543370","546397","542800","548698","546982","542885","545102","543014","547607","542806","548697","546417","553882"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["rider","ocean","beach","sand","sea","crest","turquoise","inclusion","midday","seaside"]}
