{"path":"557004.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people and a dog gathered outdoors, engaged in examining a photograph within a natural, wooded setting. The scene includes four adults—three males and one female—leaning in towards a black and white photo held by one of the men. A black dog is also part of the group, with its face close to the held photograph, as if it is included in the viewing.\n\nThe attire of the individuals suggests a casual, outdoor setting; they are dressed in practical outdoor clothing appropriate for cooler weather. The senior man holding the photo is wearing a cap and glasses, suggesting a detailed examination of the image. The second man from the left also wears workmanlike clothes and a cap.\n\nIn the background, two vintage estate cars (station wagons), one dark and one light-colored, are parked on a gravel road surrounded by trees with autumnal foliage. There are additional people visible near the cars, contributing to a communal or social atmosphere.\n\nThe focus and expressions of the individuals are intent and concentrated, implying a shared interest in the subject of the photograph they are examining. This gathering likely represents a moment of shared interest or discussion in a natural, outdoor communal setting.","title":"Kitsap County Audubon Society members on a field trip check orientation using an aerial photograph.
