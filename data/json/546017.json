{"path":"546017.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a dramatic scene of an intense fire engulfing a long wooden bridge at night. The flames are vivid, ranging in color from deep orange to bright yellow, and they are wildly soaring above the bridge, illuminating the dark sky with harsh, fiery light. The bridge itself is almost entirely consumed by the fire, highlighting its wooden structure which is ablaze.\n\nOn the right side of the image, down the length of the bridge, a single pair of headlights is visible, suggesting a vehicle, possibly stationary or moving very slowly, near the far end of the bridge. This adds a layer of urgency or danger to the scene.\n\nThe fire's reflection can be seen shimmering in a body of water below, suggesting that the bridge spans over a river or lake. The rest of the background is shrouded in darkness, focusing all attention on the fiery destruction of the bridge. The photograph captures a moment of powerful destruction, emphasizing nature's unpredictable and uncontrollable force.","title":"One of the christmas eve bonfires which take place every year in the small communities along the Mississippi river levee between New Orleans and Baton Rouge","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["557577","543900","555160","543908","543933","555481","555156","553843","548591","552086","543904","547703","555157","548590","547597","543983"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["bridge","fire","fiery","destruction","soar","engulf","danger","urgency","bright","flame"]}
