{"path":"556652.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a subway station, likely from a period in the late 20th century. The image captures a subway car completely covered in graffiti, which shows a variety of colors including blue, red, and white, contributing to an overall vivid but somewhat gritty appearance. The subway doors are open, revealing passengers inside who appear engaged in everyday transit activities.\n\nOn the platform, several individuals are visible. Their clothing and styles suggest a vintage look, typical of the late 1970s or early 1980s. There is a mix of men and women, with one man right in the foreground in a blurred motion, indicating movement, perhaps entering or exiting the subway car. The others on the platform look like they are waiting, some facing the subway car and others looking in different directions.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is subdued with a slightly greenish tint, common in older subway stations. The ceiling above is low, lined with pipes and various fixtures, which adds to the underground, utilitarian atmosphere of the setting. Overall, the image captures a lively moment filled with movement, a typical urban environment emphasizing the era's characteristic public transport experience.","title":"Passengers board the New York City Transit Authority subway on the Lexington Avenue line oblivious to the graffiti covering the side of the car. Arrests for this crime climbed from more than 1,400 in 1973 to more than 2,000 in 1974. In spite of a constant maintenance and repainting program by the transit authority there are almost no cars operating on the various lines that are free of graffiti. The New York subway system has 232 miles of track and is the longest in the world.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556814","556811","556653","548261","554325","556813","548265","556651","554324","548253","556774","548258","556780","556690","548263","551894"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["subway","platform","station","car","movement","other","tint","fixture","transit","experience"]}
