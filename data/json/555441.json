{"path":"555441.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features two prominent, old-fashioned oil lamps in the foreground, with their glass chimneys and ornately textured bases—one appearing golden yellow and the other a rich red color. Each lamp is distinctive, showing textures that suggest they are possibly made of patterned glass with metal fittings around the bases and tops.\n\nBehind these foreground elements, slightly out of focus through the transparent part of the lamps, there is the figure of a person. The person’s facial features are obscured due to the focus and lighting, but they appear to be standing indoors, facing toward the camera with a faint hint of a smile.\n\nIn the very background, the environment is blurred, indicating an indistinct indoor setting. Natural light from an unseen source illuminates the scene, enhancing the reflective and translucent qualities of the lamps and creating a somewhat mysterious or nostalgic atmosphere. The composition skillfully uses depth of field to draw the viewer’s focus to the textured surfaces of the lamps and their vivid colors against the softer, ambiguous human presence in the background.","title":"Kerosene lamps such as these in a business window, became best sellers during the energy crisis in the Pacific Northwest during the fall and winter of 1973-74.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555440","555429","555471","555428","551360","546580","549709","556516","556016","543702","558025","548561","553883","544437","557033","547427"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Religious Imagery"],"terms":["lamp","basis","fitting","glass","person","oil","focus","smile","source","chimney"]}
