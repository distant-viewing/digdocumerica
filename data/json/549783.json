{"path":"549783.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic yet industrial moment over a water body. It features a large tugboat pulling two heavily loaded barges. The barges seem to be piled with mounds of scrap materials or refuse, indicating some type of waste management or industrial activity. This operation is happening on a large body of water, possibly a river or bay.\n\nIn the background, the skyline is dominated by multi-story residential or office buildings with a modern architectural style, characterized by their height and rectangular structures. These buildings are likely part of a cityscape, possibly suggesting an urban area near the water.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image contrasts the industrial foreground activity with the urban backdrop, highlighting aspects of city life and its environmental interactions. The water shimmers due to sunlight, suggesting the photograph was taken on a bright, clear day. The photo, given its vintage quality, could be from an archival source or historical collection, documenting urban and industrial life in a past decade.","title":"Tugboat tows garbage scows down the east river destination is the Staten Island landfill","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546938","557309","550901","549814","546836","549819","550900","555807","553826","552020","551008","546830","555798","549813","550894","549802"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["barge","residential","happen","tugboat","mounds","refuse","scrap","shimmer","pull","water"]}
