{"path":"552632.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph is set in an industrial meat processing plant. The image prominently features a large pig carcass suspended from the ceiling by a hook and chain, centered in the foreground. The pig's reddish-pink skin is stained, and various parts of the body, including a rear leg, are visible. The surroundings are bathed in artificial light, contributing to the saturated yellow and green tones in the environment.\n\nIn the background, several workers can be observed. They are wearing protective gear including white helmets, yellow aprons, and rubber boots. The workers are engaged in activities related to meat processing; one appears to be handling a smaller portion of an animal on a metal table, possibly dissecting or preparing it. The equipment around them includes what looks like hoses, buckets, and other tools typically used in such facilities.\n\nThe setting gives an industrial feel due to the exposed infrastructure like beams and overhead lighting. The floor appears wet, possibly cleaned recently or in the process of cleaning, reflecting the light and enhancing the grittiness of the environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a typical scene in a meat processing facility, emphasizing the industrial handling and preparation of meat products.","title":"The Rifle packing plant, a family operation, processes locally grown livestock.
