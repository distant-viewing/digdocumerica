{"path":"547366.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man seated at a cluttered desk within a dimly lit room. The man, who is bald with glasses, wears a grey sweater and dark trousers. His expression appears mildly serious as he gestures mid-speech towards someone or something off-camera.\n\nThe desk is overrun with papers, tools, and various items suggesting a workspace of either mechanical or creative nature. Visible objects include newspapers, a telephone, a helmet, and other unidentifiable items adding to the clutter. The lighting casts shadows and provides a gritty texture to the entire scene, emphasizing the man's face and hand in the foreground.\n\nIn the background, thereâ€™s a glimpse of a window allowing some natural light to seep in, casting light on what appears to be an outdoor scene blurred beyond clear visibility. The room's atmosphere is reminiscent of a workshop or office that sees frequent use, characterized by the disorderly yet functional arrangement of items across the workspace.","title":"Walter Doheling, 72, proprietor of the only gas station and store in the small town of Surprise.
