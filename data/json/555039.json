{"path":"555039.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up of a plant stem with multiple round, bulbous growths on it, which are likely seed pods or buds. These spherical structures are light brown in color and are clustered tightly in a vertical arrangement along the stem. The stem, also brown, stands starkly against a completely dark, uniform background that emphasizes the subject by providing high contrast. Additionally, the photograph captures some fine details such as delicate spider webs strung between the seed pods, and tiny droplets, perhaps of dew, clinging to the strands and surface of the pods. The focus and lighting appear to be centered on the detailed textures and natural elements of the plant, highlighting the intricate biological and ecological aspects that might otherwise go unnoticed.","title":"Vanilla leaf seed pods at green mountain in a private forest preserve in Kitsap County, Washington","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["557169","558079","545707","557617","555053","542573","555052","554745","543622","545713","550461","557625","555106","545715","553366","542610"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["stem","web","strand","dew","bry","bud","string","cling","droplet","go"]}
