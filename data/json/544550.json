{"path":"544550.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a residential neighborhood with a highly structured and repetitive layout. The area is predominantly filled with small, boxy single-story homes, most likely built in a post-war boom style, characterized by their minimalistic design and similar architectural features. The houses are arranged in curving rows and cul-de-sacs, creating a somewhat labyrinthine road pattern that accentuates the uniformity of the neighborhood.\n\nThe colors of the houses vary subtly from white and light gray to beige, with each featuring a flat or very shallow-pitched roof. The streets are paved and marked by distinct curbs, intersecting at various points to form a network that connects the entire community. Many homes have small front yards, some with minimal landscaping visible.\n\nIn terms of visible activity, there are a few cars parked beside some of the houses and on the streets, hinting at the presence of residents, but no people are visible from this aerial perspective. The surrounding environment beyond the residential development includes patches of open, undeveloped land and a few scattered trees. The overall impression is of a planned suburban area during a phase of rapid urban development, designed to accommodate a large number of similar families in a compact and efficient layout.","title":"Recreation advertising","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544510","549071","556975","548824","547769","546399","545914","553699","553970","547211","547435","557405","553700","548825","553934","553940"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Residential Neighborhoods"],"terms":["house","layout","neighborhood","home","development","phase","uniformity","boom","resident","landscaping"]}
