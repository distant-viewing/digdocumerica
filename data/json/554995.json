{"path":"554995.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph spotlights a towering, majestic tree, possibly a type of old-growth tree commonly found in lush, temperate forests. The tree’s trunk is notably massive, and it seems to split into multiple thick branches or secondary trunks right from the base, ascending vertically to a substantial height. The bark is rugged and deeply furrowed, indicative of considerable age and exposure to the elements over the years.\n\nThe environment around the tree is rich in other vegetation, including smaller trees and various types of underbrush. The canopy above seems dense, with sunlight filtering through to create patterns of light and shadow on the tree and the surrounding foliage. The atmosphere suggests a relatively undisturbed natural woodland, possibly within a national park or a similarly protected area, emphasizing conservation and natural history.\n\nThis photograph captures not just a tree but an entire ecosystem, and its impressive composition emphasizes verticality and the natural textures of the forest. The angle of the shot, looking up towards the sky, enhances the tree’s grandeur and the feeling of standing within a serene, untouched part of the world.","title":"Western red cedar trunks on milwaukee land company property in clallam county, Washington, near the Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548687","545278","543448","554977","557621","550792","543442","542928","554966","554999","554967","548708","557623","553577","557616","542722"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["tree","trunk","furrow","verticality","spotlight","underbrush","type","split","ascend","woodland"]}
