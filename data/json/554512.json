{"path":"554512.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene focused on a large, naturally occurring waterfall. The waterfall flows powerfully through a cleft in massive rock formations, cascading down into an unseen pool below. The setting seems to be a densely wooded area, suggested by the presence of numerous coniferous trees visible in the upper part of the frame on either side of the waterfall.\n\nOn the rocks at the top of the waterfall, two people are depicted engaging closely with the natural scene. One individual is crouched and reaching forward near the edge of the rock, seemingly investigating the waterfall or the water flowing over the ledge, while the other, positioned farther back, is lying prone on the rock, possibly looking into the water or at the ground below them. \n\nThe rock formation itself is rugged and steep, giving the waterfall a jagged route to follow as it plunges downwards. The overall composition, with high contrast and deep shadows, emphasizes the drama and scale of the natural scene, portraying a moment of human interaction with the wild and powerful beauty of this secluded waterfall environment.","title":"Waterfall at Indian Falls on a trail up Mount Marcy in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553397","545874","549552","548021","542699","558087","544335","544344","550697","550979","549629","545839","555073","542594","544350","554409"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","rock","formation","drama","ledge","route","pool","scale","water","top"]}
