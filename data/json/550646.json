{"path":"550646.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset over a landscape dominated by natureâ€™s calm. It features a collection of silhouetted, elongated mountains in the distance, creating a layered effect across the horizon. Below these mountains, a tranquil body of water reflects the fading light of the sky, adding a gentle shimmer to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, a dense array of conifer trees forms a dark, textured silhouette, emphasizing the organic, untouched aspect of the setting. The sky above transitions from a deep mauve near the upper edge of the mountains, blending into warmer, softer shades of oranges and pinks as it stretches upwards. This gradient provides a vivid backdrop, enhancing the contours of the mountains and trees.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is peaceful and reflective, typical of a late evening in a secluded, natural environment. The image is well-composed, balancing the darkness of the terrain with the luminous sky, which creates a stark and beautiful contrast. There are no human elements or activities visible; the focus is entirely on the natural beauty and tranquility of the landscape at sunset.","title":"Rangeley lake in the mountains of western Maine, seen from route 4","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["557560","548909","554759","552338","554404","542994","552335","554731","543608","557000","555131","542678","545864","552895","547731","543415"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","sunset","elongate","orang","pink","fading","conifer","shimmer","darkness","upward"]}
