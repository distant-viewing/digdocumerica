{"path":"556343.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph portrays a close-up of a man, likely a miner, wearing a traditional mining helmet equipped with a mounted headlamp. The helmet appears somewhat worn and scuffed, hinting at regular use. The man has a rugged, yet relaxed look with a gentle smile, and his facial features include pronounced cheekbones, slightly sunken cheeks, a strong jawline, and he has a bit of a five o'clock shadow. His eyes convey a sense of warmth and his slight squint suggests either bright conditions or an expression of mirth. He wears a dark, possibly olive-drab jacket over a similarly dark shirt. The background of the photo is softly blurred with no distinct features, focusing all attention on the subject. The overall mood evoked by the image is one of a sincere, hard-working individual taking a pause in his day, possibly during a moment of conversation or reflection.","title":"One of a series of portraits of miners waiting to go to work on the 4 p.m.  To midnight shift at the Virginia-pocahontas coal company mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia.
