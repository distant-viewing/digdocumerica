{"path":"554949.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene involving two individuals and a cow. The setting appears to be a rustic outdoor area, likely a farm or ranch. The most prominent figure in the photograph is a man dressed in a light blue long-sleeve shirt and a darker blue baseball cap. He is actively engaged in handling the cow, pulling on a lead rope attached to the animal's headgear, which includes a heavy-duty halter and possibly a nose ring. His posture and facial expression suggest concentration and effort.\n\nThe cow, which appears calm yet restrained, has dark and light patches on its fur. It is partially visible and positioned near a wooden structure, which seems to be a make-shift stall or pen. The structure is rugged, built from wooden logs and planks, and has a simple, functional design.\n\nAnother man is visible on the right side of the photograph, standing inside or behind the wooden structure. Dressed in darker clothing and facing the scene, he seems to be observing or assisting in the handling of the cow. His presence adds a sense of collaboration or teamwork to the activity taking place.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, hinting at a natural, wooded area with some light filtering through the trees, creating a serene, almost dusky atmosphere. The setting and activities suggest a theme of traditional farming or livestock handling, possibly in a setting where such practices are part of daily life. The overall composition emphasizes the interaction between humans and animal amid a rustic, pastoral environment.","title":"Cow on a farm near Leakey, being de-horned.
