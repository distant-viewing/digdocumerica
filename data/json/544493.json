{"path":"544493.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene set in a wetland environment, likely a mangrove swamp, with several visual elements contributing to its vibrancy. The main focus is a dense cluster of mangrove trees situated in the center, rooted in water. These trees are characterized by their thick, tangled roots that are partially submerged, and their dense foliage provides a stark contrast to the sky.\n\nThe mangroves are bustling with bird activity; numerous birds, possibly egrets or other waterfowl, are either perched on the branches or caught in various stages of flight, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The birds' white feathers stand out against the greenery and the darker backdrop of the approaching storm clouds.\n\nThe background beyond the mangroves portrays an overcast sky, with heavy, dark clouds suggesting an impending storm. This gives the scene a dramatic atmosphere, potentially indicating a period of calm before a change in weather. The water surface is calm and reflects the greys and blues of the sky.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—featuring nature, wildlife, and impending weather elements—creates a snapshot of an ecosystem rich in biodiversity and dynamic natural processes.","title":"Chokoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544624","544620","544506","544563","548729","544593","553856","544611","544585","544530","544540","548587","548702","546205","548705","547500"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["mangrove","impend","bird","root","storm","egret","swamp","biodiversity","tangle","feather"]}
