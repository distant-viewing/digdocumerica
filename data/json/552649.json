In the foreground, there are two men engaged in different activities related to leather craftsmanship. On the left, a man with a dark shirt and denim jeans is standing, holding a large piece of leather on a table. On the right, another man, in a light sweater and trousers, is sitting on a stool, also examining a piece of leather, possibly cutting or marking it.\n\nIn the background, a woman with reddish-blonde hair is focused on her work, seated at a bench. She appears to be using a tool, possibly for stitching or detailed leather work. The room is cluttered with leather materials and tools, exhibiting an atmosphere of a productive workshop. Large pieces of leather in various shades from dark brown to tan are piled and hung around the room, along with personal tools and boxes potentially containing supplies or finished products. The environment seems informal yet industrious, filled with the essentials for leather crafting. The lighting hues are warm and emphasize the texture and craftsmanship involved in the work.","title":"Young cowboy is being fitted for chaps at the Rifle Leather Shop.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["544431","557153","544416","555533","557945","554432","557694","556314","548231","558356","546094","544360","557151","543741","554944","558378"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["leather","craftsmanship","tool","workshop","piece","work","room","essential","stool","supply"]}
