{"path":"544064.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a large opencast mining operation. The area shows extensive excavation works where earth has been dug up and displaced, creating a tiered, crater-like appearance. At the center and toward the right, you can see the terraced layers of earth and soil that expose different geological strata in varying shades of brown, beige, and reddish tones.\n\nA network of wide roads winds down into the depth of the excavation site. These roads are used for the movement of heavy vehicles, likely trucks and mining equipment, and help in navigating the steep and rugged terrain of the mine.\n\nOn the left, the roads form a circular pattern at different elevations, suggesting ongoing or staged excavation activities. The surrounding landscape is barren with very little vegetation, reflecting the environmental impact of such large-scale mining.\n\nThe lighting in the image suggests it was taken during a time when shadows cast highlight the depth and contours of the excavated landscape. Overall, the scene captures the scale and depth of industrial mining activities and the alteration of natural landscapes for resource extraction.","title":"Erosion of tailings piles at Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co.'s mine","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["544785","543674","549172","553049","543857","544111","549174","549177","544100","543758","544112","549171","552177","544054","549173","544110"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","excavation","stratum","depth","road","earth","alteration","mine","scale","extraction"]}
