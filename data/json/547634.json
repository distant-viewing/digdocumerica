{"path":"547634.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depictsa view of a forest canopy, with the focus on a robust tree trunk that extends diagonally across the frame. The tree has numerous branches that spread outward, densely populated with leaves. The sunlight filters through the spring or summer foliage, creating an interplay of light and shadow on the tree itself and casting a mosaic of bright, dappled spots throughout the image.\n\nThe leaves appear to be in varying shades of green, suggesting that the photo was taken during a time when the leaves were lush and fully developed. The background, primarily filled with more leaves, branches, and glimpses of the sky, supports the focal tree, emphasizing its strength and the dense coverage of leaves.\n\nThe lighting is natural and appears to be during the daytime, given the presence of sunlight filtering through the leaves. This natural backlighting highlights the edges of the leaves and silhouettes the branches, adding depth and texture to the scene. Overall, the composition evokes a sense of tranquility and the complex beauty of a forest landscape.","title":"Tree in sunlight","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["548686","548685","548687","542958","558103","543542","547643","543488","546947","554961","554978","555057","550791","554732","543445","548709"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leave","branch","filter","strength","mosaic","backlighting","forest","coverage","sunlight","tree"]}
