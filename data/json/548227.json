{"path":"548227.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph portrays a scene in a colorful classroom setting, featuring three young children and an array of educational decorations. A large American flag dominates the right-hand side of the image, its stripes and stars vivid against the paneled wall. The rest of the wall is covered with an assortment of posters and educational materials including alphabet charts, some pictures depicting various objects and scenes, and various childrenâ€™s artwork.\n\nIn the foreground, a young boy stands slightly left of center, gazing directly at the camera with a puzzled expression. He is wearing a red long-sleeve shirt and patterned trousers. To his left, a bit further in the background, a girl with long, straight brown hair peers out, wearing a red sweater. Next, there is another girl, partially visible with mouth wide open as if caught mid-sentence or surprise. She wears a multi-colored striped garment. \n\nThe setting appears to be a typical classroom from perhaps the 1970s or 1980s considering the style of clothes and the graininess of the photograph, providing a nostalgic glimpse into childhood education. The atmosphere is dynamic, capturing a moment of daily school life with a candid and slightly chaotic charm.","title":"Second graders singing \"Star Spangled Banner\" at Rockport Elementary School","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["548243","558212","543919","544798","552946","554838","547751","556265","544322","546548","543920","552590","558410","551766","556437","546556"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["classroom","girl","graininess","chart","education","child","artwork","garment","1980","wall"]}
