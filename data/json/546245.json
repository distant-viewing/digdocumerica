{"path":"546245.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime industrial scene characterized by several tall, slender oil derricks standing prominently against the backdrop of a shimmering body of water, likely at dawn or dusk given the muted light. Each derrick is constructed with an intricate network of metal beams forming a tower-like structure, tapered towards the top, where small, box-like fixtures are situated—possibly serving as control stations or housing equipment.\n\nThe silhouette of the derricks and other industrial structures dominates the mid-ground, creating a dark, detailed mesh of geometric patterns against the lighter sky. Below these main figures, various smaller elements such as additional equipment or parts of the infrastructure are visible, along with what appears to be a partially submerged platform.\n\nIn the foreground, the water is speckled with light, reflecting a bright, almost silvery glint, suggesting the sun is low in the sky. This light gives an overall serene yet dramatic quality to the scene. Additionally, the foreground shows remnants of old, broken piers or jetties—pieces of wood sticking out of the water, further emphasizing a sense of decay and old industry.\n\nOverall, the mood is somber and reflective, highlighting themes of industrial might juxtaposed with natural beauty, and possibly decay or disuse, portrayed through the stark, contrast-rich environment.","title":"Oil field","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["552990","546118","546864","547102","552717","547667","545834","547585","547579","547958","545646","547572","547702","544293","547113","551954"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["glint","jetty","mesh","disuse","equipment","fixture","housing","oil","remnant","pier"]}
