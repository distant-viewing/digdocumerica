{"path":"546621.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph showing a bustling urban cityscape, captured from a significant elevation. The focal point is a long, straight city road, stretching vertically from the foreground to the horizon. This road is flanked on both sides by neat rows of buildings that exhibit typical urban architecture, including residential and commercial structures.\n\nIn the lower half of the photograph, there is a large construction site prominently seen as a significant disruption on the main street. The site is busy with construction activity evident from the presence of excavated areas, construction materials, and heavy machinery like cranes and trucks. Construction barriers, presumably for safety, are also visible, sectioning off the work area.\n\nThe street is bustling with traffic; numerous cars are seen driving along the road or parked along the sides. Despite the construction, the traffic flow appears to be quite heavy, indicating the central nature of this road in the city's grid.\n\nSurrounding the center of action, the landscape features a mix of green trees and other buildings, suggesting this is a dense, developed area. The image gives a vibrant impression of city life and the ongoing development, reflecting an atmosphere of growth or renovation within an established urban setting. The sky overhead appears overcast, casting a mild, diffuse light on the scene, which slightly darkens the colors and enhances the metropolitan feel of the image.","title":"Metro subway construction adds to city traffic problems.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["549476","551510","546707","547764","549477","551507","553001","551506","547765","547755","548364","555743","546617","548318","547445","553016"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["construction","road","city","traffic","renovation","site","disruption","overhead","street","half"]}
