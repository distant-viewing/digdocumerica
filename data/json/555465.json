{"path":"555465.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a gas station, likely taken in the 1970s given the styles of cars and overall ambiance. On the left of the image, prominently featured is a sign stating \"GAS SALES LIMITED TO REGULAR CUSTOMERS,\" suggesting there was a fuel shortage or rationing in effect. Next to the sign is the rear view of a light-colored station wagon. \n\nThe central focus of the image lies on a man dressed in a dark blue uniform, bending slightly to interact with the driver of a classic Ford Mustang, indicative of the era's car design with their distinct high rear and elongated body. The Mustang, painted a dark color, has a visible license plate reading \"1EAU 331.\"\n\nIn the background, another gas station, labeled \"HAPPY,\" can be seen with gas pumps and an adjacent white building. There are trees and buildings further in the distance, giving the impression of a suburban or rural setting. The atmosphere of the photo suggests a quiet, slightly overcast day.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements captured in this photograph offer a glimpse into a specific historical context within the United States, relating to energy crises and their impacts on everyday life.","title":"During the fuel crisis before gasoline sales were regulated by the state, a dealer in Tigard pumped gas only to his regular customers.
