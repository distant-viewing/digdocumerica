{"path":"545920.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely a factory or a plant, characterized by a dense, dark atmosphere and industrial architecture. At the center and the right of the image, there are large, spherical structures, possibly storage tanks, supported by sturdy frameworks. These tanks are a common sight in chemical or processing plants.\n\nAbove and around these structures, thick clouds of smoke or steam are billowing out into the air, dominating the scene and contributing to a sense of pollution and industrial activity. The smoke is dark and voluminous, suggesting either heavy industrial work or possibly the burning of materials.\n\nThe background and the majority of the scene are obscured by the smoke, but visible architectural elements include metal frameworks and possibly some staircases or maintenance platforms, hinting at the functional and utilitarian purpose of the structures. The lighting is low, possibly indicating this photo was taken during dawn, dusk, or under heavily overcast conditions, which further enhances the mood of industrial gloom.\n\nThe overall composition and the elements in the photograph convey a strong message about industrial activity, possibly focusing on themes like pollution, environmental impact, or the sheer scale of manufacturing and processing industries.","title":"Smoke from Armco Steel on a sunny afternoon","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545447","542999","544691","550328","546108","547137","546908","546884","550982","548376","546107","550195","544700","552003","550983","543011"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["smoke","framework","processing","pollution","tank","burning","sight","majority","staircase","plant"]}
