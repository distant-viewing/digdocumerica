{"path":"552992.jpg","date":"February 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts a tranquil yet somber nature scene focused primarily on a deceased bird lying beside a body of water. The bird, which appears to be a seagull, has its white and grey plumage splayed on the sandy ground, partially immersed in the shallow water. Nearby are two inanimate objects, possibly stones or pieces of debris, half-submerged in the water as well.\n\nIn the background, a sparse environment can be seen, featuring tall grasses on the opposite bank of the water. The landscape includes a simple fence with wooden posts and wire, stretching across the scene. Behind the fence, the horizon is flat and expansive, hinting at a rural or undeveloped area. The sky above is clear, suggesting it might be either dawn or dusk due to the soft lighting.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a quiet moment in a natural setting, yet carries an undertone of melancholy due to the presence of the dead bird, highlighting themes of nature and possibly environmental issues.","title":"Polluted area on gulf coast: mustang island, 100 miles south of Houston.
