{"path":"554106.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a woman examining a branch of brightly colored flowers in a lush greenhouse setting. She is an Asian woman with short, dark hair, dressed in a short-sleeve, green and white checkered shirt. She appears focused and perhaps slightly curious as she inspects the cluster of vivid red flowers she is holding in her hands.\n\nThe background shows an expanse of similar red flowers blanketing the area, with rows leading off into the distance under what looks to be a structure supporting a translucent canopy, possibly a shade net used to protect the plants. The overwhelming presence of red contrasts strongly with the green foliage interspersed among the flowers and the muted tones of the woman's shirt.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, as the light casts soft shadows and gives the scene a warm, tranquil feel. This setting evokes a sense of serenity and the beauty of a cultivated, healthy garden environment meticulously maintained for growth and production of these striking flowers.","title":"At Hawaiian greenhouse, inc, near pahoa, anthuriums grow under a sun screen.
