{"path":"557572.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and moody scene of a river or lake at dawn or dusk. The water is calm and reflects a soft, diffused light, possibly from the sun which might be just below the horizon. The scene is enshrouded in a gentle mist that adds a mystical quality to the ambiance.\n\nOn either side of the water, there are lush trees and shrubbery, predominantly dark with silhouettes intensified by the low light conditions. These trees add to the enclosed, intimate feeling of the landscape, framing the waterway and leading the eye towards a vanishing point in the distance, where the water curves away from the viewer.\n\nThe sky is subtly gradated, possibly showing the light interplay of dawn or the residual glow of sunset. Colors are muted with hints of blues, purples, and a touch of warm pink or orange, suggesting the time of day is one where light and dark balance momentarily.\n\nOverall, the composition and the atmospheric conditions captured in this photograph produce a tranquil and somewhat introspective mood, inviting the viewer to experience a quiet moment in nature. This image could likely inspire feelings of peace and reflection.","title":"Sunrise at Malibu Lake in the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. This area so far has escaped intensive development pressure. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressure.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550389","552336","542994","550775","557561","557000","546963","549446","550735","554753","552142","557570","554752","550831","554608","550845"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["dawn","feeling","peace","pink","shrubbery","balance","viewer","condition","purple","waterway"]}
