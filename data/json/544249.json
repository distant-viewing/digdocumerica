{"path":"544249.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic river scene, featuring a predominantly white fishing trawler navigating through a narrow waterway. The trawler is equipped with large booms and nets indicative of its use for fishing, and it is currently in motion as indicated by the wake behind it. The river is flanked by lush greenery, including tall grasses and trees in the foreground. Some of these trees are heavily draped with Spanish moss, adding a distinctive, somewhat Southern feel to the landscape. The sky is clear and bright blue, suggesting a sunny day. The overall setting appears peaceful and idyllic, characteristic of a tranquil natural environment possibly in a bayou or marshland area.","title":"Shrimp boats","placename":"Theriot (La.)","location":"Theriot, Louisiana","nn1":["544186","544190","544255","546939","554169","547553","551148","551208","549458","552806","546976","545043","549066","548028","551217","544532"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boom","wake","net","flanke","drape","navigat","river","moss","waterway"]}
