{"path":"552143.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph features a breath-taking landscape seen from an aerial perspective. The background is dominated by a majestic range of snow-capped mountains extending across the horizon, under a clear blue sky. These mountains appear to be part of a larger chain, with peaks rising sharply against the skyline.\n\nThe middle ground shows rolling hills that are densely forested with coniferous trees, presenting various shades of dark green. The texture and uniformity of the forest create a rich tapestry of natural wilderness stretching out as far as the eye can see.\n\nIn the foreground, the terrain undulates gently and is visibly segmented by a few cleared paths or dirt roads that cut through the woods. These paths create linear patterns in the landscape and suggest some human influence or usage, potentially for forestry or access routes.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights a vast and pristine natural environment, emphasizing the contrast between the rugged mountain peaks in the distance and the lush, verdant forests in the lower regions. The viewpoint offers a comprehensive panorama that captures the grandeur and tranquility of this magnificent landscape.","title":"Olympic Mountains near Port Angeles.
