{"path":"545937.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rogers, Chuck","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene on a river, showing a group of people participating in a rafting or boating activity. The focal point of the image is a large red raft, labeled \"WINDY HILL VILLAGE,\" hosting a group of eight people. These individuals are using long poles to navigate through the water, suggesting they are involved in a competitive or recreational event.\n\nEach person on the raft is dressed differently, with attire ranging from casual t-shirts and jeans to athletic wear, suggesting a varied and possibly spontaneous participation. A notable feature is a white-colored flag with \"WINDY HILL VILLAGE\" written on it, prominently displayed and waving at the back of the raft, adding to the festive, team-spirited atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe background features a dense, lush green forest bordering the river, providing a natural, scenic backdrop that contrasts with the activity and vibrancy of the people in the raft. The river itself appears calm, with gentle ripples around the raft, reflecting a serene yet adventurous setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes movement and teamwork, with dynamic posing from the participants as they push their poles against the river's bottom, steering and balancing the raft. The combination of natural scenery and human endeavor portrays a moment of challenge and enjoyment in the outdoors.","title":"Rafting on the chattahoochee river","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["545733","549462","544925","549447","545741","549441","545729","549464","545745","549463","549439","549465","549437","545908","549461","554462"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["raft","village","river","rafting","pole","team","participation","steering","people","teamwork"]}
