{"path":"555817.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene in an industrial or service area. In the foreground, there is a dark, well-used pickup truck with dirt and marks visible on its body. The truck is adorned with text on its side that reads \"Cinderella Farms, Somerville, Md.\" The truck's bed is rusty and contains some debris, indicative of frequent use in rugged conditions.\n\nOn the side of the truck, attached to the red brick building next to it, there is a large metal chute positioned above the truckâ€™s bed, possibly for loading or unloading materials. The chute is in an open position and extends out from a cut-out in the brick wall, suggesting it is used to transfer contents directly into the truck.\n\nIn the background, there is another building with a visible flat roof where industrial equipment or units (like ventilation systems or pipelines) can be seen. There is a person standing on this roof, appearing to perform some type of maintenance or inspection. The surroundings are typical for a warehouse or factory area, with clear skies and elements like electric lines and poles subtly visible. The scene is quiet, with no dynamic movement, capturing a calm day in an industrial workspace.","title":"Truck owned by a farmer takes two loads a day of ash from the Somerset Raritan Valley Sewage Treatment Plant in New Jersey. The ash is a very fine sand-like material containing phosphates, lime, and some metals, but no organic material. The farmer spreads it on land as enrichment for his hay fields.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544061","557385","557389","543896","544767","547093","543173","544057","553041","549770","542538","547922","557390","547666","556323","544720"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["truck","chute","bed","brick","ventilation","pipeline","unloading","cut","inspection","pickup"]}
