The image captures the falls illuminated by bright, colorful lights that bathe the water in vibrant shades of purple, pink, and traces of white. The cascading waters glow mystically, creating a soft, ethereal effect against the dark backdrop of the night.\n\nIn the background, there is a sparkling cityscape. Several bright stars of light, probably emanating from street lamps and architectural lighting, add a contrasting brilliance against the darker sky. These lights cast reflections on the water's surface, enhancing the interplay of light and dark in the scene.\n\nThe exposure and lighting effects create a magical atmosphere, emphasizing both the powerful natural beauty of the falls and the human-made luminosity that highlights its features at night.
