{"path":"550988.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image depicts a serene and picturesque river setting. The river, which appears wide and calm, is surrounded on both sides by steep, lush green hills which suggest the location is within a valley. The hills are densely covered with trees and the dense forestation reflects a healthy green ecosystem. The sky is visible, showing a shade of blue with mild haziness, possibly suggesting early morning light or a slight overcast condition.\n\nIn the foreground of the photograph, on the river, is a small boat containing three individuals. Two of them appear to be paddling while one is seated facing them, seemingly enjoying or observing the journey. The boat is made of a light-colored material and looks sturdy. Around the boat are a few small, leafless branches poking through the surface of the water, indicating either the river is quite shallow at this point or perhaps there has been recent flooding or water level changes exposing these branches.\n\nIn the background, the river bends gently to the right and continues between the wooded hills. There are no visible buildings or signs of heavy human activity, which adds to the natural wilderness aspect of the scene. The overall feeling is peaceful, isolated, and intertwined with nature, making it an appealing scene for leisurely activities like boating and a great subject for nature photography.","title":"The mouth of the kanawha river at gauley bridge.
