{"path":"553116.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a scene set in a wide, open plain with a backdrop of distant mountains that appear blue and hazy, perhaps due to atmospheric perspective. The foreground shows a dry grassy field sprinkled with small, sparse bushes under a bright but soft-lighted sky, suggesting either morning or late afternoon.\n\nDominating the scene is a brown horse with a darker mane and tail. The horse is equipped with a saddle and reins and stands profiled to the viewer. On the horse, there are two riders. The primary rider is a man wearing a blue jacket and dark pants; he is seated directly on the saddle. Behind him, apparently seated on what looks like a rear saddle or pad, is a child wearing a yellow jacket and blue pants. The child, with one hand gripping the man's shoulder, is actively waving or pointing with the other hand, perhaps gesturing towards something outside of the frame.\n\nThe overall setting, attire of the riders, and their activity suggest a casual ride through a rural or wilderness area. The mood conveyed is one of leisure and exploration, emphasized by the child's excited gesture and the calm demeanor of the horse. The composition and elements within the frame evoke a sense of freedom and connection with nature.","title":"Spring roundup of Paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.
