{"path":"547534.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene within a wooded area, possibly during the late afternoon or evening given the dark hues and shadows present. The focus is on the dense network of tree branches which dominate the foreground; they are intertwined and cover most of the view, creating a mesh of natural lines and textures.\n\nThrough the gaps in the branches, glimpses of a water body can be seen in the background. It appears to be a river or a lake, reflecting light that contrasts sharply with the dark tones of the surrounding woods. This light reflection suggests the water is calm.\n\nThe image is characterized by its dim lighting and moody atmosphere, mainly conveyed through the dominant browns and deep blues. The setting does not include any visible human activity or man-made structures, highlighting a sense of solitude and the untouched aspect of nature. The overall composition uses natural frames created by the tree limbs, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention towards the water glimpsed through the trees.","title":"Outfall from a laundry on the Pawtuxet River","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["554608","546963","550844","543611","543700","553465","553075","553410","550389","555217","554603","554753","554395","555008","550777","546066"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["limb","branch","mesh","gap","network","aspect","tree","water","evening","solitude"]}
