{"path":"545222.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph showcases a scenic coastal landscape. The vantage point is from a high cliff looking down towards a beach and the ocean. The ocean stretches horizontally across the middle of the image, its waters dotted with rocks near the shoreline.\n\nOn the right side, the cliff slopes down covered with grass and patches of bare earth, suggesting possibly erosive forces at work. There's overgrown greenery, such as bushes and small plants, near the bottom and edges of the cliff, which adds texture and a rugged quality to the terrain.\n\nIn the middle-ground, there's a long stretch of beach visible, characterized by its wet sand, possibly from a recent tide, which leads into small rocky areas appearing intermittently.\n\nTowards the left, the scene includes a more densely vegetated area with a few residential buildings nestled between the trees, indicating a small coastal community. Dense fog or mist partially obscures the hillside and the houses, lending a mysterious or serene quality to the atmosphere.\n\nThe sky is overcast and the overall lighting in the scene is soft, with muted colors, which enhances the tranquil and somewhat somber mood of the coastal landscape. The natural beauty and quietude of the scene are its most striking attributes, inviting contemplation or exploration.","title":"Otter Rock, on the Oregon coast.
