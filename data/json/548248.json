{"path":"548248.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"The photograph captures a somewhat bleak and overcast landscape with various elements spread across the scene. On the left, prominently positioned in the foreground, is a wooden sign with black painted letters spelling \"NO TRESPASSING\" nailed onto it. The sign shows signs of wear and fading, hinting at its exposure to the elements over time.\n\nTo the right of the sign, dominating the midground, there's a pile of large, uneven rocks forming a rugged, natural barrier or perhaps part of a collapsed structure. Directly adjacent to this, partially obscured and nestled among the rocks, is what appears to be an overturned white boat with its red underside exposed. The boat is worn and slightly vandalized, evident from graffiti marks.\n\nThe background offers a wide view of a flat, expansive field leading up to a body of water, possibly a river or large lake, which extends to the horizon line. Beyond the water, a peaceful looking township with small buildings, possibly residential, can be seen. The architecture is quaint, characterized by simple, traditional designs. The overall landscape includes bare trees and shrubs, indicating this photo might have been taken in late fall or early spring. The weather is gloomy, with a grey sky that complements the subdued tones of the entire scene, enhancing the feelings of solitude and calm.","title":"Site of possible condominium development which would ruin harbor panorama.
