{"path":"544622.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a green anole lizard lying on a textured branch. The lizard has a vibrant green coloration that covers its body, contrasting with the soft brown-gray color of the branch. Its eyes are open, reflecting subtle alertness and it is positioned facing slightly towards the camera, blending well with its surroundings due to its color.\n\nThe background of the image is blurred, largely filled with shades of brown and green which might suggest dry grass or similar vegetation typical of a forest floor or a natural brush area. This effect of blurring enhances the focus on the lizard and the branch it rests on, highlighting the details of the lizardâ€™s skin texture and the patterns on the branch.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photo suggests it was taken in a natural habitat where this lizard species might typically be found, providing an insight into the behavior and environment of green anoles in the wild. The lighting is subdued, suggesting either an overcast day or a shaded area within the lizard's natural habitat.","title":"Lizard along TaMiami Canal","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543778","551366","545553","544280","555066","549145","555065","549459","554602","544908","555196","544904","551362","557593","549144","554993"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["branch","habitat","alertness","behavior","insight","brush","coloration","skin","specie","floor"]}
