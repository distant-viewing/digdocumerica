{"path":"547819.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts a two-story building that appears somewhat dilapidated and is constructed with concrete blocks. The structure features a large balcony on the upper floor with a wooden railing that seems to be in poor condition. The ground level has a covered concrete porch where two individuals—both appearing elderly—are sitting on sofas that face each other. Each sofa is draped with a cover and there are various objects scattered around them on the porch, including what looks like a small table.\n\nThe building is labeled with the numeric address \"2116\" above the porch area. Near the entrance, a sign that reads \"Domino Parlor\" is visible, suggesting that this location might be used as a social gathering place for playing games like dominoes. The surroundings include lush greenery and a partly visible neighboring white building to the right of the frame. In the foreground, there is a street corner with a street sign, a utility pole, and some debris, including what appears to be a broken chair and other refuse items grouped near the pole. The environment suggests a quiet, possibly residential area with a relaxed or low maintenance atmosphere.","title":"A neighborhood just north of downtown Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["546155","553483","550113","548655","548625","555905","551115","545522","557702","553472","551002","551114","545317","550141","558029","553498"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["porch","sofa","address","pole","game","street","balcony","block","cover","entrance"]}
