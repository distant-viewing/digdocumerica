{"path":"544864.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor advertising billboard situated in a desert landscape, promoting Moab, Utah. The billboard is large, with a clear sky and a backdrop of barren hills under a pale blue sky scattered with a few clouds. The billboard's message is directed at manufacturers, saying \"MR. MANUFACTURER: MOAB, UTAH Has SPACE For You & Your PLANT Too.\" An invitation or further information is to be sought from \"DON HOFFMAN - GRAND CO. COURT HOUSE.\"\n\nThe design of the billboard includes a visual of a big-horn sheep standing atop a red rock formation, which is emblematic of the natural geology found in Moab. This rock is artistically illustrated in a way that emphasizes Moabâ€™s unique desert landscapes; it resembles layers of stratified rock which is common in desert regions.\n\nIn the background, behind the billboard, there are sparse low-lying shrubs typical of arid environments. Additionally, a line of simple buildings, possibly homes or small offices, can be seen in the distance, indicating a small community or residential area adjacent to the location of the billboard. The setting is quite open and expansive, emphasizing the point of the billboard about the availability of space in Moab.","title":"Utah--Moab","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545622","544145","543641","549223","545824","543814","547648","546425","544136","543637","548730","548674","547841","549039","544897","557502"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["billboard","desert","rock","geology","horn","availability","seek","visual","sheep","say"]}
