{"path":"544879.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph showcases a desert landscape with prominent plant life. The foreground is dominated by a plant with thorny, jagged leaves, and a large white bloom, centered prominently in the frame. The sandy ground surrounding the plant is smooth and has subtle undulations, indicating soft windswept patterns.\n\nFurther back, numerous other similar plants are scattered throughout the terrain. These plants appear sparse and spaced apart, typical of arid environments where flora competes for limited resources.\n\nThe middle ground of the image extends into a vast open desert space, hinting at the expanse of the landscape. In the distance, a horizon of barren, low-lying hills or rock formations can be seen under a clear, bright blue sky. The remoteness and the clear sky suggest a serene, albeit harsh, environment typical of desert ecosystems.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on desert flora and the expansive, open landscape, highlights the beauty and solitude of desert environments. The contrasting textures between the sandy ground and the plant's rough foliage add a tactile element to the image.","title":"White poppy, desert flower","placename":"Green River (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549018","544887","545717","545579","545843","545709","545789","549123","545724","545903","544016","544890","544400","545723","549183","544401"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","plant","flora","undulation","remoteness","ground","resource","space","bloom","ecosystem"]}
