{"path":"543072.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people enjoying a day at the beach, with several noteworthy elements contributing to its scenic appeal. The image is set along a dark sandy shoreline, with the incoming tide creating white, foamy patterns as it approaches the beach.\n\nThe foreground prominently features a group of people engaging in a leisurely stroll along the waterâ€™s edge. There appear to be nine individuals in total, dressed in casual outdoor wear suitable for a beach environment. The individuals vary in age and gender, some walking in pairs while others walk alone, suggesting a relaxed and social atmosphere. One of the individuals is walking a small dog, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene.\n\nIn the middle ground, the ocean gently laps against the shore, and a large rock formation emerges from the water, adding a rugged and natural element to the landscape. The waves around this rock are slightly turbulent, displaying the dynamic movement of the sea.\n\nThe photograph benefits from bright, clear lighting, likely indicating that it was taken during the day under sunny conditions. The composition and perspective suggest that the photo may have been taken from an elevated position, looking down at the beachgoers, which provides a broad and encompassing view of this serene coastal scene. Overall, the image exudes a sense of calm and relaxation, typical of a pleasant day spent by the sea.","title":"Northern California--Moonstone Beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["546982","543089","545162","547009","553952","555402","555923","543395","543322","554159","543310","553951","545097","543254","548697","557507"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","stroll","sea","beachgoer","gender","tide","individual","rock","appeal","group"]}
