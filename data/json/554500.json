{"path":"554500.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a man standing atop a large rock, overlooking a scenic mountain landscape. The man, whose back is to the camera, appears to be taking a photograph or observing the view with binoculars. He is dressed in an outdoor, casual outfit consisting of a dark long-sleeved shirt, jeans, and sturdy boots, suggesting a setting of exploration or hiking. His cap and the way he holds an object up to his face suggest he might be either photographing the view or shielding his eyes to see further.\n\nThe landscape in front of him features layers of mountains receding into the distance under a clear blue sky with a few clouds. The closest mountains are lush and green, heavily forested, and peak prominently against the skyline. The further mountains, fading in blue atmospheric perspective, suggest a vast landscape. The terrain around the man is rugged and wooded, indicative of a natural, possibly remote location ideal for hiking or nature photography.\n\nThe composition of the picture, with the man positioned off-center and the vast landscape stretching out in front, highlights the grandeur of the natural setting and the small, exploring figure within it. The photograph appears to be taken during the day under good weather conditions, which enhances the visibility of the distant mountains and contributes to the overall serene and adventurous mood of the scene.","title":"Looking out over high peaks area from a trail up algonquin mountain in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, second highest point in New York state","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545753","554460","543833","545607","543378","554507","543376","554515","542751","545762","554514","544341","554504","544902","545755","550443"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["mountain","hiking","binocular","man","shield","front","explore","ideal","photography","recede"]}
