{"path":"551224.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil shoreline scene. In the foreground, the image shows a dilapidated jetty made of wood, with its far end submerged or broken off into the water, surrounded by debris such as logs and branches scattered along the shore and over the jetty itself, suggesting recent disrepair or abandonment. The bank next to the jetty is lush with greenery and trees, giving a sense of a somewhat secluded or less urbanized area.\n\nIn the midground, the water appears calm with gentle ripples, reflecting the overcast sky above. Located on the water further back are stilt houses or structures built over the water, likely serving as residential or commercial properties, connected back to the land.\n\nIn the background, the opposite shore is visible with more trees and higher land. Notably, there are modern buildings visible amongst the tree line which contrast against the rustic appearance of the wooden structures on the water. The sky is partly cloudy with patches of blue and light clouds which indicates it might be a fair weather day despite some overcast conditions. This mixed environment suggests a coexistence of natural and developed elements, typical in coastal or riverside communities.","title":"Discarded boat docks are a hazard to navigation as well as an eyesore.
