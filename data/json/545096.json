{"path":"545096.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene marine setting during twilight or early evening. The foreground features a muddy shoreline dotted with colorful wildflowers, predominantly orange, nestled among lush green grass. Moving towards the midground, the muddy shore transitions into calm waters reflecting the soft light from the sky, with several boats moored at docks. These boats vary in size, and some appear to be fishing vessels.\n\nIn the background, a bridge spans across the water, enhancing the coastal landscape. The sky above is dimly lit, suggesting the time is either dusk or dawn, which gives the scene a peaceful and slightly melancholic atmosphere. The reflection of the sky and the bridge in the water adds a tranquil and picturesque quality to the image. The overall mood is quiet and reflective, capturing a typical scenic view by a harbor or estuary, typical of a coastal town. This type of setting could be conducive for leisure activities such as boating or simply enjoying the natural beauty of the surroundings.","title":"Newport Harbor on Yaquina Bay","placename":"Newport (Or.)","location":"Newport, Oregon","nn1":["543119","550039","547110","552311","542870","545030","543143","543133","552225","548247","543956","545000","545911","542907","547044","546998"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["marine","bridge","boat","harbor","wildflower","midground","twilight","vessel","transition","dawn"]}
