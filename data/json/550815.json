{"path":"550815.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial or elevated view of a swirling, foamy water body surrounded by rocky terrain. The water appears dark with large patches of white foam forming intricate patterns similar to marbling. These patterns are possibly caused by the agitation of the water or pollutants in it, indicating water pollution or a natural swirling current.\n\nThe rocks surrounding the water are jagged and irregular, mainly in dark shades that suggest either wet surfaces or a naturally dark stone composition. The foreground of the image is the most sharply in focus, featuring more pronounced details of the rocks and a few scattered green plants indicating some sparse vegetation in the area.\n\nThe overall image captures a contrast between the natural rugged beauty of the rocky landscape and the disturbed state of the water, possibly highlighting an environmental issue or natural phenomena. The composition focuses on the textural interplay between the rocks and the swirling foam, creating a visually dramatic scene.","title":"Scum forms on the Wisconsin river near the mosinee paper company","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["553388","545168","550817","545164","557252","547502","550371","555626","550369","545119","550734","550370","548090","549624","550849","547650"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["swirling","foam","rock","water","phenomena","pollutant","foamy","current","pattern","cause"]}
