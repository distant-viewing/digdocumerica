{"path":"548115.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil river scene where a young child, appearing from behind, is observing a large cargo ship. The child, likely a girl given the hairstyle, is wearing a blue sweater and shorts, standing at the riverbank amid lush greenery that partially obscures the view.\n\nThe cargo ship, occupying the central and right parts of the frame, is large with a red and black hull and features multiple cranes, suggesting it is equipped for handling cargo. The cranes are positioned along the length of the ship, and it appears to be anchored or moving slowly on the river. The front of the ship is visible and pointing towards the left side of the frame. \n\nThe background shows a tranquil river expanse under a light blue sky with few clouds, contributing to the serene ambiance of the scene. The opposite shore is lined with trees, visible across the wide river, enhancing the natural setting. The photograph has a somewhat muted color palette, typical of vintage or dated photographs. Overall, this scene captures a moment of curiosity or contemplation as the child looks on at the passing ship.","title":"Freighter passing Kelly Point on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548201","546024","546020","551990","555811","546019","555810","548127","544657","545277","550910","550941","547064","547056","551148","546040"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["ship","cargo","river","child","crane","hairstyle","curiosity","hull","sweater","vintage"]}
