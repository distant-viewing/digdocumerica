{"path":"551246.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of a ground surface scattered with various objects and natural debris. The predominant features in the image are two rusted metal cans, one positioned on the left side and partially buried under the soil, and the other located towards the bottom right, tilted on its side. These cans appear worn and weathered, with rust and perhaps some remnants of paper labels, suggesting they have been discarded a long time ago.\n\nThe ground around the cans is a mixture of soils rich in color variations, from dark reddish-brown areas to lighter brown and beige colors. There are also numerous small stones and bits of rocks scattered around, along with some organic matter, including decaying leaves and broken twigs. The surface texture is rough, with the appearance of dampness or wetness around some areas, likely from recent rain or moisture in the environment.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, focused on discarded waste in a natural setting, suggests themes of environmental pollution or neglect. The lighting appears natural, perhaps captured under an overcast sky, enhancing the muted tones of the earth and rust. There is no presence of animals or people in the image, directing the entire focus on the impact of human waste on natural surroundings.","title":"Dump beside Lake Road (5-27) near Purvis.
