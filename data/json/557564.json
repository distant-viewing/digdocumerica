{"path":"557564.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric scene on a body of water, likely during the early hours of the morning due to the presence of mist. At the center of the image, there is a single rower in a small boat, rowing slowly through the water. The rower is silhouetted against the reflective surface of the water, which is tinted with hues of pink and purple, suggesting the photo was taken at sunrise.\n\nThe background features a dense line of trees, shrouded in mist, enhancing the sense of quiet isolation. The trees appear dark and are only partially visible through the fog, which adds a mysterious and dreamlike quality to the setting. Above the trees, the sky is a gradation of color from deep purples at the top to lighter tones near the horizon.\n\nThe overall composition and the subdued lighting create a mood of tranquility and introspection. The mist not only obscures parts of the landscape, rendering it almost impressionistic, but also contributes to the ethereal quality of the photograph. The water is calm, and the scene is devoid of any other human activity or disruptions, emphasizing the solitude of the rower in the midst of a vast, natural space.","title":"Youngsters boating in the early morning on Malibu lake in the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county.
