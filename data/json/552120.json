{"path":"552120.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph features a man in a plaid shirt and a dotted bandana bent over while doing some work on a flat-bottomed boat in a body of water. The boat is equipped with a single, white fiberglass chair near the middle, a steering wheel to the right of the chair, and appears to have a motor attached at the back. There are also some ropes and wires visibly lying around on the floor of the boat. The boat's interior and exterior reveal wear and use through apparent rusty patches and scratches. The water surrounding the boat has a brownish hue, suggesting it might be a river or a lake. The lighting is bright, indicating daytime. The background primarily focuses on the waterâ€™s reflective surface and nothing else is prominently visible, thus centering all attention on the man's activity involving the boat.","title":"Warren Freeman, 50, built a cottage on an island in the Kansas River. The island lies between the 18th Street and East Kansas Avenue bridges. Unemployment checks and fishing are his present means of support.
