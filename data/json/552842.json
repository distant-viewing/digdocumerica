{"path":"552842.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a landscape consisting of flooded fields, forests, and a body of water covered in mist. The bottom section of the image displays several fields lined up in neat rows, partially submerged underwater, suggesting recent heavy rainfall or a flood event. These fields are bordered on one side by a dense forest, with the treetops appearing lush and dark green, which fills the top half of the image. A serpentine body of water snakes through the forest and alongside the fields, reflecting the gray, overcast sky above.\n\nThe cloud cover is thick, lying low over the forest and fields, giving the scene a moody and misty atmosphere. The overall color palette is a mix of deep greens, grays, and the reflective silver of the water, which adds a cool tone to the image. No human activity or people are visible, depicting a quiet, natural landscape likely after or during a rainstorm. The compositional elements like the straight lines of the flooded fields contrast with the natural curves of the waterway, creating a dynamic interplay of human-made and natural forms in the landscape.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years. Unprecedented flooding occurred throughout the river basin. Particularly affected were the marsh area below New Orleans and the entire Atchafalaya River basin Gulf of Mexico flood area.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552834","547778","552853","555570","553668","552847","557014","550559","545042","556964","544515","550620","553856","550569","542822","544530"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["field","forest","underwater","treetop","flood","snake","silver","rainfall","half","cover"]}
