{"path":"545916.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic and dense cloud of smoke that dominates the image. The smoke is billowing out in large, voluminous plumes, heavily concentrated and appearing in shades of dark gray and blue. The density and texture of the smoke suggest intense turbulence and energy within the cloud.\n\nIn the background, beneath the overwhelming presence of the smoke, faint silhouettes of what might be distant mountains or structures can be seen, but they are almost entirely obscured by the thick smoke.\n\nThe color tone of the sky shifts from dark blue in the top right corner to a warm, sandy orange towards the top left side of the image, indicating either the time of day being around sunset or the possible influence of the smoke on the coloration of the sky. This interplay between the dark smoke and the soft, warm sky creates a stark and somewhat ominous contrast.\n\nThe size and intensity of the smoke cloud suggest a significant and powerful event, possibly a large fire or an industrial incident. The photo captures the formidable nature of the cloud and the way it dwarfs the landscape below, emphasizing the scale and the potential impact of whatever event caused such a smoke release.","title":"Smoke from armco steel on a sunday afternoon","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545924","550984","557578","544704","549634","548595","546237","547137","547204","545975","545990","550987","553841","545048","550983","555166"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","cloud","incident","turbulence","event","release","coloration","shift","intensity","influence"]}
