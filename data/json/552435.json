{"path":"552435.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a dry, cracked ground surface with sparse vegetation. The soil is light-colored with shades that range from beige to light brown and is textured with numerous small and large cracks that indicate aridity and dry conditions. Scattered across this barren landscape are several thin, green grass blades, which are unevenly distributed. These grass blades are relatively short, indicating either poor growing conditions or young plants.\n\nSmall rocks and pebbles are embedded within the soil, adding to the rough, uneven terrain. There are also tiny dark specks distributed sporadically across the soil, possibly small bits of organic matter or debris. The focus is sharp nearest the center, gradually becoming softer toward the edges of the frame, which adds a slight depth to the flat landscape. Overall, the image depicts a harsh, dry environment struggling to support even minimal vegetation.","title":"Dry cornstalks at the Weir Farm in Fulton County.
