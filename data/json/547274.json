{"path":"547274.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an evocative scene of dancing, likely in a hall or large room, with a dynamic, blurred motion effect that conveys movement and energy. The setting seems dimly lit, creating a warm and intimate atmosphere.\n\nThe focus is on multiple pairs of dancers, each captured in a blurred state, suggesting the swift movements typically associated with dancing. A few individuals stand out due to their attire; particularly, two women in brightly colored dresses—one in pink and another in a floral pattern—add a striking visual contrast to the otherwise dim background.\n\nThe overall blurred effect softens the details of individual faces and clothing, enhancing the feeling of motion and fluidity of the dance. There is a sense of liveliness and joy, underscored by the swirling dresses and the indistinct shapes of the dancers in action.\n\nIn the foreground, a woman in a light pink dress is adjusting her hair or face, somewhat sharper in focus than the other figures, creating a layered effect, with her as a somewhat static element against the backdrop of ongoing movement.\n\nThe background is nondescript and overshadowed by the activity in the foreground, focusing viewer attention solely on the dancers and their motion. Overall, the image captures the essence of a dance - movement, rhythm, and a collective spirit of enjoyment.","title":"33rd annual square dance festival in Pershing Auditorium","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547386","547270","547317","547334","558286","547403","547387","553241","558284","558285","547371","551710","556309","557790","547271","547383"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dancer","dancing","dance","movement","motion","effect","fluidity","overshadow","rhythm","liveliness"]}
