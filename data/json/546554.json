{"path":"546554.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a quiet, introspective moment in an indoor setting, likely a gallery or museum. A young girl with blonde, curly hair is seated alone on a long, red upholstered bench. She is engrossed in reading a large, clear book or magazine, which draws her complete attention. The girl is wearing a red top and black pants, and she is sitting halfway along the bench with her legs crossed at the ankles.\n\nThe interior features industrial-style architecture with exposed brick walls which create a texturally rich background. We can also observe artwork hung on these brick walls, featuring various designs or paintings, although specifics are not clear from this perspective. The ceiling is low, punctuated with grid patterns and small round lights that provide a soft, ambient glow to the space.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is calm and contemplative, highlighted by the natural lighting that appears to come from an unseen source, casting subtle shadows and illuminating the girl as the focal point of the scene. This setting fosters a sense of solitude and immersion in the arts, emphasized by the simplicity and quiet elegance of the surroundings.","title":"North Christian Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546564","551294","553535","553532","546474","546561","546478","546558","546479","552961","546560","551448","546556","546500","553534","553156"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["girl","bench","ankle","museum","immersion","brick","magazine","specific","round","elegance"]}
