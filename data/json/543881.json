{"path":"543881.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil, outdoor aquatic scene. In the foreground, there are two individuals lounging on a large, inflatable yellow watercraft on a body of water. The person at the back appears to be paddling casually, while both enjoy the calm water and outdoor setting. The water surface is slightly rippled, suggesting a gentle movement. \n\nIn the background, a dense arrangement of green trees stretches across the horizon, indicating a lush, wooded lakeside or riverside location. The trees are thick and full, implying a summertime setting. Slightly visible beyond the trees are some structures that might be docks or small buildings, possibly part of a park or residential area lining the shore.\n\nThe scene is softly focused, giving the photograph a serene, almost dreamlike quality, typical of a leisurely day spent on the water. The overall ambiance is relaxing and recreational, showing a slice of life centered around enjoying nature and water-based activities.","title":"The Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["553442","553403","546349","552982","551350","546856","543942","554468","549417","545229","549030","546976","549939","543943","551680","550674"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["summertime","watercraft","enjoy","lounge","water","paddle","spend","riverside","lakeside","slice"]}
