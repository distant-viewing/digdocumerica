{"path":"553147.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features two young boys. The boy in the foreground is wearing a dark hat and a gray jacket with visible red and yellow details around the zipper. He appears to be slightly smiling as he looks directly toward the camera. The focus on his face captures a sense of youthful curiosity and engagement. \n\nThe second boy, slightly out of focus and situated in the background, is wearing a red polo shirt. His posture is relaxed and he's looking off to the side, giving the impression that he might be listening to someone or something outside of the frame.\n\nThe background is quite blurred, offering no specific detail but providing a soft contrast that highlights the two boys. The lighting feels natural, suggesting the photo may have been taken outdoors or in a well-lit indoor space with natural light. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of casual, everyday life, capturing a moment of interaction or companionship between the two boys.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: Saturday afternoon on the town","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["549299","545959","543870","546565","545953","556606","556163","553170","555950","556284","553168","553511","543849","556604","552859","545970"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["boy","polo","companionship","listen","curiosity","detail","engagement","smile","impression","situate"]}
