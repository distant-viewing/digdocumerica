{"path":"548598.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a vast, flat and densely wooded area intersected by a grid of straight dirt roads. The main road extends vertically down the center of the image from the bottom to the top, disappearing into the horizon. Perpendicular to this central road are smaller roads that create intersections at regular intervals, resembling a grid or lattice layout. This structured network of roads segments the forest into neat, rectangular areas.\n\nThe terrain is uniformly covered with green trees, and the roads are light-colored, contrasting sharply with the dark green of the vegetation. There are no visible structures or human activities evident in the scene, which gives an impression of serene isolation. The perspective is high, possibly taken from an aircraft, and allows a comprehensive view of the patterned landscapeâ€”a man-made imposition on a natural setting. The sky is not visible, and the focus is strictly on the interaction between the structured roads and the natural environment.","title":"Drainage canals criss-cross the Everglades in Collier County. Permitted for land development, such canals have been blamed for causing foliage to become dry, thus increasing the danger of fire.","placename":"Marco Island (Fla. : Island)","location":"Marco Island, Florida","nn1":["556933","550567","556970","542835","542836","556976","556938","556935","550613","544544","556934","556920","555888","550587","553567","556918"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["road","grid","interval","lattice","segment","aircraft","intersection","network","layout","bottom"]}
