{"path":"547096.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a security checkpoint, possibly at a military or industrial facility, from the perspective of a vehicle approaching the gate. The scene includes a small, box-like security booth painted gray, with messages and symbols warning visitors. On top of the booth, there is a sign that reads \"WARNING YOU MUST SHOW PASS BEFORE ENTERING PROJECT ALL VEHICLES ARE SUBJECT TO SECURITY INSPECTION.\" The contextual emphasis suggests strict security measures are in place.\n\nThere are two prominent red stop signs affixed to the booth, one on each side of its frame, reinforcing the command for vehicles to halt. Additionally, a red and white barrier arm blocks the path further emphasizing the control of entry and exit.\n\nStationed at the booth, a security guard in uniform, possibly military given the attire, is speaking into a telephone, indicating active communication, likely about the inspection or authorization of entry.\n\nThe surrounding environment appears rugged and barren, with sparse vegetation visible in the background, suggesting that the location may be in a remote area. The focus and framing of the image emphasize the role of the security booth and the guard as pivotal in the regulation of access to the area.","title":"Guard shack at Consumer Power project in Ludington","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["557474","557412","557887","557875","549129","542758","548951","554103","555858","555856","546240","557872","546303","549090","551896","543645"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["security","booth","guard","entry","inspection","command","vehicle","exit","measure","regulation"]}
