{"path":"546383.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene with a person engaging in agricultural activity in a tropical environment. The person, likely a male, is dressed in light-colored trousers, a short-sleeved shirt, and a conical straw hat that is common in many farming communities around tropical zones. He appears to be older, bent over while using a long-handled tool, possibly a hoe or a similar farming implement, to work the soil or clear vegetation. \n\nIn the background, multiple tall coconut trees dominate the scene, suggesting the location might be near a coastal area or in a region where such trees are prevalent. The light in the photograph indicates it might be late morning or early afternoon, as the sun seems bright and is casting some shadows in the area where the man works.\n\nThe ground is covered with green, leafy vegetation and a few fallen palm fronds, indicative of a warm, humid climate suited for diverse plant growth. This setting is peaceful yet busy, encapsulating a moment of daily life where manual labor plays a significant role.","title":"A farmer clears his land with a machete.","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557696","544371","545371","554047","552574","544246","554108","544250","549036","544254","553879","543781","554203","543858","552812","549259"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["farming","frond","straw","palm","person","male","role","growth","climate","trouser"]}
