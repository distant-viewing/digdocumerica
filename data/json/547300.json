{"path":"547300.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic rural landscape, most likely taken in the latter part of the day, judging by the soft lighting. The composition focuses on a meandering dirt road that cuts through the scene, disappearing into the horizon, creating a sense of depth and perspective.\n\nThe road is bordered on both sides by lush green fields, suggesting spring or early summer. There are varying shades of green in the fields, possibly indicating different types of crops or grasses. The landscape is gently rolling, not flat, contributing to a tranquil and pastoral feel.\n\nOn the left side of the road, there are utility poles with visible wires, stretching along the road which adds a human element to the otherwise natural vista. Additionally, there are a few trees intermittently spaced along both sides of the road, their foliage dense and healthy in appearance.\n\nIn the distance, the land gradually rises into a soft hill, and the horizon is marked by a clear sky with faint hints of cloud, possibly tinted by the onset of evening.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the serene beauty of a rural countryside, emphasizing tranquility, open spaces, and the simplicity of pastoral life.","title":"Highway 77 and farmlands near village of Hallam","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["549235","549261","549257","547316","547354","549236","556960","555818","549182","555635","557087","554800","549146","549222","555624","556405"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","onset","vista","countryside","field","horizon","crop","simplicity","wire","spring"]}
