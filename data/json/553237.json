{"path":"553237.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and colorful protest or parade scene. The focal activity is a group of individuals, predominantly women, actively participating in the event by holding and waving various banners and flags. Each flag is unique, featuring different symbols, colors, and messages, suggesting themes of cultural, political, or social significance.\n\nThe participants are dressed in summer attire suggestive of the 1970s or early 1980s, including tank tops, shorts, and flowing skirts. Their fashion and hairstyles vary, reflecting a casual, eclectic style typical of grassroots movements of the time.\n\nThe setting appears to be an urban street or public square paved with stones, surrounded by buildings with large windows, which give the impression of a densely built area possibly in a city center. The crowd seems enthusiastic and engaged, contributing to an atmosphere of camaraderie and shared purpose.\n\nThe crowd's density and mix of standing and moving individuals along with the raised flags suggest a moment of climax in the event, capturing a spirited expression of community involvement and public demonstration.","title":"August brings the \"D'Aug Days\" to Fountain Square. \"D'Aug Days\" is a month-long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
