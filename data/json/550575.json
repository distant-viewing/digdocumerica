{"path":"550575.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a sprawling landscape, predominantly characterized by lush green vegetation and an intricate network of rivers and roads. Dominating the scene near the center and left side of the image is an airport with multiple runways, taxiways, and a parking area which includes several buildings. The terminals and possibly hangars are visible as small structures clustered around the paved areas of the airport.\n\nA winding river meanders through the landscape, splitting off into various branches, creating a rich, wetland-based ecosystem. This river reflects light differently compared to the surrounding terrain, which suggests it may contain calm water or possibly marshland.\n\nThe environment also includes cleared paths through the trees, suggesting logged or managed forest areas, with different sections appearing in varying shades of green, likely indicating different types or ages of growth. The crisscrossed lines of dirt roads extend through these forested areas, used for access to different parts of the landscape, probably for forestry management or suburban development purposes.\n\nThe topography overall is moderately flat with some gentle, rolling hills. Towards the right side of the image, there’s a clear view of further deforested tracks that run diagonally, creating geometric patterns over the landscape—these might be used for similar utility or access reasons as those on the left.\n\nThe background fades into a lighter sky at the horizon beneath a scattering of clouds, suggesting a vast and expansive terrain extending beyond the borders of the visible photograph. The image captures the integration of human activity with the natural environment, highlighting aspects of industrial, transportation, and natural resource management within a single expansive view.","title":"The view west toward Fairbanks from a point above mile 445 for security and other reasons, the pipeline has been routed across the fort wainwright military reservation east of Fairbanks.
