{"path":"556728.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"In this photograph, there's a woman sitting inside an older model car, captured through the open driver's side window. The woman appears to be deep in thought, with her cheek resting against her hand, elbow propped on the door's edge. She wears a dark blouse and has short, dark, curly hair styled close to her head, and she also wears pearl earrings.\n\nThe car's interior is visible, showing a vintage steering wheel to her right and the interior side of the door, which has a window crank and a worn away, slightly rusted, but functional looking handle.\n\nThe setting is naturalistic and teeming with intimacy, focusing closely on the woman's expression and posture, giving the impression of a candid or introspective moment frozen in time. There's no visible background beyond the interior of the car, which emphasizes the woman even more as the central subject of the photograph. The lighting appears soft and diffuse, suggesting an overcast day or shaded environment, contributing to the photographâ€™s rather reflective and somber mood.","title":"Driver waits for one of the monumental traffic jams to unsnarl during a bus strike in Washington, District of Columbia, in May, 1974. Some 250,000 persons were forced to find alternate methods of transportation, usually their cars. Drivers faced this ordeal twice a day during the several day strike. As a result they were parking illegally, using bus lanes, traffic \"islands\", \"no parking\" zones, sidewalks and lawns.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["545316","546667","557871","557896","557863","557923","557866","557847","556800","557908","548958","546849","557370","557874","548255","552780"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["woman","interior","cheek","door","car","earring","elbow","intimacy","handle","steering"]}
