{"path":"553884.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a mesmerizing scene where a large, circular radar array is silhouetted against a dramatic sky during sunset. The radar, composed of intricate patterns of mesh and structural beams, dominates the image with its complex and geometrically appealing design. The moon, appearing large and slightly obscured by wispy clouds, is positioned directly behind the radar, creating an illusion that emphasizes the scale and the scientific purpose of the radar installation. The sky around the moon and radar is tinted in shades of deep red and purple, suggesting the photo was taken during a vibrant, colorful sunset. This combination of technology and natural beauty offers a striking visual contrast and evokes a sense of wonder and technological achievement.","title":"Radar scanner near Chesapeake Beach.
