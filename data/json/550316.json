{"path":"550316.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph captures an indoor scene at a seafood processing facility. In the image, there are two women working. The woman in the foreground, who is the focal point of the photo, stands over a cooking or processing device, which appears to be a large metal steamer or cooker with water and steam visible. She is handling a crab, perhaps preparing or evaluating it for processing. She is dressed in a light-colored, plaid, short-sleeve shirt and wears a protective white apron. Glasses are perched on her nose as she intently focuses on the task at hand.\n\nTo her side, numerous crabs are organized neatly in metal racks or baskets that are segmented into grids. The racks are filled with crabs prepared to the same stage, emphasizing the systematic nature of the work. The crabs are positioned upright, showcasing their white underbellies.\n\nIn the background, another woman can be glimpsed, engaged in a similar task. The environment suggests a busy workplace rhythm, with both workers absorbed in their duties.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, accentuated by the industrial setting with metal machinery and organized workflow, underlines the seafood processing industry's methodical and meticulous nature. The lighting in the facility appears natural, supported by industrial lights, creating a well-lit workspace.","title":"Canning sardines at the Holmes packing plant in Eastport","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["545065","545064","543245","545182","545202","545089","552875","544264","550320","545211","552635","552284","545189","556824","544252","545175"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["crab","processing","seafood","rack","metal","woman","workplace","rhythm","task","cooking"]}
