{"path":"557928.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a woman with long blonde hair, standing in what appears to be a dimly lit industrial or transit-like setting, such as a train station or a factory with visible structural beams in the background. She is smiling and looking directly at the camera, wearing a dark blazer over a lighter shirt.\n\nThe woman is holding up a large paper or card that reads \"I'm Clean\" in large, bold letters, along with a graphic of a vehicle and some text that is less clearly distinguished. This document keeps part of her face obscured, but her engaging smile and the sparkling eyes that are visible imbue the image with a cheerful demeanor.\n\nThe focus of the image is soft, which gives it a slightly dreamlike quality, against a background that has a rather moody, possibly cold atmosphere, judging by the lighting and the shadows. The contrast between her bright expression and the darker, more industrial surroundings creates a striking visual effect.","title":"Happy young woman with a bumper sticker which reports she had successfully passed testing at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. Her first test was unsuccessful, and she had to return after her auto's carburetor was adjusted at a service station. Emissions testing for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons has been in effect since January, 1975. All vehicles in the city must pass a safety check.
