{"path":"544165.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling mining operation. In the foreground, thick, coiled cables or hoses stretch across a rocky ground, which is littered with dark, jagged rocks, emphasizing the industrial activity. The center of the image features a large mechanical crane with a prominent bucket attached, in the midst of handling materials, its boom extended toward a mound of similar dark rocks. To the left, a large industrial truck, likely used for hauling, is partially visible with its bed raised, suggesting the unloading or loading of materials. Another truck appears in the distant background. The overall environment is stark and rugged, typical of an active mining site, with no vegetation in sight, and the overcast sky lends a moody atmosphere to the scene. The machinery's colors, yellow and green, and their robust structures underscore the heavy-duty nature of the operations at this site.","title":"Dragline used in strip mining at the \"Navajo Mine\" in northern Arizona","placename":"Black Mesa (Navajo County and Apache County, Ariz.)","location":"Black Mesa, Arizona","nn1":["544134","554770","545831","543639","554828","549245","545883","544099","545887","554765","544139","552418","544135","552416","555606","554826"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["mining","truck","site","unloading","sight","boom","hose","operation","loading","rock"]}
