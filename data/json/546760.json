{"path":"546760.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a large industrial scene, centered around a towering chimney emitting a voluminous cloud of white smoke into the sky. The chimney is tall and slim with a light gray tone, contrasting vividly against the lighter sky and darker ground. Surrounding the base of the chimney are various industrial buildings, some of which appear to be part of a power plant or factory. These buildings are nondescript, mostly rectangular, and colored in dark shades that blend into the landscape.\n\nThe environment around these structures is rugged and barren; it looks to be a mix of dirt and small loose rocks, indicative of a heavy industrial area with little vegetation. The overall setting suggests a remote or isolated location, possibly in a region dedicated to heavy industry or resource processing.\n\nIn the background, a mountain or large hill shades the horizon, adding to the sense of isolation and perhaps emphasizing the environmental impact of such industries. The sky is overcast, with the smoke from the chimney mixing into the clouds, slightly blurring the line between the smoke and the natural cloud cover. The quality and color saturation of the image, along with the style of the buildings, suggest that this could be a photograph from the mid-20th century, capturing the industrial activities and their environmental implications during that period.","title":"Morenci smelter, phelps-dodge corporation","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["544777","550998","552184","543005","551060","545472","547468","557299","551052","551026","545236","557301","550871","546884","545441","550938"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","smoke","industry","cloud","implication","mix","dedicate","saturation","resource","shade"]}
