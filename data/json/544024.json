{"path":"544024.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and scenic view of a desert landscape, likely taken from an elevated vantage point. In the foreground, a cluster of buildings, possibly a small town, is visible. These buildings vary in design and color, including some with flat roofs typical of desert architecture. The area surrounding the buildings is sparsely vegetated, with scattered shrubs and open dirt areas suggesting a dry, arid environment.\n\nA central feature of this image is a large dust devil visible in the middle distance, towering over the landscape. This natural phenomenon, characterized by a swirling column of air and dust, adds a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil desert scene.\n\nFurther in the background, the terrain flattens out into what appears to be a sprawling desert plain, perhaps used for agricultural purposes, as indicated by orderly rows that could suggest fields or plantations. A long straight road stretches through the town and into the distance, enhancing the depth and scale of the view. The background also features a mountain range, providing a stark contrast to the flatness of the desert floor and contributing to the sense of vast, open space.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, with soft, diffuse light that casts gentle shadows and creates a slightly hazy atmosphere, suggesting the photograph was taken on a warm, possibly windy day. The overall composition of the image, with its combination of natural and human-made elements, offers a glimpse into the unique beauty and challenges of life in a desert environment.","title":"Paradise Valley with \"dust devils.\" In the background is Pinnacle Peak and Cave Creek.","placename":"Scottsdale (Ariz.)","location":"Scottsdale, Arizona","nn1":["544400","544016","544027","545809","547717","545575","545771","549016","545789","552923","549067","546753","545843","542518","545790","544405"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["desert","dust","town","phenomenon","challenge","combination","column","vantage","distance","building"]}
