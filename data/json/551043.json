{"path":"551043.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph depicts a gritty, industrial scene focused on the activities around a coal-laden barge. A large mound of shiny, black coal dominates the left portion of the composition, heaped atop the flat surface of one of the barges. These barges, painted in what appears to be a faded red and marked with the number 32, are connected in a linked series, though only two or a part of a third are visible in the shot.\n\nA shirtless man in dark pants, sporting a close haircut, stands on the barge deck numbered 32, near the coal pile. He appears engaged in his work, focused on tasks at hand that are not entirely visible due to his position and angle to the camera. He's near a black bicycle, which he could possibly be using to move across the barges or nearby areas efficiently.\n\nThe barges are docked next to a water body, likely a river, given the scope of the water and the context of the scene. The water has a textured surface indicating slight disturbance, possibly due to the wind.\n\nThe scene is captured under overcast light, suggesting a cool or muggy atmosphere conducive to industrial labor. The overall feeling is one of rugged industry, capturing a moment of activity in an otherwise routine work environment focused around the transportation or processing of coal.","title":"A Coalburg tug and eight coal barges go downstream through the London locks, one of three locks systems on the Kanawha River. The other locks are at Marmet and Winfield. The coal is being transported to a power plant on the Ohio River.","placename":"Charleston (W.
