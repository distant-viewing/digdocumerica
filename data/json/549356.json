{"path":"549356.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This color photograph captures a scene on a boat where three men are involved in activities that appear linked to marine research or sampling. The central focus is on two men in the foreground, one of whom is shirtless and bent over. He is holding onto a cylindrical container, possibly a core sampler, that extends into the water. This man is also grabbing a rope or wire that seems to be attached to a mechanism above him, operated by the other shirtless man standing beside him.\n\nThe second shirtless man is actively pulling down on a large lever or boom crane, which is suspending the aforementioned cylindrical container. His engagement with the mechanism suggests that it is used to lower or raise the container into the water.\n\nA third man, on the right side of the frame, watches the activity. He is dressed in a red plaid shirt and has curly hair. His presence indicates he might be observing or supervising the procedure.\n\nThe backdrop includes the ocean and a clear sky, emphasizing that this activity is taking place at sea. The overall environment and the equipment being handled suggest a scene of scientific marine work, likely involving water sampling or a similar study. The men are focused and seem to be cooperating closely in their efforts.","title":"Scientific work in progress on the Adriatic Sea aboard the hydrobiological research ship, the Vila Velebita II.
