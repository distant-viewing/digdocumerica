{"path":"554800.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This image portrays a tranquil rural landscape taken from a vantage point peeking through a screen of sparse, leafless branches in the foreground. The view is centered on a winding dirt road that gracefully curves through the composition, enhancing the pastoral ambiance. Lining this road are several structures typical of a farm setting, including a large white barn and other smaller outbuildings, each with their own distinctly classic, rural architectural styles and are probably used for storing farm equipment or livestock.\n\nThe landscape around the road and buildings is dotted with verdant trees and patches of grassy areas. A few animals, potentially horses or cows, are grazed in the fields, adding a dynamic and living element to the otherwise serene setting. In the distance, the terrain gently rises and falls, accentuated by patterns of fields and clumps of trees, showing the diversity of the vegetation and the use of the land.\n\nThe higher elevation areas in the background contrast with the otherwise mostly flat or gently undulating terrain, adding a sense of depth to the scene. The color palette of the photograph — muted, natural tones of greens, browns, and greys — suits the rustic theme perfectly, evoking a sense of peaceful rural life. The atmosphere might suggest early spring or late autumn given the lack of foliage on the trees and the overall soft, cool color tones.","title":"This farmland soon will be stripped by the Ohio Power Company shovel in the background, off Route 146.","placename":"Freeland (Ohio)","location":"Freeland, Ohio","nn1":["554819","549257","555635","555577","555537","555624","557748","554767","556963","547300","555818","549256","554801","549261","551305","547309"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["farm","road","screen","outbuilding","cow","clump","livestock","field","diversity","horse"]}
