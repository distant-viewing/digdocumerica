{"path":"555869.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph depicts a pile of crumpled and heavily damaged vehicles in a barren landscape. These vehicles, which include cars and possibly parts of trucks, are stacked haphazardly and show extensive deformation and rust, indicating they have been in this state for some time. The colors of the vehicles vary, with shades of green, red, and blue, though they are mostly obscured by dirt and rust.\n\nThe environment is stark and dry, with cracked, compacted soil that suggests arid conditions. There appears to be a trench or gully in the foreground filled with muddy water, indicating some recent rain or runoff, contrasting sharply with the otherwise dry terrain. \n\nIn the background, there are majestic snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky, which adds a serene and contrasting backdrop to the chaos and destruction in the foreground. The mountains rise dramatically above the flat landscape that supports the vehicle wreckage. The clarity of the sky suggests it might be a cold day, likely enhancing the desolate and abandoned feeling conveyed by the scene of discarded vehicles. This scenery implies the location might be in a relatively remote or less populated area, possibly used for dumping or storing damaged vehicles away from urban settings.","title":"Car Bodies and other debris are shown piled up after being moved from the five acre pond. A trench has been dug to lower the water table around the pond. EPA personnel supervised the pond cleanup which prevented possible contamination of a nearby wildlife refuge and Great Salt Lake.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["543680","542590","551547","555870","555871","544060","553009","553006","547476","545340","549023","545365","542656","552999","546268","552073"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["vehicle","rust","damage","gully","runoff","trench","wreckage","crumple","compact","chaos"]}
