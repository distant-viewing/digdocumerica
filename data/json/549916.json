{"path":"549916.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban scene with a strong sense of depth and perspective. The viewerâ€™s attention is initially drawn to a woman in the foreground, captured from behind as she walks down a sidewalk. She has long dark hair and is dressed in a snug, bright blue top and white pants. She is also carrying a black jacket or sweater draped over her left arm.\n\nThe background offers a contrasting environment with the bustling atmosphere of a city. On the right-hand side, there are tall buildings of various architectural styles that frame the picture, while on the left-hand side, a long, brick wall runs the length of the street, adding to the urban canyon effect. The end of the street opens up to show two very tall, light-colored skyscrapers against a dim sky, possibly evoking the sense of a commercial or financial district.\n\nThe street is lined with various parked cars, and a few pedestrians can be seen further back, including a man walking on the same sidewalk as the woman, heading towards the camera. The ambient light suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting soft shadows and giving the photograph a slightly muted tone. The composition successfully captures a moment of everyday life within the dynamic environment of a city.","title":"Looking south on West Broadway toward the towers of the World Trade Center","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549863","556199","546498","553845","552763","549907","546623","553822","553474","557904","557279","549645","545331","556226","547191","551493"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["sidewalk","street","city","canyon","district","hand","woman","skyscraper","sweater","length"]}
