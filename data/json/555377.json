{"path":"555377.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic outdoor setting that appears to be part of a small store or informal trading post. The main focus is a weathered wooden shack with a white facade showing signs of peeling paint and aging. Two window frames, both closed or perhaps without glass, can be seen.\n\nAbove the porch, there is a handmade wooden sign reading \"GROCERIES - SODA-POP - CANDY\" in roughly painted black letters on a faded white background, suggesting the sale of these items. The vintage nature of the storefront is enhanced by an old Coca-Cola cooler in prominent view on the porch, beside which is a smaller white cooler or container.\n\nSupporting elements include a wooden pillar with large antlers mounted on it, adding to the rustic charm. Various objects hang on and around the pillar and sign, such as old lanterns, ropes, and other tools that are difficult to identify precisely from the image.\n\nThe surroundings suggest a rural or wilderness area with trees and natural vegetation visible in the background, contributing to a quiet and secluded atmosphere typical of a countryside setting. The composition and items in view create a nostalgic glimpse of a bygone era, evoking a sense of history and rural Americana.","title":"Old country store near show low","placename":"Arizona","location":"Arizona","nn1":["555640","556368","552518","547808","552513","547805","544373","557756","552517","551079","558281","554036","557679","552454","552489","544113"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["cooler","pillar","porch","grocery","soda","antler","shack","lantern","item","sign"]}
