{"path":"543899.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an evocative sunset scene featuring a junkyard filled with derelict automobiles. The sky transitions through a gradient of warm colors, from a deep burnt orange near the horizon to a darker, muted red-orange overhead. The large, softened sun is captured near the center of the frame, setting just above the horizon, casting a haze that partially obscures its outline.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple discarded car bodies are piled and scattered unevenly. These vehicular remnants, bathed in the sunset's deep hues, show various signs of decay such as missing wheels, broken windows, and crumpled metal. The silhouetted shapes create a contrast of dark, jagged outlines against the lighter sky. Towards the right side of the image, a more prominent vehicle frame stands out, partially intact but visibly abandoned and weathered.\n\nIn the distant background, just visible against the fading light and slightly to the left, one can make out the shape of a lone palm tree. Its presence along with the cars suggests a setting that might be typical of certain arid or semi-arid regions, potentially in a rural or on the outskirts of an urban area.\n\nOverall, the composition and lighting of the photograph convey a sense of quiet abandonment and the melancholic beauty found in man-made objects reclaimed by nature and time.","title":"AutoMobile junk yard","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["553000","542590","543166","545365","546249","553007","555491","543146","544060","545340","547535","555492","547587","552072","552999","555849"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["outline","orange","sunset","junkyard","shape","overhead","palm","outskirt","automobile","horizon"]}
