{"path":"551425.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a casual, outdoor scene involving a group of young people. Four individuals are visible, with two males and two females.\n\nTwo people, a male and a female, are sitting on the ground. The man wears a dark shirt and light blue jeans and is mostly lying back, propping himself up on his elbows. The woman next to him is seated more upright and is wearing a yellow top paired with dark pants. \n\nMeanwhile, another pair (a male and a female) stands to the right. The standing man is helping the standing woman down what appears to be a slight hill or embankment. He wears a brown shirt and dark jeans. She has on a light grey or taupe-color shirt, blue jeans, and her hair is styled in a shag cut.\n\nThe background features a blurred natural landscape, likely deciduous woodland without fully sprouted leaves, suggesting it might be early spring. The foreground shows a grassy area with an exposed soil embankment, where the group seems to be engaging in a leisurely exploration or walk in a rural or semi-wilderness area. The atmosphere appears relaxed and friendly, with a focus on casual interaction in an outdoor setting.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
