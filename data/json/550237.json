{"path":"550237.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and visually striking scene set at a body of water, likely during the golden hours of sunrise or sunset. The image is marked by a strong backlight, which silhouettes the figure against glittering, reflective patterns on the water's surface.\n\nThe central figure in the photo appears to be a person knee-deep in water, caught in mid-motion as if running or splashing energetically. This person is captured from the side and appears entirely in silhouette, making any specific details about their appearance or attire indistinguishable. Their shadowy outline, combined with the swift movement against the sparkling water, lends a sense of liveliness and spontaneity to the scene.\n\nThe water itself is a key element of the composition, with light flickering off its surface. The visual effect of circles and specks of light, possibly created by the sun's reflection off the moving water, adds a textured and almost magical quality to the image. The overall tone of the photo is warm, dominated by golden and brown hues, enhancing the feeling of a sunlit scene.\n\nThis photograph encapsulates a moment full of energy and natural beauty, emphasizing motion and the interplay of light and darkness, while the exact details of the setting and the figure remain mysterious and open to interpretation.","title":"Sunset at Huntington Beach on lake erie","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["543893","553180","544693","552237","548844","548978","548871","543397","544725","552226","550389","545882","543143","544347","545863","548291"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["figure","water","spontaneity","splashe","swift","backlight","shadowy","interpretation","liveliness","silhouette"]}
