{"path":"542716.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene in a densely wooded area. A man is working at the site, seemingly engaged in some form of forestry work or scientific activity. He is dressed in dark trousers, a dark shirt, and wears a white hard hat. The man is bending slightly, focusing intently on a large, fallen tree trunk which is prominently featured in the foreground of the image. He appears to be handling some kind of equipment, possibly a tool or measurement device, which is connected by a cord to something not visible in the image.\n\nThe tree trunk itself looks old and shows signs of weathering and bark decay. Surrounding the man and the fallen tree are various young, green plants and ferns, which add a splash of color to the subdued tones of the forest floor. The background is diffuse with light filtering through the trees, creating a play of shadows and highlights on the ground and on the figures within the scene.\n\nThe setting suggests a natural, possibly remote location with an abundance of mature trees, some standing and others fallen, indicating a natural forest dynamic or perhaps an area recovering from logging or a natural disturbance. The overall mood of the photo is one of serene concentration and interaction with nature.","title":"Wm.  H.  Wingo, forester with southern California edison company, placing a barrier log.
