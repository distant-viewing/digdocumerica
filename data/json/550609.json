{"path":"550609.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic natural landscape dominated by a range of snow-covered mountains in the background. The mountains are enveloped in some clouds, adding a layer of mystique to their towering presence. The sky above them is somewhat overcast, suggesting either early morning or late evening light, which gives the snow a bluish tint.\n\nIn the foreground and extending towards the middle ground, we see expansive rolling hills and variegated terrain. The hills are covered in dark tones suggesting dense vegetation, possibly shrubs or small trees. Prominently featured in the middle ground is a river or a large stream, winding its way through the landscape. The water body reflects some light, which contrasts with the darker hues of the surrounding terrain.\n\nThere is no visible wildlife or human activity, emphasizing the serene and untouched nature of the scenery. This image likely portrays a remote, wild area, possibly captured during a hiking or exploration trip, intended to showcase the stark beauty and ruggedness of this wilderness area.","title":"View north to the Alaska Range and 11,300-foot-high Mt Kimball from mile 610.
