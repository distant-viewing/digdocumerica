{"path":"555744.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of an urban area featuring a complex of roads, rivers, and industrial zones. From this birdâ€™s-eye view, the main body of water flowing through the image is most likely a river that bends and snakes through the cityscape, complete with several bridges that cross over it at different points. The bridges are likely to be a mix of road and rail bridges due to their size and proximity to other transportation infrastructure.\n\nSurrounding the river are numerous buildings and structures indicative of an industrial zone, including factories with tall smokestacks, warehouses, and storage tanks, bedecking the landscape in an orderly grid formation in certain areas. This industrial setup suggests a focus on manufacturing or processing, observable from several smoke plumes rising into the sky, contributing to the haze over the city.\n\nParallel and adjacent to the river runs a major highway, densely packed with vehicles indicating traffic movement. This highway meanders through the town, with various exit and entry ramps visible, underlining the area's heavy commuting usage. Closely clustered next to the highway are several large parking lots, crammed with parked cars, and additional side roads that feed into smaller street networks.\n\nTrain tracks can also be discerned, markedly close to the river, highlighting a logistics and transportation corridor critical to the operations of the surrounding industrial facilities. The photograph is likely taken during daylight hours as the area is well-lit by natural light, and shadows are visible beneath vehicles and structures, giving depth to the terrain.\n\nIn the far background, beyond the industrial and urban clutter, a haze blurs the horizon where the outlines of further vegetation or possibly a rural setting can be perceived, marking the transition from the urban to less densely developed regions. The overall tone of the image is slightly bluish, suggesting early morning or late afternoon light, and conveys a busy, utilitarian landscape focused on industry and transportation.","title":"The long island expressway in Queens, New York transportation in an urban and industrial area like New York produces environmental problems of its own.
