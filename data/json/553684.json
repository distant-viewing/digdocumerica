{"path":"553684.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene full of activity. The image shows a sandy beach crowded with people engaged in various activities under a bright, sunny sky. Many of the beachgoers appear to be sunbathing, with some lying on towels or beach mats. Others are walking along the shoreline, and there are groups of people standing and talking.\n\nThe ocean is mildly busy with swimmers and some individuals on surfboards. Near the shore, a large canoe, possibly an outrigger canoe, dominated by white and red coloring, sits partially in the water. Several people are gathered near and around this canoe, suggesting a communal or group activity related to it.\n\nJust beyond the beach area, there is a row of buildings lined with trees and palm trees adding a tropical ambiance to the setting. Several beach umbrellas are open, providing shade for some of the visitors near the buildings.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a typical day at a bustling beachside, reflecting leisure and recreational activities in a tropical setting.","title":"Waikiki beach is the most popular tourist spot on the island there are 26,000 hotel rooms on Oahu.
