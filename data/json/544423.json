{"path":"544423.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph depicts a solemn scene in a cemetery at dusk, emphasizing themes of remembrance and patriotism. The foreground is dominated by a grave adorned with a multitude of colorful floral arrangements, creating a vibrant blanket of yellows, whites, oranges, and greens. Amidst the flowers, there are multiple American flags, prominently displayed. These flags are fluttering slightly, suggesting a gentle breeze. One of the flags is centrally positioned and is backlit by the setting sun, imparting a radiant glow that enhances the solemnity and significance of the scene.\n\nIn addition to the floral arrangements and flags, there is a wooden cross placed on the grave, right in the center of the image. This cross adds a religious element to the scene, indicating the faith of the deceased or the bereaved's tradition. \n\nThe background shows other gravestones, though they are less prominently featured and are partly shrouded in shadow, giving a sense of depth and continuity to the cemetery. These gravestones vary slightly in shape and size but are uniformly simple in design, focusing attention back to the decorated grave in the foreground.\n\nThe lighting of the photograph is poignant, with the setting sun casting a warm, golden hue over the scene, creating high contrast between the illuminated parts of the cemetery and its shadowed areas. This lighting enhances the emotional weight of the image, underscoring themes of honor, memory, and national identity. The overall composition and the elements within it work together to evoke a deep sense of respect and commemoration.","title":"Veterans' cemetery","placename":"Window Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Window Rock, Arizona","nn1":["544427","544267","550364","554824","545322","554790","557184","557089","557185","552487","547337","554792","557942","550731","558040","547397"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["grave","cemetery","flag","gravestone","cross","arrangement","patriotism","continuity","remembrance","respect"]}
