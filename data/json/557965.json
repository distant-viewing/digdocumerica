{"path":"557965.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant, historical scene featuring a steam locomotive in motion on a rail track. The train is heading towards the camera position, with the headlight brightly illuminated and a plume of dark smoke billowing from its stack, indicating it is actively powered and moving.\n\nThe setting is a residential area. On the left side, there is a large white house with a black roof and an attached porch. Beyond that, another house is partially visible, painted in a light color with a visible gable and trees around it. On the ground near the rail track, vegetation and grass are overgrown, showing that the area beside the tracks isn't meticulously maintained.\n\nAbove the scenery, there is a sturdy bridge constructed of concrete and metal, running perpendicular to the viewer's line of sight and casting a partial shadow over the scene. The bridge adds an industrial touch to the otherwise quiet, suburban environment.\n\nThe photograph, likely taken during the mid-20th century, using the visual clues in the design and condition of the buildings and the style of the vehicles barely visible behind the houses, provides a nostalgic glimpse into past transportation and community layout. The image overall displays a harmonious blend of industrial activity and residential life, captured on a seemingly sunny day with bright, natural light enhancing the vividness of the scene.","title":"Boston Mills Road at Boston Mills, Ohio, near Cleveland is seen by passengers of the weekend Cuyahoga Valley Line steam-powered train. The white building in the left foreground formerly was a busy store in the once bustling Ohio-Erie Canal town. The canal and the Cuyahoga River are located behind the store. Interstate road I-271 crosses the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area between Akron and Cleveland.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557956","557963","557967","556120","557966","556857","556022","556782","556058","545541","548474","556331","556759","557960","557944","556382"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["track","rail","house","bridge","locomotive","gable","sight","overall","headlight","vividness"]}
