{"path":"557652.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view of Helen, Georgia, a charming town known for its Alpine architecture and positioning as the gateway to the Chattahoochee National Forest. In the foreground, there is a sign welcoming visitors, prominently placed at the roadside. This sign is detailed with the text \"Herzlich Willkommen HELEN, GEORGIA Gateway to the CHATTAHOOCHEE National Forest\" painted in white on a dark background, and is mounted on a structure made from stones.\n\nThe roadway curves gently into the town, leading the viewer's eye towards the center of Helen. The architecture visible in the town features red roofs and white walls, evoking a European-style village ambiance. A distinctive church with a white steeple stands out, serving as a focal point in the town's layout.\n\nThe background is dominated by lush, rolling hills densely covered with trees, indicating the townâ€™s proximity to natural forested areas. The sky is clear and the lighting suggests it is either morning or late afternoon, casting soft shadows and enriching the color palette of the green mountains and the built environment. Power lines are visible stretching across the top part of the image, hinting at modern infrastructure amidst this quaint setting. A solitary blue car is seen driving along the road, adding a hint of daily life and activity to the scenic view.","title":"Entrance to Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. Main street shops line Highway 17/75. The town was a typical Georgia mountain village until 1969 when officials, businessmen and residents decided upon a Bavarian alpine motif for the small business district. It was done without state or federal funds, and using existing buildings but changing the exteriors. A development plan cautions about the need for balance between commercialism and public interest.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557770","557654","557653","551117","551101","543640","557806","557989","556394","556102","558038","556420","543738","553326","552595","547333"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["town","steeple","village","welcome","architecture","positioning","enrich","roadside","know","drive"]}
