{"path":"554547.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a landscape setting primarily characterized by heavy soil erosion and displacement, likely due to construction or excavation activities. The foreground of the image is dominated by a large expanse of bare, muddy terrain with numerous vehicle tracks, suggesting recent movement of heavy machinery. The soil appears drastically disturbed, with various ridges and furrows, hinting at the removal of upper soil layers.\n\nTowards the middle ground, two residential-style houses are visible; these homes have steeply pitched roofs and are elevated, possibly on a slightly raised or less affected patch of land. The houses seem somewhat isolated from the main area of disturbance, surrounded by a few sparse trees and vegetation that have not been removed. \n\nThe background is a densely wooded area, providing a stark contrast to the stripped and bare foreground. The sky is clear and blue, indicating no immediate weather disturbances, which focuses attention on the impacted land and the residual effects of human activity on this environment. Such a setting is indicative of construction or land development impacts often observed in rural or semi-rural settings.","title":"A bulldozer has been used to fill in swampy land for more vacation homes near Fourth Lake and eagle creek located near eagle bay, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545938","547652","548807","555812","554548","555598","556456","547523","549205","549255","553051","555136","554804","554816","544438","551971"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["disturbance","soil","land","furrow","removal","disturb","remove","construction","house","impact"]}
