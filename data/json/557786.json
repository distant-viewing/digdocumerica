{"path":"557786.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a festive scene at what appears to be a public event, possibly an Oktoberfest celebration given the year \"1975\" and the word \"Oktoberfest\" mentioned on the sign. The setting is outdoors, with a large, striped tent in the background that covers several rows of folding chairs inhabited by attendees. Underneath the tent, people in different casual and traditional attires are either seated or standing, engaged in conversations or enjoying their drinks.\n\nIn the foreground, to the left, an elderly man wearing a hat, white short-sleeved shirt, and dark pants, complemented by suspenders, is capturing the scene with his camera. He appears focused on photographing the subjects in front of him.\n\nThe main focus of the composition is a playful setup where two individuals—a man and a woman—stick their faces through large cut-out boards that portray cartoonish characters dressed in traditional German attire: lederhosen for the man and a dirndl for the woman. These cardboard figures are part of a standee with the mentioned \"1975 Helen, GA Oktoberfest\" label, indicating the location and the event. The figures, including the human participants, are placed in front of a broad, light blue background board, creating a photogenic booth.\n\nTo the right, a dog, most likely accompanying one of the visitors, has joined the scene. The dog stands in front of the board, facing sideways, partially engaging with the people around it.\n\nThe photograph captures a cheerful moment during the community event, emphasizing leisure and cultural celebration, all in a brightly lit setting indicative of a daytime gathering.","title":"Oktoberfest visitors of German ancestry at Helen make use of a comic photo prop set up outside the circus tent which served as headquarters for the fifth annual celebration. The small mountain community of some 270 people was typical of villages in the area until 1969. At that time local businessmen, officials and residents endorsed the Renovation of the business district with a Bavarian-Alpine theme. The project has increased business and tourism.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557784","557802","557787","557792","557789","558264","558265","551808","557794","558295","551847","551688","558287","558313","558266","557797"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["board","tent","celebration","dog","event","front","suspender","booth","figure","drink"]}
