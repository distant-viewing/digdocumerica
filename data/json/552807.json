{"path":"552807.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a man at work on a large fishing net spread out on the ground. The individual is focused on mending or adjusting the net, seated near its center while handling a smaller section of netting. He is dressed in a dark short-sleeve shirt and dark pants, creating a visual contrast against the pale color of the net.\n\nThe setting appears to be an outdoor area by a waterfront, likely part of a marina or a similar logistic point for boating and fishing operations. In the background, various nautical and industrial elements can be observed: a boat in a state of disrepair, a trailer, and other maritime-related equipment clutter the area, suggesting ongoing labor and activity. Behind this, a calm body of water and lush greenery lining the far shore provide a natural backdrop, adding to the rustic, work-oriented ambiance of the scene.\n\nThis mix of nature and human activity conveys a sense of practical engagement with the environment, typical of places where fishing is a significant part of daily life and economy. The open sky above and the absence of modern technology in the immediate vicinity emphasize the timeless nature of the scene.","title":"In the spring of 1973, the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
