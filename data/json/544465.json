{"path":"544465.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a humble, small house or shack with a dilapidated appearance. The building is constructed from what appears to be white siding, though many pieces are missing or damaged, exposing the underlying structure. A significant part of the roof is also in disrepair, with visible patches and perhaps an improvised covering like a tarp.\n\nIn front of the house, there is a basic porch with a simple, solitary wooden chair, suggesting a functional but stark living situation. To the left side, there's a small extension or add-on to the building, bearing similar siding and condition as the main structure.\n\nThe environment around the house includes a few small puddles, indicating recent rain or poor drainage in the area, adding to the somewhat desolate and neglected feel of the setting. Overhead, utility lines cross, framing the top part of the image against a clear sky with a scattering of clouds. A lush tree at the edge left of the frame and some greenery in the background suggest a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe general essence captured speaks to a sense of isolation or economic hardship, imparted by the building's rundown condition and the absence of vibrant life or activity in the immediate vicinity.","title":"Part of widespread damage caused by flooding of Guadalupe River","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["546960","556491","551115","542588","552494","551081","551091","557633","549221","543171","552491","545233","547038","546997","554788","544353"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["siding","house","hardship","scattering","covering","extension","drainage","tarp","situation","puddle"]}
