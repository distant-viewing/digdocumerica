{"path":"549729.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph shows a scene from a historical or cultural reenactment taking place in a lush, green park under bright sunlight. In the foreground, there is a group of people dressed in 19th century period costumes. Several women are wearing large, elaborate dresses with hoops, decorated in layers and ruffles. One woman also carries a lace parasol, and another woman is seen carrying a child. A man in a blue uniform resembling that of a Civil War era soldier carries a large drum, suggesting a musical or military reenactment component.\n\nIn the background, juxtaposed with the period attire of the foreground figures, modern-dressed onlookers watch the event. These contemporary spectators are dressed in typical casual attire like t-shirts and slacks suitable for a sunny day outdoors.\n\nThe setting is quite open, suggesting the event is public, likely held in a communal area like a public park. The scene captures a mixed atmosphere of historical immersion and casual, modern-day leisure, creating a contrast between the reenactors and the audience observing them. The image effectively portrays an interactive and educational event enjoyed by participants and spectators alike.","title":"Old time Rifleman's meet, June 24, 1973, is held on the Greenfield Village green adjoining the Henry Ford Museum of Dearborn.
