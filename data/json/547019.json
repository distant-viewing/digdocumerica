{"path":"547019.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial waterfront scene. In the foreground, a muddy shoreline is strewn with debris and clutter alongside pieces of worn-out wooden pilings that protrude from the water. A line of sturdy, vertical pilings stands submerged in the calm river, reflecting their images on the water's surface. These pilings appear to support a horizontal beam that extends into the distance.\n\nLooking further into the scene, the background showcases multiple industrial structures including large buildings, tanks, and possibly cranes or other heavy machinery, suggesting an industrial complex or factory area. The sky is partly cloudy but largely bright, indicating a sunny day, with wispy clouds above.\n\nThe overall composition combines elements of industrial activity and a somewhat neglected, dilapidated waterfront, portraying a contrast between human industrial endeavors and natural water bodies. This juxtaposition might evoke thoughts on environmental impact, industrial decay, or the coexistence of urban industrial life with natural elements.","title":"Union Camp plant","placename":"Savannah (Ga.)","location":"Savannah, Georgia","nn1":["547577","547585","551985","549300","547582","551984","552240","549305","547581","551980","547622","548105","552154","544527","547575","547572"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["piling","waterfront","clutter","endeavor","coexistence","thought","beam","complex","factory","crane"]}
