{"path":"553118.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene focusing on a man mounted on a horse. The man is positioned on the right side of the frame and appears to be enjoying a leisurely moment. He is wearing a light straw cowboy hat, a long-sleeve button-up shirt, and jeans. The expression on his face is content and relaxed, with a slight smile, looking slightly off-camera.\n\nThe horse, primarily appearing on the left, is dark brown with a tidy mane. It is fitted with a red bridle and bits of harnessing can be seen around its head and neck. The horse's posture is calm and steady.\n\nThe composition takes advantage of the expansive landscape surrounding them, under a broad sky with puffy clouds scattered across it. The terrain is arid and mountainous, possibly indicative of a high-altitude desert or semi-desert region. There's sparse vegetation visible on the ground, which appears rocky and barren. The light and shadow suggest it is either morning or late afternoon, creating a serene and naturalistic setting that conveys a sense of tranquility.","title":"Spring roundup of paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake indian reservation.
