{"path":"551898.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a man working at a control panel or operation desk facing an enormous wall map. The map appears to be a schematic or layout of a city or a network, with various sections labeled and interconnected by lines, possibly indicating streets, routes, or districts.\n\nThe man, wearing a white shirt, is seen from the back with his head slightly tilted as if he is intently observing or analyzing the information on the map. In front of him, his workspace includes several old-fashioned monitors, documents, and possibly control equipment spread across the desk, pointing to a setting that involves surveillance, monitoring, or coordination activities.\n\nThe overall ambiance suggests a setting related to utility management, transportation, or some form of command center, with a focus on urban planning or operations. The technology and style suggest the image could be from the late 20th century, reflecting the work environment of that era.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day controls all traffic lights, receives remote tv inputs from major intersections, and maintains radio contact with all traffic control vehicles","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551904","551916","551902","556755","551903","551900","551901","551896","547720","556758","551905","542765","552388","545943","557394","549378"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["map","desk","control","surveillance","coordination","command","interconnect","tilt","operation","monitor"]}
