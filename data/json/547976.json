{"path":"547976.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a beach scene with a metal sign placed prominently in the foreground, reading \"AUTHORIZED FISHING FOR ON POST RESIDENTS. MEMBERS OF SANDY HOOK ROD GUN AND ARCHERY CLUB.\" The sign is mounted on a rail fence that partially encloses an area of sandy beach with scattered tufts of dune grass.\n\nIn the background, there is a flat beach that stretches across the image, dotted with bits of driftwood and debris near the shore. The sandy landscape meets calm water, which extends horizontally across the photo. Two structures, which appear to be white houses or buildings, can be seen in the mid-distance along the shore. Electrical poles and a tall thin tower supplement the background, adding to the sense of a remote but inhabited area. The sky is clear, contributing to the serene, open feel of the shoreline setting.","title":"Sign outside old Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook.
