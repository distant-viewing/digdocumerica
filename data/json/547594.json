{"path":"547594.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph features a rustic and somewhat derelict waterfront scene. The foreground of the image shows a wooden dock in considerable disrepair, with many planks missing, creating a geometric pattern of gaps that reveal the water below. The weathered wooden planks are darkened, possibly wet, and stained, adding a sense of age and neglect. Scattered across the dock are a few objects including ropes and debris.\n\nDirectly on the dock, close to the edge, there is a worn, rusted cleat with a rope coiled around it, suggesting the dock's functional past or present use for mooring boats. The cleat and rope are central elements in the foreground, drawing the viewer's eye as symbols of the waterfront's marine purpose.\n\nIn the background, across the calm body of water, there are industrial buildings that appear aged and abandoned. These structures, featuring faded and peeling paint, contribute to the atmosphere of decay and disuse. One of the buildings is taller with a tower-like structure, adding vertical contrast to the otherwise horizontal layout of the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is one of quiet abandonment and decay, with a touch of nostalgia and melancholy for a once-busy and now forgotten industrial waterfront. The color palette is dominated by deep blues and muted earth tones, enhancing the feeling of solitude and stillness in the scene.","title":"State pier on Narragansett Bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547584","548105","547622","547581","545005","547582","551985","547575","551978","551984","547572","547579","546871","549306","549300","547893"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["dock","rope","waterfront","plank","decay","mooring","coil","forget","disuse","nostalgia"]}
