{"path":"545239.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene captured from a high vantage point through a haze or mist, contributing to a somewhat obscured and eerie atmosphere. In the foreground, the silhouette of foliage, likely bushes or small trees, frames the view, giving a contrasting natural element to the industrial backdrop.\n\nIn the middle ground, the prominent features include large industrial buildings and structures. These buildings appear robust, possibly made of concrete, with flat roofs. There are visible emissions in the form of smoke or steam rising from various points within the industrial complex, suggesting ongoing industrial processes.\n\nIn the background, a tall chimney or smokestack dominates the scene, stretching skyward and emitting a substantial plume of smoke or steam that blends into the hazy sky. The sky itself is tinted with shades of purple and pink, possibly indicating the photo was taken either during early morning or late evening, enhancing the moody and somewhat dystopian feel of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition and the color palette used in the photograph, along with the juxtaposition of industrial and natural elements, create a striking visual statement about environmental impact and industrialization.","title":"Port of tacoma is almost obscured by smog","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["551054","551026","557220","550181","557225","545268","547539","557381","545447","552188","545446","557374","557214","551140","544173","547090"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["steam","statement","smoke","industrialization","tint","emitte","point","contrasting","emission","moody"]}
