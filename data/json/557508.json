{"path":"557508.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene coastal scene during (likely) evening or early morning, given the low angle of the light which presents a silhouetted effect. The image shows a rugged coastline where steep, shadowed hills meet the edge of the sea. The hills, possibly cliffs, appear dark against the brighter sea and sky, underscoring a dramatic contrast in lighting.\n\nThe sea is relatively calm with gentle waves lapping against the shore and around several small, isolated rock formations protruding from the water. The light reflects on the water's surface, creating patterns of shimmering light and enhancing the peaceful yet dynamic nature of the scene.\n\nA lone bird, possibly a seagull, is captured in mid-flight, positioned centrally at the bottom part of the image, adding a sense of life and movement to the otherwise still natural landscape. The presence of the bird introduces a dynamic element, its solitude echoing the vastness of the surrounding environment.\n\nIn the background, atop one of the hills, very muted silhouettes of structures such as communication towers or utility poles are barely visible, suggesting the presence of human activity or habitation at a distance, yet they do not dominate the view, allowing nature's grandeur to be the focal point of the photograph.\n\nThis image likely aims to convey the majestic isolation and untouched beauty of a coastal landscape, evoking feelings of tranquility and awe in the viewer.","title":"Gaviota State Beach. The area is scheduled for additional oil processing facilities. At present there are only small processors in the vicinity. Restrictions on shoreline development have been tightened since the passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November, 1972. The commissions charged with deciding development must submit a report to the state legislature by January, 1976, with guidelines which will affect future coastal development.","placename":"Santa Barbara (Calif.)","location":"Santa Barbara, California","nn1":["543068","543085","543060","545173","543080","543051","542808","543424","553910","548241","550361","544985","542870","547483","543304","543091"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["sea","bird","hill","seagull","awe","communication","flight","habitation","grandeur","coastline"]}
