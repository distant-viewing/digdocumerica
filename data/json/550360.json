{"path":"550360.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene marine landscape focusing on a rocky island or cape. The landform is characterized by rugged rocks and sparse vegetation, mainly small bushes and what appears to be evergreen trees. This setting is likely in a temperate coastal area, evidenced by the overcast sky and calm sea surrounding the island.\n\nThe island is connected to the mainland or a larger island by a narrow strip of land, partially covered with lush green grass and exposed rock formations. Notably, atop the highest part of the island, there are several structures that appear to be man-made. Among these is a red-roofed building and other smaller structures which might be utility or storage buildings. Additionally, a lighthouse or beacon, painted in red and white, stands prominently on the edge, serving as a navigational aid.\n\nElectrical or communication wires stretch over the rocky waters, supported by tall poles installed across the island, suggesting the presence of modern infrastructure.\n\nThe background reveals a broad expanse of calm waters that stretch out to the horizon, where distant land or cloud formations are faintly visible, adding depth and vastness to the scene. The overall composition of the photograph, with its muted colors and peaceful setting, conveys a sense of isolation and rugged natural beauty typical of coastal regions.","title":"Campobello Island.
