{"path":"558010.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene featuring historical stone structures in a natural setting. The foreground shows a neatly trimmed grassy area sprinkled with fallen leaves, indicative of an autumn season. In the middle of the image, there is a prominent stone structure, possibly part of an old building or a boundary wall. This stone wall runs horizontally across the photograph, in a roughly L-shaped configuration.\n\nThe wall appears to be made of rough, weathered stones with moss and lichen growth, adding a textural contrast to the smoothness of the lawn. It has a rustic and aged appearance which suggests historical significance. There appeared to be openings or recesses in the wall, possibly doorways or windows that are now empty.\n\nBeyond the wall, the background reveals a dense arrangement of trees which display a mix of green and autumnal colors—yellows, oranges, and reds—contributing to a serene and tranquil ambiance. The sky is not very visible but appears to be clear given the overall brightness and shadows in the photograph.\n\nThe setting doesn’t show any human activity, providing a sense of quiet and abandonment. This, combined with the natural and historical elements, creates a peaceful yet evocative scene that might suggest a place with historical importance or simply a preserved natural area meant for visiting or study.","title":"The deepest and best preserved part of the Ohio-erie canal is the deep lock, located at deep lock quarry, which is part of the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system.  It is the deepest of the 40 locks located between Akron and Cleveland.  This area is now within the cuyahoga valley national recreation area.
