{"path":"545771.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph showcases a stunning desert landscape, characterized by dramatic geological formations under a vast, cloud-streaked sky. In the foreground, the prominent feature is a large mesa or butte with steep, rugged cliffs. Its surface seems rough and is bathed in a warm reddish hue, suggesting it might be late afternoon or near sunset, which casts long shadows and gives the rock a glowing appearance.\n\nThe terrain surrounding the central mesa is a mix of lower plateaus and rocky outcrops, spreading into the distance and fading into more muted colors. The land's texture and stratification signify years of geological activity, possibly erosion. Broad, flat areas, which could be considered desert plains or valleys, extend beyond the mesa, interspersed with other smaller rock formations.\n\nThe sky above this desert scene is dynamic and partly clouded. The clouds are soft, fluffy, and predominantly white, contrasting sharply with the deep blue of the sky. This combination of elements—vivid rock colors, expansive skies, and an overall serene setting—gives the photograph an impressive, almost painterly quality. The natural lighting enhances the textures and contours of the landscape, emphasizing its grandeur and the quiet majesty of such rugged environments.","title":"Looking north to ekker butte from the maze overlook in the heart of the canyonlands","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545748","545790","545696","545779","545789","544027","545804","544745","545775","545799","547717","544401","545761","545754","545800","544376"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","rock","cloud","stratification","formation","plateaus","plain","majesty","consider","outcrop"]}
