{"path":"553941.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a dense cluster of residential houses on a hillside, seen through a slightly hazy atmosphere. The houses are tightly packed together, predominantly featuring similar architectural styles with pointed roofs, a mix of one and two-story structures. Most homes have sloping roofs and balconies, with subdued colors mostly in shades of brown and gray. There seems to be standard suburban infrastructure including utility poles and wires visible, adding to the residential look of the area.\n\nIn the foreground, prominently placed and slightly out of focus compared to the sharply captured background, is a large sign titled \"Hillside Terrace â€“ One.\" This sign is presumably an advertisement or an entrance marker for a housing development or a similar residential community. The sign includes text that lists features such as \"3 & 4 Bedroom Town Homes\" as well as a phone number and the name \"Ryan & Lee Realty, Inc.\"\n\nThe photograph appears to be taken from an elevated position, looking down on the sign and the community, which creates a layered visual effect, showcasing the dense living conditions and architectural uniformity of this suburban development. The mood is somewhat moody and introspective, possibly highlighting suburban congestion or the expansion of residential developments.","title":"Pearl City, on the west side of Honolulu, is the fastest growing area in all of Hawaii.
