{"path":"556959.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph showcases a serene rural setting featuring two houses nestled in a verdant landscape. The house in the foreground is a classic white two-story building with green shutters. It has a noticeably traditional architectural style, including a covered front porch partially visible to the viewer. In the adjacent yard, there are fence-enclosed areas that appear to be used for small-scale farming or livestock.\n\nThe background features a second house, which sits at a higher elevation on the hillside. This house has a more modern design with yellow siding and large windows, and it is surrounded by a wrap-around deck. There's a notable contrast in the architectural styles and color schemes of the two houses, reflecting a blend of old and new.\n\nThe surroundings include a lush wooded area that envelops the scene, intensifying the feeling of a secluded rural retreat. The landscape is also marked by rolled hay or fencing materials scattered near the houses, enhancing the agricultural feel. Additionally, there is a car parked beside the house in the background, suggesting recent habitation or activity. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is peaceful and quaint, typical of a countryside environment.","title":"View of the homes of jerri fisher, who lives in the countryside near poulsbo.
