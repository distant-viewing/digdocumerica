{"path":"557016.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene in an urban parking lot filled with various cars from the 1970s. The image presents a vibrant mix of colors and activity, characterized by both the vehicles and the people interspersed among them.\n\nAt the forefront of the shot is a maroon car (possibly a vintage Ford), with a young boy sitting on its trunk. He seems to be eating or drinking something while appearing deep in thought. Other vehicles visible include a bright yellow car packed with passengers peering out and several other sedans and haulers of various colors like red, white, and tan.\n\nBehind the maroon car where the boy is seated, a group of adults and children are engaged in some kind of interaction. One man, possibly a father, holds a toddler while talking to another adult holding a large map, suggesting they might be tourists or travelers trying to find their way. A woman in a red skirt seems to be talking with another child standing on the ground next to her.\n\nThe environment around the vehicles is a grey, likely concrete, parking lot marked with white parking lines, indicating a well-organized urban area. The sky is overcast, lending a slightly gloomy atmosphere to the scene, which contrasts with the vivid colors of the cars and the clothing of the people. \n\nOverall, the photo depicts a moment of travel or a transient stop for these groups, highlighting a slice of life from a past era through its depiction of vintage cars and fashion.","title":"People and vehicles waiting for the ferry at the Bainbridge Island Washington State Ferry Terminal.
