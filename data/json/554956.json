{"path":"554956.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph shows a dramatic and intense scene of silhouetted trees amidst what appears to be a cloud of smoke or mist, backlit by a glowing, bright light which might be the sun or an explosion. The dominant silhouette is that of a single central tree that stands out prominently against the illuminated backdrop. The detailed contours of this tree and those around it are obscured by the density and movement of the smoke or fog, adding a sense of mystery and a slightly ominous quality to the image.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or clearly discernible activities in the scene. The trees, which likely belong to a thick forest, have irregular outlines suggesting they may be coniferous. The composition of the photograph focuses heavily on the contrast between the dark, obscured forest figures and the overpowering brightness behind them, creating a compelling visual tension. This could potentially be a scene from a forest fire or a similar natural or man-made event where smoke and intense light play major roles.","title":"Old growth of western red cedar, Douglas fir, and spruce silhouetted in early morning above Spider Lake on the Skokomish River drainage system in Grays Harbor County, in the Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553625","548596","557598","555081","553572","554139","553571","557578","542932","557579","548593","545747","543747","542926","553561","556473"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["smoke","forest","tension","figure","mystery","tree","fog","brightness","fire","density"]}
