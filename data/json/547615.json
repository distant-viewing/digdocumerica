{"path":"547615.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant industrial scene dominated by a large crane with its boom extended diagonally across the frame. The crane hoists what appears to be a circular metal component, which is suspended mid-air by cables. The crane towers above the scene, presenting a stark silhouette against a bright, slightly overcast sky.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several large cylindrical objects, possibly coils of steel or industrial cables, adding depth and an element of rugged texture to the composition. These coils are cast in shadow, contrasting with the brighter sky, and their intricate, tangled appearance offers a visual counterpoint to the more structured lines of the crane.\n\nThe background is less distinctly visible but seems to include industrial elements such as scaffoldings, metal structures, and possibly other machinery or storage units typical of a construction site or metalworking facility. The atmosphere is one of busy industrial activity, highlighted by the use of heavy machinery and metal components. The overall mood is one of dynamic industrial work, where both man-made structures and mechanical operations coalesce to form a scene of industrial endeavor.","title":"Scrap metal yard on waterfront","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547223","550874","555269","544127","544109","550907","548559","553027","544157","555285","545655","555273","548773","554545","555593","549308"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["crane","cable","component","metal","machinery","scaffolding","boom","endeavor","unit","steel"]}
