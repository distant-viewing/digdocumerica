{"path":"544182.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a rural desert landscape under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a solitary street sign reading \"PICACHO WAY\" is prominently positioned on a metal post. The terrain around the sign is flat and arid, scattered with small shrubs and patches of dry grass, predominantly red and brown soil. In the midground, the sparse vegetation continues, with occasional small trees breaking the monotony of the scrubland. The horizon is marked by a small hill or low mountain in the distance, offering a slight contrast in elevation against the otherwise flat landscape. Overall, the scene conveys a sense of solitude and the ruggedness of a desert environment.","title":"\"Picacho Way.\"","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545620","544017","545575","555346","544043","545341","544178","544401","545824","544016","542518","549013","544027","544428","545717","544400"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["desert","monotony","ruggedness","elevation","midground","post","sign","shrub","solitude","soil"]}
