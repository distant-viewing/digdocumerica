{"path":"551172.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of an industrial area situated on a narrow strip of land surrounded by a river. The landscape is densely packed with various industrial facilities including large cylindrical tanks, manufacturing buildings, and potentially factories or processing plants, which are clustered along the length of the strip.\n\nThe series of large tanks, colored white, gray, and a few in vibrant colors like orange, dominate one side of the stretch, possibly for storage of liquids like oil or chemicals. The other side has more complex structures, comprising tall vertical towers typical of chemical or refining plants, and several interconnected buildings.\n\nA bridge spans the river near the foreground of the image, providing a connection between the two sides of the riverbank. Below the bridge and distributed along the river are several barges and a couple of tow boats, suggesting this river is an active route for transporting goods or raw materials.\n\nThe river curves around the industrial strip, framing it. Beyond the immediate industrial zone, other infrastructure, possibly related to support or transport for the industry, is visible further along the riverbanks. The hills in the far background suggest the broader setting is within a valley, emphasizing the industrial focus of the area nestled within a natural landscape.","title":"Downriver view of the blaine's island operation of the union carbide chemicals company on the kanawha river","placename":"Charleston (W.
