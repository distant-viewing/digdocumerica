{"path":"554042.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a scene centred around a person operating machinery in a foggy or misty environment, creating a moody and obscured atmosphere. The individual is seated, likely on a vehicle, and appears to be facing away from the camera, gazing ahead at controls or the path forward. They are wearing a helmet and a face covering, suggesting a setting that requires protective gear, possibly for safety or due to the dusty conditions.\n\nThe machinery features elements like a protective cage or framing around the operator, marked by what looks like a patterned grid or mesh possibly for safety. This setup indicates that the vehicle might be something like a bulldozer, excavator, or another piece of heavy machinery commonly used in construction or industrial environments.\n\nThe background and surrounding details are notably blurred and difficult to distinguish because of the mist or fog, which adds a sense of isolation and focuses attention on the operator and the machinery. The overall lighting is subdued, contributing to the hazy and somewhat mysterious quality of the photograph.\n\nThis composition, with its emphasis on atmosphere and the obscured, silhouette-like figure engaging with heavy machinery, presents a vivid portrayal of industrial work under challenging visibility conditions, emphasizing themes of solitude and endurance.","title":"Heavy equipment used in planting sugarcane, Maui's chief agricultural product","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["553623","554045","553599","553600","544379","556866","556513","544832","556865","556315","544161","558379","556447","556893","556861","553621"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["machinery","operator","safety","cage","excavator","mesh","distinguish","obscure","portrayal","bulldozer"]}
