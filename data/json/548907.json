{"path":"548907.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large farming area depicting various stages of agricultural activity. The landscape is divided into multiple sections, each with a distinct agricultural function. The primary portion of the field is characterized by freshly tilled soil arranged in long, precise rows that create a striped pattern across the landscape. In several areas, billowing white dust clouds likely caused by ongoing plowing or soil preparation activities are visible.\n\nTowards the center, separating two distinctly managed sections of land, there is a road or pathway accompanied by rows of lush green vegetation which could be trees or large bushes, forming a barrier or windbreak between fields.\n\nOn the left side of the image, beyond the more actively managed fields, there are sections with different crops and grasses in shades of green and gold, suggesting various growth stages or types of crops. The background features a flat, expansive landscape that stretches towards distant mountains barely visible under a hazy sky.\n\nThe entirety of the view is a striking representation of intensive, large-scale agriculture, showcasing human efforts to cultivate and manage the land systematically. The photograph's composition, with its vast, geometric agricultural patterns and the natural scenery in the distance, contrasts the human-made order with the more random natural environment.","title":"Fertilizing a field","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["554029","548902","548908","542708","548820","557517","548898","558414","553977","549094","554053","553047","548817","542710","552858","548901"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["manage","crop","section","stage","field","soil","entirety","till","row","order"]}
