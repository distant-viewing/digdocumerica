{"path":"545870.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph shows a grand historical building characterized by classical architecture. It is a symmetrically designed structure with a large central section featuring a pediment supported by four tall, white Doric columns. At the apex of the pediment sits a decorative, circular clock tower capped with a domed roof, which includes a weathervane at its peak. \n\nThe building is constructed with multi-coloured brickwork, possibly sandstone, giving it an elegant yet sturdy appearance. Large, symmetrically placed windows with white frames are visible on either side of the central section. The entrance is marked by a set of double doors reached by ascending a short flight of wide steps that split halfway, creating a distinctive 'Y' shape leading up to the door.\n\nA concrete pathway bisects a well-maintained lawn leading directly to the front steps of the building. Shadows of nearby trees cast patterns across the pathway and lawn, suggesting the photo was taken on a sunny day. The sky in the background is bright, likely indicating midday or early afternoon.\n\nIn conclusion, this photograph depicts a serene and formal setting, typical of an important civic or educational building, bathed in natural light and surrounded by lush greenery.","title":"Kimball county court house in mason","placename":"Austin (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Texas","nn1":["558162","549360","558146","557073","556046","557156","546464","557084","548866","558122","546473","557074","546469","555949","546542","546468"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["pediment","lawn","step","pathway","apex","door","brickwork","bisect","section","midday"]}
