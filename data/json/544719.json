{"path":"544719.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts an aged and dilapidated building set behind a foreground of lush green corn plants. The structure appears to be made of corrugated metal, predominantly in faded and weathered white and gray hues, showcasing signs of rust and wear. The building’s façade features large, industrial-style windows with numerous broken panes, creating a pattern of absent glass and dark voids. Adjacent to the windows, there's a seemingly unstable external staircase with metal railings, leading to a second level where a simple door is slightly ajar. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the setting is one of neglect and decay, highlighted by the contrast between the natural vibrancy of the cornstalks in the front and the stark, deteriorated state of the man-made structure. The sunlight illuminates part of the scene, casting sharp shadows and highlighting textures, which enhances the feeling of abandonment and the passage of time. The composition effectively captures a sense of forgotten industrial history reclaimed by nature.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay Area","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["543339","543344","547985","551330","554707","547894","545982","552091","551586","554565","552515","550129","553555","543171","546164","551111"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["corn","pane","staircase","vibrancy","history","façade","metal","passage","window","rust"]}
