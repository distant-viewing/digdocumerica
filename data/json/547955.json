{"path":"547955.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image captures a scene at a cluttered boatyard under a bright, clear blue sky. Several boats are on trailers or stands, prominently in the forefront and background, suggesting maintenance or storage. The foreground features an orderly disarray of debris and discarded items, including old tires, cardboard, discarded metal objects, and scattered trash accumulating around and inside an open drum.\n\nOn the left, a mid-sized boat named \"GRAPA\" situated on a makeshift wooden block stand is noticeable. A man appears, standing aboard the boat, looking down towards the deck, possibly engaged in cleaning or fixing the boat. Other boats are visible in varying sizes and states of repair or disrepair, with some boats labeled, such as one in the background marked \"New York.\"\n\nIn the immediate background beyond the boats, other vehicles, possibly belonging to boat owners or yard workers, include a dark sedan. Overall, the setting illustrates a working or storage area for boats with a casual disregard for cleanliness or organization. The mixture of direct sunlight and the clear weather highlight the vivid colors and details of this busy maritime environment.","title":"Marina at great kills park on Staten Island has created a waste disposal and littering problem","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547941","546802","548688","542875","547012","544244","542911","543409","547961","552028","542902","543035","548547","547957","548543","542871"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","discard","disregard","owner","cleanliness","working","storage","fix","clean","accumulate"]}
