{"path":"543652.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural scene featuring water and land. In the foreground, a dirt and rocky path borders a body of brownish water. The water has a muddy appearance, possibly indicating low water clarity or sediment presence. Parallel to the path, the shore is lined with more sediment or salt deposits, forming a crusty, white edge.\n\nThe middle ground shows the body of water extending towards a sandy shore opposite the viewpoint. This area features patches of snow or salt deposits scattered along the lower sides of gently sloping hills, which rise up from the shores of the water.\n\nThe hills, covered with sparse vegetation or grass, meet a cloudy sky in the backdrop. The overall landscape suggests a semi-arid or coastal environment, perhaps undergoing seasonal changes or environmental stresses such as salt deposition or water quality issues. The scene is tranquil and devoid of any visible human activity or animals, focusing entirely on the natural elements. The lighting suggests either an overcast day or a time when the sunlight is muted, casting soft light on the landscape.","title":"The Colorado river near union carbide uranium mill","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["544765","549538","548811","550492","545031","545593","545636","544729","550598","545294","545923","552902","543809","544721","547905","553867"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["salt","deposits","shore","sediment","water","deposition","path","stress","featuring","devoid"]}
