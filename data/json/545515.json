{"path":"545515.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This image captures a scene in a lush, forested setting. A person, who appears to be a young adult, is standing next to a dark tree trunk, examining a sheet of green paper, possibly a map or notice. The person, assumedly female, is dressed casually in a light-colored long-sleeve shirt and sports a bright purple and red hat. Her attention is focused on the paper, which she holds in her right hand against the tree.\n\nIn the background, there is a small, bright yellow car parked amidst the dense greenery, suggesting that this location might be a parking area or a clearing in the woods. The forest floor is covered with leafy green plants, and the trees around are full, indicating a healthy woodland environment.\n\nThe entire scene conveys a sense of outdoor activity, possibly related to hiking, camping, or conducting environmental research, given the remote setting and the examination of the paper, which could be related to navigation or information about the area. The atmosphere is serene, with overcast lighting enhancing the vibrant greens of the forest.","title":"Member of weekend trip to bankhead national forest.
