{"path":"543516.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene that seems centered around a fishing activity. There are two individuals present, one adult and one child. The adult, a man, is engaged in fly fishing. He is dressed in a white outfit, consisting of a shirt and shorts, and he wields a long fishing rod. His stance is dynamic, as he appears to be actively casting the line into the river, which glistens under the light.\n\nNearby, a young child, wearing a red top and beige shorts, is squatting by the water's edge. The child seems to be exploring the water, possibly touching or playing with the water with his hands.\n\nThe setting is a shallow river surrounded by a dense forest of tall evergreen trees. The area around the river is rocky, and sunlight filters through the trees, illuminating patches of the river and its rocky banks. The atmosphere conveyed is peaceful and naturally beautiful, suggesting a remote or wilderness area perfect for nature activities like fishing and exploring. The composition highlights a moment of interaction between humans and the natural environment, emphasizing activities that connect people with the outdoors.","title":"Fly fishing on lake","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552976","542740","554519","554520","542564","542529","549935","550665","550317","551025","553081","551408","543693","542744","548737","550313"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","river","child","short","exploring","wield","adult","squatt","banks","glisten"]}
