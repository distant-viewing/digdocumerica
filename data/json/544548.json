{"path":"544548.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a large agricultural field. The field is divided into long, neat rows of vibrant green crops, creating a striking visual pattern. In the upper left quadrant of the photo is a small portion of a barren field with a reddish-brown, earthy color, providing a contrast to the lush green of the cultivated area.\n\nNear the bottom right of the image, parked on the edge of the field next to the green rows, is a white pickup truck. There are four people in the field: three are spread apart from each other amidst the crops, likely engaged in activities such as inspecting or harvesting the plants, while the fourth person is closer to the vehicle. Each individual appears tiny in comparison to the expanse of the field, emphasizing the scale of the agricultural area.\n\nThe perspective of the photo places the viewer directly above the scene, offering a clear, broad view of the agricultural layout and activity on the ground. The natural lighting suggests this photo was taken on a sunny day, casting shadows that give an additional sense of depth to the rows of crops. This type of imagery often highlights agricultural practices, the expanse of crop cultivation, and can be indicative of the type of farming taking place.","title":"Vegetable farming near the boundaries of the Everglades National Park","placename":"Homestead (Fla.)","location":"Homestead, Florida","nn1":["548900","548820","554054","554056","544552","549104","548902","548907","557478","548898","548997","553048","557517","549094","542708","554017"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["crop","field","row","quadrant","expanse","comparison","imagery","type","photo","harvest"]}
