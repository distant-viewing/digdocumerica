{"path":"549285.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph features an engaging scene involving two individuals through an oval-shaped window on a door. On the left side of the frame, there's a man standing outside, visible from a side profile. He is wearing a dark jacket, and his face is turned as if he's peering intently into the window.\n\nOn the inside, visible through the glass of the window, we see another person, an older man, who seems to be interacting with the first by placing a \"STOP\" sign against the pane. The sign, bearing the text \"LOGAN STOP EXPANSION,\" suggests a theme of protest or objection, presumably concerning local or community issues. The older man is wearing glasses and a plaid shirt, and appears to be making direct contact with the viewer or the figure outside, intensifying the sense of interaction.\n\nThe window itself has a white, ornate frame, contributing to a sort of vintage or classic aesthetic to the setting. It matches with the overall traditional architecture suggested by visible elements of the door.\n\nThe lighting and color in the photograph are distinctive, casting the scene in somewhat dim but natural light, which could suggest the photo was taken during the evening or in a shaded area. There's an overall blue cast over the image, adding a moody, almost chilly atmosphere to the interaction depicted. \n\nThis well-composed shot captures a personal, possibly intense, moment of communication or confrontation through a barrier, perhaps symbolizing larger themes of division and connection in the human experience.","title":"Anthony bruno affixes a protest sticker to the front door of his neptune road house while joseph porzio looks on.
