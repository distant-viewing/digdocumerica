{"path":"551295.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This image captures the vibrant atmosphere of an amusement park bumper car ride. In the foreground, prominently visible are various bumper cars in motion. The cars have a classic design with a combination of yellow, black, and cream colors. In one of the cars, a young girl with blonde hair looks thrilled as she steers her car, showcasing an expression of joy and excitement. Next to her, an adult man is seen laughing heartily, likely enjoying the playful bumping activity. \n\nOther participants are also visible further back, each controlling their own cars, contributing to the lively scene. Above the riders, a red and white sign that reads \"Max's SHAKE SHOP Sandwich & Fries‚Äù hints at the presence of food concessions nearby, typical of such settings.\n\nThe environment is covered by a roof supported by metal beams, suggesting that the ride is either indoors or under a shelter, protecting the participants from direct sunlight or rain. The flooring is a smooth surface suited for the ride, and the overall lighting appears to be a mix of natural and artificial light, creating a well-lit setting that enhances the cheerful, festive mood. The background also contains elements typical of an amusement park, like partial views of other attractions or structures, adding to the recreational theme of the photograph.","title":"Fun city, part of \"the strip\" playground area, offers a variety of amusement rides.
