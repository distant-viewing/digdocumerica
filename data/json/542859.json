{"path":"542859.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic industrial and rural setting. The foreground features a rustic wooden fence that encloses a grassy field, indicating a rural area possibly used for agriculture or grazing. In the middle of the composition, there is a large stack of logs, neatly arranged into a considerable pile, suggesting a logging or wood-processing operation. The presence of a crane next to the log stack reinforces this industrial activity, used likely for moving and arranging the logs.\n\nBehind the log stack, there are several vehicles parked, including cars and what appears to be trucks, further supporting the industrial nature of this site. The background is dominated by a dense, mist-covered forest with evergreen trees that fade into a hazy, mountainous silhouette, suggesting that this location might be in a valley or a similarly enclosed natural environment. The haze gives the scene a slightly muted and serene atmosphere, contrasting with the industrial activity suggested in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes elements of nature and industry, highlighting human activity within a naturally rich landscape. The photograph seems to be taken during the day, under bright, slightly overcast conditions, enhancing the vivid greens of the grass and trees against the industrial elements.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546236","545260","545256","552162","550346","542584","543749","555542","552163","545112","556913","554434","543668","542942","554809","545053"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["log","stack","grazing","logging","agriculture","mist","haze","valley","crane","industry"]}
