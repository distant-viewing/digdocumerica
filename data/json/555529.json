{"path":"555529.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up profile view of an elderly man lighting a cigarette. The man appears to be outdoors, indicated by natural light and green, blurry foliage in the background. The focus is sharply on the man, highlighting his rugged features, including deep wrinkles, a slightly furrowed brow, and a beard streaked with grey. His hair is unkempt and windswept.\n\nHe is holding a cigarette between his fingers, bringing it close to his lips, his hands showing signs of aging with visible veins and aged spots. He wears a blue denim shirt that suggests a casual, possibly work-related environment.\n\nThe image conveys a sense of worn resilience, possibly reflecting a moment of rest or contemplation. The natural backdrop and the man's attire suggest he might be engaged in outdoor activities or living in a rustic setting. The overall composition and the man's expression provide a strong sense of character and life experience.","title":"The surviving child of 13 offspring, this man has lived alone since his mother's death 25 years ago.
