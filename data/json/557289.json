{"path":"557289.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"In this photograph, the scene is set in a well-maintained garden during the daytime. The main activity is a person clad in a pink outfit pushing a lawn mower across a grassy area. The garden features various elements including a lush lawn scattered with fallen leaves, a concrete pathway leading through the garden, and densely planted trees and shrubs. Notable among the vegetation are a large tree with autumnal yellow leaves on the left, and a distinctly trimmed, round bush near the center.\n\nThere are also other gardening implements visible, such as a wheelbarrow filled with garden debris next to a small pile of branches. In the background, residential houses can be seen, partially obscured by the mature trees that signify a well-established neighborhood. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on autumnal garden upkeep, evokes a serene and productive atmosphere.","title":"Suburban housewife in the Mt.
