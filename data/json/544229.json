{"path":"544229.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts two young boys standing on a wooden dock near a body of water. The boy on the left is wearing a blue plaid short-sleeve shirt and dark pants, and he holds a small revolver in his right hand and a can in his left. His expression is neutral and he is looking directly at the camera. The boy on the right is shirtless, wearing green shorts, and is also barefoot like his companion. He holds a fishing pole in his right hand, and his expression is also neutral as he gazes into the camera.\n\nBehind them, the landscape features calm water, partially covered with aquatic plants. A small metal boat partially filled with water is tied to the dock. The background includes a variety of lush trees and overcast sky, which suggests a humid, possibly overcast day.\n\nThe overall scene may suggest a lifestyle closely connected to nature and possibly indicates the boysâ€™ familiarity and interactions with outdoor activities such as fishing and handling tools or weapons at a young age. The elements in the picture, including their apparel and the objects they hold, contribute to a rural, possibly southern U.S. setting.","title":"Boys with airgun and bird.
