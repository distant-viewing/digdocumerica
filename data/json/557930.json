{"path":"557930.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of an informational sign related to vehicle testing. The sign is predominantly white, with bold, black lettering that reads \"EXHAUST EMISSION PERFORMANCE TEST,\" with additional text beneath it saying \"as 95 REQUIRED IN OFFICIAL INSPECTION LANES.\" On the top left corner of the sign is a smaller caption in red, \"Sun Tuned Engines SAVE GAS,\" promoting a benefit of the testing.\n\nIn the background, the sharply blurred image suggests a street scene. There is a glimpse of a white vintage car, which appears from the side, illustrating an everyday traffic scenario. Behind the car, trees and other greenery lightly dot the background, adding a touch of nature to the urban setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo juxtaposes the commercial and environmental aspects of vehicle usage, with the focus on vehicle emissions testing pointing to concerns about air quality and fuel efficiency. The setting seems quite typical of a mid-to-late 20th-century American street.","title":"Closeup of a sign at one of several service stations that advertise tune-ups to pass emission and safety tests. It is located near an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. All light-duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must be inspected for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions since January 1975, and also receive a safety check. All other type vehicles registered in the city must undergo only the safety check.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["542762","557825","549691","557824","553895","549690","557828","552771","548174","555452","557875","549894","557859","557849","552770","557829"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["testing","emission","test","vehicle","efficiency","sign","fuel","usage","street","performance"]}
