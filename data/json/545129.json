{"path":"545129.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a coastal scene, likely taken from an elevated vantage point on a cliff overlooking the ocean. The foreground is densely populated with lush greenery, featuring tall grass, bushes, and small trees. The vegetation looks slightly windswept, indicating frequent exposure to sea breezes.\n\nThe middle ground of the image reveals a steep cliff face sloping down towards the ocean. The cliff is rugged and appears to be composed of layers of sediment or rock. Small, jagged rocks can also be seen scattered along the slope, adding to the rough texture of the terrain.\n\nIn the immediate background, the ocean extends towards the horizon, its surface disturbed by waves and whitecaps suggesting windy conditions. The waves are breaking near the shore, creating white froth that contrasts with the deep blue of the sea. Farther out, there are several small rocky islets or formations that emerge from the water, adding points of interest to the seascape.\n\nThe sky above is clear and bright blue, indicating fair weather and contributing to the vivid color contrast in the image. This scene captures a dynamic and pristine coastal environment, possibly untouched by significant human activity, highlighting natural beauty and the ruggedness of the coastal landscape.","title":"Oregon--Coos Bay","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["545125","543049","543184","543061","543297","543301","543300","545230","542917","545222","545122","543080","545226","543374","543291","545934"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","ocean","whitecap","wave","froth","islet","sea","seascape","ruggedness","rock"]}
