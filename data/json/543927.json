{"path":"543927.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph appears to depict an outdoor community clean-up activity, with several young people engaged in collecting rubbish in a natural setting. There are six individuals visible in the scene, each actively participating in the clean-up. They are using large black plastic garbage bags to collect debris from the grassy and slightly wooded area.\n\nThe background features lush greenery, with an assortment of trees and bushes under a cloudy sky, suggesting a rich, natural environment possibly during spring or summer. The participants, who seem to be teenagers, are dressed in casual attire suitable for outdoor work: jeans, t-shirts, and comfortable shoes.\n\nTo the left, a young woman with long hair is seen bending down to pick something up; she is wearing white jeans and a light-colored t-shirt. Adjacent to her is a young man with side-parted hair, dressed in a striped shirt and jeans, also focused on collecting rubbish. Behind him, partially obscured, another individual is visible, facing away, mainly involved in a similar task. To the right of the image, two more young people, a male and a female, are busy at work; the male in a darker shirt and jeans, and the female in a pink patterned shirt and jeans. They both display seriousness and commitment to the task.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a moment of active participation and environmental stewardship, emphasizing community involvement and the care of natural surroundings.","title":"Students pick up trash along roadside.","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["551427","552948","542655","548191","544800","550060","548198","551421","550056","552951","546863","551391","543441","543176","543439","543440"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["jean","collect","female","rubbish","t","male","shirt","seriousness","task","teenager"]}
