She wears traditional Native American attire that includes a beautifully decorated black jacket with vivid floral beadwork in colors like pink, white, and light blue. Her outfit is complemented by a red shawl draped over one arm and a grey and white patterned scarf tied at her neck. She also wears a bead necklace and earrings with a traditional design. On her head is a dark bandana or hat.\n\nThe woman's expression is serious and reflective as she gazes out of the frame, giving her a dignified and solemn presence. Her facial features and the lines on her face suggest that she is a woman of experience and wisdom.\n\nIn the background, the natural environment can be seen under a clear blue sky. It appears to be a sunny day, and the landscape includes green foliage and possibly a body of water or a distant road visible through trees.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph places a strong emphasis on the woman's attire and expression, capturing a sense of cultural heritage and personal history. The natural lighting enhances the vivid colors of her clothing and the peaceful yet vibrant outdoor setting.","title":"Photograph of mary louise White Cloud rhodd","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554051","544321","557158","555530","556594","556487","544404","543864","554923","551439","544408","557172","547385","544409","553708","553760"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["woman","shawl","earring","bandana","necklace","heritage","scarf","portrait","expression","neck"]}
