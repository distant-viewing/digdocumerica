{"path":"548116.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene that appears to occur in a moderately unkempt outdoor area. At first glance, we see a child, possibly in his pre-teens, walking on what looks like a gravel path next to a body of water. The child, wearing a long-sleeved orange striped shirt, blue jeans, and brown shoes, carries a fishing rod in one hand, suggesting he may have been fishing or is preparing to fish.\n\nThere is a significant amount of debris or personal items scattered on the ground near the child. This includes varied objects like clothing, a towel, and a plastic bucket, amongst others which are a bit difficult to define precisely from the image. Close to these items is a large corrugated pipe, half-submerged at one end in the water, perhaps serving as drainage.\n\nThe environment is semi-ruralâ€”the ground around is dirt and gravel, with sparse vegetation consisting mainly of grass and a few shrubby plants. The tones and nature of the debris, the attire of the child, and the general setting give the image a raw, rustic feel, potentially highlighting an aspect of everyday rural life possibly centered on a local watery area. The setting is sunny and seems tranquil, aside from the scattered objects which introduce a notion of disarray or casual use of the space by the local community.","title":"At Delta Park on the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["552828","546940","545539","551392","548837","551022","551025","544303","550231","544203","554534","557734","551024","552940","542740","543164"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["child","notion","teen","drainage","item","disarray","towel","object","debris","rod"]}
