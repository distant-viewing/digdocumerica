{"path":"545807.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features an aerial or high-angle view of a mountainous landscape with dramatic and rugged terrain. The mountains shown are steep and have sharp, jagged peaks and ridges, emphasized by the deep valleys and gorges that dissect them. The coloration of the mountains is a striking mixture of dark red and brown tones with patches of grey, suggesting the presence of different minerals or varying soil compositions.\n\nThe image's lighting highlights some of the ridges, providing a strong contrast against the shadowed areas, which add depth and dimension to the scene. There are no visible signs of vegetation or human activity, reinforcing the impression of a remote and barren environment. The landscape is purely natural and appears untouched, offering a stark and powerful view of Earth's geological formations.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its blend of dramatic color contrast and complex textures, captures the raw and majestic beauty of the mountain range. This creates a sense of awe and might be indicative of a region known for its geological and perhaps climatic extremities.","title":"Island in the Sky, the northern-most section of Canyonlands National Park","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["550396","550422","550514","550505","542519","550423","550425","550515","550424","552144","550501","550596","545313","542830","550507","550415"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["ridge","mountain","gorge","dimension","awe","coloration","mineral","mixture","grey","peak"]}
