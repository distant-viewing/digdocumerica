{"path":"550218.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial or urban waterway, featuring an old, rusted culvert or storm drain tunnel that opens into a body of murky water. The entrance to the culvert is circular and made of metal, showing significant signs of deterioration and rust, especially around its base where it meets the water. Additionally, water stains are visible around the entirety of the entrance.\n\nThe water itself is a dull greenish-brown, likely indicating stagnation or pollution. The surface of the water is relatively smooth with a few minor ripples. Directly above the culvert, a concrete or stone structure appears to support it, characterized by bare and weathered surfaces, with some parts submerged in water, suggesting a high water level or possible flooding conditions.\n\nThe atmosphere conveyed by the image is somewhat gloomy or foreboding, highlighted by muted colors and the aged infrastructure. There is no visible wildlife or human activity, further emphasizing a sense of abandonment or neglect. The setting likely points to an aged urban area or an industrial zone.","title":"Republic Steel discharges waste water into the Cuyahoga River.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["555550","550715","551534","552071","550719","551424","553428","547925","547890","552022","549564","543822","553467","551562","546793","543649"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["entrance","water","entirety","deterioration","tunnel","flooding","storm","stain","open","wildlife"]}
