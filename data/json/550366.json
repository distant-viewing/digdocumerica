{"path":"550366.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a broad, turbulent river viewed from a high vantage point under overcast skies. The river is swollen and appears to be in flood, characterized by muddy waters with swirling patterns of foam. On the left side, the riverbanks are less visible, suggesting a wider expanse of water, while to the right, the river is bordered by a more defined bank with residential buildings closely clustered together.\n\nA variety of homes, most likely single-family dwellings, can be seen along the right riverside. These homes, varying in design and color, contribute to a somewhat quaint and tightly knit community atmosphere. The vegetation around the homes is lush, indicating it might be spring or summer.\n\nIn the foreground, on the lower left side of the image, there's a railway track that runs parallel to the river, reinforcing the presence of infrastructure and civilization adjacent to the natural environment.\n\nThe overall tone of the image is somewhat somber due to the cloudy sky and the dark, swirling waters of the river, suggesting a scene captured during or after recent heavy rains or possibly during a storm event. The river's powerful flow and the packed residential area hint at a potentially precarious situation regarding water-related events such as flooding.","title":"Foam, a sign of pollution, floats on the st.
