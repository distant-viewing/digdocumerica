{"path":"552292.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil marine scene viewed through a natural frame of densely leaved branches, mainly composed of evergreen trees. The viewpoint is from a higher elevation looking down onto a serene body of water. In the water, two boats are in motion. The boat in the foreground is closer, moving rightward, creating vivid white frothy water trails. Its hull is predominantly white with a hint of blue and it appears to be a small to medium-sized pleasure craft with large visible windows and possibly a small upper deck or cabin top.\n\nThe background shows a wider expanse of water exuding dark blue tones, contrasted by another boat in motion further away. This second boat follows a similar trajectory and leaves a long wake displaying its brisk movement. The shimmering light on the water around both boats suggests sunlight reflecting off the surface, adding a vibrant touch to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition uses natural elements to frame a picture of leisure boating in a calm, tree-surrounded waterway, likely capturing a moment of peaceful retreat into nature. The colors are rich and dark, indicative of either early morning or late afternoon lighting, enhancing the mood of tranquility and isolation.","title":"Pleasure boats on puget sound off point defiance","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548247","549374","550769","549417","551311","549380","547234","551209","543059","547549","548118","555694","542903","552316","542908","547781"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","brisk","exud","motion","pleasure","trees","water","medium","retreat","trails"]}
