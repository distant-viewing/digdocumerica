{"path":"543788.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a sunny outdoor scene where a family is walking alongside a large horse. The horse, shown from behind and dominating the foreground, has a shiny chestnut coat and a swishing tail. Its rear prominently faces the camera, and you can see some defining muscles and folds in its skin around the upper legs and hindquarters.\n\nIn the background, two women and a small child are walking. One woman, with long dark hair, is dressed in a casual black top and vertically striped pants, carrying a baby in a light blue outfit. She is smiling gently and looking down at the child she is holding. The other child, likely a toddler, walks beside her wearing a pink jumpsuit and sports a light-colored pair of shoes. This child is looking directly towards the camera with an expression of curiosity or attention.\n\nThe setting of the photograph seems to be a rural or semi-rural area, with sparse vegetation and visible rocks on the ground. The backdrop features clear skies and hints of a tree line or distant landscape in the soft blur, suggesting a spacious environment. The mood conveyed is one of casual, familial outdoor activity, likely taken in a moment of leisure or during a walk. The image captures a sense of motion and candidness, providing a glimpse of everyday life and interaction with a domestic animal.","title":"Ranch family with horse","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553116","543678","543043","544358","557992","556562","554689","552562","543783","543841","557418","544362","553064","551229","554885","542972"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","horse","jumpsuit","fold","baby","toddler","walk","tail","blur","rear"]}
