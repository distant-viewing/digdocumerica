{"path":"543876.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a person engaging in an activity likely related to surfing or paddleboarding. The individual, who appears youthful and is partly obscured by sunlight and water splashes, is seen lying prone on a small surfboard. They are paddling through the calm, rippled waters which glisten under a luminous sun.\n\nThe water appears to take on a reddish-brown hue, possibly due to the lighting or the natural color of the water in this particular location. The background is devoid of any distinct features or landmarks and is entirely filled with the vast expanse of water extending to the horizon. The sky blends seamlessly with the water due to the brightness and lack of visual demarcation.\n\nThe shot is taken from a distance and slightly to the side, focusing closely on the subject while capturing the motion of water and the serene aquatic setting. The color tones are warm, and the ambiance exudes a peaceful late afternoon vibe on the water.","title":"Kentucky--near Louisville","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["550292","553687","544964","552354","553690","543942","546349","557481","553988","543881","544347","543393","544291","547913","546397","551960"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["water","surfboard","prone","demarcation","surf","landmark","paddle","glisten","obscured","reddish"]}
