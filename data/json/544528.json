{"path":"544528.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil yet dynamic scene on a body of water. The focal point is an alligator moving through the water, its back and tail creating a visible, textured surface above the waterline. The alligator's rigid, scaled back is sprinkled with water droplets that sparkle in the light, suggesting the photo was taken on a sunny day.\n\nThe water surrounding the alligator is relatively calm with light ripples, and the reflection of light on the water gives it a textured appearance, enhancing the overall serene yet wild atmosphere of the scene. The composition is straightforward, centered on the alligator which is positioned horizontally and occupies a significant portion of the frame from the foreground extending into the middle ground.\n\nThe background is minimal and blurred, helping to keep the viewer's attention on the alligator. The color palette is natural, dominated by blues of the water and the darker tones of the alligator. The overall effect is a simple, naturalistic representation of wildlife in its habitat, captured with clarity and a focus that draws the viewer into this moment of quiet movement.","title":"Alligator at s-12a structure","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544546","550219","553079","544543","544900","545923","550341","550786","545142","545991","544765","554623","551352","547630","545008","546963"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["water","waterline","sprinkle","sparkle","tail","droplet","representation","viewer","keep","clarity"]}
