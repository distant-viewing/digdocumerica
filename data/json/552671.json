{"path":"552671.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The image captures a dynamic scene likely taken at an equestrian event during the evening under artificial lighting. A blurred motion effect is evident, suggesting rapid movement and energy. The photograph features a horse and rider, along with a dog. The horse, a light-brown or chestnut color, is in mid-gallop, with its legs extended and hooves barely touching the ground. The rider, wearing a pale blue shirt and jeans, appears focused and is maintaining balance as the horse moves swiftly.\n\nA black dog, also in motion, is running ahead of the horse and rider. The dog is stretched out close to the ground, suggesting it is running at full speed.\n\nThe background is mostly a blur of horizontal light streaks - white and yellow - likely representing artificial lighting from the venue. These streaks enhance the sensation of speed and motion in the scene. The ground is a smooth, sandy arena surface, commonly used in equestrian sports, reflecting some light and contributing to the overall ambiance of the photo.","title":"Garfield County Fair.
