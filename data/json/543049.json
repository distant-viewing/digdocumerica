{"path":"543049.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal landscape under a clear blue sky. The view spans along a rugged coastline with a series of cliffs descending into the ocean. The ocean appears lively with white waves breaking against the shore and around scattered rock formations and small islands that protrude from the sea, suggesting a potentially rocky seabed.\n\nOn the left side of the image, lush green vegetation covers the forefront and the sloping hillside, indicating a flourishing coastal ecology. The cliffs are densely wooded, adding a sense of depth and natural ruggedness to the scene.\n\nIn the distance, the ocean meets the horizon in a calm line, contrasting the frothy activity near the shore. Above the horizon, the sky is mostly clear but adorned with fluffy white clouds near the top of the frame, suggesting good weather conditions.\n\nThe light in the scene, presumably either early morning or late afternoon based on the soft glow and long shadows, highlights the texture of the water's surface and the greenery on the cliffs, providing a tranquil yet dynamic natural setting.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543184","545129","545230","543080","545125","543297","543061","543300","542917","543328","545222","543374","543430","545122","545226","543290"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","ocean","shore","ruggedness","island","horizon","hillside","coastline","forefront","glow"]}
