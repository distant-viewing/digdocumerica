{"path":"553546.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts an intimate and serene moment between two young adults on a weathered red sofa, located in a room characterized by subdued lighting that filters through window blinds. The young man, reclining on the sofa, wears a sleeveless mesh top and colorful striped pants. He appears relaxed or asleep, his head resting against the shoulder of the young woman seated beside him. The woman, dressed in a simple white t-shirt, is gently pinching or touching the man's nose, affectionately. Her expression is tender and focused on the man's face.\n\nBeside the sofa, a small white dog lies on the floor, contributing to the casual, homely atmosphere. There's a glass of water on a small side table near the sofa, indicating a relaxed, domestic setting. The room appears lived-in and slightly cluttered, with personal items like a pack of cigarettes visible on the table, adding to the authenticity of the scene.\n\nThe natural light and shadow play across the room adds depth and texture to the composition, enhancing the quiet mood of the snapshot. Overall, the image captures a snapshot of everyday life, filled with comfort and human connection.","title":"Wife of Dale Watkins, one of the nine children of a Mulky Square family, performs a little cosmetic surgery on husband's face.
