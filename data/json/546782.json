{"path":"546782.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a distressing environmental scene along a lakeshore. The focal point is a collection of dead fish scattered along the water's edge. These fish vary in size but are similar in appearance, suggesting they might be the same species. They are interspersed with a mix of natural debris including leaves, twigs, and small stones that make up the shoreline. The background shows the edge of the lake's water, which is calm and reflects a dark, blurred image that could be the sky or distant shore. The overall hue of the photograph is tinted in warm, brownish colors, enhancing the somber and possibly polluted atmosphere of the scene. The image appears to be taken during the day under direct sunlight, as evidenced by the vivid details and shadows cast by the fish bodies and debris.","title":"Dead fish on the shore near Port Covington","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["555560","547737","547687","546846","546930","542985","546898","547704","546779","546784","546185","552067","550878","548973","546792","546842"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","twig","debris","specie","edge","collection","shoreline","stone","shore","size"]}
