{"path":"547606.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph portrays a scene filled with various discarded and deteriorated objects submerged in a dark, murky liquid, probably water. The objects appear heavily corroded and rusted, suggesting they have been in this environment for a substantial period. Front and center is a partially submerged shopping cart, its structure bent and twisted, with debris and sediment accumulated within. Surrounding the shopping cart are numerous other items including what appears to be a rusted iron beam, possibly part of some structural or machinery component, and a heavily decayed piece of fabric or plastic that resembles a torn bag.\n\nIn the background, less discernible objects can be seen floating or settled beneath the surface of the dark water, contributing to a general impression of abandonment and environmental degradation. The waterâ€™s surface reflects a reddish-brown hue indicative of rust and decay, which is typical in sites where metal has been exposed to water and elements over time. This image might evoke considerations about consumerism, waste, and environmental neglect.","title":"Dumping on Narragansett Bay shore","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547908","549307","546838","551497","546854","552102","547513","555850","555851","552158","543302","546913","549306","556324","547024","555852"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["cart","shopping","object","consideration","iron","liquid","fabric","degradation","water","sediment"]}
