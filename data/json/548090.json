{"path":"548090.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph is centered on a polluted body of water, possibly a river, shown with a foamy, dirty surface indicating contamination. The foreground of the image is dominated by a muddy shore littered with various debris including leaves, twigs, and man-made waste. A prominent feature in the foreground is a large piece of driftwood embedded in the mud. \n\nThe water in the river is murky, with ripples that reflect the light, creating an array of sparkling spots on the surface. The color tones of the water vary from dark brown to lighter muddy hues, mixed with the white of the polluted foam.\n\nNo people or animals are visible in the image, focusing entirely on the environmental aspect. The picture serves as a stark representation of water pollution and its impact on natural bodies of water. The composition is straightforward, giving an unembellished view of the affected environment, possibly serving as an ecological or environmental statement about water pollution.","title":"Raw sewage bubbles up into the spokane river from the spokane city treatment plant about five miles west of the city","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544779","550369","555784","552054","552127","544804","552811","543819","550812","547537","550723","545168","544580","547524","551560","550371"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollution","water","statement","serve","contamination","embed","driftwood","twig","representation","mud"]}
