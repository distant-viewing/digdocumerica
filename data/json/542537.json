{"path":"542537.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic river scene set against a rugged landscape. A large river dominates the foreground of the image, featuring glistening, slightly turbulent water that reflects the sunlight. In the middle of the river, there is a notable driftwood or a fallen, partially submerged tree that forms an interesting, almost sculptural element with its branches reaching out at various angles.\n\nThe background consists of a panoramic view of undulating hills that are sparsely vegetated, suggesting a semi-arid terrain. The hills roll into the distance, and their surface appears rugged and uneven. The coloration of the hills varies between shades of green, brown, and gray, which might be a result of both the natural foliage and the sunlight's angle during the time the photo was taken.\n\nNo people, animals, or man-made structures are visible in the image, emphasizing a sense of natural wilderness and tranquility. The overall composition and the focus on natural elements showcase a serene yet slightly wild aspect of the landscape, inviting contemplation and appreciation of natural beauty.","title":"Mill Creek entrance","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["550658","543793","542743","548156","550682","550542","550698","550700","542653","550433","550656","553855","543789","549456","550560","550742"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["hill","river","angle","appreciation","driftwood","coloration","result","glisten","sunlight","undulate"]}
