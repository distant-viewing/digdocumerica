{"path":"555086.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph displays a scene of significant natural disturbance featuring a large pile of broken, discarded tree trunks, limbs, and debris. This expansive view shows aspects of an area after what could be logging activity, a natural disaster such as a storm or landslide, or a deliberate clearing. The ground is covered in splintered wood and jumbled vegetation, visible in a variety of colors ranging mostly through grays, browns, and some green hints, possibly indicating moss or remaining leaves.\n\nThere is an absence of standing trees in the visible area, suggesting the impact of the event or operation was quite comprehensive. The scene is untidy, with wood pieces crisscrossed and piled indiscriminately. No human figures or animals are discernible, focusing all attention on the aftermath of the tree clearance. The background blends seamlessly with the foreground due to the uniformity of the destruction and debris, giving no separation or depth cues, only a continuous texture of broken natural material. This creates a somber or distressing mood, reflecting the scale of disturbance to the natural environment.","title":"Three-year-old clear-cut area of olympic national timberland, Washington.
