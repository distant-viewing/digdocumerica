{"path":"546203.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features a dramatic silhouette of a large industrial structure, possibly a segment of a bridge or a similar construct, captured against a vividly bright, sunlit backdrop. The main focal point is the monumental, curved metal beam that dominates the upper portion of the frame. This beam, intensifying in darkness as it arcs across the sky, is supported by a robust truss framework, visible as an intricate pattern of interconnected metal rods forming a triangular lattice.\n\nBeneath this giant metallic arch, the scene opens up to a serene waterscape speckled with light reflections dancing on the surface of the water. Several small boats are scattered throughout this watery expanse, their details minimized by the distance and backlighting from the sun. The horizon is marked by structures that could be part of a distant port or marina, indicated by faint outlines and shapes that suggest buildings or industrial equipment.\n\nThe foreground consists of an uneven, rocky terrain, suggesting a shoreline. The environment looks rough and untended, adding a rugged contrast to the engineered precision of the structure overhead.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively plays with light and shadow, utilizing the bold silhouette of the structure to frame and emphasize the shimmering water and distant horizon, creating a compelling interaction between the man-made and the natural.","title":"Fish-eye view of bridge","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["548207","544671","545022","544722","555731","544655","555730","546389","547064","548870","555725","557979","545430","550910","552990","546139"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["beam","minimize","waterscape","intensify","arc","engineer","lattice","dance","truss","silhouette"]}
