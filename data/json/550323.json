{"path":"550323.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a place called \"Ken's Pool Room,\" as indicated by the slightly weathered, colorful sign above a window. The window is divided into four quadrants, enclosed by a white frame set into a light blue wall. Through the window, three elderly men are visible; they appear to be seated and looking out.\n\nThe man on the left is wearing a blue cap and a dark jacket, and he seems to be attentively observing something outside. The man in the middle has greying hair and is also dressed in dark clothing; he holds his chin thoughtfully, with a pensive or possibly bored expression. The man on the right is wearing a plaid cap and a jacket; his posture and facial expression suggest he is lost in thought, resting his head against his hand.\n\nThe interior behind them is dimly lit, making it difficult to discern many details about the room's interior. The mood conveyed by their expressions and the dull weather outside suggests a quiet, reflective day. The scene captures a slice-of-life moment likely reflective of daily social gatherings among friends at this local hangout.","title":"Looking out at main street in eastport","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["547376","557152","547794","548234","545984","547789","543975","553172","557767","554866","556612","556485","552622","548452","547359","557856"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["expression","quadrant","window","cap","lose","man","ching","call","jacket","friend"]}
