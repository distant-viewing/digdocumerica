{"path":"551090.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image captures a modest residential scene from possibly a few decades ago, judging by the style of vehicles and overall tone. In the foreground, partly blurred, are two cars parked on the side of a street. The car closest to the viewer has a retro design, suggesting the photo is from the mid-20th century, and features distinct round headlights and a metallic body. The second vehicle, partially obscured by the first, also appears to be of a similar vintage.\n\nIn the middle ground of the photograph is a small, somewhat weathered wooden house. The house, painted in a pale color, shows signs of wear and has a porch with a set of stairs leading up to it. On the porch railing and extending onto a clothesline are various items of laundry, including shirts and pants, vividly capturing a slice of domestic life.\n\nThe house is framed by abundant greenery; lush trees and shrubs envelop the background and partially shadow the house and yard. This vegetation suggests a setting that is not in an urban city center but perhaps in a suburban or rural community. The overall atmosphere evoked is one of simplicity and everyday life, untouched by modern hustle.","title":"Never-ending stream of cars roars by homes on busy Route 60 at Riverside","placename":"Charleston (W.
