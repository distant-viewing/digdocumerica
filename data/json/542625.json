{"path":"542625.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil sunset scene, emphasizing the silhouette of multiple trees against a vividly colored sky. The trees, characterized by their sprawling branches and full foliage, are etched starkly in black against the backdrop, creating a striking contrast. The sky transitions from a deep orange near the horizon, where the sun seems to have just set, to a darker, moodier orange as it extends upwards.\n\nThese trees are situated atop a gently sloping hill, enhancing the composition by adding a sense of depth and layers to the image. The silhouette of the hill cuts across the bottom part of the frame, with the trees positioned at varying heights on this slope.\n\nThe overall effect of the colors and silhouettes gives the image a serene, almost contemplative quality, probably intended to highlight the peacefulness and natural beauty of the scene at twilight. The simplicity of the elements - sky, silhouetted trees, and hill - work together to focus attention on the interplay of light and shadow, and the natural lines of the landscape. Given the quality of the photograph, it suggests a somewhat dated or analog origin, adding a textured or grainy feel that complements the timeless scene.","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["554731","543137","547705","543145","547719","543415","543621","550646","543410","554403","552335","543400","547733","544601","546100","554397"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["silhouette","etch","origin","grainy","tree","slop","intend","quality","peacefulness","sprawling"]}
