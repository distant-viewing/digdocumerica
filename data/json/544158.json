{"path":"544158.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures an archaeological excavation in a sprawling desert landscape. Two people, a man and a woman, are actively engaged in the dig. The woman, wearing a light-colored shirt and pants, is standing on the left side of a dug-out area, leaning towards it as she seemingly examines something in the ground or speaks to her colleague. The man, in a blue long-sleeve shirt and dark pants, is on the right, handling a shovel and working on excavating deeper into the earth.\n\nThe setting is distinctly arid and vast, with sparse vegetation, mainly consisting of a prominent tree right in the center background, which stands out against the flat horizon. Beyond this tree, the landscape extends into flat, scrub-dotted terrain, backed by low-rise mountains under a clear blue sky. Scattered around the excavation site are tools, cloths, and bags â€” typical of an archaeological site.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes both the isolation and intensity of the archaeological work, situated in a remote and expansive natural environment.","title":"Skilled Navajos carry out archaeological excavations.
