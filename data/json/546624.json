{"path":"546624.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a bustling urban landscape. In the foreground, there is a prominent, tall, white building with a distinctive, vertical structure reminiscent of Art Deco architecture. Surrounding this building are expansive green lawns and several smaller structures, possibly part of a campus or institutional complex. \n\nA major, multi-lane road bisects the image from the bottom right to the middle left, filled with a heavy flow of traffic suggestive of a busy time of day. The road is lined with rows of neatly arranged trees, adding a touch of greenery to the urban setting.\n\nThe background of the image shows a mix of residential and commercial areas with several high-rise buildings, suggesting this is a part of a city or a densely populated suburb. Furthermore, the presence of wide green spaces interspersed between these areas provides a balanced mix of urban and park environments.\n\nThe overall scene is set against a backdrop of a clear sky, indicating it might be a bright, sunny day. The composition offers a snapshot of urban planning, integrating architectural prominence, transportation flows, and green spaces, all contributing to the dynamic of a lively city environment.","title":"Looking south on Rockville Pike.
