{"path":"557394.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene likely set in an industrial or utility control room. The primary focus is on a man stationed at a large control panel filled with numerous illuminated buttons and switches, predominantly in red and blue. The man appears to be a worker, wearing a white safety helmet and a plaid shirt; he holds a clipboard, suggesting he is either monitoring the systems, performing an inspection, or recording data.\n\nThe control panel, which stretches across the right side of the photo, is well-lit by the indicators, emitting a blue glow that adds a cool tone to the scene. The left side of the background reveals a glimpse of an industrial setting with complex machinery and structures, partially visible and faintly illuminated by natural light, suggesting an open doorway or window.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is somewhat somber and focused, emphasized by the low lighting, which casts shadows on the man's face and creates an aura of concentration and seriousness in his environment. The lighting and the array of buttons create a striking contrast, giving the picture a technical, almost cinematic quality.","title":"Precipitates are continuously monitored in this \"bag house\" control room at the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant.
