{"path":"556103.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image depicts an indoor scene within a train station waiting area. The setting features a light-colored wooden paneled wall which gives a vintage feel. Above the five individuals sitting on the benches, there is a large blackboard prominently displayed. The board is divided into sections labeled \"EAST\" and \"WEST,\" and shows scheduled train timesâ€”both for on time and late departures. Next to it, the Amtrak logo on a sign symbolizes the train service, accompanied by a framed photo of a train mounted beside it.\n\nOn the wooden benches, sit five individuals appearing to be waiting for their respective trains. Seated from left to right: a man wearing a light-colored short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, who is engaged in reading a book. Next to him, a woman in sunglasses and a light-colored casual outfit glances downward, possibly resting. Beside her, another woman in sunglasses and white attire holds a purse on her lap and seems to be looking off to the side. Next is a woman in a striped shirt, with her purse beside her, looking directly ahead with a somewhat contemplative expression. Lastly, another woman in a patterned blouse and skirt sits with her arms crossed, also looking ahead.\n\nLight streams in through unseen windows, casting shadows and highlights across the room, providing a tranquil, somewhat timeless ambiance to the scene. The individuals all appear relaxed and patient, typical of a waiting area scenario in a train station. The photograph captures an everyday moment, providing a window into a routine travel experience, with each individual absorbed in their personal state of waiting.","title":"Passengers waiting in the station at east glacier park Montana, for the train which will take them to Seattle Washington.
