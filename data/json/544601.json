{"path":"544601.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This atmospheric photograph captures a serene sunset scene dominated by nature. The image features a group of birds perched atop a tree silhouette that stands against a warm, golden sky, possibly indicating the time of dusk. To the right, a larger, full sun hangs low in the sky, suggesting the sun is setting, bathing the scene in a soft, diffused light.\n\nThe tree on which the birds are perched is densely leaved, and it fills the top left quadrant of the photograph, forming a dark, detailed silhouette. Multiple birds of various sizes are visible. Some are stationary, sitting amidst the branches, while others appear to be in motion, notably three birds captured in the act of taking flight.\n\nThe background of the photograph is composed of a subtly varying golden hue that transitions from a lighter tone near the sun to a deeper, richer gold as it moves away from the sun, accentuating the sun's glow. The horizon is softly defined, suggesting a distant landscape that could be either water or a lightly wooded area.\n\nOverall, the composition and color scheme of the image convey a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, emphasizing a moment of calmness and freedom as the day ends. The silhouette technique used here effectively highlights the forms and actions of the birds, making them a striking element against the simpler, monochromatic background.","title":"Chokoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Mexico, Gulf of","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544597","544612","553776","544609","553875","543145","554731","544605","542625","555013","551378","543062","547719","550382","550888","543137"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","sun","perch","silhouette","quadrant","freedom","technique","gold","calmness","scheme"]}
