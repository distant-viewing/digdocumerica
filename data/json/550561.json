{"path":"550561.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a stunning aerial view of a meandering river through a mountainous landscape. The river cuts a serpentine path, creating a dramatic S-shape as it flows through the valley. The foreground is dominated by dark, silhouetted trees on the hillsides, indicating we are viewing the scene from a higher vantage point. The reflection of the sky in the water gives certain parts of the river a shiny, almost metallic look.\n\nIn the middle distance, the hills roll gently and are covered in dense greenery, likely coniferous forests, interspersed with darker patches that could be shadows cast by clouds above. The riverbanks are steep, emphasizing the depth of the valley carved by the river.\n\nThe background features a range of mountains with noticeably sharper peaks, suggesting a transition to a more rugged terrain. These mountains fade into a misty, blue-grey horizon which gives the image a feeling of vastness and remoteness. The sky, partly cloudy and appearing somewhat stormy, adds a dramatic atmosphere to the scene, with patches of light breaking through the clouds highlighting certain areas of the river and mountains, enhancing the contrast and depth of the photograph. The overall mood is one of serene isolation and natural beauty, typical of wilderness areas undisturbed by human activity.","title":"View west of point where pipeline will cross the Yukon.
