{"path":"543849.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features two people and a rural setting. In the foreground, an elderly man is captured in close-up, dominating the left side of the frame. His facial features are detailed, showing signs of aging and he is wearing glasses. His attire includes a weathered wide-brimmed straw hat and a striped button-up shirt. He has a solemn expression and his skin appears weathered, hinting at a life of outdoor work.\n\nBehind the elderly man, slightly out of focus, a young boy to the right side of the frame looks towards the camera. He has dark hair and is wearing a light blue top with darker sleeves.\n\nThe background shows the corner of a worn-down white wooden house, the edge of which is supported by a vertical post. There are some clothes hanging next to a window, and the walls of the house are visibly weathered and aged. The setting suggests a rustic or rural environment, possibly on a farm.\n\nOverall, the lighting and mood of the image are subdued, capturing a moment that seems reflective or candid, with a strong emphasis on the character and lived experience of the subjects depicted.","title":"Migrant worker with his gRandchildren in front of two room shack which houses three families (20 people), this man and his family follow the crops north from Texas each year, his present job is weeding sugar beets at $2.00 an hour.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["554857","552103","554926","542613","552859","547179","547679","557033","554915","553091","548218","556563","554846","557113","546068","544409"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["weather","house","straw","aging","brim","skin","button","live","emphasis","up"]}
