{"path":"553903.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene park scene on a bright day. The composition is framed by the silhouette of a large, leafy tree occupying the foreground. The tree branches spread widely, partially obscuring a view of the park and imparting a sense of depth. Beneath these branches, several people are visible engaged in an outdoor game, possibly cricket, given the wide, open space and their casual yet active stance.\n\nThe lush park is characterized by well-manicured grass, spanning wide across the image, set against a vibrant, cloudy sky. In the distance, other dense patches of trees and foliage are visible, outlining the park. The light appears to be quite strong, possibly indicating a time close to midday, highlighted by the vividness of the green grass and the relatively dark shadow areas under the trees. The play of light and shadow, along with the natural green hues, makes the scene feel alive and inviting. The general ambience is one of leisure and relaxed activity in a public, open space.","title":"Sanitary landfill transformed into a recreational area - the answer to the town dump.
