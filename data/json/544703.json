{"path":"544703.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a water channel. The sun, low on the horizon, casts a brilliant golden hue across the frame, backlighting several telegraph poles that line the edge of the waterway. These poles, extending into the distance, create a perspective line that converges in the distance. The water itself appears calm, with the surface reflecting the light of the sunset and showing ripples near the edges, indicating some movement. On the right side of the image, the water transitions into darkness, which dominates the lower portion of the frame, giving a contrasting effect to the bright sky. The overall atmosphere evoked by the image is peaceful and quiet, typical of a rural or semi-rural area at dusk. The visible wires overhead suggest some elements of human presence or activity in this otherwise natural landscape.","title":"Sunset","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["547732","542631","557447","552294","544707","542618","547731","551206","549096","545022","544711","552277","547714","549847","548181","554404"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","pole","channel","darkness","edge","waterway","distance","wire","transition","ripple"]}
