{"path":"547349.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a circular saw blade. The focus is on the detailed texture of the bladeâ€™s edge, showcasing serrated teeth depicted in a highly magnified form which creates an artistic pattern. The curve of the saw blade fills the frame diagonally, disappearing out of the top left and bottom right corners.\n\nThe surface of the blade displays fine, parallel lines indicating wear or machining, providing an interesting contrast in textures. The color tone is a deep reddish-brown tint with hints of darker and lighter areas, suggesting rust or varying metal properties. Above the teeth, a band of the blade is visible, characterized by a rough finish which perhaps catches light differently due to its composition or condition.\n\nSprinkled over the blade, particularly around the teeth area, are tiny sparkles that could be metal filings or dust particles reflecting light. This effect adds a further layer of texture and visual interest to the image.\n\nThe lighting is subdued with emphasis on highlighting the form and texture of the blade, casting shadows around the teeth that enhance their outline and shape. There is no visible background, ensuring the image retains a tight focus on the subject matter itself, emphasizing the details and engaging the viewer in an exploration of industrial aesthetics.","title":"Aerial view of farmland contours","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["546888","555345","546932","549125","554604","555141","550058","547029","554306","543121","555059","550606","555325","557626","544682","557583"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Religious Imagery"],"terms":["blade","tooth","texture","sparkle","form","matter","finish","particle","tint","band"]}
