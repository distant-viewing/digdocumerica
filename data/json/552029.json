{"path":"552029.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil moment at a lakeside setting. In the foreground, two individuals, an adult and a child, are seated on a concrete dock facing the lake. The adult appears to be engaged in fishing, equipped with fishing rods, sitting on a portable chair. The child, seated closer to the waterâ€™s edge, is watching the lake, possibly observing the fishing activity or the surroundings.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo shows a small power boat speeding across the water, creating a trail of waves behind it, suggesting recreational activity on the lake.\n\nThe background features a serene lakeside view lined with dense trees and what appears to be residential housing partially obscured by the foliage. The sky is clear and reflects a bright, sunny day, enhancing the overall peaceful and recreational atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Fishing and boating on the niagara river.
