{"path":"548695.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photo captures a peaceful moment on a beach. In the foreground, on a stony shoreline, three people and a small black dog are engaged in leisure activities. The dog appears to be walking along the beach in front of the group. Among the people, there is one woman and two men. The woman, to the left, wears a yellow dress and has short, curly hair. She is walking and looking to her right, perhaps talking to or observing the others. To her right, a young boy in a red T-shirt and grey shorts seems to be interacting with the other man, who is shirtless, wearing swim trunks, and possibly pointing to something on the ground. This man is facing the boy and bending slightly forward.\n\nIn the background, the ocean extends widely with varying shades of blue, segmented by subtle waves. Above the horizon, the sky is a muted blue, indicating either early morning or late afternoon light, contributing to the serene atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo highlights a tranquil, leisurely beach setting where both humans and animals are enjoying a calm seaside stroll.","title":"Tourists on the public beach","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["543083","543500","543395","548697","543072","550924","543463","547877","543390","545218","547009","543225","543396","555402","553951","543070"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","dog","boy","seaside","stroll","walk","talk","segment","woman","man"]}
