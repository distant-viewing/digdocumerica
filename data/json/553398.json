{"path":"553398.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph shows a stone water barrier in a tranquil river setting. The barrier extends diagonally across the image and functions as a partial dam, creating a series of cascading waterfalls. Water flows over the barrier in a smooth, flowing pattern, which creates a stark contrast between the turbulent white water on one side and the calm, still water on the other. The day appears to be sunny, as the light shines brightly on the water and casts clear shadows of nearby trees on the tranquil water surface.\n\nThe calm side of the river reflects the surroundings, displaying a mirror-like effect that captures the silhouettes of trees and the sky. The barrier itself looks worn and slightly mossy, indicating it has been in place for a considerable time. Overall, the composition presents a serene and natural environment, exemplifying a peaceful water scene with elements of man-made structure integrated into the natural landscape.","title":"Dam below the Weyerhaeuser paper mill on the Whitman River is almost choked with wastes from the mill.
