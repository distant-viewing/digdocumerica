{"path":"551394.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures two men engaged in river fishing. The setting is a muddy riverbank with some vegetation and tree branches visible in the area.\n\nThe man in the foreground is actively fishing. He is dressed in a plaid shirt, jeans, and knee-high rubber boots to wade in the water, and wears a baseball cap. This man is bending over as he uses a large fishing net to scoop up fish from the water, showing some motion and activity.\n\nThe man in the background is seated, possibly keeping a lookout or resting. He wears sunglasses, a camouflage jacket, and what appears to be some type of hunting or outdoor cap. He is holding what looks like a cigarette or small cigar in his right hand and seems to be watching the activity or waiting his turn.\n\nAround them are tools likely used in their fishing activity: buckets (one red, one gray) and an additional net or some fishing gear on the ground. The river itself is murky and rushing, indicating either recent rain or a fast-moving current, contributing to the rugged and outdoor nature of the scene. The overall impression is one of active participation in nature and a snapshot of outdoor, rural life.","title":"Annual smelt run at Singing Bridge, Tawas City.
