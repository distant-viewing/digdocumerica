{"path":"546559.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil outdoor scene, primarily focusing on a straight pathway that leads through a grassy area. The path, made of dark asphalt, runs directly from the foreground towards the background, framed by grass on either side. It's lined by lush greenery, including a variety of trees and possibly shrubs.\n\nThe scene is illuminated by what appears to be early morning or late afternoon sunlight, casting long shadows on the path and creating a serene, slightly muted light ambiance. The sunlight enhances the textures on the path and the vivid green grass.\n\nTowards the background, centered along the pathâ€™s line of sight, stands a building that resembles a modern residential structure or a small institutional building with a flat, horizontal architectural style. This building is flanked by tall trees, enhancing its secluded feel. There's a clear sky visible in the background, adding to the calm and open atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of peacefulness and simplicity, inviting the viewer to imagine walking along the path, surrounded by nature and the quiet presence of the distant building.","title":"Schmitt Elementary School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["550275","547536","553464","555215","546464","546505","557018","546460","557555","547538","557782","557024","546463","553373","546450","545588"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["path","sight","asphalt","building","peacefulness","sunlight","grass","simplicity","pathway","shrub"]}
