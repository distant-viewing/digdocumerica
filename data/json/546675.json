{"path":"546675.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside the cockpit of an aircraft. It features a man, dressed in a uniform with a badge that reads \"POLICE\" on his upper arm, sitting on the right side and facing toward the left. The man is of middle-age with a faintly visible receding hairline and dark hair. He is holding a microphone close to his mouth, likely communicating through it. His expression is focused, matching the seriousness often associated with law enforcement duties.\n\nThe interior of the aircraft shows a window on the left through which a hazy, indistinguishable landscape can be seen, indicating the aircraft is in flight. Above the window, there is a curved white ceiling of the cockpit, and myriad wires and knobs are visible, forming part of the aircraft's instrumentation and control systems. The scene conveys an essence of alertness and command, typical of a law enforcement operation or surveillance activity.","title":"Officer broadcasting traffic reports from helicopter","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546688","542671","542668","552375","556657","542576","546683","555825","548880","553786","551896","547165","545645","546663","553787","546611"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["aircraft","enforcement","law","cockpit","alertness","surveillance","seriousness","command","knob","microphone"]}
