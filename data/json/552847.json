{"path":"552847.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a forested area partially submerged in water, which appears to be a result of flooding. The scene includes a sizable water body surrounded by dense, lush green forests. In the middle of this water body, several structures, presumably houses or sheds, can be seen partially submerged. These buildings are accompanied by small boats and floating objects, possibly indicating an attempt to manage or navigate through the floodwaters. The composition of the photo shows the contrast between the natural dense greenery of the forest and the dark, still waters. The top-right corner shows a continuation of the forest, suggesting a large, expansive woodland area. The overall appearance is one of tranquility, despite the apparent natural disruption.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years. Unprecedented flooding occurred throughout the river basin. Particularly affected were the marsh area below New Orleans and the entire Atchafalaya River Basin farms under water south of Jonesville, Atchafalaya Basin area.","placename":"Alexandria (La.)","location":"Alexandria, Louisiana","nn1":["552843","552853","552438","550832","552857","552440","552842","552852","556931","556955","555728","550626","552849","552431","550749","555570"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["forest","floodwater","attempt","result","continuation","flooding","disruption","shed","corner","water"]}
