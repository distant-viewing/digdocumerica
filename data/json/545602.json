{"path":"545602.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features two young individuals, a man and a woman, standing by the roadside with a desert landscape in the background. The man, shirtless and wearing blue jeans, is holding a basket with a small plant in it. He has long, styled blonde hair and a light beard, and appears to be engaged directly with the photographer, offering a slightly bemused expression. The woman, standing beside him, is dressed in a matching bikini top and shorts. She is smiling towards the camera and holds a single plant stem with her right hand.\n\nIn the background, the arid environment is marked by sparse vegetation, rolling rocky hills, and a clear sky. A road curves gently around the scene, with a vintage station wagon parked along it. The overall setting suggests it might be in a national park or a similarly preserved natural area, likely somewhere known for its rocky terrain and desert landscapes. The sunny, clear day contributes to the warmth and casual, leisurely feel of the image.","title":"Removing live plants from the park violates federal law","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"Arches National Park, Utah","nn1":["545612","544408","544404","548306","544089","545767","557738","543027","544337","546320","551426","546312","546093","557097","543034","545596"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["desert","bikini","photographer","basket","beard","preserve","stem","wagon","warmth","roadside"]}
