{"path":"550247.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a post-flood scene filled with debris and devastation. The foreground shows a muddy, waterlogged terrain littered with refuse such as plastic bottles, branches, and assorted garbage. Puddles of water reflect the overcast sky above, implying recent or ongoing rain.\n\nA set of railroad tracks runs horizontally across the image, partially obscured by the mud and debris, leading towards a horizon where the silhouette of a person and a truck can be faintly seen. The landscape on either side of the tracks is similarly chaotic, covered in thick mud and scattered debris, which suggests the area may have experienced significant flooding.\n\nIn the background, beyond the muddy expanse and parallel to the tracks, there appears to be a water body, likely a river or lake, contributing to the sense of a water-induced disaster. Sparse vegetation is visible near the water's edge.\n\nThe overall setting is desolate and grim, painting a vivid picture of environmental disruption and the aftermath of a natural disaster.","title":"Unauthorized dumping ground on Lake Erie, north of the Easterly Water Treatment Plant, has become a breeding ground for rodents.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["555870","552829","547527","555872","550950","547661","549944","555871","547868","555852","557993","549119","543815","555544","548197","547872"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["disaster","track","mud","debris","devastation","flooding","disruption","puddle","railroad","aftermath"]}
