{"path":"555370.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an interesting array of cacti, prominently featuring a species known as the prickly pear. These cacti have thick, flat, blue-green pads that are covered in clusters of small barbed bristles called glochids, and on some pads, larger, traditional spines are visible. This beautiful scene is enriched by the bloom of a strikingly vibrant yellow flower emanating from one of the cactus pads, capturing a focal point in the image. Surrounding the flower are several unopened buds, dense and green, promising more blooms to come.\n\nThe background seems to be a dusty or slightly aged greenhouse or conservatory window, blurred and streaked with dirt or dust, which allows filtered natural light to highlight textures and hues of the cacti. The conditions suggest a controlled environment that supports the growth of these desert plants. The overall composition, with the sharp details of the cacti against the soft, dim background, creates a compelling contrast, emphasizing the resilience and isolated beauty of desert flora.","title":"Englemann prickly pear cactus growing outside a solar heated greenhouse at the University of Arizona Environmental Research Laboratory at Tucson where experiments in high intensity agriculture and aquaculture are being conducted.
