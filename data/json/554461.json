{"path":"554461.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image captures a serene natural landscape, predominantly filled with a dense coniferous forest. The foreground prominently features several tall pine trees, their dark green needles and rugged textures standing out against the scene. These trees slightly obscure but also frame the view towards a distant mountain visible in the background. The mountain appears majestic with its gentle peak somewhat shrouded by a haze, indicating either mist or distant cloud cover, suggestive of a moist, cool climate typical of such regions.\n\nBetween the rows of trees, a glimpse of a grassy area is visible, possibly a small clearing or a meadow within the forest. The overall lighting in the photograph suggests an overcast day; the sky is not visible but the diffused light enhances the richness of the green tones throughout the scene. The photograph evokes a sense of tranquility and untouched wilderness, typical of mountainous forested areas perhaps in a national park or a preserved natural area.","title":"Summit of mount marcy, New York, from lake tear of the clouds, source of the Hudson River, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543582","555110","554459","555116","550602","543569","555119","554531","555698","548025","542604","542753","554530","557019","549226","542849"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["forest","richness","meadow","mountain","needle","preserve","pine","shroud","clearing","diffuse"]}
