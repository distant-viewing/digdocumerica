{"path":"555231.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a rustic, old wooden structure, possibly a small cabin or shed, situated in a natural, forested setting. The cabin is constructed of rugged, horizontally laid logs that show signs of weathering and aging, with varying tones of brown and gray, and some parts covered with moss.\n\nOn the left side of the structure, there is a notable stone foundation or pile supporting the cabin, made of irregularly shaped and sized rocks, giving it a sturdy but primitive appearance. Adjacent to this pile of rocks is a simple wooden door, seemingly newer compared to the rest of the cabin, painted or stained in a light, natural wood color. The door is slightly ajar, suggesting either recent use or a lack of secure closure.\n\nThe roof of the cabin, though not fully visible, appears to be made of the same logs, and some small stones and forest debris can be seen resting atop, possibly to weigh down any covering material underneath. Surrounding the cabin are various foliage and the ground is covered with pine needles, leaves, and small plants, indicating the cabin is in a mostly undeveloped, woodland area. The background is darker, densely filled with trees and shadows, creating a secluded and somewhat mysterious ambiance.","title":"A root house made from old railroad trestle timbers at the Satsop Guard Station in Olympic National Timberland, Washington Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549193","554786","554436","555295","543339","543350","554438","544865","546149","549152","554556","554084","554696","545518","551111","554440"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cabin","log","stone","door","pile","rest","covering","foundation","rock","needle"]}
