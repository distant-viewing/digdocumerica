{"path":"554454.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in front of the \"Enchanted Forest of the Adirondacks,\" a theme park entrance. The architecture of the entrance is whimsical, featuring a bold pink and turquoise color scheme and decorative elements like scalloped awnings in alternating colors of yellow and white. The sign above the entrance is large and brightly colored, with \"Enchanted Forest of the Adirondacks\" written in a playful, yellow script against a blue background, capped with a pointed roof that mimics a fairytale castle.\n\nA group of people, including adults and at least one child, are gathered around the entrance. Some individuals appear to be entering or exiting through the glass doors, while others are standing or walking near the entrance. The attire of the people indicates a casual, likely vacation-oriented atmosphere, with some wearing plaid shirts, trousers, and dresses typical of mid-20th-century fashion.\n\nThe setting includes details such as neatly maintained bushes and a clear, well-maintained pavement. There's a small streetlight style post with hanging decorations or lights near the entrance adding to the whimsical feel of the place. The background shows a slightly overcast sky, hinting at a cool or temperate weather setting.","title":"Enchanted Forest tourist attraction at Old Forge, New York in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554457","543094","554456","543095","543365","545448","557654","554458","543239","545221","554699","557985","543413","552950","543223","557336"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["entrance","script","streetlight","vacation","awning","pavement","scheme","decoration","yellow","plaid"]}
