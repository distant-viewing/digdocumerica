{"path":"556196.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a highly organized and tightly packed parking lot filled with numerous cars dating from what appears to be the mid-20th century, likely the 1960s based on the vehicle designs. The cars, showcasing a variety of models, are aligned in diagonal rows across the frame, offering a view that emphasizes the uniformity and density of the parking arrangement.\n\nIn the center aisle of the lot, two men dressed in formal attire, dark suits and ties, are walking away from the camera towards the upper right section of the image. Their posture and attire suggest a business or formal context.\n\nThe surroundings of the parking lot are not clearly visible due to the tight framing focused on the cars and the men. The light and shadows on the vehicles indicate it is a bright day, contributing to the vividness of the car colors and reflective surfaces. The rows are marked by numbers, indicating an organized lot possibly used for a large company or event. The design of the vehicles, ranging from sedans to coupes, all with prominent chrome details and a mix of vibrant and muted colors, reflect typical automotive aesthetics of the era.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its rows of cars receding into the background and central human figures, creates a perspective that draws the eye along the direction the men are walking, adding a dynamic element to the orderly static nature of the parked cars.","title":"Monroe Street parking lot in Chicago holds 2,700 cars for commuters at Lake Shore Drive.
