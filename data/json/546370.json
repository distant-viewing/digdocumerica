{"path":"546370.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This image showcases a bustling city traffic scene from an elevated perspective, likely taken from an overpass or a high vantage point. The photograph captures a street packed with a variety of vehicles, primarily vintage cars in various colors and models, reminiscent of a 1960s or 1970s setting. The cars are densely lined up, indicating a traffic jam.\n\nThe road divides into multiple lanes and seems to continue into a dense urban area, as indicated by several commercial signs and the presence of buildings in the background. The setting sun casts long shadows and gives a warm tone to the light, suggesting that this is either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nProminently, the traffic includes multiple lanes filled with cars waiting in line, while a few vehicles are moving in an adjacent lane. The image captures a mix of personal and commercial vehicles, with open spaces visible between some cars and others tightly packed.\n\nThe surrounding area features grassy medians separating the opposite lanes of traffic. Power lines and utility poles run alongside the road, enhancing the urban feel of the photograph. The skyline includes low-rise commercial buildings, cluttered with billboards and business signage, typical of a suburban or semi-urban setup.","title":"5. P.m.
