{"path":"556539.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a traditional, American rural scene with a group of people standing in front of a classic weatherboard house. The house is moderately aged with a covered front porch and a simple, white door. The roof appears to be metal and there is a brick chimney on one side.\n\nTo the left, there is an old red Chevrolet pickup truck with the text \"UMWA TODAY\" visible on a banner attached to the side. Surrounding the truck and standing on grassy terrain, there is a group of seven children of varying ages and one adult male. The children include two boys and five girls, all dressed in casual, colorful clothing appropriate for the time period (likely 1970s to 1980s based on the style and condition of the truck).\n\nThe children's expressions range from smiles to a more neutral, reserved demeanor. The adult male, standing by the truck, is wearing a casual sleeveless shirt and shorts, indicating a warm weather setting.\n\nIn the background, beyond the house and the group, are densely wooded hills typical of a mountainous area. In the middle ground but slightly obscured and to the far right, infrastructure possibly indicating a small industrial facility or similar installations can be seen nestled in the valley. The overall atmosphere suggests a modest, community-oriented lifestyle with an emphasis on family and outdoor life.","title":"Photograph of the Jerry Rainey family","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556542","556332","556454","557667","557948","551116","557671","553097","553498","557361","556439","545398","548303","546962","544329","551001"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["truck","male","child","house","group","appropriate","adult","banner","pickup","lifestyle"]}
