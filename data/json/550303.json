{"path":"550303.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a large body of water, possibly a lake or a calm sea. The dominant color theme is a warm spectrum of oranges and dark silhouettes, reflecting the last rays of the sun. In the background, there is a visibly dense line of trees that mark the distant shoreline, stretching horizontally and partially shadowed, which reinforces the tranquility of the setting sun.\n\nIn the forefront, activities and various silhouetted figures are spread across the view. On the right, there is a speedboat moving leftward; its wake creates a textured pattern on the water surface. Behind the boat, another water trail hints at past movement, possibly from another boat. \n\nIn the middle and closer to the lower section of the image, five individuals are seen standing or walking along a thin line, likely a submerged sandbar or a shallow area of the water. These figures are engaging in different leisure activities â€“ two of them seem to have fishing poles, while others appear to be strolling or standing. The silhouettes of these individuals are dark against the shimmering water, which is dappled with reflections of the sky.\n\nOverall, the composition and the warm tones of this photograph evoke a sense of peacefulness and leisure, typical of a relaxing evening by the water.","title":"Lake Erie at sunset.
