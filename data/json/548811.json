{"path":"548811.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph shows a serene natural landscape featuring a canal or river bordered by rocky shores. The body of water extends diagonally from the foreground to the midground on the left side, leading the viewer's eye towards the background.\n\nThe shoreline is rocky and interspersed with patches of grass and occasional small plants. The rocks range in size from small pebbles to medium-sized stones, covering most of the ground visible in the foreground and part of the midground. The terrain appears arid and rough, suggestive of a dry climate or a location where water levels have receded.\n\nOn the opposite side of the canal, there is a tree line consisting of bushy, medium-height trees and sparse undergrowth. The trees have a lush green appearance, contrasting with the stark whiteness of the rocky shoreline.\n\nThe sky is bright and mostly clear, with a few sparse clouds, which suggests a sunny day. The overall lighting in the photograph enhances the natural tones of the water and the landscape, giving it a tranquil and somewhat stark aesthetic. The absence of any human presence or man-made structures focuses the viewerâ€™s attention on the natural elements and the tranquility of the scene.","title":"Land development at Key Largo, near the northern tip of the Florida Keys. A common practice among waterfront developers is to dig canals for shorefront property lots, but leave small \"land plugs\" blocking the canals from the ocean. Accessways opening to the sea require state permits, and these are hard to obtain.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543789","542583","543793","550750","542653","552916","550656","550844","552905","553135","545068","554527","552900","550486","545008","543652"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["canal","midground","shoreline","pebble","undergrowth","recede","viewer","absence","climate","height"]}
