{"path":"553073.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque rural landscape set against a dramatic mountain backdrop. In the foreground, a large green field, possibly used for farming or livestock, stretches across the frame. This field is neatly divided by a white fence that runs across the middle portion of the image, adding a structured element to the natural setting.\n\nA cluster of farm buildings, including barns and stables, is located toward the left of the field. These buildings are uniformly low-rise and feature reddish roofs, which contrast with their white walls, harmonizing with the natural color palette of the scene. There are scattered groups of black cattle grazing or resting near the buildings, adding a lively element to the pastoral scene.\n\nBeyond the fence and the farmland, the terrain ascends into rolling hills covered with shrubs and sparse vegetation, presenting various shades of green and brown. These hills serve as the middle ground in the composition, leading the viewer's eye toward the spectacular mountains in the background.\n\nThe mountains in the distance are covered with snow, suggesting a late spring or early summer timeframe, depending on the regional climate. The peaks are jagged and majestic, towering over the scene with their white snow caps contrasting starkly with the blue sky above. The overall composition is well-balanced, with natural layers of color and texture that draw the eye from the manicured farmland in the foreground to the wild, imposing peaks in the background. The scene is a classic representation of rural life set against the timeless beauty of nature's high-altitude landscapes.\n","title":"Uncompahgre river valley.  (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
