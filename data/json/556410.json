{"path":"556410.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a bird's-eye view of a man walking alongside a train on industrial tracks. The focus is on a relatively older model locomotive, painted a muted blue-gray color, with various mechanical and structural details visible, such as vents, grilles, and the cab. The train is marked with the number \"5714\" emblazoned on both the side and back. It appears to be parked, as there are no signs of movement or activity typically associated with an operating train.\n\nThe man walking beside the train is dressed in dark, work-appropriate attire, including a cap, and holds what seems to be a toolkit or lunch box. The area around the train is strewn with industrial debris, including what looks like disassembled or discarded parts and machinery, signaling an environment dedicated to heavy operation or maintenance work.\n\nThe ground is a mixture of gravel and patches of dirt, typical of rail yards or industrial areas. Two additional sets of tracks are visible next to the main one on which the train sits, indicating a setting that is used for heavy and possibly frequent rail movement. The image suggests a cool, overcast day, contributing to the somber, work-focused atmosphere of the setting.","title":"Trainman heading for an engine in the rail yards of Danville, West Virginia, near Charleston.
