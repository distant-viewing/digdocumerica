{"path":"554907.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures two women seemingly in an intimate moment, sharing a kiss in a serene, natural setting. The woman on the left has medium-length dark blonde hair styled in braids and is wearing a plaid shirt. She appears calm with her eyes closed. The woman on the right has long, flowing blonde hair, partially styled with what appears to be a blue hairband, and is wearing hoop earrings. Her facial expression is not visible, but she seems to be engaging closely with the other woman.\n\nThe background of the photograph features soft-focus trees and a hint of a water body, suggesting the setting might be near a lake or a river. The greenery and blurred backdrop create a tranquil and secluded environment. This scene is framed with natural light and shadows hinting at either early morning or late afternoon, accentuating the intimacy and quietude of the moment captured between the two women.","title":"Two girls smoking pot during an outing in Cedar Woods near Leakey, Texas, (taken with permission) one of nine pictures, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554908","554911","554909","554904","554902","554906","554900","551409","554901","551334","554913","553164","556700","551436","548465","548833"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["woman","braid","hoop","earring","intimacy","quietude","hair","plaid","length","moment"]}
