{"path":"549144.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a dragonfly perched delicately on a green blade of grass. The dragonfly, positioned slightly off-center to the right in the image, has a translucent and intricately veined pair of wings that catch the light, highlighting patterns on their surface. Its body appears slender and elongate, suggesting agility and lightness.\n\nThe dragonfly is surrounded by a dense thicket of similar grass blades, suggesting a lush, possibly wetland environment. The blades of grass are predominantly vertical, with varying shades of green, and some display subtle brownish tones at their tips and bases, possibly indicating their natural lifecycle or water level changes.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, a mixture of green and blue hues, giving the hint of a water body nearby or a clear sky slightly obscured by the verdant foreground. This soft focus helps to isolate the dragonfly as the central subject of the photograph, drawing the viewerâ€™s attention directly to it.\n\nOverall, the composition and focus of the photograph emphasize the delicate beauty and fragile appearance of the dragonfly, set against a natural, serene backdrop that suggests a peaceful habitat.","title":"Dragonfly on marsh grass near sarpy basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["555064","557585","544619","544479","543564","544280","553872","544553","543603","550471","553853","544517","544603","544514","557544","544618"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["blade","grass","elongate","lifecycle","thicket","basis","tip","wing","perch","isolate"]}
