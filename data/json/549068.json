{"path":"549068.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph prominently features a sturdy stone bridge arching over a body of water. The bridge, with an old-fashioned architectural design, is adorned with lamp posts and several flags fluttering in the breeze. The bridge spans across the frame with multiple arches visible, allowing glimpses of a faded landscape in the background. Hills and open sky can be seen in the distance behind the bridge.\n\nIn the foreground, a focus point is a grouping of three heavy, wooden pilings tied together with thick, coiled ropes. The wood's textures are highlighted, showing weathered surfaces and worn edges. The turquoise-green water surrounding these pilings adds a vibrant contrast while small waves lap gently against the wood. The image captures the tranquil interaction between human-made structures and natural elements, under what appears to be cloudy or overcast lighting conditions.","title":"London Bridge--brought from London to Lake Havasu City in 1971","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548207","546810","548064","552846","546870","557959","552052","543087","549469","547669","543313","545227","552247","551527","544542","552598"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","piling","grouping","wood","breeze","arch","rope","lamp","flag","post"]}
