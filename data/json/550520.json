{"path":"550520.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a remote industrial facility situated in a lush, sprawling wilderness. The central feature is a compound consisting of several large, orderly arranged buildings, some of which are possibly warehouses or barracks given their uniform appearance. Adjacent to this central area, there are other installations that include smaller structures possibly for storage or specialized equipment.\n\nA network of dirt roads connects different parts of the facility and extends to a prominent, long runway that suggests this installation accommodates air transport. To the immediate north of the central compound is a large, dark, rectangular pond, which could be a man-made feature related to the facilityâ€™s operations.\n\nSurrounding the facility are wide river networks which meander through the landscape forming multiple branches and convergences, emphasizing the isolated nature of this location amid wild terrain. The overall backdrop is dominated by dense green forest, indicating that the area is either mountainous or a part of a flat but vast wilderness area. The untouched appearance of the surrounding environment, combined with the structured and developed nature of the compound, creates a stark contrast between civilization and nature.","title":"Dietrich camp at mile 198.
