{"path":"549779.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy industrial scene, likely within a depot or storage facility for vehicles. The focal point is a large, bright yellow snow removal vehicle, prominently displayed in the foreground to the left side of the image. It features a massive plow mounted in front, suggesting its use in clearing snow.\n\nTo the right of this snow removal vehicle, several other vehicles are visible. These include a yellow cab-over-engine truck and a red fire engine, both parked next to an open garage bay. Additionally, a black sedan is seen in the center, positioned closer to the viewer than the larger trucks.\n\nThe background features a large building with a dark, metallic exterior and visible signs of wear. A portion of the building has an arched roof, and large doors under which the trucks are parked are open, displaying a dimly-lit interior. A prominent feature on the building's facade is a star emblem, and above this, partly obscured lettering that seems to read \"D R Y S T D.\"\n\nThe setting suggests this is a maintenance or storage facility related to vehicle operations, possibly for a municipality or a large complex. The context implies readiness for utility tasks, particularly snow clearance. The sky is clear blue, indicating fair weather, which presents a contrast to the readiness for snow removal by the vehicles.","title":"Garbage truck at the 91st Street Marine Transfer Station (MTS).
