{"path":"553156.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures a solitary young woman sitting outdoors. She is positioned on what appears to be a concrete ledge or wall. The woman, with long, flowing dark hair and wearing glasses, is dressed casually in a light-colored, button-up shirt and blue jeans. She is resting her chin on her hands, which are clasped together, conveying a contemplative or pensive mood.\n\nBeside her, there is a small red handbag and a piece of patterned fabric, possibly a skirt or a scarf, resting on the ledge. Her posture and the placement of her items suggest she might be taking a break or is deep in thought.\n\nThe background is lush with greenery; dense foliage from trees fills the scene behind her, indicating that the setting is likely in a park-like or garden environment, perhaps within a university campus or similar institution, given the presence of a building partially visible through the trees. The abundance of green leaves suggests it might be late spring or summer.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a serene, introspective moment, capturing the woman in a private instance of reflection or relaxation amidst a natural, tranquil setting.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: looking down at Fountain Square from the overhead walkway.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551448","543835","546474","546555","553165","550940","546566","544742","551458","553534","552720","557842","552961","556414","548232","557146"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["ledge","woman","instance","campus","institution","chin","handbag","abundance","scarf","placement"]}
