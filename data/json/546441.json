{"path":"546441.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful suburban scene, featuring a large, traditional two-story house painted in white, with a spacious wrap-around porch. The house is partially obscured by a robust tree with sunlight filtering through, casting dappled shadows on the lush green lawn in front. A person in a pink top, standing on the grass in the foreground, appears to be gazing down, possibly at a small feature on the ground or engaging in a subtle outdoor activity. The setting suggests a quiet, residential area, reflective of a typical small-town atmosphere. The warm lighting indicates that the photo was likely taken in the late afternoon, producing long shadows and a serene ambiance. Various windows on the house are visible, some curtained, enhancing the homeâ€™s quaint and lived-in feel. Multicolored blooms and other greenery decorate the porch, adding touches of nature and homeliness to the scene.","title":"Large old home at the corner of franklin and 11th streets","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["557094","554697","550121","549279","556426","546435","550125","546439","556433","557068","556448","557668","548664","556950","548295","545041"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","porch","produce","wrap","curtain","bloom","decorate","live","lawn","gaze"]}
