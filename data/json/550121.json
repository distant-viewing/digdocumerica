{"path":"550121.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a suburban scene with a series of residential houses along a sidewalk. The primary house in the foreground has a traditional architectural style distinguished by a peaked roof, wooden siding, and ornate detailing around the windows and under the porch roof. The house is painted in muted, earthy tones with different sections highlighted in contrasting dark and light colors, including red accents near the entryway. The first floor includes a bordered, spacious porch adorned with railings and several pillars that support the roof.\n\nThe sidewalk runs parallel to the front of the houses and is bordered by a low white picket fence that leads the view down the street. Two individuals, possibly children, are walking along the sidewalk towards the direction of the photographer. There is minimal activity in the scene, implying a quiet, serene neighborhood setting.\n\nThe overall light in the photograph suggests it was taken in direct sunlight based on the harsh shadows cast by the porch and trees along the street. The background is softened by an abundance of trees providing dense green foliage, adding a bucolic, shaded quality to the street scene. This contributes to a feeling of tranquility and a well-established, possibly historical neighborhood.","title":"Renovated homes on jay street--part of Ohio city area renewal project","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["556433","556950","556601","547433","546441","557094","556436","547938","558157","550117","551102","557405","556448","557641","550124","547946"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","sidewalk","house","neighborhood","street","roof","picket","entryway","distinguished","peaked"]}
