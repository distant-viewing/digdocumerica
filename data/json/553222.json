{"path":"553222.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively outdoor scene in an urban setting. On the right side, a young woman is seated on a stone ledge, deeply engrossed in reading a book. She appears relaxed, sporting a casual summer outfit consisting of a white blouse, dark shorts, and sandals. Her legs are crossed, and she holds the book comfortably in front of her.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there are three older men seated on another stone ledge under the shade provided by a line of trees. The men are variously dressed in coats and pants, and they seem to be engaged in conversation while observing their surroundings.\n\nIn the foreground, a bird, possibly a pigeon, walks across a patterned paving. The ground features a wave-like design which adds a visual texture to the scene. Around these main activities, the background shows a glimpse of the city atmosphere, characterized by tall buildings and shaded alcoves that hint at a plaza or a similarly semi-private outdoor area. \n\nThe setting suggests a public area, likely part of a business district given the sign 'S. SMITH INC.' visible in the shadowed background behind the men. The scene captures a typical urban moment where people from different walks of life are going about their day, either engrossed in personal leisure or engaging in light social interactions.","title":"Girl with book and bench-sitters in Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553218","551434","551481","551472","553158","551829","553187","546474","556776","551815","551823","551793","556775","544960","550751","551646"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["ledge","book","paving","stone","sandal","walk","plaza","district","man","bird"]}
