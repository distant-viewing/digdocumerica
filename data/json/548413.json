{"path":"548413.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view depicting a lengthy bridge and highway system extending over a large body of water, likely a river or bay. On the right side of the image, the bridge begins or ends at the shore and extends diagonally across the frame, curving slightly as it spans the water. The bridge is constructed with multiple arches under which the water is visible, reflecting sunlight.\n\nBelow the bridge, extending horizontally across the image, is a multi-lane highway bustling with cars. This highway is paralleled by lines of trees and possibly some small buildings or structures. Traffic on the highway appears dense, suggesting it might be during peak hours.\n\nThe quality and color of the image suggest it might have been taken during the later part of the 20th century. The scene is enveloped in a haze, possibly due to weather conditions or the photograph's age, adding a nostalgic or vintage look. The natural and man-made elements combine to show a busy, functional aspect of city infrastructure and transport.","title":"Entrance to the tappan zee bridge near White Plains","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548401","547703","546724","549878","553846","548415","549861","546588","558051","546569","549469","548341","552846","551186","558049","548418"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["highway","bridge","nostalgic","extend","begin","envelo","reflec","bay","bustling","hour"]}
