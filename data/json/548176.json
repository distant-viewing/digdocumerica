{"path":"548176.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a prominently displayed wooden sign placed in the foreground, painted with the message \"SORRY NO GAS\" in red lettering. The sign appears makeshift, crafted from a light-colored wood and standing on what seems to be a roadside or pavement. The background is slightly out of focus, illustrating a typical street scene with cars driving along the road and traffic lights visible in the distance. Trees line the edge of the street, contributing to a suburban setting. It seems to be overcast or dusk given a little subdued lighting, emphasizing the sign's message as possibly related to a time of fuel shortage or a similar crisis. Overall, the composition communicates a clear message regarding the unavailability of gasoline, positioned in a common roadway environment where such a sign would be relevant.","title":"Signs like this have begun to appear frequently in the Portland area.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555416","555413","548169","548171","555519","555414","548174","555464","555411","548173","548175","555518","555452","548053","555494","555423"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["message","sign","crisis","shortage","regard","gasoline","fuel","street","communicate","pavement"]}
