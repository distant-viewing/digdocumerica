{"path":"543272.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures two sea lions on a rocky shoreline. The sea lions are in close proximity to each other, with one appearing to look upwards, basking in sunlight while the other rests its head against the first sea lion's back. The sea lions' fur varies in color from dark brown to slightly lighter shades. They are positioned on a concrete ledge with jagged rocks visible behind them.\n\nThe background shows a calm body of water that stretches into the distance, reflecting light and surrounded by an uneven, rocky landscape. The lighting in the photo is natural, highlighting the glossy texture of the sea lionsâ€™ fur and creating a serene atmosphere. This setting suggests a peaceful moment in a natural habitat, possibly near a coast or on an island where these animals are commonly found.","title":"Partners","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543275","543274","543280","553768","543281","543311","543139","543492","549471","543268","543204","543263","547486","545133","543068","543060"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sea","fur","ledge","coast","island","habitat","find","proximity","animal","shoreline"]}
