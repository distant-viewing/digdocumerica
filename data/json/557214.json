{"path":"557214.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph encapsulates an industrial scene dominated by large volumes of smoke or steam rising from a complex of structures. The entire image appears to be tinted with a bluish, slightly underexposed hue, creating a somber and intense atmosphere.\n\nIn the forefront are various industrial buildings and equipment, including smokestacks, pipes, and metal frameworks that silhouette against the smoke-cloaked sky. The towering chimneys discharge enormous plumes of white and gray smoke that blend into a clouded backdrop.\n\nThe scene appears devoid of any human presence and is instead focused on the mechanical and the environmental. The buildings are constructed of metal and possibly concrete, suggesting heavy industrial use, possibly a refinery or manufacturing plant. The sky and surroundings are obscured by the dense smoke, hinting at an environment impacted by industrial activity.\n\nTo the right, faint outlines of bare tree branches suggest this photograph might have been taken from behind a barrier or through sparse vegetation, adding a natural element that contrasts sharply with the industrial activity. The rows of parked cars at the bottom of the frame provide a sense of scale, emphasizing the grandiosity of the industrial operations relative to everyday life.","title":"White plume containing many pollutants is emitted from a quenching tower at a coke plant owned by the United States Steel Corporation.
