{"path":"553281.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a contemplative scene, combining elements of urban life with public art. The central figure in the image is a young man seated against the pedestal of a bronze sculpture, which depicts a woman in a dynamic pose, suggesting movement or dance. The man is dressed in a casual denim jacket and appears lost in thought, his hand supporting his chin while the other rests on his knee.\n\nThey are situated next to a fountain, evidenced by jets of water visible in the background, contributing to an effect of soothing white noise and a serene atmosphere likely providing a respite from the hustle of city life. The lighting in the photograph casts both the sculpture and the man in partial silhouette, accentuating the texture and flow of the water while lending an air of introspection and isolation to the man despite being in a public space.\n\nThe background is blurred but hints at a lush, possibly tree-filled park setting or a verdant public square, adding a touch of nature and tranquility to the urban environment. The overall composition evokes themes of contemplation and the interaction of history, art, and modern life in public spaces.","title":"At the Tyler Davidson Fountain, in Fountain Square downtown Cincinnati's popular public plaza, a young man listens to the radio with one ear, play of the water with the other.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551468","551858","553163","551860","550748","552736","552701","546512","546520","553207","553181","553224","551647","549382","551480","552700"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["sculpture","art","noise","respite","bronze","pedestal","dance","chin","introspection","man"]}
