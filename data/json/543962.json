{"path":"543962.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene featuring a traditional riverboat on a vast body of water during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the soft, warm lighting that bathes the scene. The riverboat, prominently positioned in the center of the frame, is a large, multi-deck vessel characterized by its classic design with multiple levels and ornate architectural details, including several chimneys or smokestacks.\n\nThe boat is white with decorative trim, and it sports a festive look, possibly adorned with lights or reflective materials, as suggested by the hints of shimmer visible on its structure. The water is calm, showing slight ripples which could be from the movement of the boat or a gentle breeze. In the background, the opposite shore is visible but appears somewhat muted and obscured due to the atmospheric conditions and the dimming light, offering a silhouette of tree-lined banks.\n\nThe photograph exudes a serene and somewhat nostalgic quality, evoking the elegance of bygone eras of river travel. The color tones are rich yet subdued, with dominant hues of purples and blues merging seamlessly with the rose-tinted sky, creating a tranquil and slightly melancholic atmosphere. The composition is balanced, with the riverboat centrally placed, drawing the viewer's eye as the focal point against the vast, softly textured backdrop of water and sky.","title":"Paddlewheel steamboat on the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543963","543955","543967","543971","553815","543959","551222","551313","551215","543972","545736","551214","550825","551147","545917","550773"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["riverboat","rose","shimmer","elegance","boat","breeze","trim","sunrise","purple","travel"]}
