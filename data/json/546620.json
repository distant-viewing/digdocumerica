{"path":"546620.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a busy intersection with multiple lanes merging and branching off. A central circular grassy island serves as a conduit for traffic flow, with surrounding roads leading in various directions.\n\nThe scene is populated with a number of vehicles, mostly cars, dating from around the 1970s or 1980s based on their designs. These vehicles vary in color and are in motion, as evident from their slightly blurred appearances, suggesting a snapshot during moderate traffic.\n\nThe surroundings of the intersections feature patches of greenery, mostly well-maintained grass areas with a few trees. On the left side of the photo, a large strip of green lawn parallels the road, separated by a utility pole line that cuts vertically down that part of the image. Also on the left are parking areas filled with cars, adjacent to the road. The upper right and lower parts of the photograph show additional parking space set against a backdrop of dense foliage.\n\nThis photograph captures a midday routine in a suburban or semi-urban area, characterized by moderate vehicle activity and orderly infrastructure. The high vantage point gives a comprehensive overview of the traffic flow and urban planning of the intersection and its immediate areas.","title":"In front of National Institutes of Health, six cars try to feed into evening traffic on Rt. 355 (Rockville Pike, extension of Wisconsin Avenue)","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546712","548342","546730","548092","547776","546718","546714","544642","546723","547770","546697","548411","548332","546612","548420","549919"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["intersection","traffic","parking","road","vehicle","flow","conduit","overview","parallel","1980"]}
