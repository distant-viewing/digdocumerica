{"path":"553374.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph features the interior of a large cylindrical structure, possibly a pipe or tunnel. The predominant elements include a wooden ladder propped along one side, stretching upwards towards a small opening or light source near the top of the cylinder. The structure itself appears robust but shows signs of wear, such as scuffs and stains on its inner surface.\n\nInside the cylinder, there are several markings and inscriptions that seem to have been left by previous visitors or workers, including texts and graffiti-like symbols that are vaguely visible on the walls. The composition emphasizes depth, as the perspective draws the viewer's eye towards the light at the circular opening, suggesting a point of exit or entrance.\n\nThe lighting in the image is rather dim, with light coming predominantly from the opening at the top, illuminating parts of the ladder and casting the rest of the cylinder in relative darkness. This creates a dramatic and somewhat mysterious atmosphere, focusing attention on the textures of the cylinder's surface and the form of the ladderâ€”a stark, solitary object in this enclosed space.","title":"Water control facilities are being built at Nashua jointly assisted by the epa water quality office and the New Hampshire water supply and pollution control commission","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["556398","556385","544937","543997","556519","543170","543258","552493","557391","557324","544818","555169","555332","556327","546757","557976"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cylinder","ladder","opening","inscription","prop","tunnel","graffiti","exit","symbol","stain"]}
