{"path":"542928.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph showcases a towering, massive tree trunk, likely that of a giant sequoia or a redwood, which dominates the frame with its rugged, textured bark. The tree stands tall against a misty and obscure background, creating an ethereal and mysterious ambiance. To the left of the large trunk, a much younger, slimmer tree is visible, accentuating the massive scale of the oldest tree. The foreground includes some small floral plants, and the overarching mood is serene and foggy, suggesting this photo was taken in a dense, misty forest, possibly during the early morning or on a foggy day. Further in the background, beyond the dense fog, faint outlines of other tree trunks are barely visible, enhancing the depth and the secluded feel of an expansive old-growth forest. The general atmosphere is quiet and ancient, evoking a sense of isolation and the majesty of nature.","title":"Burnt trunk of giant redwood and new young tree","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554977","542575","554966","557621","554995","554999","543442","542748","554967","542745","543447","542845","550792","545278","542569","554969"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trunk","redwood","tree","majesty","fog","bark","growth","accentuate","outline","isolation"]}
