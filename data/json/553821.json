{"path":"553821.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic cityscape under an overcast sky. The image features two distinct sections of a city, separated by a body of water, under moodily lit conditions. On the left side of the image, a cluster of high-rise buildings, presumably a downtown area, stands against darker clouds, giving a slightly ominous feel. The tallest buildings are silhouetted against the overcast sky. The right side displays a broader view of a city extending into the distance, with numerous lower buildings that suggest a residential or mixed-use area. Notably, a larger river is visible, and in the distance, there are faint silhouettes of bridges connecting different parts of the city.\n\nThe lighting in the image is dim and the sky features a gradient from darker clouds at the top to a slightly lighter horizon line, suggesting either an early morning or late evening time. This atmospheric condition contributes to the subdued and somewhat somber tone of the photograph. The disparate lighting between the two sections of the cities suggests either the lingering effects of sunset or the onset of stormy weather. The overall composition and the interplay between natural and urban elements make this a compelling view of an urban landscape under dynamic weather conditions.","title":"Manhattan skyline, see from a helicopter over Brooklyn (from the sites exhibition.
