{"path":"554129.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene in a seaside landscape. In the foreground, there is a grassy hilltop with various animals and a rider. Three cattle – two black and one with prominent white markings – are scattered across the hill, seemingly grazing or looking around. To the right, a person mounted on a horse appears to be managing or herding two dogs that are in motion near the horse’s feet.\n\nThe background offers a view of a shimmering sea that meets the horizon under a clear blue sky, suggesting that the photo may have been taken on a bright, sunny day. This open landscape, combined with the involvement of livestock, a horse rider, and dogs, implies that this may either be a farming activity or a routine check on the animals. The natural setting provides a serene atmosphere, and the image conveys a sense of calm and routine rural life.","title":"Moving cattle in the rich grazing lands of the agricultural district","placename":"Pahala (Hawaii)","location":"Pahala, Hawaii","nn1":["554128","554885","553105","552565","553100","552698","542627","552562","542622","546102","550833","548954","552566","542626","549027","543776"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["horse","rider","dog","animal","herd","hilltop","cattle","seaside","graze","livestock"]}
