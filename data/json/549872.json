{"path":"549872.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant and bustling street scene, likely from the mid-20th century based on the style and models of vehicles visible. The image is set in an urban environment, possibly in a downtown or main street area, characterized by dense traffic and a variety of commercial signs.\n\nThe street is lined with numerous classic cars indicative of the 1960s or 1970s era, evident from their distinctive designs such as elongated bodies and chrome detailing. The vehicles are mostly sedans and are seen in a variety of colors including white, black, blue, yellow, and green.\n\nOn the left side of the image, theater marquees dominate the scene. They are adorned with bright, bold neon signs and feature names and titles suggesting they are cinemas or performance theaters; titles like \"Steve McQueen in The Reivers\" are visible. The signs are rich in detail and light, suggesting a lively cultural scene and possibly a premiere or special showing given the prominence of the advertisement.\n\nThe sidewalks are crowded with pedestrians, adding to the lively feel of the area. People appear engaged in typical city activities, likely walking or gathered in groups, though individual actions are not distinctly visible due to the distance and focus of the photograph.\n\nThe background shows tall buildings, typical of an urban cityscape. The architecture includes large billboards and signage extending above street level, contributing to the commercial and busy atmosphere of the setting.\n\nOverall, this photograph offers a glimpse into city life at a specific historical period, highlighted by the automotive and architectural styles, as well as the social and cultural dynamics evident through the clustered traffic and active street life.","title":"In the heart of midtown Manhattan--42nd street between 7th and 8th avenues","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554297","545216","551135","550139","549882","548388","556724","556709","542586","548369","551125","546626","556718","547369","551324","554310"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["theater","street","title","elongate","traffic","sign","prominence","neon","variety","billboard"]}
