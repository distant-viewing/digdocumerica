{"path":"543323.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph displays a vivid and somewhat unusual scene on a roadside. The focus is on four individuals engaged in different activities involving a \"ROAD WORK AHEAD\" sign.\n\nStarting from the right of the image, there are two young girls walking past the sign. They both appear to be wearing school uniforms involving skirts, sweaters, and dark shoes. They have long hair and are looking forward, seemingly uninvolved with the action happening to their left.\n\nIn the center and left of the image is where a more curious activity is taking place. A person, distinctively dressed in a long, bright orange-red cloak and patterned pants, is interacting with the yellow road sign. They are in a dynamic posture, with one arm raised towards or perhaps even attaching something to the top of the sign, while the other arm is hidden from view, possibly supporting their activity.\n\nThe background presents a rural setting, characterized by a grassy field and distant trees, bordered by a wire fence running parallel to the road. It appears to be a sunny day, as indicated by the shadows cast on the road and the brightness of the colors in the scene.\n\nThe composition of the image, with vivid colors, action-oriented poses, and the juxtaposition of routine and unusual elements, creates a striking visual narrative. The attire of the person at the sign contrasts sharply with the utilitarian nature of the road work sign and the casual appearance of the passing girls, suggesting a playful or performative element in an otherwise ordinary setting.","title":"Keep amercia beautiful day, april 29, 1972.
