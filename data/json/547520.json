{"path":"547520.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted wetland area strewn with a significant amount of garbage and debris. The foreground shows a mix of discarded items submerged in water and tangled among the reeds. These items include bits of plastic, papers, a tire, containers, and fragments of unidentifiable material, reflecting a variety of colors but mostly subdued earth tones and blues stained with mud and water.\n\nThe midground of the image allows a view of dense aquatic plants, primarily tall reeds that seem to be thriving despite the polluted environment, extending towards the horizon. The background displays an open sky with no clouds and a flat landscape, suggesting a wide and open wetland area. A remote building or structure can faintly be seen in the far background, indicating some human presence or activity nearby, though it appears quite minimal.\n\nThis image captures a strong contrast between natural beauty and human neglect, highlighting environmental issues like pollution and the challenge of maintaining natural habitats in the face of human impact. The overall mood evoked is one of negligence and a call to awareness about environmental protection and stewardship.","title":"Middletown dump meets the salt marsh","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547521","547512","547516","550812","547844","547524","547907","551440","547517","547525","550352","552811","550800","551441","544813","544647"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["reed","wetland","awareness","item","protection","fragment","challenge","mud","garbage","plastic"]}
