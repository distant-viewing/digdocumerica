{"path":"545626.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image depicts a breathtaking aerial view of a large-scale landscape, primarily characterized by rugged terrain and a series of expansive water storage ponds. The foreground features a sharply defined cliff edge, providing a dramatic contrast with the vast, open scenery. The land is largely arid, with rocky surfaces and minimal vegetation accentuating the geological features.\n\nDominating the center and extending to the background is a winding river, which curves elegantly through the terrain. Alongside the river, multiple large, rectangular ponds filled with water are visible, arranged in a pattern that suggests they are part of a managed aquaculture or water treatment facility.\n\nThe landscape is a mixture of earthy tones—browns, reds, and muted greens—giving it an almost otherworldly appearance. The overall setting suggests a remote location, possibly in a desert or semi-desert region known for its stark natural beauty and significant geological formations.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is soft, indicating either early morning or late afternoon, as evidenced by the long shadows and the gentle, diffused light that enhances the textures of the landscape. One can also observe a slight haze that softens distant features, adding depth to the view and highlighting the expansiveness of the scene. The photograph captures the blend of natural beauty and human intervention in a delicate ecosystem.","title":"Sulphur company's potash division plant","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544063","550393","544393","552548","545329","548974","550397","544155","544752","555845","555705","544744","545633","555860","543767","543697"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["pond","aquaculture","expansiveness","treatment","intervention","soften","know","river","terrain","mixture"]}
