{"path":"547002.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts two carousel horses suspended on a merry-go-round, likely captured in motion or between rides. The foreground features a dark horse in rich colors of black, blue, gold, and red, with its head thrown back in a dynamic pose, mouth open as if in mid-neigh. Its eyes are vividly defined, and its mane flows back gracefully.\n\nBehind it, partially obscured, is a second horse painted primarily in white with red and blue accents along the saddle and bridle. This horse also has an open mouth, displaying a playful expression. Both horses have a traditional carnival aesthetic with exaggerated features and vibrant colors.\n\nIn the background, beyond the perimeter of the merry-go-round, thereâ€™s a grassy area and a white building with classical architectural features such as columns. The sky above is a clear blue with a few scattered clouds, suggesting a pleasant day.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image invokes a sense of nostalgic joy and playfulness typically associated with fairgrounds or amusement parks. The focus and framing of the horses against a simple backdrop emphasize their ornate details and the whimsical spirit of the setting.","title":"Merry-go-round at an amusement park on St. Simon's Island","placename":"Brunswick (Ga.)","location":"Brunswick, Georgia","nn1":["543213","547278","549583","542951","549711","551229","542972","543678","554010","545894","553116","543694","542619","557988","552671","542622"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["horse","mouth","carnival","bridle","mane","saddle","playfulness","spirit","amusement","round"]}
