{"path":"553573.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a charred forest setting where a burned tree prominently features a white, round sign attached around it. The sign bears the logo of the USDA Forest Service at the top, followed by text that reads \"STREAMSIDE AREA. TRACTORS PROHIBITED BEHIND THIS SIGN.\" The background reveals more of the forest's devastating condition, with numerous skeletal, blackened tree trunks standing stark against a bright sky. The ground is covered with what appears to be ashes and scattered debris, suggesting a recent forest fire. The overall scene is somber, highlighting the aftermath of a severe natural disaster and the efforts to protect sensitive areas from further damage.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain range near Sonora.
