{"path":"557836.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This image depicts an outdoor scene at the \"Norwood Safety Lane,\" which appears to be a vehicle inspection or service station. There are two classic cars in the scene, one black coupe in the immediate foreground exiting or entering the service bay, and another car partially seen on the right edge of the image.\n\nThe building itself has a rustic charm with its brick construction, traditional window framing, and arched features. The entrance has a large garage-style door that is open and a standard door beside a sign announcing the “Norwood Safety Lane.”\n\nThree men are visible in the photograph; two are interacting near the open garage door, possibly discussing something related to the vehicle or service, while the third man walks along the right side of the image, carrying what appears to be a bag or a briefcase. The setting includes clear skies and what seems like a warm, sunny day, casting shadows on the ground and highlighting the structure and people within the scene.\nThe peripheral environment includes utility lines overhead and residential houses in the backdrop behind the tree-line, suggesting the station is in or near a residential area.","title":"Norwood, Ohio, auto emission inspection station, part of a Hamilton County system in which all light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must be certified annually. Vehicles are attached to an exhaust analyzer that gives readings for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.
