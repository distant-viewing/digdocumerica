{"path":"551892.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures two people and a dog in a subway station. The older man, with graying hair and stubble, is dressed casually in a light blue short-sleeve shirt and dark trousers. He is holding a rope-like leash attached to a large, black and white dog, possibly a Basset Hound, which stands in front of him. Next to him, a woman, viewed from the side, is dressed in a dark knee-length skirt and a lighter top, carrying a large, light-colored handbag and wearing open, high-heeled sandals. Both individuals seem engaged in a light conversation or interaction, looking towards each other with mild expressions.\n\nThe background features clean and simplistic subway architecture, with a tiled floor, a row of white doors along the wall, and a sleek, modern ceiling design. The platform itself is devoid of other people, creating an intimate setting for the interaction depicted. The environment suggests a quiet moment away from the usual hustle and bustle typical of subway stations.","title":"Dogs are permitted on all public transportation for one third full fare (a child's fare). Seeing-eye dogs ride free. Riders travelling the same route daily can buy a monthly pass. If they take their dog, he is issued a monthly pass, too--with his picture on it.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["556658","557909","556779","556665","556814","556666","556821","551889","556829","556682","556171","556654","556663","548274","556700","548260"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","dog","leash","station","sandal","handbag","hustle","knee","skirt","interaction"]}
