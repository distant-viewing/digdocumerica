{"path":"548868.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene riverside scene in a semi-arid environment. The river gently meanders through the landscape, with its waters reflecting the clear blue sky. Sand and sparse vegetation dominate both banks of the river, indicating a possibly arid regional climate.\n\nOn the left bank of the river, several structures, possibly makeshift and temporary shelters or small buildings, are visible alongside moored boats, suggesting the presence of a small, perhaps fishing, community. Individuals are seen interacting with the river; a person on the right is standing by the water's edge while another is wading or fishing in the river.\n\nFurther upstream and on distant banks, more greenery is apparent as well as several other small structures, hinting at more human activity. The background is dominated by a flat horizon line with sparse vegetation, and the overall lighting conditions suggest this image was taken on a clear day. This landscape offers a glimpse into a tranquil, perhaps routine day-to-day life by the river in a rural setting.","title":"Colorado River at Mexican border","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["549029","548096","557485","548839","543793","549089","549457","555575","542653","550782","551067","550839","557106","552108","550208","553003"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","bank","fishing","shelter","riverside","day","climate","sand","vegetation","glimpse"]}
