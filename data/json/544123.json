{"path":"544123.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and moody natural landscape under a stormy sky at dusk. The image is predominantly in shades of dark blue and black, spotlighting the subdued light conditions typical just after sunset or before a storm. Silhouettes of rolling hills or low mountains dominate the horizon, contributing to the feeling of a remote, tranquil environment.\n\nThe sky is a central feature of the composition, with thick, heavy clouds covering most of the view. A break in these clouds towards the center left of the image lets through a narrow, horizontal swath of brighter sky, hinting at either the sunset or a brief respite in the overcast weather. This natural light provides a striking contrast to the otherwise dimly lit scene.\n\nNotably, two distinct red lights glow towards the lower right of the image, likely artificial lights from a vehicle or a small structure, which adds a hint of human presence in this vast natural landscape. There are no clear signs of movement or activity, and the overall atmosphere is one of stillness and solitude, enhanced by the encroaching darkness and the impending sense of a heavy storm.","title":"Hauling coal at night.
