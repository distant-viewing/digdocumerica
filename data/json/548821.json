{"path":"548821.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers a scenic view of a golf course from behind a lineup of parked golf carts. Each golf cart is equipped with a white canopy for sun protection. In the foreground, rocky terrain is visible spanning the width of the image, contrasting with the well-manicured greenery of the golf course. On the course itself, individuals, likely players, are scattered across the landscape, some near the golf carts, and others farther into the field, possibly in mid-play.\n\nA single tall palm tree stands prominently on the left side, adding a picturesque quality to the setting. Beyond the golf course, the background features a vast, flat landscape, interspersed with more green areas from adjacent parts of the golfing facility. Mountain ranges line the horizon under a sky partially covered by wispy clouds, suggesting a serene, open-air environment.\n\nThis composition of the image, with its foreground emphasis on the rocky area and golf carts, directs the viewerâ€™s eye towards the activities on the golf course and the natural beauty of the surrounding landscape, emphasizing a sense of leisure and the expanse of the outdoor setting.","title":"Golf club on the lake at Lake Havasu City","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["546959","549069","554148","543633","554149","552608","554492","546513","553980","554167","557512","545249","558098","548823","547286","546509"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["golf","course","cart","lineup","player","width","protection","palm","emphasis","play"]}
