{"path":"552332.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features two young blonde children, a boy on the left and a girl on the right, engaging in play at a rocky outdoor setting. Both children are crouching, focusing intently on a small pool of water formed in one of the rock depressions.\n\nThe boy is dressed in a dark blue and polka-dotted long-sleeve top paired with black pants. His outfit is accessorized with a red scarf tied around his neck, and he has light-colored shoes. The girl, on the other hand, wears a vibrant green jacket with flower patterns over a blue jacket and navy pants; she has red shoes. Both children display long blonde hair.\n\nIn the shallow pool, a small toy boat with red, yellow, and blue parts floats on the water, seemingly the center of their attention. The surrounding rocks are rough and jagged, suggesting a natural rugged terrain, likely near a coastal or mountainous area. Patches of moss or lichen are visible on the stones, adding a touch of green to the mostly gray rocks. The environment speaks of a serene, nature-filled area, perfect for children's exploration and play.","title":"Pair of teenagers examine a tidepool at Larrabee State Park on northern Puget Sound.","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["544200","543612","543685","547692","543875","552591","551857","543677","543473","550229","544183","550244","544380","545757","543392","552828"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","pool","shoe","play","girl","rock","boy","depression","polka","lichen"]}
