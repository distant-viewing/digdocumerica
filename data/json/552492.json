{"path":"552492.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures the detail of a decorative wooden porch or window structure. The focus is on an ornate, carved wooden trim that features a leaf-like design, delicately cut out of the wood. This trim runs along the top of the structure, set against a contrasting rustic and weathered wood-paneled background which may be a wall or side of a building. In the background, through the frame of the wooden structure, a portion of a window with a six-pane glass design is visible. The window glass appears somewhat dirty, and reflecting off it are shadowy forms that hint at a dimly-lit interior or obscured background, adding a sense of mystery or age to the scene. The darker wood tones and the intricate carving work contribute to a vintage or historical feel, suggesting that the structure is part of an older building, potentially in a rural or heritage setting. The overall mood is atmospheric and somewhat nostalgic, evoking a serene and timeless quality.","title":"Interesting detail on porch of deserted house","placename":"Detroit (Ill.)","location":"Detroit, Illinois","nn1":["543028","548653","557070","547299","548657","543348","548652","552535","555295","557081","558031","557074","542815","557646","548651","548658"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["trim","wood","carving","window","heritage","glass","pane","leaf","mystery","structure"]}
