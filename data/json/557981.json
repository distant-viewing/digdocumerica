{"path":"557981.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features two men engaging in an outdoor activity involving archery equipment. The setting appears to be a grassy area with a dark background that might suggest a wooded or shaded environment.\n\nOne of the men, dressed in a plain white T-shirt and khaki pants, is holding a compound bow and appears to be assisting or instructing the other man on how to use it. He has short dark hair, and is also carrying another bow over his shoulder, possibly indicating they're either sharing equipment or he is a trainer of sorts.\n\nThe second man, wearing a denim jacket over a blue T-shirt paired with jeans adorned with patch and embroidery designs, is focused on adjusting or setting up the compound bow. Notably, his jeans show a unique embroidery of a rocket on one of the legs, contributing to his distinct style. This man is also wearing a patterned bandana on his head and has a stubbly beard, adding to his rugged appearance.\n\nTheir engagement with the bow suggests they are either practicing archery or preparing for it. The expressions and bodily engagement suggest a moment of learning or concentration, particularly from the man in the denim jacket. There aren't any visible targets in the immediate vicinity, focusing the scene solely on the interaction between the two individuals and the equipment. The natural lighting and casual outdoor setting provide a relaxed and informal atmosphere to the scene.","title":"Bowmen zeroing in their equipment prior to hunting, using private facilities at the agoca bowmen, inc., field course adjacent to the hampton hills area and Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system at bath road.
