{"path":"556565.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a large industrial site, most likely a coal processing plant, nestled in a valley surrounded by densely forested hills. Key features of the site include several large, metal structures, which are interconnected by a network of elevated conveyor belts. These conveyors are instrumental in transporting materials between different areas of the facility.\n\nAt the forefront, a building labeled \"EAST GULF\" prominently displays its name painted in bold letters along its side. This structure appears to be a central hub for operations or possibly a warehouse. Nearby, there are various industrial equipments and vehicles, suggesting ongoing operations or maintenance work.\n\nThe landscape around the industrial buildings is largely devoid of vegetation, likely due to the industrial activity, with visible scars on the land from mining operations. In contrast, the background has lush, green hills that indicate the rugged, natural environment of the region.\n\nThere are parked cars near the buildings, which along with the industrial activity, indicate that this photograph was taken during a regular working day. The atmosphere of the image conveys a sense of industriousness and the significant impact of human activity on natural landscapes.","title":"East Gulf, one of the large mining companies in the area of Rhodell and Beckley, West Virginia. There is very little industry other than coal in the area. Many of the youths have to choose between coal related jobs nearby or searching for employment in the cities some distance away. This can be a traumatic decision which affects all members of the closeknit families.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554625","549168","556602","556520","554632","556424","551113","557403","551037","551112","554764","556349","551035","543169","551036","546055"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["conveyor","operation","industriousness","interconnect","site","coal","hill","hub","belt","work"]}
