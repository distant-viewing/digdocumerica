{"path":"553231.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph depicts a vibrant street performance capturing a moment filled with movement and music. In the foreground, a woman dressed in a flowing purple jumpsuit is captured mid-dance. She has an intense expression of focus as she stretches out her arms elegantly, her feet bare, against the patterned cobblestone surface. Behind her, a man plays the trumpet, adding a musical dimension to her dance. He is seen wearing sunglasses and a buttoned-up light brown shirt paired with dark pants.\n\nIn the background, various spectators line the edges of the scene, observing the performance. These onlookers display a range of reactions, dressed in typical casual to smart casual attire reflecting the era's fashion, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s given the style of clothing and hair. The setting is an open urban space, likely a square, characterized by a cobblestone pavement and surrounded by buildings that are not clearly detailed but hint at a city environment. Overall, the photograph captures a lively interaction between performers and their audience, set in a sunlit, outdoor urban setting.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
