{"path":"556776.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"In the photograph, two individuals are sitting on a long green bench in a semi-urban outdoor setting, possibly a public transportation waiting area given the presence of a bus schedule on the wall behind them.\n\nOn the left side of the bench, a woman is seated, appearing engrossed in reading a small booklet or brochure. She is wearing a colorful striped top, black pants, and white shoes, and she has a large beige purse resting next to her. Her posture suggests deep concentration as she holds one hand to her temple.\n\nOn the right side, a man is seated, leisurely reading a newspaper, which is held wide open. He is dressed casually in a yellow short-sleeve shirt, grey pants, and dark shoes. His glasses and serious expression contribute to an air of absorption in the content of the paper.\n\nThe background is nondescript with grey walls and a large, blurry poster visible; it features graphical artwork and text, likely an advertisement or public announcement.\n\nThe overall mood is quiet and focused, with both parties absorbed in their respective readings, disconnected from each other yet sharing the same physical space. The image captures a moment of everyday life, highlighting individual pursuits and the commonality of public spaces.","title":"Passengers waiting for Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) trains to take them into Philadelphia.

Improvements in equipment, service and fringe parking were responsible for the increase. Annual budget for the system is $180 million, half of it subsidized, the rest is from fares.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556775","556070","553222","556796","549897","546597","551827","551970","556034","553736","551472","551434","546564","556103","555961","556699"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["shoe","bench","waiting","schedule","pursuit","purse","artwork","reading","pant","wall"]}
