{"path":"555411.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph features a prominent blue sign with white text that reads, \"Temporarily out of Gasoline OPEN for your other driving needs.\" The sign is placed in front of what appears to be a parking lot, with sections of pavement visible, partly covered with scattered leaves and debris. In the background, partially obscured by the sign, there is a trailer or a large vehicle parked. The setting indicates an outdoor area likely associated with a gas station or similar facility that is experiencing a temporary gasoline shortage but remains open to offer other services. The lighting and quality of the image suggest it might be a scan from a slide, giving it a slightly vintage or dated feel.","title":"Out of gasoline signs were increasingly evident in Oregon during the month of October, 1973. Stations such as this one at Lincoln City along the coast closed earlier and stayed closed longer, including weekends.","placename":"Lincoln City (Or.)","location":"Lincoln City, Oregon","nn1":["548176","555413","555416","555464","548174","548169","555414","555415","548171","555518","548053","555519","548175","548168","555412","555452"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["shortage","gasoline","slide","sign","need","pavement","trailer","gas","remain","experience"]}
