{"path":"553126.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a large hillside with various texts and a logo painted or posted on its surface. The texts are mostly in green and red colors, along with a logo that appears to be in red. The top portion reads \"70 MI. TO HARVEY'S\" in green. Below this, in larger letters, the name \"HARVEY'S\" is shown in red, followed by \"WAGON WHEEL\" in green. Additional text includes \"LAKE TAHOE\" in green and \"HWY 50\" in red, just below which are the words \"HOTEL CASINO RESORT\" in white. The arrangement of text seems to direct attention to Harvey's Wagon Wheel, a hotel casino resort located on Highway 50, near Lake Tahoe, and it suggests it's 70 miles away from the location depicted in the image. \n\nThe background of the image is a barren hillside with sparsely vegetated terrain, mostly dry grass and a few bushes, under a clear blue sky. The landscape is typical of semi-arid or desert mountain areas, possibly indicative of a region near Lake Tahoe. The overall image serves as an advertisement and directional guide for travelers.","title":"Outdoor advertising seen from i-80, approaching Reno from the east","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["553669","543641","543637","543724","543814","544145","553017","544897","545824","549008","544136","557534","549223","554186","543100","557546"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["text","hillside","logo","mile","hotel","traveler","resort","vegetate","guide","advertisement"]}
