{"path":"549238.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic landscape depicting an expansive natural area under a clear blue sky with scattered cumulus clouds. In the foreground, tall grasses dominate the view, displaying varying shades of green, yellow, and brown, suggesting a wild and undisturbed prairie environment.\n\nThe middle of the image reveals a gentle slope that descends into a valley filled with dense patches of conifer trees, which provide a stark contrast in color and texture to the open grassy areas. These trees appear healthy, adding a rich green hue to the landscape.\n\nBeyond the trees, the terrain rises again into rolling hills that show signs of soil erosion or possible land use, revealing shades of red and brown soil among patches of sparse vegetation. These affected areas suggest either natural wear or human impact on the land.\n\nIn the distance, more forested areas can be seen, leading up to a horizon line that is intermittently visible through the trees. The scene conveys a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, with the wild, grassy foreground giving way to the more structured appearance of the tree-covered valleys and eroded hills, all under a vast, dynamic sky that suggests a remote or wilderness area. The overall composition of the image balances the elements of untouched nature with subtle signs of environmental changes.","title":"This land, which lies next to the westmoreland coal company strip mine, is next on the company's agenda for expanding its operations","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["552903","549218","549186","550604","549134","549236","549227","549155","549229","549139","552914","549157","556990","548025","549249","557099"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grassy","valley","prairie","cumulus","soil","reveal","tree","descend","wild","erod"]}
