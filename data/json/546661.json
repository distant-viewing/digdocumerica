{"path":"546661.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a city street during what appears to be dusk, given the low light and street lamps beginning to glow. A male police officer, viewed from behind and slightly to the side, is interacting with a driver at a car window. The officer is dressed in a standard police uniformâ€”light blue shirt, dark trousers with a belt, and a peaked cap.\n\nThe car he is approaching is silvery-white with a sleek design, indicative of the automotive styles from the mid-20th century. Next to this car, partially visible is another darker vehicle. The background shows a city environment with hints of greenery, buildings, and multiple other vehicles parked or in motion, contributing to a sense of busy urban life. \n\nThe photograph has a somewhat grainy texture, enhancing its vintage feel. The overall atmosphere is one of a routine traffic stop or police check, set against the backdrop of a bustling city street. There's a small, red spherical light visible in the air, which might be a reflection or lens flare, adding a subtle dramatic effect to the setting.","title":"Driver gets ticket for jumping the light.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546654","546663","557841","555461","546631","546635","546611","546630","546647","549932","546637","546653","542755","554293","555447","557865"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["police","officer","city","street","car","check","flare","lens","stop","driver"]}
