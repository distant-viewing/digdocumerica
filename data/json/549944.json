{"path":"549944.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts a barren landscape littered with trash and debris. In the foreground, the ground is rough and sandy with noticeable wheel tracks, and it is scattered with various pieces of garbage including papers, plastics, and broken objects. Towards the middle ground, a distinct, lighter path appears to have fewer debris compared to its surroundings. In the background, there is a serene view with a row of trees lining a road parallel to a body of water, likely a river or a lake. Beyond the water, hills gently rise under a hazy sky. The overall setting feels desolate, emphasizing environmental neglect contrasted starkly against the natural beauty in the distance.","title":"Croton landfill operation is just a few hundred feet from Westchester County's croton point park on the Hudson River.
