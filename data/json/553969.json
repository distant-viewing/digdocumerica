{"path":"553969.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of a sprawling, semi-industrial area. In the foreground of the photo, there is a large complex with multiple large buildings emitting steam or smoke, suggesting a possible industrial facility. Some of these buildings have slanted or tiered roof structures, likely indicating different operational areas or purposes. There are roads weaving around these buildings, and some vehicles can be spotted parked alongside.\n\nThe area surrounding this complex shows a mix of both urban and rural qualities. To the middle-left, you can see wide open fields with a few water bodies, which may be used for agriculture. On the right side, there is a densely built residential area consisting of tightly packed houses with distinct, recognizable roofing.\n\nAdditionally, toward the upper right, there is more urban development with a range of different buildings including what appears to be a large, possibly commercial, building that has an unusual round shape. This could be a place of social or cultural gathering.\n\nThe foliage surrounding all these areas is lush and indicates that the setting could be in a region with a rich natural environment or a high rainfall area. Overall, the mix of industry, suburban lifestyle, and natural settings suggest this photograph captures a diverse, multi-functional area which might serve industrial, residential, and agricultural purposes.","title":"Lihue Plantation sugar mill","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["551174","551569","549727","549523","555761","555755","555771","542620","543764","547126","549506","543872","555778","558054","555779","550866"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["complex","purpose","building","roofing","mix","area","lifestyle","rainfall","agriculture","steam"]}
