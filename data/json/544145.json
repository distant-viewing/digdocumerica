The billboard reads \"Add a PAGE to your trip\" with the word \"PAGE\" prominently displayed in large, bold, white lettering, possibly referring to the name of a location or point of interest for travelers. Below the main text, smaller text provides additional information: \"Food · Gas · Lodging\" and \"Pop. 6500,\" indicating the services available in Page and its population, respectively. The background of the billboard showcases a picturesque desert landscape with rugged mountains, enhancing the travel-themed appeal of the advertisement. Notably, the billboard has an interesting design element at the top left corner, where there is a directional arrow pointing right, painted in a vivid red that matches some framing elements of the billboard.
