{"path":"550891.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph features a close-up of a large ship's underbelly and bow as it cuts through water. The ship's hull is painted in hues of red and gray, and you can see a portion of the waterline marked with numbers indicating 30 and 31, possibly signifying the draft of the ship in feet. The ship is moving at a significant speed as evidenced by the massive, turbulent wake and the splashing water around its bow.\n\nThe water has a frothy appearance, mostly white due to the ship's interaction with it, and appears slightly choppy, likely from both the movement of the ship and environmental factors. The background is softly out of focus, but one can discern rocky, rugged terrain suggestive of a shoreline or a riverbank.\n\nThe photograph has a somewhat vintage or retro feel, with a color palette dominated by blue, red, and white tones influenced by the maritime setting and the film used for capturing the image. The angle and close-up nature of the shot provide a dramatic and dynamic representation of maritime power and engineering.","title":"Wake of a massive freighter in the Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["550897","555801","544234","551990","546040","548201","555810","544657","549618","549431","550918","545845","546926","555789","555811","545830"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","factor","waterline","suggestive","retro","representation","signify","bow","foot","discern"]}
