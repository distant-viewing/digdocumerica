{"path":"551302.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a woman in a playful pose, kneeling on a patio of a building named \"The Clown\" as indicated by the sign on the top left of the image. The sign also features imagery of two clowns, one above the text and another on a lantern-like object beside the sign, giving the venue a whimsical or circus-themed vibe.\n\nThe woman is wearing a patterned bikini and is smiling broadly, adding a lively, joyful atmosphere to the image. Her short hair and bright expression contribute to a sense of mirth and spontaneity. In front of her on the concrete floor is a small bowl containing what looks like pet food, suggesting she may be feeding or playing with an animal, though none is visible in the immediate vicinity.\n\nThe background shows the edge of a body structure, possibly over water, hinting that this might be a lakeside or seaside resort area. Behind her and to the right, there's a blurred view of a waterfront, with a glimpse of calm water and overcast sky. The setting is casual and recreational, perfect for a day out near the water.","title":"Pam Schumacher, waitress, poses for photographer at \"The Clown,\" a floating restaurant at Osage Beach.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["556300","548584","548291","553200","544339","549718","544189","551306","552952","546223","551093","547197","544742","550936","550242","551249"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["spontaneity","patio","lantern","bowl","imagery","sign","bikini","resort","venue","woman"]}
