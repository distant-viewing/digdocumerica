{"path":"549215.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents an industrial scene dominated by a large power plant. The facility is extensive, with multiple buildings that include a central, large, rectangular structure painted white. It has several sections, each with flat roofs and numerous vents and other industrial apparatus. There are multiple smokestacks, four of which are prominently visible emitting thick, grey smoke into the sky. Each smokestack is tall and cylindrical, red with a white band around the top.\n\nIn the foreground, the landscape includes a body of water that appears to be a river or a man-made water storage area, reflecting the plant and parts of the grey sky. The edges of the water feature small, grassy islets and some growths of shrubbery, which provide a soft contrast to the stark industrial setting. The water body is framed by what appear to be containment structures or small embankments.\n\nThe background is comprised of a gently rolling landscape with sparse vegetation, which suggests a location that might be in a semi-arid or artificially modified area. The sky over the landscape is overcast, contributing to a somber atmosphere that complements the industrial theme.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the natural elements of water and limited vegetation against the industrial might of the power plant, highlighted by the significant environmental impact visible in the form of smoke emissions.","title":"The Dave Johnston power plant","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557302","549190","549189","548195","546080","550329","544495","550672","546808","557306","546087","546141","551009","548068","557374","546005"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","plant","power","containment","might","islet","modify","smoke","water","embankment"]}
