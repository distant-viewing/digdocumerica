{"path":"551236.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet intriguing scene by a large body of water. The foreground prominently features the paved surface of a bridge, where a vintage, light-colored sedan tows a small boat on a trailer, driving from right to left. The boat appears well-equipped for leisure activities, like fishing or day cruising.\n\nBeyond the guardrails of the bridge, the water is the scene of uncommon activity: several people are spaced out, standing directly in the water, which reaches about waist-high for some. This unusual sight suggests the water level might be unusually low, or perhaps they are on a sandbar. Near the right side of the image, a small boat is situated close to shore where a few other individuals are gathered, possibly attending to fishing tasks or readying a boat for departure.\n\nThe water itself has a calm surface, reflecting a hazy sky, hinting at overcast or smoggy weather conditions. The people, varied in their attire, add a dynamic element, suggesting various recreational or utilitarian purposes for their presence in the water.\n\nOverall, the image offers a snapshot of a moment blending everyday transportation with recreational water activities, possibly in a community where boating and fishing are popular.","title":"Passenger car hauls pleasure boat.
