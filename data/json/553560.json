{"path":"553560.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a forest fire. In the foreground, there are numerous fallen branches and twigs engulfed in flames, brightly burning with a mix of orange and red hues. Wisps of smoke rise from the fires, contributing to a somewhat hazy atmosphere. The middle ground shows more smoldering remains and some smoke, likely from fires that have either diminished in intensity or are obscured from direct view. The background features a dense forest with tall pine trees standing against a blue sky dotted with clouds. Despite the presence of the fire, the back portion of the forest appears unscathed and serene. The overall composition gives a stark contrast between the destructive fire in the foreground and the still-intact forest in the distance.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora. Trees still burn on the fringe of the cleared area.
