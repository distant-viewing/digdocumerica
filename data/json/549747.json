{"path":"549747.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a broad, cluttered landscape of garbage and debris, sprawling across the foreground under a clear blue sky. The vast heap includes numerous types of waste such as paper, plastic bags, pieces of wood, some textiles, and scattered unidentifiable refuse. Amidst the trash, small pockets of standing water reflect the sky.\n\nIn the background of the image, a row of high-rise residential buildings lines the horizon, suggesting that this landfill is located near an urban area. The contrast between the built environment and the expanse of waste speaks to environmental and urban challenges.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its focus on an expansive landfill set against a backdrop of residential blocks under a wide sky, strongly emphasizes themes of pollution, urban waste management, and environmental degradation.","title":"Municipal dump in the Bronx reaches almost to the doorstep of \"Co-Op City\" (housing development in background). Although dump already exceeds capacity, pile-up continues; high winds, typical of the area, scatter bits of refuse for miles around.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549739","544799","549957","549762","548210","547899","549748","550256","544637","545299","550801","549750","549823","553039","557307","551247"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["landfill","waste","refuse","pocket","heap","challenge","garbage","degradation","plastic","block"]}
