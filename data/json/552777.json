{"path":"552777.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"The photograph presents a scene featuring four men interacting around a small, bright yellow car against an outdoor, parking lot backdrop. The car, notable for its compact size and vibrant color, has distinct styling with chrome accents and white stripes on the bonnet. It also features a visible license plate which reads \"EXPERIMENTAL\" indicating its unique or prototype nature. \n\nThree men are seated inside the car. The individual at the wheel is dressed in a light-coloured suit and tie, while the passenger beside him wears a dark suit, and the third man, who is in the rear seat, has on a light colored jacket and dark trousers. These men appear to be engaged in conversation or a demonstration of the vehicle's features. The fourth man, standing outside the car, leans slightly into the vehicle, attentively observing or participating in the interaction with those seated. He is dressed in a dark suit and tie. \n\nVisible behind the car is a wide parking lot scattered with numerous cars of various models and colors suggesting a public or commercial setting. In the distance, light infrastructure like lamp posts, a small building possibly a shelter or kiosk, and a broad expanse of cloud-filled sky can be seen.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the Marriott Motor Inn, Ann Arbor.
