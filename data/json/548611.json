{"path":"548611.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly man using a public phone booth. The man, positioned on the left side of the frame, is viewed from the side as he stands inside the small, partially enclosed phone booth. He is dressed formally in a dark suit and wears a straw hat with a textured band. The man is actively engaged in a conversation, holding the receiver of a traditional, round-dial payphone to his ear with his left hand while resting his right hand against the booth for support.\n\nThe phone booth itself is compact and utilitarian, made of metal and glass with the word \"PHONE\" prominently displayed on top in bold, capitalized letters on both visible sides. Inside the booth, there are instructional labels and a coin slot, typical of public payphone stations from the mid-to-late 20th century.\n\nThe background is mostly obscured by the phone booth, but it appears to be an outdoor setting in daytime, given the bright natural light that illuminates the scene. The manâ€™s expression is focused, suggesting a level of concentration or perhaps urgency in his phone conversation. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on the interaction between the man and the phone, emphasizes themes of communication and perhaps a glimpse into everyday moments of past decades.","title":"Member of the retirement community of south beach","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["556777","556689","555968","548269","556678","549090","555527","549851","553176","549291","551854","551840","556794","554845","553030","551337"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["phone","booth","man","capitalize","conversation","ear","urgency","bold","dial","communication"]}
