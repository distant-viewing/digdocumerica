{"path":"553515.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures a young individual performing a wheelie on a bicycle. The person is a youth with medium-length hair, appearing focused and balanced while riding. They are dressed in a plaid shirt and dark pants, riding a red bicycle. The street they are on looks quiet and residential, bordered by houses displaying a mix of textures, including weathered wooden sidings and a brick façade. The street is paved but shows signs of wear and patches of grass. The overall atmosphere hints at a subdued, perhaps late-afternoon setting with soft lighting, contributing to a somewhat nostalgic feel. The image has a candid, spontaneous quality, emphasizing movement and youthful energy.","title":"Look, Ma, one wheel. Billy Watkins of Mulky Square can ride like this for a whole block, has even offered to teach others the trick for a small fee - but so far has found no takers.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["546967","555501","547199","551303","547857","555436","557354","544432","543719","547389","555433","555950","550073","557535","543497","553908"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["bicycle","youth","street","façade","siding","energy","length","wear","look","brick"]}
