{"path":"546660.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image portrays a bustling urban street scene on a rainy day, captured from an elevated perspective. The photograph vividly captures the atmosphere of a wet, gloomy day with rain-soaked surfaces reflecting city lights, enhancing the rich, saturated colors typical of a rainy day setting.\n\nThe scene includes a variety of vehicles such as cars, buses, and possibly a tram, congested in traffic along the street. The architecture visible includes tall commercial buildings, typical of a mid-20th-century American cityscape, featuring facades with rows of windows and a muted color palette that blends with the grey, overcast sky.\n\nTree-lined sidewalks add a touch of greenery to the urban environment. The trees are lush, with leaves that hang heavy, likely weighed down by the rain.\n\nPedestrians, some holding umbrellas, are visible walking along the sidewalks or waiting at bus stops. Their attire and the presence of umbrellas suggest preparedness for the typical rainy weather, which does not seem to deter the normal hustle and bustle of city life. The overall mood conveyed is one of dynamic urban activity despite the inclement weather, with the cityâ€™s infrastructure and citizens actively engaged in their daily routines.","title":"Rainy evening rush hour, looking east on K Street from 16th Street, NW","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546643","556681","551933","546656","551863","546639","551869","553188","546742","546738","556734","549849","556983","551873","551471","556807"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["umbrella","bus","rain","sidewalk","city","inclement","tram","preparedness","soak","bustle"]}
