{"path":"557934.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a festive outdoor scene focused on a communal meal preparation, likely at a fair or gathering. The setting is a sunny day with abundant greenery and a hint of autumnal trees in the background, suggesting it might be early fall.\n\nIn the foreground, around the center and to the right of the image, three adults and a child interact around a large barbecue grill. The grill is laden with food, likely sausages or hot dogs, which generates a bit of smoke visible above it. An adult, probably a woman seen from the back, wears a long red-and-white patterned dress and holds a plate. Beside her, a young man with dark hair, dressed in a casual light blue shirt, appears to be tending to the grill with a tong.\n\nTo the left, an older woman wearing a scarf or bandana on her head and a light blue apron over her dress, is focused on another woman right across from her, who is also involved in the cooking process. She stands in profile view and wears a casual blouse. A small boy, partially obscured, is beside the older woman, looking on attentively.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, showing an expanse of grass leading towards a line of cars parked under trees, suggestive of the casual, community-oriented nature of the event. The environment reflects a serene rural or semi-rural locale, enhanced by bright sunlight casting soft shadows on the grass.","title":"Simple food is served by a costumed employee of the Western Reserve Historical Society at the Hale Farm and Western Reserve Village near Bath and Akron, Ohio.
