{"path":"556494.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This is an image depicting an outdoor haircut scene, likely taken on a porch of a house. The setting looks rustic and modest, with a weathered wooden floor and ceiling. An older man, wearing a black baseball cap, glasses, a long-sleeve shirt, and suspenders, is cutting the hair of a younger man. The younger man is seated on a simple wooden chair, draped with a white cloth that covers him, likely to protect his clothing from hair clippings.\n\nThe older man is focused on his task, holding scissors in his right hand and carefully trimming the hair. The expression on the younger man's face is calm and he appears relaxed, trusting the older man with his haircut. Both individuals are surrounded by a peaceful, rural environment that is slightly visible in the blurred background.\n\nThe scene is an intimate glimpse into everyday life, illustrating a moment of care and routine between two people. The setting and the activity suggest a close-knit community or family connection, evoking a sense of simplicity and tradition.","title":"Ellis w.
