{"path":"546528.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, somewhat dimly lit indoor scene, primarily constructed of modern architectural elements. This scene includes a person descending a flight of concrete stairs. The individual, a woman, is dressed in a light-colored, floral-patterned dress and is carrying a bag, interacting with the space around her as she moves downwards.\n\nThe architectural environment features large geometric shapes and structures. Prominent in the photo is a massive concrete pillar on the left, leading into beams that segment parts of the space, creating a play of light and shadow. The interaction of natural and artificial lighting enhances the mood, casting patterns and patches of light along the surfaces.\n\nIn the background, partly obscured by the concrete structures, there are potted plants, adding a touch of greenery and life to the otherwise stark, modern setting. This suggests that the space might serve a public or semi-public function, possibly a modern business or civic building.\n\nThe setting is largely monochromatic with the exception of the green plants and the woman's dress, which adds contrast to the scene. The focus and stillness of the woman in motion, juxtaposed with the immobile and rigid architectural lines, create a dynamic visual dialogue between human and structural elements.","title":"Interior courtyard of southside junior high school","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546498","546526","546515","546558","546493","546511","546519","556385","546506","546517","546510","546518","546479","556027","546462","546450"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["dialogue","woman","space","pot","stair","pillar","descend","dress","light","plant"]}
