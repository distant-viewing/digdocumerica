{"path":"555782.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph showcases an urban street scene, apparently taken during the late 20th century, judging by the style of vehicles and overall atmosphere. The view captures a city street that extends into the background with high-rise buildings on either side, forming a typical urban canyon. This creates a sense of depth and scale, emphasizing the bustling nature of the city environment.\n\nIn the foreground, the street is lined on one side with cars parked parallel to the curb. The road itself is busy with several cars in motion, suggesting a typical day with active traffic. One notable feature in the traffic flow is a bus prominently decorated with multiple advertisements, including a large one for \"WNBC Radio 66\" and other smaller ads that depict commercial messages and possibly promotions.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, there is a red sedan that stands out against the more neutrally colored vehicles around it. The architecture visible includes varied building facades, typical of many downtown city areas, with windows reflecting the sunlight and possibly some shopfronts or offices at street level.\n\nThe lighting suggests it might be either early morning or later in the evening, as the colors have a muted, warm tint, making the scene feel a bit distant or nostalgic. No people are distinctly visible in the image, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention solely on the urban landscape and the movement within it. The overall atmosphere captures a vibrant, dynamic moment in city life, with a mix of transportation and architectural elements characteristic of a populated urban center.","title":"Sewer outfall into the East River in Manhattan, New York rivers which flow through the region carry raw and partially digested sewage, and chemical and industrial wastes into the waters of the bight.
