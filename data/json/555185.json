{"path":"555185.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of nature, predominantly showcasing a variety of plants set against a muted sky. In the foreground, there are clusters of dark leaves, some of which are sharply contoured with silhouetted edges, indicating they are backlit. These leaves have a glossy texture, are slightly wilted, and vary in shades from dark green to brown. \n\nProminent in the composition are the remnants of a tree, perhaps a stump with jagged, splintered edges, which occupy the middle to the right side of the frame. The texture of the wood is rough, showcasing natural weathering and decay, captured in shades of gray and white that suggest old, bleached wood. \n\nThe ground appears to be covered in a layer of dry, fallen leaves and other organic debris, adding to the sense of a natural, undisturbed environment. The overcast sky serves as a diffuse, soft light source that enhances the details and textures of the plant life and wooden remnants. The overall mood of the photograph is somewhat serene yet evokes a sense of desolation from the decay showcased prominently.","title":"Oregon grape burned from overexposure to the sun because the land was clear-cut and burned six years earlier.
