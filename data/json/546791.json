{"path":"546791.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a drawbridge with the drawbridge partially raised. Looking through the gap created by the lifted part of the bridge, we see a bright day and the calm waters below. A sailboat with a white sail, marked with \"FSC 321,\" is gliding gently through the water. The edges of the sailboat reflect a streamlined design, emphasizing its graceful maneuver under the bridge.\n\nThe background is filled with many more sailboats moored at docks, indicating a popular boating area or marina. These boats vary in size and are tightly packed in the visible marina space. The infrastructure of the drawbridge itself is heavy and metallic, with a grid-like pattern visible on the lifted part, hinting at its robust engineering designed to frequently accommodate boat traffic.\n\nThe overall scene suggests a peaceful day at a busy marina, with the drawbridge as a functional architectural element facilitating the smooth passage of boats in and out of the area. There is a balance between technology and recreation in this environment, highlighting a harmonious coexistence. The focus on the bridge and the sailboat crossing underneath it adds a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil setting.","title":"Sailing through the drawbridge","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["544722","544667","544717","552234","544248","547064","556190","543938","544669","552347","543305","552262","547061","557483","547781","542904"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","marina","bridge","lift","boat","glide","accommodate","crossing","gap","boating"]}
