{"path":"544788.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing an expansive industrial landscape adjacent to a large body of water. The most prominent feature in the image is a sizeable industrial facility on the left, characterized by multiple buildings, some emitting smoke from stacks, suggesting active manufacturing or processing operations. The facility is surrounded by vast, barren terrains with various winding dirt roads and minimal vegetation.\n\nDirectly in the foreground and stretching to the midpoint of the image is a rugged mountainous area, with stark, exposed rock formations and little to no vegetation which appear to be tailing, possibly from mining activities.\n\nIn the background of the image extends a calm, blue body of water, which might be a sea or large lake. Next to the water, there appears to be a large, flat area divided into sections, possibly evaporation ponds or some sort of water treatment areas, consistent with industrial uses.\n\nThe sky is mostly clear, suggesting a bright, sunlit day when the photograph was taken. The overall impression is of a major industrial operation located in a remote, possibly arid environment, juxtaposed against a natural landscape and water body, highlighting both industrial activity and the natural environment in stark contrast.\n","title":"Kennecott smelter and mine - the largest open-pit copper mine in the world","placename":"Salt Lake City (Utah)","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","nn1":["544569","551612","544059","551585","544058","544067","549968","545354","551998","546103","551197","549508","552196","555769","544781","544573"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["water","operation","facility","body","treatment","sort","pond","manufacturing","stack","mining"]}
