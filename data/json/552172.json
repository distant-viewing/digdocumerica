{"path":"552172.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a majestic and dramatic mountain vista. In the foreground, you see the dark, rugged outlines of lower mountain ranges, which lead the eye towards the more distant, towering peaks. These higher mountains are richly adorned with snow, accenting their crevices, ridges, and peaks, which highlight the complex topography.\n\nThe lighting in the scene suggests either early morning or late afternoon, given the deep blues and shadowed slopes contrasted sharply with the illuminated snow. The sky above the mountain range is a deep, dark blue, possibly indicating the use of a polarizing filter or the natural coloration during periods closer to twilight.\n\nThe snow-covered peaks and craggy landscapes suggest this mountain range could be part of a larger, possibly well-known chain, such as the Rockies, the Alps, or the Himalayas, characterized by their extensive snow coverage and rugged terrain. The scene is uninhabited and untouched, conveying a sense of serene isolation and natural beauty.","title":"Olympic mountains near Port Angeles","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555681","552173","542520","550415","550645","550422","550421","550423","550504","550416","550401","550628","550413","542519","550408","550505"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["snow","mountain","peak","range","crevice","vista","coverage","blue","filter","coloration"]}
