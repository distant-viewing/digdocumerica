{"path":"551162.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a peaceful outdoor scene where two young boys are engaged in fishing from the shore of a large body of water. To the immediate foreground, both boys are seated on the wooden dock, one on a box and the other directly on the dock. The boy closer to the camera is focusing intently on adjusting his fishing reel with fishing gear and bait spread around him, including what appears to be a Maxwell House coffee can possibly used for storing bait.\n\nIn the background, towering over the scene, are two large cooling towers from what looks like a nuclear power plant. Voluminous plumes of steam or water vapor are being emitted from these towers, flowing upwards into the sky. In between these two prominent towers, another industrial structure with a tall smokestack is visible.\n\nThe surrounding environment is illuminated by bright daylight, suggesting a warm and calm day perfect for fishing. The water is relatively calm, reflecting the structures in the background and creating a striking contrast between the serene activity in the foreground and the industrial backdrop. A few lush green bushes softly frame the right edge of the image, enhancing the juxtaposition of the natural environment against the industrial setting.","title":"Boys fish in the Kanawha River at Poca.
