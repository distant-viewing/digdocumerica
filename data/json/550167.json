{"path":"550167.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image captures a high-altitude view of a vibrant and busy industrial urban landscape, possibly dating back to the mid-20th century given the style and make of the vehicles visible.\n\nFrom the foreground to the background, one can observe various segments of urban planning and infrastructure:\n\n1. **Foreground**: The immediate foreground shows an open ground with scattered patches of soil and greenery. Adjacent to this is a prominent billboard for \"Cleveland Trust,\" positioned alongside a busy road filled with cars typical of mid-20th century designs.\n\n2. **Middle ground**: This area is densely packed with industrial and commercial buildings. Notably, the rooftops are mostly flat, and the buildings appear functional, characterized by large rectangular structures. The streets are bustling with cars, suggesting a busy part of the city. There are multiple parking lots filled with vehicles, indicating the areaâ€™s commercial nature.\n\n3. **Transport infrastructure**: Dominating the middle part of the image is a complex network of roads and railway tracks. The roads weave through the area with overpasses and intersections that facilitate considerable automotive traffic. The railway lines run parallel and close to the roads, indicating an industrial area possibly linked to freight and manufacturing operations.\n\n4. **Far Background**: The farthest part of the image reveals a broad highway or expressway running parallel to what appears to be a landing strip, suggesting proximity to an airport. Beyond this, the horizon fades into a hazy skyline dotted with more industrial structures and possibly a body of water, which is slightly visible at the edge.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a dynamic and industrially focused area, bustling with transportation and commercial activity, framed against a backdrop that suggests further urban and possibly maritime engagements. The hazy sky might indicate either weather conditions or smog common in industrial areas, adding a gritty texture to the overall urban scene.","title":"Heavy industrialization on lake erie waterfront","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["545382","548326","555745","557224","543961","548382","549523","555772","547764","555755","550182","546700","547651","553020","555744","555762"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["railway","road","landing","bustle","smog","run","airport","century","infrastructure","freight"]}
