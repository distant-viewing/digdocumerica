{"path":"550259.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph shows a landscape heavily affected by pollution and environmental degradation. The foreground and midground display a large area littered with debris and rubble. Various types of waste, including chunks of concrete, plastics, and other unidentifiable refuse, are scattered throughout the soil, indicating severe environmental neglect or the aftermath of a demolition.\n\nA small, narrow stream bisects the scene from the middle to the right side of the image, flowing through the polluted area. The water appears dirty and possibly contaminated, reflecting the environmental impact of the surrounding waste.\n\nFlanking the stream, there are patches of greenery indicating that this area might once have been a more vibrant natural habitat. The greenery is sporadic and looks stunted, suggesting it struggles to grow under the polluted conditions.\n\nIn the background, there are traces of industrial activity. Structures that resemble warehouses or factories can be seen, which may suggest that this area is near an industrial site, possibly contributing to the environmental degradation observed.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a landscape that has been severely impacted by industrial pollution and waste dumping, highlighting issues related to environmental management and conservation.","title":"Warner road landfill operations are carried out along mill creek, which flows into the cuyahoga river","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["547485","544810","547907","550800","551440","550352","550250","556942","556419","547524","551247","552019","552169","552089","555852","555228"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waste","degradation","stream","contaminate","pollution","dumping","struggle","demolition","chunk","bisect"]}
