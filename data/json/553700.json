{"path":"553700.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a suburban area, characterized by an organized pattern of streets lined with houses. The houses mostly feature gable roofs and appear to have similar architectural styles, suggesting a planned community. The roads twist and turn, forming loops and cul-de-sacs, typical of suburban layouts designed to minimize through-traffic and promote a quiet residential environment.\n\nThe color palette is subdued, with the roofs of the houses displaying various shades of browns and grays, which contrast with the vibrant green of the lawns and occasional tree foliage. In the background, expansive fields extend to the horizon, hinting at agricultural activity or undeveloped land. The sky above is overcast with clouds suggesting potential precipitation, adding a dimmed, moody tone to the aerial view.\n\nIntriguingly, to one side of the photograph, there is a large patch of bare red soil, indicating ongoing construction or land development. This area breaks the uniformity of the developed neighborhood with its raw, earthy texture, hinting at expansion or the development of new facilities.\n\nThe photograph captures the essence of suburban development amidst a larger rural or semi-rural landscape, reflecting aspects of urban expansion and community planning.","title":"Rezoning of \"surplus pineapple land\" enabled pineapple growers-turned-developers to build this subdivision in Mililani Town, one solution to the island's housing shortage.
