{"path":"545917.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rogers, Chuck","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque scene on a river. In the foreground, there is a large, traditional paddle steamer prominently positioned to the right in the image, moving on the river. This steamer features multiple levels with visible decks adorned with railings, and an array of American flags fluttering at the rear. On the upper deck, several passengers can be seen observing the view.\n\nThe background showcases a cityâ€™s skyline with various buildings, including a tall skyscraper punctuating the cityscape. To the right, spanning across the river, is a long, metal truss bridge, adding to the industrial charm of the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is serene with a slightly overcast sky, and the waters of the river appear calm, reflecting a diffuse light. There are a few other smaller boats visible on the river, suggesting a leisurely or touristic setting. The image evokes a peaceful day out on the water, likely captured from an opposite bank or another boat given the wide perspective of the scene.","title":"Photograph of the Ohio River in Louisville, Kentucky","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543972","545921","545736","551147","543967","543971","543958","543964","543962","543963","554657","543954","543966","543959","554658","545732"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["river","deck","paddle","truss","boat","rear","skyscraper","charm","passenger","flag"]}
