{"path":"543150.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a detailed close-up of a multitude of small, rounded pebbles. The pebbles vary significantly in color, ranging from shades of grey, brown, white, red, and black. Each pebble features a glossy surface, suggesting they might be wet, possibly indicative of a recent exposure to water. The varied colors and sizes of the pebbles create a richly textured visual pattern across the entire photo. There are no apparent activities, people, or additional objects in the pictureâ€”just an expansive view of closely-packed, diverse stones. The focus of the photo is sharp, highlighting the individual characteristics of each pebble. The background is not distinguishable as the pebbles fill the entire frame, emphasizing the natural beauty and diversity of these small geological components.","title":"California--point lobos state park","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["543617","543191","543152","550458","557251","550483","552546","543142","550474","553582","550726","544790","543151","550475","550606","544907"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pebble","multitude","diversity","exposure","characteristic","component","photo","vary","picture","grey"]}
