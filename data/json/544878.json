{"path":"544878.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and expansive landscape dominated by rippling sand dunes under a clear sky. In the forefront of the image, the sandy ground presents a textured appearance with fine lines and ripples, created by the wind sweeping across the surface. A solitary, crystal-clear bubble sits incongruously on the sand, adding a unique and almost surreal element to the scene.\n\nThe background is dominated by towering mountains that display a sharp contrast between their snow-capped peaks and the lower forested slopes. These mountains stretch across the horizon, adding a majestic backdrop to the arid landscape of the dunes. The intersection of the harsh desert environment in the foreground with the alpine conditions of the mountains in the background provides a striking natural contrast, emphasizing the diverse ecology of the region.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its wide-open spaces and the solitary bubble, evokes a sense of isolation and tranquility, while also highlighting the delicate balance found in nature. This serene yet dynamic environment captures the viewer's imagination, encouraging contemplation of nature's beauty and its unexpected surprises.","title":"Great Sand Dunes National Monument","placename":"Colorado","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550490","544873","545200","547717","545199","543097","551553","545207","549037","545203","555399","550441","543644","544415","544400","544392"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["bubble","dune","mountain","sand","crystal","balance","intersection","contemplation","wind","forefront"]}
