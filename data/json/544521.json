{"path":"544521.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a Halloween Pennant dragonfly (Celithemis eponina) perched on the tip of a thin twig or plant stem. The dragonfly is seen from a profile angle where its wings are spread out from its body, showing off the striking pattern of orange and black bands that give it a festive, Halloween-like appearance. The background is a completely clear and uniform blue sky, emphasizing the isolation and detail of the dragonfly and the plant on which it is resting. There are no other objects or additional details in the frame, offering a minimalistic yet vivid portrayal of the dragonfly in its natural environment.","title":"\"Dragonfly\"","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555064","549144","557585","544896","544603","544514","544517","551381","544518","544566","544479","553874","544553","544619","548283","555062"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["tip","twig","stem","portrayal","wing","band","plant","detail","angle","isolation"]}
