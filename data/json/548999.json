{"path":"548999.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man sitting inside a vehicle, engaging in some paperwork. Seen through the vehicle's windshield, the image offers a perspective both intimate and candid, focusing on the man's activity rather than his surroundings.\n\nThe man is wearing a white short-sleeved shirt with dark pants, and a cap; he appears focused on his task. The interior of the vehicle suggests it's a service or utility vehicle, given the presence of a dispatch radio and other equipment visible around him. The vehicle's dashboard displays multiple items including papers, a camera, and possibly some maps or other tools.\n\nProminently visible through the windshield is an American flag sticker and a safety sticker that reads \"SAFETY CHECKED\" in the lower right corner of the photograph. The man's surroundings are reflective of a suburban area with residential homes, one of which is directly behind the vehicle. A clear blue sky suggests a serene, daytime setting.\n\nThe image carries a vibe of everyday professional life, perhaps showing an individual from a public service or maintenance sector, attending to his responsibilities in a community setting.","title":"Frank reed of epa's Las Vegas national environmental research center makes his monthly rounds of tld (thermo-luminescent docimeter) wearers in alamo.
