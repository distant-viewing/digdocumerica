{"path":"548539.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts two fishing boats moored side by side in calm blue waters. Both boats are named \"CARIBE\" followed by the Roman numerals IV and V respectively. The boats are predominantly white with some beige or tan accents around their wheelhouses and along their hulls. They feature a variety of maritime equipment, including thick ropes, winches, and net pulleys, suggesting they are used for commercial fishing. The detailed rigging and sturdy structures indicate they are built to withstand the ocean conditions.\n\nEach wheelhouse has visible windows and antennas, possibly for navigational communications. A large cylindrical object, perhaps part of the fishing gear, is seen on the deck of one of the boats. The scene captures the functional aspects of the fishing industry, with the boats carrying tools necessary for their trade.\n\nThe background shows tranquility with the open water smoothly transitioning into a clear sky, hinting at good weather conditions. The foreground has part of another boat included in the frame, adding to the sense of a busy fishing harbor or docking area. The overall composition focuses on these workboats, portraying a snapshot of marine life and fishing activity.","title":"Shrimp boats at the commercial fishing docks","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["546939","548108","548546","548535","557815","542873","542911","547549","547553","543035","546388","552313","548547","550306","544186","547565"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","boat","pulley","winch","trade","rigging","docking","antenna","communication","harbor"]}
