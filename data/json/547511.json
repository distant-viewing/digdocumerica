{"path":"547511.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a historic train station. In the foreground, there are two sets of railroad tracks composed of steel rails and wooden ties, interspersed with gravel ballast. Leading the view towards the midground is the edge of a train platform, above which hangs a sign that reads \"KINGSTON.\" The platform appears to be quiet and unoccupied.\n\nThe main focus of the image is the old train station building constructed of dark wood. Its architecture includes a pitched roof and a square projection, likely a signal box, with arched double doors that are closed. Beneath this projected structure is part of the main building, also featuring a pronounced roofline that extends to cover the platform. The station exhibits a rustic look, characterized by weathered wooden siding, showing signs of aging and lack of recent maintenance. \n\nThe background behind the station and above the roofline includes a glimpse of utility lines, suggesting the presence of a somewhat developed area but there are no obvious signs of modern structures or heavy urbanization. The station itself conveys a sense of historical charm and appears to be from an earlier era of rail transportation. There's a general atmosphere of quietness and stillness, possibly indicating that the station is not frequently used, or captured at a moment of solitude.","title":"Railroad station at Kingston","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547656","556124","554563","556040","556125","556782","556778","557090","556129","556002","556131","556021","556768","556783","556022","556058"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Transportation Hubs"],"terms":["station","roofline","train","platform","rail","urbanization","quietness","signal","sign","railroad"]}
