{"path":"554965.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric scene within a dense forest. The setting is characterized by tall, straight trees towering overhead, their trunks appearing substantial and sturdy. The forest is predominantly filled with evergreen conifers, identifiable by their needle-like leaves.\n\nThe lighting in the image creates an ethereal feel; light filters softly through the forest canopy, casting a gentle bluish hue and creating pockets of light and shadow on the forest floor. The atmosphere is slightly misty or foggy, adding a mysterious, almost mystical quality to the scene.\n\nThe understory is visible with lush, green ferns and smaller shrubs covering the forest floor, indicating a moist and fertile environment. This rich undergrowth adds layers and texture to the image, enhancing the dense, wild feeling of the forest.\n\nThere are no people or animals visible in the scene, which emphasizes the quiet and untouched nature of the environment. The focus is entirely on the natural beauty and tranquility of this forest setting, inviting the viewer to contemplate the peacefulness and eerie beauty of the woods.","title":"One hundred to 200 year age class of old growth Douglas fir, hemlock, and vine maple with sword fern ground cover in Queets Valley, Olympic National Park, Washington.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555028","554393","555051","555120","554425","555118","542930","553574","554959","554990","542725","554394","549234","546947","550791","557596"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","floor","contemplate","fern","pocket","undergrowth","conifer","overhead","needle","peacefulness"]}
