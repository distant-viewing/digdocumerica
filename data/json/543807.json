{"path":"543807.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a textured and somewhat abstract scene. The image appears to show a collection of small, fluffy, cloud-like formations scattered across the frame. These formations are amber to brown in color, predominantly clustered towards the lower part of the image. The background is a clear, light blue sky that gradually transitions into a deeper blue at the top, suggesting either a vignette effect or a deeper depth of field emphasizing the sky. The surface of the photo seems to have a significant number of scratches and specks, indicative of either an old photographic print or a picture taken with a film camera with a dirty lens or internal debris. The overall composition has a dreamy, almost ethereal quality, with a focus on texture and color contrast between the earthy tones of the formations and the cool blues of the sky.","title":"Sewage sludge settles to bottom of beaker.
