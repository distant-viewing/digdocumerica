{"path":"545851.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This is a striking photograph showing a stark contrast between two different environments. In the foreground, there is a large junkyard filled with numerous old and damaged cars piled up. The density and chaotic arrangement of the vehicles indicate that this is likely a scrapyard or a salvage yard, suggesting a working-class or industrial area of a city.\n\nSurrounding the cars, there is dense vegetation, possibly small trees or large bushes, which partially obscure the view but add a textural contrast to the metal and colors of the cars. A few power lines and wooden utility poles are visible, crossing above the scrapyard and subtly leading the viewer's eye towards the city skyline in the background.\n\nIn the background, a modern and developed city skyline rises sharply in contrast to the junkyard. The skyline features several tall skyscrapers and notable buildings of different architectural styles and periods, indicating a cosmopolitan and economically developed urban center. Some of the buildings appear to be reflecting sunlight, suggesting the image was taken on a bright day.\n\nThe sky above the city is clear and slightly hazy, hinting at either smog or humidity typical of many urban centers, which might subtly suggest environmental themes or the growing concerns of urbanization. This photograph might be interpreted as a commentary on economic disparities, urban growth, or environmental impact owing to its powerful visual juxtaposition between the developed urban environment and the rundown, cluttered foreground of the salvage yard.","title":"AutoMobile junkyard with Houston skyline in background","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["549638","557283","551521","549782","549958","552740","549777","552043","545146","549768","549773","542660","545059","546267","543166","549776"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["salvage","junkyard","scrapyard","skyline","city","yard","urbanization","humidity","car","smog"]}
