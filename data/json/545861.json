{"path":"545861.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a peaceful river scene, capturing the natural beauty and tranquility of a flowing waterbody surrounded by lush vegetation. The river, appearing in the center of the image, runs horizontally and is characterized by its shimmering surface reflecting light. The moving water creates a dynamic texture on its surface, with ripples and light reflections adding a sense of motion.\n\nOn the left side of the riverbank, the scene is densely populated with various kinds of trees and shrubs, contributing to a lush green backdrop. A prominent dirt hill, likely formed due to erosion, is visible behind the trees, exposing a brownish, rugged texture contrasting with the greenery.\n\nThe right foreground of the image features more green vegetation, including a few tall plants with bright yellow flowers, possibly sunflowers, adding a pop of color against the green and brown tones of the scene. These plants are notably sharper in focus compared to the background, drawing attention to their details and vibrant color.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights the serene and untouched aspect of a natural landscape, emphasizing the beauty of the river and its surroundings. The play of light and shadow, along with the natural colors of the environment, contribute to a calm and inviting natural scene.","title":"Sunflowers and sewage on Simms Bayou","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["542653","550656","542523","550839","550782","550845","546171","551536","544861","542557","551348","555075","554762","542844","557106","542558"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["waterbody","river","pop","plant","kind","calm","erosion","beauty","play","texture"]}
