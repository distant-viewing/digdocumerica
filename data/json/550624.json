{"path":"550624.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a river intersecting with a roadway in a densely forested area. The central focus is a junction where a large, winding river splits into multiple branches, interacting with a complex road system that includes a major overpass and several smaller roads. Surrounding the junction area are clusters of buildings, possibly indicating a small residential or community setting nestled within a vast landscape of green trees. The trees heavily blanket the terrain except around the water and roads, presenting a natural scenic view. The image also shows minor vehicles or possible human activity around the infrastructure. A noticeable feature is the contrasting colors; the dark green of the forests, the varying gray and blacks of the roads, the bright white of exposed groundwork or facilities, and the murky blue-green of the river water. This photograph likely depicts a landscape where human development intersects with natural river paths, potentially highlighting issues of land use, infrastructure, and environmental interaction.","title":"Pipeline crossing at the klutina river, west of the town of copper center.
