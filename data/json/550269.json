{"path":"550269.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a residential construction site. Two workers, wearing white helmets and minimal clothes suitable for labor-intensive work, are engaged actively in their tasks. The scene is set during the daytime, evident from the daylight and shadows visible.\n\nIn the foreground, you see various construction materials and equipment scattered around, such as bricks, a wheelbarrow, wooden planks, and metal buckets. A concrete mixer is also positioned on the left side, close to one of the workers who seems to be moving towards it. The worker on the right is interacting with another worker slightly off-frame, seemingly handing over a bucket.\n\nThe house being constructed is predominantly white, with elements of structural detail that suggest a sophisticated design approach, including a stylish garage door. It features a steeply pitched roof, indicative of possibly a multiple-story structure, and several protruding sections and windows suggest room divisions and interior complexity.\n\nAdjacent to the main construction focus, there's another house with a completed exterior painted in dark green, showcasing the neighborhood's residential character. The area appears to be a new development, given the absence of mature vegetation and the presence of multiple houses in varying construction stages.\n\nThis is a busy, active construction site aimed at developing new residential properties, characterized by contemporary architecture and suburban setting.","title":"Colonial style buildings will distinguish shopping center under construction in Franklin, on Interstate 75 near State Route 73.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550284","543544","550273","557730","547833","546988","553922","546414","543592","556642","547989","543583","543594","553394","555373","548294"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["worker","construction","bucket","house","site","division","approach","garage","clothe","daytime"]}
