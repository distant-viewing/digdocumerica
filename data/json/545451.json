{"path":"545451.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph captures an urban highway scene, likely taken during the early morning or late afternoon, given the soft, diffused light and possible haze or smog that slightly obscures the cityscape in the background. The image shows a curved, multi-lane highway bustling with various vehicles including cars and large trucks. The road loops around, with interlinking ramps and bridges visible, suggesting a complex interchange system typical of large cities.\n\nIn the background, several high-rise buildings define the city's skyline, appearing somewhat shadowy due to the atmospheric conditions. These buildings vary in height and architectural styles, indicating an urban center with both commercial and possibly residential areas. The foreground is dominated by the roadway, bordered by grassy areas that show signs of urban wear and minimal maintenance.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somewhat somber, punctuated by the muted colors and the visible air quality. This setting could be indicative of environmental issues common in densely populated urban areas. The absence of vibrant colors and the dominance of grays and muted blues and greens suggest a typical overcast day in a busy metropolitan area.","title":"Smoke from industrial plants is a 24-hour fact of life in Birmingham.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["542682","545467","553475","549890","545432","553721","546612","553020","556194","546707","553021","547780","550175","546608","552719","546686"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","dominance","interchange","ramp","smog","city","roadway","issue","absence","height"]}
