{"path":"547632.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a narrow, sandy peninsula or spit extending into the water. The left side of the image shows a broad expanse of ocean with waves gently breaking along the sandy shoreline. The right side of the peninsula is bordered by a serene bay or lake. The land appears flat and is characterized by patches of scrub and grass, hinting at a possibly arid or semi-arid climate.\n\nAcross the peninsula, a series of paths or roads can be seen crisscrossing between sparse low-lying vegetation. There are very few visible structures, suggesting this is a relatively undeveloped area. The sandy color of the roads contrasts with the darker greens and browns of the natural vegetation.\n\nTo the bottom right of the peninsula, there is a group of small islands within the body of water, supporting similar sparse vegetation, which suggests a continuation of the peninsula's ecosystem into the aquatic environment.\n\nFurther back, opposite the peninsula across the water, a more densely populated area with numerous buildings can be seen, contrasting with the mostly natural and undeveloped landscape of the spit. The overall atmosphere evokes a sense of isolation and natural beauty, with stark geographical features.","title":"Barrier beaches","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["548604","554022","548785","547637","550640","554024","549520","552887","548989","554019","554156","554021","556966","552922","554018","557466"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["peninsula","scrub","continuation","vegetation","island","bay","road","ecosystem","climate","shoreline"]}
