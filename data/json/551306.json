{"path":"551306.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a sunbathing scene where a woman is lying on a red towel atop a rough, rocky surface. The setting appears to be a natural rocky area, possibly near a body of water or a geological formation. The rock surface has a layered structure, with dark, shadowed crevices that create a textured and rugged appearance.\n\nThe woman is dressed in a brightly colored bikini with vivid patterns that stand out against the dull, dark color of the rocks. She is lying on her side in a relaxed pose, with one arm resting along her head and the other along her body. Her legs are slightly bent, and her eyes are closed, suggesting a peaceful or restful state.\n\nThe overall composition of the image emphasizes a contrast between the harsh, unyielding texture of the rock and the soft, leisurely pose of the woman, offering a juxtaposition between nature and human relaxation. The image appears to be taken during bright daylight, highlighting details in both the texture of the rock and the vivid colors of the woman's attire.","title":"Rubbish heap in close proximity doesn't faze this sunbather on a rocky shore.","placename":"Ozark Lake (Ark.)","location":"Ozark Lake, Arkansas","nn1":["551249","547935","543310","548996","550242","550920","551972","548624","544339","547507","544946","545767","550232","550936","548621","545300"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["rock","woman","pose","bikini","crevice","towel","relaxation","leg","texture","daylight"]}
