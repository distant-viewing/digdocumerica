{"path":"544259.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a detailed and somewhat haunting scene set in what appears to be a cemetery. The primary focus is on a weathered grave marker, which is centrally positioned and made of stone. The marker features an engraved cross at the top and an inscription that reads, \"JAMES COULOZE,\" indicating the name of the deceased. Below the name, additional details indicate that he was from Poitou, Charente in France, both the birth (October 6, 1800) and death dates (December 16, 1874) are also noted, along with the inscription “Gone, but not forgotten.”\n\nThe background adds a deeper mood to the image. To the right side of the frame, dominating the background, is a statue of a robed figure. The statue stands with one arm raised, in what appears to be a gesture of benediction or farewell. The cloaked figure has a serene and almost sorrowful posture, contributing a poignant atmosphere to the image.\n\nBoth the grave marker and the statue are framed by the structural elements of an alcove or a small building with weathered walls showing significant age and moss or lichen growth. The background behind the statue is softly blurred but suggests a natural, grassy area which blends into a calm sky, complementing the somber scene in the foreground with a tranquil and isolating environment.","title":"\"Cemetery\"","placename":"Pointe a la Hache (La.)","location":"Pointe a la Hache, Louisiana","nn1":["546098","544267","554206","557941","558040","547417","550365","552486","545314","554792","549041","547801","546106","554210","550364","557942"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Religious Imagery"],"terms":["statue","marker","grave","inscription","name","lichen","date","cemetery","cross","figure"]}
