{"path":"545517.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a visually striking and somewhat ironic scene of environmental neglect juxtaposed with regulatory signage. The foreground prominently features a road that runs horizontally across the lower third of the image. A metal sign is positioned close to the left edge of the frame, standing alongside the road. The sign reads \"$100 FINE FOR DUMPING RUBBISH ON RIGHT OF WAY,\" suggesting a legally enforced prohibition against littering.\n\nBeyond the sign, along the roadside and spilling over into a partially wooded area, is an extensive amount of scattered refuse. This covers the middle and parts of the background of the picture. The debris comprises a variety of discarded items, including plastic bags, broken furniture, various containers, and other unidentifiable waste materials.\n\nThe background is framed by dense trees, suggesting that the location is semi-rural or on the outskirts of a more forested area. The sunlight filtering through the trees indicates that the photograph was likely taken during the day. This backdrop of natural greenery contrasts starkly with the man-made waste, highlighting the environmentally destructive impact of the littering depicted. \n\nOverall, the composition underscores the irony of the situation where the explicit warning of the sign is flagrantly ignored by the actual state of the environment surrounding it. It reflects a powerful message about the challenges of enforcing environmental regulations and promoting civic responsibility.","title":"Seen along route 263 approaching Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["553729","544813","546386","546805","550258","551247","552084","551245","550687","543664","544648","550352","548308","552100","547827","545494"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["sign","waste","responsibility","regulation","spill","situation","warning","promote","refuse","furniture"]}
