{"path":"554917.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph portrays a brown and white cow standing in a rural setting. The cow, possibly a dairy breed judging by its build and appearance, has a halter around its head and a large bell hanging from a strap around its neck, likely used for locating the animal when it is grazing. The cow's fur appears clean but slightly tousled, and it seems well-cared for.\n\nThe background features a rickety wooden fence and part of a barn or shed constructed with grayish corrugated metal, suggesting an outdoor area of a farm. The ground is covered in patches of dirt and possibly dry grass, common in pens or grazing areas used by farm animals.\n\nOverall, the composition and setting give off the feel of a working farm, highlighting an element of rural life focused on livestock management and care. The lighting suggests it could be early morning or late afternoon, providing soft and natural illumination to the scene. There isn't much vibrant color, mostly earth tones, which enhances the rustic aesthetic.","title":"Cow on a farm near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554560","552669","548984","542960","554949","554948","554950","542626","548959","548065","552567","548960","545153","552465","546102","542652"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cow","farm","animal","halter","grazing","breed","judging","strap","build","bell"]}
