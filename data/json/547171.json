{"path":"547171.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial or construction scene near a body of water. In the foreground, there is a pile of large white rocks or rubble, suggesting some form of heavy construction or maintenance work, possibly related to coastal management or the construction of a barrier.\n\nA large crane dominates the left side of the image, its arm extended upwards and tipped with a visible flame, commonly found on equipment like pile drivers, or used for signaling or hazard reduction. Alongside the crane, there are multiple construction vehicles, including what appear to be trucks and possibly other heavy machinery, stationed near the waterâ€™s edge.\n\nIn the background, there is a body of water that is fairly turbulent, with waves splashing against and over more rocks, which might be part of a man-made breakwater or jetty. This setup might be part of efforts to protect coastal areas from erosion or to manage water flows for environmental or navigation purposes.\n\nAcross the water, residential or small commercial structures can be seen, indicating that this area is likely on the outskirts of a town or city. Trees that appear to be without leaves suggest that the season might be either fall or winter.\n\nThe sky is clear, implying good visibility and no immediate adverse weather conditions, ideal for such outdoor activities. The overall composition and elements in the image suggest a focus on infrastructure development or maintenance, possibly related to coastal or waterway management.","title":"Reinforcing Sheridan road in evanston","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["546833","545858","544282","548361","545655","548775","545648","548774","548559","547216","547970","549308","545631","555796","545657","544753"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["construction","management","crane","maintenance","extended","breakwater","pile","hazard","statione","flame"]}
