{"path":"543642.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting with various elements typical of a manufacturing or processing plant. The foreground features a large pile of dark material, which could be coal or some type of ore, and a yellow heavy machinery vehicle, possibly a bulldozer or a loader, is visible working on or near the pile. This scene suggests ongoing industrial operations, perhaps related to mining or material handling.\n\nIn the middle ground, several industrial structures and machinery are present. There's a prominent white tower emitting steam or smoke, hinting at some form of energy production or chemical processing occurring within the plant. Adjacent to this, there are other steel structures including silos, pipes, and large tanks, all interconnected, likely part of the process line of the plant.\n\nThe background shows a striking natural landscape with large, flat-topped mountains or mesas, which give a stark contrast to the industrial foreground. This juxtaposition highlights the interaction between industrial development and natural environments.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its industrial elements set against a natural backdrop, might be used to evoke discussions on topics such as energy production, environmental impact, or the coexistence of industrial activities with natural landscapes. The lighting and color tones suggest the image was taken either in the late afternoon or during an overcast day, which casts a moody ambiance over the scene.","title":"Union Carbide uranium mill","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["555591","557374","551036","544736","554764","551026","544390","554632","544068","552544","544059","544048","551037","554763","554625","557403"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["production","energy","processing","plant","topic","mesa","loader","ore","pile","machinery"]}
