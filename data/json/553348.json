{"path":"553348.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures a scene focused on an undetermined object or material floating or partially submerged in water, resembling a frothy or cloudy formation. The water itself has a dark, murky tone, suggesting a significant depth or the presence of sediment. Its surface is rippled, indicating either wind or movement within the water. The frothy formation is lighter in color, almost whitish, contrasting sharply with the dark water around it. It looks somewhat dispersed, spreading into the surrounding water.\n\nThere are no visible landmarks or backgrounds that provide context to the location; the photograph focuses almost entirely on the water and the aberrant formation within it. The ambiance suggested by the image is somewhat mysterious or ambiguous, leaving the nature of the floating object open to interpretation. No people, activities, or other objects are visible in the image, putting the entire emphasis on the natural and possibly polluted aquatic environment.","title":"The floating sludge on the Nashua River is paper mill waste.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550849","543194","557252","555336","550815","545168","555626","550817","545923","553388","545164","550686","550368","547905","552054","553871"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["formation","object","water","interpretation","landmark","sediment","emphasis","wind","context","movement"]}
