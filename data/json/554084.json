{"path":"554084.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic scene featuring a modest wooden cabin with a tin roof in a rural setting. The cabin is small, with a front porch visible, highlighted by the warm light suggesting either sunrise or sunset. Itâ€™s set on a grassy elevation with a slight incline leading up to the house. \n\nIn the foreground, the landscape includes rough, overgrown grass and weeds, strewn with some wooden planks and debris, presenting a somewhat untidy appearance. A wooden fence, slightly dilapidated, borders the property on one side, contributing to the rural, lived-in character of the setting.\n\nThe background is lined with several tall trees that dominate the scene, adding a dense, leafy canopy over the area. The sky above is a deep blue with a few clouds, indicating clear weather conditions. Power lines can faintly be seen extending across the top right corner of the image, suggesting that despite the isolated feel, modern amenities might be accessible.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a peaceful, if somewhat solitary, atmosphere typical of rural dwellings. The low sun casts dramatic lighting, giving the image a calm, serene quality, and emphasizing the natural beauty and simplicity of the environment.","title":"House in rural district along Highway 36 near Hana.
