{"path":"556995.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a dark, somewhat blurry aerial or elevated view of a densely wooded area. Within the woods, there appears to be a body of water that is reflecting the sky, giving a glimpse of sunlight or light colored sky through the dense green foliage. On the left side of the image, there are signs of a road or a clearing that curves slightly and travels vertically up the frame.\n\nThe picture is prominent with dark green hues and patches of blue, possibly indicating an overcast sky mirrored in the waters amidst the trees. The terrain is rugged and natural, and the overall atmosphere of the photograph gives an impression of a remote or wilderness area, possibly captured during twilight or under low light conditions which contributes to the overall darker, moody tone of the image.","title":"Aerial view of typical residences along Hood Canal, south of Bangor Annex. This area and others like it will be affected by population growth when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby. A \"new city\" is proposed to house a substantial portion of the projected 27,000 people who will move into the area when the naval installation is complete.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["556931","555728","553564","556906","547534","553594","556910","555702","545488","550626","555217","550620","553567","557001","550601","553568"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["clearing","twilight","wilderness","picture","impression","glimpse","wood","foliage","sky","sunlight"]}
