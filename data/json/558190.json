{"path":"558190.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures an informal, candid moment among spectators at an outdoor event, possibly located in a stadium or park. The central figure is a young girl with light brown hair styled in pigtails, tied with white ribbons. She is eating an ice cream stick and looking to the side with a surprised expression on her face. She is wearing a light-colored sleeveless dress adorned with a pink floral design near the bottom.\n\nBeside her, slightly out of focus, is a small, fluffy Pomeranian dog with a light caramel-colored coat. The dog is facing forward and seems to be calmly sitting on the concrete steps, its leash visible and held by someone sitting next to it.\n\nOn the left side of the image, partially visible are parts of other spectators. One boy, possibly in his teens, has his back to the camera, wearing a striped shirt. The atmosphere looks lively, yet relaxed, typical of a public gathering for an event. Overall, the scene is bathed in soft, natural lighting, suggesting it is either late afternoon or early evening.","title":"Youngster unknowingly has shared her ice cream stick with the dog as she watches judging during the kiddies parade in Johnson Park in New Ulm, Minnesota. The parade is an annual event held early in the evening during the summer. The town is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming community of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe.
