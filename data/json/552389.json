{"path":"552389.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image depicts an individual focusing intently on drafting or drawing on a large sheet of paper that is spread out on a desk. This person, a man, is wearing a neat white shirt, black glasses, and a black-and-white patterned tie. He is captured in the process of tracing or sketching with a red pencil. The visible details of the sheet suggest a meticulous diagram or map, featuring grid-like sections and curving lines, structured with precision.\n\nThe man is bent over the table to get a closer view of his work, which shows his dedication and attention to detail. The work environment appears well-lit and office-like, indicating that this is a setting dedicated to technical or architectural work. His wristwatch, partly visible under his shirt's cuff, adds an element of professionalism and punctuality to his demeanor. The background is softly out of focus, heightening the focus on the subject's engagement with his task. The overall impression is that of a professional absorbed in precise analytical work, likely within an engineering, architectural, or planning field. The photo captures a moment of intense concentration, embodying a workplace scenario centered around detailed and exact work.","title":"The Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), is a unique, multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group.
