{"path":"556630.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of numerous beverage can tops, all tightly arranged to fill the entire frame. The can tops are all pull-tab style, typical of older soda or beer cans. Each top has the word \"SCHLITZ\" prominently embossed along the tab and around the central opening mechanism, indicating they are likely from cans of Schlitz beer.\n\nThe tops are metallic and reflect light, giving them a shimmering appearance. Some show signs of wear or slight rust, suggesting they might not be new. The arrangement of the can tops creates a repetitive and textured pattern that dominates the visual interest of the image. The background is not visible as the frame is fully covered by the closely packed can tops. The overall color tone of the image is a blend of dark and metallic hues, with the lighting enhancing the details on each can top, such as the embossing and the shape of the pull-tabs.","title":"One example of wall construction in experimental housing using empty steel beer and soft drink cans near Taos, New Mexico. Cans for non-load bearing walls such as this can be laid horizontally and will be plastered over when the house is completed. Exterior and load bearing walls employ eight can blocks wired together. Houses using can construction can be built for as much as 20% less than conventional structures, reports designer Michael Reynolds.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["556616","548755","547506","548758","555314","550805","543711","556631","552529","548753","543696","554847","543616","556614","552937","549788"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["beer","top","can","soda","beverage","show","mechanism","opening","rust","word"]}
