{"path":"551575.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal industrial site. The main features include large, open piles of white materials, possibly salt, gypsum, or another mineral, spread across several sections of the landscape. These white piles are prominent against the dark water and the green-toned land areas. \n\nIn the central part of the image, a large industrial structure, likely a processing plant or factory, is visible with multiple storage units and conveyors, evident from its metallic contours and the dark, coal-like material around it. This complex is situated adjacent to a body of water, which could be a harbor, as there are hints of docks and possibly ships. \n\nThere is a network of roads connecting different parts of the site, and towards the bottom right, a more verdant area with trees can be seen, suggesting the edge of the industrial zone. A small rock outcrop or islet near the shoreline at the bottom of the image adds a natural element to the otherwise heavily modified landscape.\n\nThe surrounding waters are deep blue, and there is a minor froth at the shoreline, indicating waves or currents impacting the coast. The overall impression is one of significant human impact on a coastal ecosystem, primarily for industrial purposes.","title":"SouthWesterly currents have carried taconite tailings discharged by reserve mining company's plant in silver bay, to stony point, eight miles away.
