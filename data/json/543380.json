{"path":"543380.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a man and a woman examining a map together in a rugged outdoor setting. The background is a dramatic mountain landscape with rocky, jagged peaks and patches of snow visible on the higher elevations. The foreground is strewn with large rocks and some sparse vegetation, indicating a high altitude or a remote location.\n\nThe woman is wearing a wide-brimmed hat, a short-sleeve green shirt, light-colored shorts, white socks, and hiking boots. She holds the map open and seems to be discussing or looking at it intently. The man is sporting a dark-colored fedora, sunglasses, a light khaki shirt, dark shorts, and similarly styled hiking boots as the woman. He leans towards the map, showing interest in whatever is being pointed out or discussed.\n\nBoth appear to be carrying backpacks, suggesting they are engaged in a hiking or mountaineering expedition. Their attire and gear imply readiness for a day spent outdoors trekking in the mountains. The presence of clear skies and bright sunlight suggests it is a favorable day for such activities.","title":"Packing expedition of Explorer Post 397 of Los Angeles area.
