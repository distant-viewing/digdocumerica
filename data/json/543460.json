{"path":"543460.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures two people on a sunny beach scene, playing by the water's edge. One person, a woman, appears joyful and is caught mid-motion, arms raised and one leg slightly lifted as if dancing or jumping in excitement. She wears a full-length purple dress and her hair is dark and flowing down her back. Beside her, a man is also running along the beach; he is dressed in a dark green towel wrapped around his waist and is shirtless, his bare back to the camera.\n\nThe background shows a lively ocean with white surf and waves rolling in towards the shore. The sky is clear and bright blue, adding a vibrant color palette to the scene. The beach itself looks sandy and expansive, reflecting the sunlight which enhances the overall cheerful and energetic mood of the moment captured.\n\nThere is no one else in the immediate vicinity within the frame, emphasizing the two individuals' interaction with the natural surroundings. The playfulness and freedom expressed through their gestures suggest a moment of relaxation and enjoyment in a serene beach setting.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["550923","552977","546413","553072","543498","548805","553882","547507","543216","543517","548793","543458","544206","545194","543397","547688"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","express","playfulness","lifte","jump","surf","dance","waist","freedom","excitement"]}
