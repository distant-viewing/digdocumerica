{"path":"548866.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a modern institutional building with a mid-century architectural design. The building has two stories, characterized by a symmetrical facade with a slightly recessed central section flanked by two protruding wings, each featuring large, evenly spaced rectangular windows that are both functional and decorative. The façade's color appears to be a mix of grey and beige, possibly constructed from concrete or a similar material.\n\nThere's a neatly kept, sprawling green lawn in front of the building, enhancing its formal appearance. A few small bushes and a solitary tree are visible, adding a touch of natural beauty to the landscape.\n\nIn front of the building, near its center, stands a solitary flagpole with a flag, suggesting the building may serve an official or governmental purpose. The sky above is partially cloudy, casting a vibrant and dynamic backdrop which contrasts with the structured, orderly nature of the building and its surroundings.\n\nForegrounding the view is rough natural vegetation, possibly implying that the photo was taken from a distance or from a less cultivated part of the property. This natural framing focuses the viewer's attention towards the building, emphasizing its prominence and isolation.","title":"EPA national research center at Las Vegas","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["546448","546456","546473","546542","546464","546543","546460","546329","542593","546468","546481","546702","558146","551613","546539","549360"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["building","flagpole","prominence","front","wing","façade","framing","concrete","property","lawn"]}
