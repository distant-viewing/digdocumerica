{"path":"550443.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"In the photograph, an individual is seated on a grassy and rocky terrain while holding a camera and apparently inspecting or cleaning it. The terrain is covered with short, reddish-brown vegetation. This person, with shaggy hair and dressed in dark outdoor clothing, is surrounded by various outdoor gear items, including a large backpack, a couple of water bottles, a gas stove, and other small pieces of equipment scattered around.\n\nThe background features a vast, mountainous landscape with steep, rocky slopes. The mountains, devoid of trees, have a barren, rugged appearance typical of high-altitude or northern environments. The sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting cool or temperate weather. To the left and slightly behind the person, a white sheep or goat can be seen grazing, further emphasizing the wilderness setting of the scene. The image exudes a sense of isolation and the beauty of a remote natural environment, where the individual seems engaged in wildlife photography or some form of outdoor exploratory activity.","title":"Having spent two hours creeping up on them, photographer dennis cowals prepares to take pictures of a flock of dall sheep they are coming down toward the west lick, one of two salt licks on either end of the atigun gorge.
