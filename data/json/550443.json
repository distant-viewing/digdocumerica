{"path":"550443.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"In the photograph, an individual is seated on a grassy and rocky terrain while holding a camera and apparently inspecting or cleaning it. The terrain is covered with short, reddish-brown vegetation. This person, with shaggy hair and dressed in dark outdoor clothing, is surrounded by various outdoor gear items, including a large backpack, a couple of water bottles, a gas stove, and other small pieces of equipment scattered around.\n\nThe background features a vast, mountainous landscape with steep, rocky slopes. The mountains, devoid of trees, have a barren, rugged appearance typical of high-altitude or northern environments. The sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting cool or temperate weather. To the left and slightly behind the person, a white sheep or goat can be seen grazing, further emphasizing the wilderness setting of the scene. The image exudes a sense of isolation and the beauty of a remote natural environment, where the individual seems engaged in wildlife photography or some form of outdoor exploratory activity.","title":"Having spent two hours creeping up on them, photographer Dennis Cowals prepares to take pictures of a flock of Dall sheep. They are coming down toward the west lick, one of two salt licks on either end of the Atigun Gorge. This view looks south into the Brooks Range.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545753","554460","554500","554507","554515","545776","543378","543371","545766","554514","545786","545762","558108","542751","549083","554509"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["goat","stove","sheep","backpack","photography","person","bottle","gas","altitude","terrain"]}
