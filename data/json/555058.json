{"path":"555058.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a dense, lush forest scene, vividly showcasing the wildness and natural disorder of a woodland ecosystem. Dominating the image is a variety of trees and flora, rich with moss and tangled undergrowth.\n\nIn the foreground, there is thick moss covering the ground and fallen tree branches, suggesting a moist environment. Various branches and parts of trees are interlaced, displaying a chaotic yet organic form, with some branches bare and others covered in moss or lichen.\n\nA notable feature is a tree stump draped in moss, standing out amid the surrounding greenery. Several trees in the background rise straight and tall, partially obscured by the mist or soft light that gives the forest depth and a slightly ethereal quality.\n\nThe canopy above is dense, allowing minimal light to penetrate, which highlights the vibrancy of the green moss and leaves. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is serene and primordially wild, conveying a sense of quiet and untouched natural beauty.","title":"Wind fall in a spruce climax forest on an ocean strip in the pacific coast area of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555000","554985","555054","545285","554961","542958","555043","554958","554980","554975","545271","554976","555183","555057","555028","555151"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","branch","wildness","disorder","penetrate","tree","bare","tangle","forest","undergrowth"]}
