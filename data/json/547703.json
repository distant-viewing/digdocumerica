{"path":"547703.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a majestic aerial view of a large bridge spanning across a wide body of water, probably taken around sunset given the deep oranges and reds bathing the scene. The bridge showcases visible architectural details including truss structures and is supported by multiple pillars, gracefully curving into the distance. Below the bridge, the water reflects the sunset colors, giving it a warm, glowing appearance.\n\nOn the near side, parallel to the bridge, is a straight highway packed with vehicles, suggesting a time of busy traffic. The vehicles are visible as tiny specks, indicative of the height from which the photo was taken. Bordering the highway are darkened land areas, possibly forested or developed land with less distinct features due to the lighting and resolution.\n\nThe visibility decreases towards the edges of the photo, fading into shadowy zones, emphasizing the central bridge and highway. The horizon is not sharply defined, suggesting either fog or low clouds merging water with the sky. There are no visible human figures; the focus is entirely on the infrastructure and natural landscape, rendered in a somewhat moody and dramatic light due to the time of day and the photographic filters or exposure used.","title":"Tappan Zee Bridge at Nyack on the Hudson River","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548415","548413","546870","552846","543087","546810","548207","558051","549547","552598","542804","557096","549469","543050","547669","548401"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","highway","sunset","truss","land","speck","filter","pillar","time","fog"]}
