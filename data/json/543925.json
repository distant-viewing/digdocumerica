{"path":"543925.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a formal gathering taking place in a brightly lit, spacious hall with an interior design that suggests the event could be in the 1960s or 1970s. In the foreground, various attendees are seated at long tables covered with white tablecloths, closely attending to the proceedings. These people appear to be partaking in a meal or possibly tea, as evidenced by the plates and cups in front of them.\n\nAt the front of the hall, a man stands at a podium delivering a speech to the audience. He is flanked by a table where several individuals, likely dignitaries or officials, are seated facing the crowd; they are attentively listening to the speaker. The backdrop behind the speaker and the seated officials features a double staircase leading to an upper floor, which is lined with glass railings.\n\nThe walls are adorned with numerous posters and banners displaying various messages and colorful graphics, adding a lively visual element to the setting. The posters seem to be advertisements or informational graphics related to community initiatives, products, or services. The abundance and variety of these posters suggest that the event may be related to a community or educational function, possibly involving local businesses or creative projects.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of formal communication or presentation, set in a community-friendly environment, emphasizing engagement and possibly the exchange of ideas or information among participants.","title":"Environmental awards dinner","placename":"Fort Smith (Ark.)","location":"Fort Smith, Arkansas","nn1":["543924","556451","545384","557703","556694","543917","552618","547365","554333","557704","556068","551852","549073","556028","556253","547367"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["poster","official","speaker","hall","community","seat","table","idea","tablecloth","exchange"]}
