{"path":"547159.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph portrays an outdoor scene involving a middle-aged man engaged in the process of discarding or arranging metal barrels. He is depicted lifting one of the barrels onto or off a flatbed truck. The setting is rustic, featuring a backdrop characterized by a sparse woodland with trees devoid of leaves, indicating it might be autumn or winter.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows some elements of disorder with scattered rubbish, including some plastic and paper debris around a dilapidated wooden structure that looks akin to a makeshift shed or storage unit. On the truck, besides the man, there are several other barrels and containers, suggesting that this activity might be related to clearing or managing waste materials.\n\nVisual elements such as the drab colors, overcast sky, and bare trees lend a somewhat bleak and desolate atmosphere to the scene. The truck is an older model, as indicated by its style and wear, reinforcing the utilitarian nature of its use in this context.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a strong sense of manual labor and possibly environmental clean-up or waste management in a rural or semi-wilderness area.","title":"Garbage collection at Bass Lake","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["542549","547208","556324","546902","556323","546380","553041","543896","543762","546377","547611","543806","542550","550162","549743","549949"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["barrel","truck","waste","disorder","flatbed","rubbish","woodland","shed","plastic","unit"]}
