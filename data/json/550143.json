{"path":"550143.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph presents an urban scene filled with several layers of visual elements that convey a sense of bustling city life and commerce from a vantage point of an observer, likely taken from a road or higher elevation. The foreground features a bustling highway where multiple cars, representative of an earlier period given their design, are traversing in both directions. Speed limit signs are visible, showing limits of 50 mph minimum and 35 mph maximum.\n\nBehind the highway, the middle ground is dominated by an older commercial building prominently displaying various advertisements. Signs advertising \"Van Roy Coffee\", \"Johnson Motors\", and \"Intl Lake Marine\" are affixed to the fa√ßade of the brick building, suggesting the area's industrial and commercial uses. Additionally, a large clock and a signboard for \"Calvert Extra\" liquor are visible, emphasizing a common theme of advertisement in urban spaces.\n\nAbove the building, numerous billboards are stacked, adding to the commercial atmosphere. These billboards display ads for different products and services, including a bank (prominently labeled \"Society National Bank\") and a playful image of a child and an adult, possibly connected to the same bank advertisement.\n\nIn the background, contrasting the density of the foreground and middle ground, there are higher modern buildings that form the city skyline, signaling a central business district. The taller buildings, with their modern architecture, stand in stylistic contrast to the older, industrial foreground buildings, illustrating the architectural evolution of the city.\n\nOverall, this photograph provides a snapshot of an urban environment where commerce, advertisements, and busy traffic converge under the backdrop of a diverse cityscape, highlighting both historical and modern elements.","title":"Signs and more signs on Memorial Shoreway","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553301","554307","543961","547369","555782","553845","545216","555743","552712","551494","550153","549113","545382","556193","549224","546616"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["advertisement","limit","billboard","commerce","highway","city","building","bank","evolution","representative"]}
