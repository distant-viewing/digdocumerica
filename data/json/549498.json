{"path":"549498.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a landscape where natural and man-made structures intersect. Prominently featured is a large river, which flows from the top to the bottom of the image, with visible white water currents indicating turbulence or fast flow. Adjacent to the river on the left side is a dense forested area, showcasing lush greenery and a natural, untouched appearance.\n\nTo the right of the river, there is a substantial hydroelectric power plant marked by geometric concrete structures from which water vapor is visibly emanating, suggesting activity. This generates a striking contrast between the natural flow of the river and the mechanized, controlled environment of the power plant.\n\nBeside the power plant, paralleling the river, is a wide highway that is clearly divided into lanes with vehicles visible in motion, providing a sense of scale and everyday human activity. Beyond the highway, the area transitions into a more residential or possibly small commercial zone, characterized by buildings, parking lots, and neatly organized roads.\n\nThe photograph captures a diverse tableau that juxtaposes natural beauty with human engineering and urban development, illustrating the interaction between natural landscapes and human modifications.","title":"Aerial view of the Niagara River showing sewage discharge from the city of Niagara Falls.
