{"path":"547081.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene featuring a road closure at a beach or lakeside location. In the foreground, there is a prominent barricade with a sign that reads \"ROAD CLOSED\". The barricade is constructed from horizontal beams painted in a striped black and white pattern, and fitted with round reflectors.\n\nBeyond the barricade, the ground appears muddy and strewn with debris, such as pieces of wood and what might be fragments of the paved surface. This suggests some sort of damage perhaps due to natural forces or construction activity.\n\nTwo individuals, probably women, are standing near the water's edge to the left of the barricade. Both are wearing long coats, and one appears to be looking out towards the water, possibly involved in a conversation. They seem unaffected by the condition of the road and are more engaged with the waterfront view.\n\nThe background features a clear blue sky and the calm water of a lake or sea, enhancing the tranquility of the scene, contrasting with the disarray at the road.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the road closure sign in the immediate foreground and the human subjects positioned near the calm waters, suggests a narrative of interruption amidst a serene natural setting. The presence of the individuals gives a human element to what could otherwise be interpreted as a desolate scene.","title":"Aftermath of flooding near Lake Michigan in Zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547095","547111","554789","555582","555628","545624","547904","542984","547836","556943","544245","545620","555647","548197","545680","557482"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["barricade","road","interruption","disarray","fragment","lakeside","sort","force","damage","water"]}
