{"path":"548923.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image shows a close-up view of what appears to be a celestial object, specifically a planet. The photograph is dominated by a deep red color. The object has a textured surface visible in various shades of dark and light red. On the upper half of the sphere, there are patchy, checkerboard patterns that could resemble some form of mapping or imaging data, indicative of scientific observation.\n\nThere are also visible lines and swirls across the surface, suggesting geological features such as canyons or weather systems. The background is entirely dark, emphasizing the vivid red sphere in the foreground. The overall composition highlights the planet, focusing on its textures and patterns, suggesting this might be an image taken in infrared or through some filter for scientific observation purposes, possibly of a planet like Mars.","title":"Colorado River-- from a helicopter over Needles","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547675","546152","546119","555793","555182","543148","553582","548914","544682","548814","546110","552239","545799","550442","543149","543151"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["sphere","observation","swirl","datum","filter","object","canyon","half","pattern","system"]}
