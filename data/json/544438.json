{"path":"544438.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The image is an aerial photograph depicting a rural landscape with various environmental and human activities.\n\nIn the center and left part of the photograph, there is a large excavation site characterized by significant soil disturbance. The presence of machinery, possibly dump trucks or excavators, indicates ongoing construction or mining operations. Near these machines, several piles of logs or lumber and smaller built structures are visible, suggesting logging activity or temporary setups for workers.\n\nSurrounding the site, there are two main bodies of water reflecting a deep blue color, likely ponds or small lakes, which might be natural or resultant from the excavation work. These water bodies are scattered across the image, surrounded by patches of land and trees.\n\nThe broader setting is rural and wooded, with numerous trees dotting the landscape. Grass-covered paths or dirt roads meander through the trees, connecting different areas of the scene. These paths hint at minimal human intervention in some parts of the land, preserving a more natural environment compared to the heavily operated area in the image.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a blend of nature and industrial activities, highlighting human impact on rural landscapes through construction, excavation, or possibly mining operations. It also shows the adaptation of the land around these activities, with roads and paths that facilitate movement and access.","title":"Scarred land in central Texas","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551204","550572","553051","549255","544498","550573","555812","542948","550568","551187","551611","555859","543861","556913","556922","549169"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["excavation","path","land","mining","log","site","adaptation","lumber","excavator","construction"]}
