{"path":"542814.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from a storefront window. The store, identified as a gift shop by the text on the window (\"MERRY GIFTS 4U GIFT SHOP\"), is located in a building with the address \"108\" labeled above the right door. Displayed prominently in the window is a figure of a pirate or sailor holding a large anchor. The figure is positioned in a dynamic pose, adding a thematic element to the display.\n\nInside the store, visible through the clear glass of the storefront, are two older individuals, possibly the shop owners or workers. One person, standing and facing towards the window, seems engaged in conversation or observing the window display, while the other, who is bald and wears glasses, is seated and appears to be reading or writing at a desk. The store has a sign stating \"FOR SALE\" hanging inside, suggesting the business or property is on the market.\n\nThe overall scene suggests a moment in everyday life, capturing both the static display of the window mannequin and the active, yet mundane activities of the people inside. There's a stark contrast between the lively figure in the window and the calm, routine demeanor of the people inside the shop.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543470","548242","556207","557808","547805","557809","557763","552413","546034","557803","547342","556214","543132","550132","546672","552637"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["window","shop","store","figure","display","sailor","owner","address","glass","desk"]}
