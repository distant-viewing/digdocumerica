{"path":"543575.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial setting featuring a large, heavy-duty metal structure with striated panels running diagonally across the frame. The structure is composed of thick metal ribs that support numerous parallel slats, casting strong linear shadows on the surfaces below them. Along the lower part of the image, thereâ€™s a concrete base that seems to serve as a pathway, flanked by a metal railing on one side. The sunlight filtering through the panels highlights their dusty and somewhat weathered texture, indicating that the structure is outdoors and exposed to elements. The shadows created by the slats are sharp and well-defined, suggesting the photo was taken during a time of day when the sun was at a particular angle, probably midday or early afternoon. Overall, the atmosphere is reminiscent of a covered walkway or a segment of an industrial facility explicitly built for a functional purpose like ventilation or light modulation. No people are visible in the image, emphasizing the architectural and structural elements of the scene.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["555328","557388","557976","546029","557387","557391","546510","543258","543997","557386","552030","545992","557390","556390","557298","556503"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["slat","panel","metal","ventilation","segment","midday","duty","walkway","pathway","railing"]}
