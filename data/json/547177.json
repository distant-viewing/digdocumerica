{"path":"547177.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene at a rugged coastal location. A large orange crawler tractor, equipped with a bulldozer blade, is situated at the top left part of the image, adjacent to a newly dug trench. The trench is oriented towards the viewer, leading from the tractor directly to the edge of what appears to be a muddy water body or wetland.\n\nThe trench is filled with water, and its muddy sides are unevenly excavated, with areas of pooled water visible around it, indicating recent digging or water movement. The surrounding terrain is barren and consists of muddy and rocky soil, typical of a coastal area with minimal vegetation. In the distance, beyond the trench and muddy areas, the sea or a large body of water is visible, merging with the skyline under a mostly clear sky with a few clouds.\n\nThe setting seems isolated, focused on land reclamation or perhaps construction related to water management, considering the proximity to the water and the presence of the trench filled with water. The overall atmosphere is one of remote industrial activity, possibly concerning environmental management or development projects.","title":"Floodwaters trapped behind earthen seawall are drained.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547939","543111","545665","548775","551262","552814","547926","547151","544654","547254","549205","545661","545662","555608","555559","551947"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["trench","tractor","water","management","reclamation","digging","blade","bulldozer","project","wetland"]}
