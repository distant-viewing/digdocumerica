{"path":"549741.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene at a landfill, where a heavy-duty bulldozer is actively engaged in managing waste. The machine, which appears aged and industrial, with a large front shovel, is partially obscured by the flurry of seagulls surrounding and flying above it. The landfill is filled with a jumbled assortment of discarded items, which creates a chaotic and cluttered landscape. Dozens of seagulls are in flight, adding a dynamic and somewhat chaotic element to the scene. The background features a hilly, wooded area, which contrasts starkly with the stark, man-made environment of the landfill. The atmosphere appears slightly hazy, which might suggest dust or pollution typical of such industrial settings. The overall composition of the photo captures the interaction between human activity, waste management, and wildlife.","title":"Hackensack dump is feeding ground for gulls.
