{"path":"542499.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a scene involving two individuals and a biplane, shot during the early morning or late afternoon, given the presence of long shadows and soft lighting. The biplane, prominently colored in yellow with a black accent, features a specific mention of \"Central Valley Aviation\" along its side, hinting at its operational context, possibly in a farming-related aerial activity, like crop dusting.\n\nIn the photograph, one person, dressed in a white jumpsuit and helmet, is standing on the wing of the biplane, seemingly engaged in loading or adjusting an unseen object in the biplane's open cockpit. This person's attire and the helmet suggest they might be the pilot or a crew member prepared for flight. Another individual, also in a matching white jumpsuit, stands on the ground assisting the first, either handing over equipment or communicating about the task at hand.\n\nThe ground is only partially visible, but it appears to be a paved surface typical of an airstrip. The background is mostly taken up by the light sky, hinting at an expansive, open field typical for airports. The composition emphasizes the teamwork and preparation involved in aviation activities, using the sharp angles of the biplane's wings and the people's positioning to draw attention to the central action of preparing for a flight. Shadows cast on the ground add an artistic dimension to the image, enlivening the entire scene with a play of light and form.","title":"Preparing to sulfur-dust grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542498","542496","548881","542578","542576","542506","548884","553873","548841","549072","542504","542577","547247","542500","542508","545935"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["biplane","jumpsuit","wing","flight","helmet","prepare","dusting","aviation","pilot","cockpit"]}
