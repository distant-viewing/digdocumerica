{"path":"546461.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a sunny day scene at what appears to be a school or college campus. In the foreground, two young women are seen walking along a paved path. The woman on the left is wearing a red jacket, blue jeans, and is carrying a red book or notebook. The woman on the right is dressed in a plaid coat and a scarf, holding yellow books or folders. Both seem engaged in a conversation.\n\nThe background shows modern, single-story buildings with flat roofs and large, repeated window panes that provide views into the corridors or rooms. Adjacent to the building is an extended roof that creates a covered walkway, supported by pillars. \n\nThe campus environment is lush with a well-maintained grassy area lining the pathway, dotted with small flowers. The scene is peaceful, with only a few individuals visible in the distance, including a person farther down the path and others near the building's entrance.\n\nThe sky is bright and partly cloudy, suggesting a pleasant day conducive to outdoor activities. The architecture, open spaces, and casual attire of the subjects together suggest a relaxed academic atmosphere typical of educational institutions.","title":"Parkside Elementary School, built in 1962","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546522","546541","546532","558033","557171","546431","546465","546563","558205","546493","558211","543036","551815","546545","546489","551923"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["campus","book","folder","woman","notebook","institution","path","corridor","repeat","scarf"]}
