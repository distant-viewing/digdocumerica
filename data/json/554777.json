{"path":"554777.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a somber, natural landscape showing a river flowing through a narrow valley. The river, appearing a slate blue or gray, gently winds through the scene, embraced by steep, rocky slopes on either side. The slopes are covered with a blanket of small rocks and sparse vegetation, suggesting a rough, barren terrain. There are no trees directly adjacent to the riverbanks, indicating that the area might be regularly subjected to high water levels or poor soil conditions that inhibit large vegetation growth.\n\nThe sky is overcast with a heavy cloud cover, casting a cool, bluish hue over the entire scene, enhancing the melancholic and secluded mood of the landscape. There's no evidence of human activity or presence in this scene, which adds to the feeling of isolation and untouched natural beauty.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on the contrast between the smooth surface of the river and the rugged textures of the rocky valley sides. The river leads the viewer's eye through the photograph, gently curving around, and disappearing into the background, suggesting continuation beyond what is visible. The photograph could be depicting a scenario in late autumn or early winter, judging by the apparent lack of foliage and the overall dormant look of the landscape.","title":"Pond of stagnant water remains after stripping in an apparent violation of Ohio law.
