{"path":"545045.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a deserted, clear-cut area of land with remnants of tree stumps scattered across the terrain. The setting appears overcast with gray skies and a hint of muted, distant greenery in the background, which suggests a somewhat desolate atmosphere. Dominating the foreground is a sizable, erect sign that features a dark green logo on a beige background with black lettering stating \"Weyerhaeuser\" along with the words, \"High Yield Forest Planted 1970\" below. This suggests that the area was specifically managed for timber production and was clear-cut after the harvest. The ground is overgrown with sparse vegetation and a few young pine trees are beginning to sprout, indicating early stages of reforestation or natural regrowth. The overall scene conveys a sense of human impact on natural spaces and the ongoing cycle of forest management for resource extraction.","title":"Forest is replanted by Weyerhauser pulp mill operators.","placename":"South Bend (Wash.)","location":"South Bend, Washington","nn1":["555198","545138","550354","553468","542865","555092","542823","542834","556922","555148","555085","555139","555150","555097","555208","546060"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["harvest","cycle","stump","cut","extraction","timber","pine","production","lettering","resource"]}
