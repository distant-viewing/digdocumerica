{"path":"547194.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a murky waterway, focusing on a small yellow and black tugboat named \"Eddie B.\" The boat is situated in the foreground, viewed from the side as it navigates the water. The upper part of the tugboat is painted in a distinct yellow, featuring a circular emblem with \"MT\" at the center, possibly denoting a company or organization. Spherical black objects, likely for bump protection, hang from the side. Below, the hull is black with the boatâ€™s name in gold lettering.\n\nA man, dressed in a yellow jacket and brown pants, stands on the boat's deck. His attire suggests he might be a crew member, and he appears to be involved in operating or guiding the tug. His head is turned away from the camera, looking toward the front of the boat, indicating his focus on the path or operations ahead.\n\nIn the background, the environment suggests an overcast day with diffused lighting. Industrial or port-related structures loom distantly, along with a large heap of what might be coal or similar material. The impression is of an industrial waterway setting, typical for operations involving tugs like the Eddie B.\n\nThis image, with its slightly faded colors and evident wear, evokes the feel of an earlier era of photography, suggesting a connection to industrial history and the daily work in these environments.","title":"Tugboat on the calumet river","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547694","551008","546938","550872","550893","550901","550894","545073","546845","548067","550913","550892","549819","546832","546836","551179"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["boat","tugboat","waterway","name","denote","emblem","involve","gold","operation","loom"]}
