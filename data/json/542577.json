{"path":"542577.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and dynamic scene in a barren landscape under a vast, cloud-streaked sky. In the foreground, the earth is rough and textured with numerous small holes and indentations, indicative of arid, possibly desert-like conditions. The color palette of the ground ranges from dark browns to sandy yellows.\n\nAt the center of the image, a person stands looking upwards, poised with one arm slightly raised. This figure, dressed in what appears to be military-style clothing including a helmet, is focused on an aircraft directly above.\n\nThe aircraft, flying low and directly towards the camera, dominates the upper portion of the frame. It appears to be a vintage single-engine plane, distinguished by its fixed wing spanning across the image. The plane's design and flight path suggest an imminent landing or a low flyby.\n\nThe background is composed of a distant mountain range and a relatively flat horizon, adding a sense of depth and isolation to the scene. The sky is filled with large, soft clouds, contributing to the dramatic quality of the lighting and the overall intensity of the moment captured.","title":"Harmful squirrel colonies are identified by pilot and relayed to \"spotter\" on the ground.
