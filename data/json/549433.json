{"path":"549433.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene on a sailboat named \"La Forza del Destino\" from Sunapee, New Hampshire. The image shows several people engaged in sailing activities on a body of water under cloudy conditions.\n\nThe sailboat, with its hull painted dark blue and marked with its name and location in visible white lettering, is tilted due to the wind and water conditions. The deck of the boat is bustling with about six individuals, all in casual attire, involved in various tasks related to maneuvering the boat. The sails are hoisted, with the mainsail and a jib capturing the wind competently.\n\nOn the left side of the deck, one person in a bright red shirt and white hat appears to be adjusting a line, possibly communicating with others. Another figure stands out in a black shirt, positioned more towards the center, appearing to take command or oversee operations. The rest of the crew is actively engaged, some pulling ropes and others attending to different parts of the sail.\n\nThe sea is choppy, with moderate waves indicating sailing under a relatively strong breeze, suggesting that these people are handling the boat in somewhat challenging but manageable conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of teamwork, action, and adventure amidst the elements, with a focus on the collective effort of the crew to navigate and control the sailboat effectively.","title":"Contender in the five-class Annapolis-Newport race on Chesapeake Bay near the start of the race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549434","549435","549388","547458","547456","549392","549404","549427","549428","549430","548513","549394","549436","547449","549429","549399"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","crew","sail","wind","deck","boat","command","condition","other","teamwork"]}
