{"path":"547776.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view capturing a busy traffic scene. There are two distinct roads visible, separated by a grassy median. The roadway on the left is lined with a considerable number of parked cars, arranged in a meticulous, orderly fashion along the roadsideâ€”they are perpendicular to the street. This arrangement of parked cars hints at an organized event or perhaps an overflow from nearby facilities. A few motorcycles are also present among the parked vehicles, and flags are visible, fluttering above the cars, adding a festive or ceremonial touch to the scene.\n\nThe road on the right shows active traffic; several cars and a motorcycle are in motion, traveling along the highway. The vehicles are diverse in type and color, reflecting a typical busy highway. The proximity and organization of the cars suggest a high-volume, multi-lane road.\n\nThe top portion of the image features segments of a high-rise building, indicating an urban setting, and the presence of lush green grass enhances the vibrancy of the scene. The shadow of another tall structure is visible in the foreground of the upper left corner, partially obscuring the view and adding depth to the image.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a dynamic urban landscape, juxtaposing stillness (parked cars on the left) against movement (flowing traffic on the right), framed within an architectural context.","title":"Friday afternoon traffic on the freeways of Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["546716","546730","546617","553681","556195","546707","546686","546616","546608","546713","548419","546710","555781","553893","546726","547780"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["car","motorcycle","traffic","park","highway","median","road","flutter","overflow","volume"]}
