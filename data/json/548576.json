{"path":"548576.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts two people playing water volleyball. Both individuals are partially submerged in a pool, standing behind a volleyball net that spans across the width of the image. The net is clearly visible with squares large enough to see the scene behind it, consisting of calm water that merges seamlessly with the sky at the horizon.\n\nOn the right side, a volleyball is captured in mid-air just above the net, suggesting a dynamic moment during the game. The player on the right side of the net is male, with visible torso and arms raised in an action likely either preparing to hit or just having hit the ball. He has a focused expression on his face.\n\nThe player on the left is also male, wearing glasses, and appears slightly behind the first player in terms of depth in the image. His torso is similarly exposed, and he has a calm expression with his attention likely directed towards the volleyball.\n\nThe overall setting suggests a leisurely, sunny day ideal for water activities, with the waterâ€™s surface glistening and reflecting light, highlighting the enjoyment and active engagement in a recreational sport. The scene communicates a sense of fun and relaxation, typical of a warm day spent in the pool.","title":"Some of the male residents of the Century Village retirement community meet each evening to play water-volleyball in the club pool.","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548575","543512","556295","548834","552227","557481","546330","553449","544204","548844","546349","551285","553430","555926","548548","544291"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["net","player","torso","pool","fun","ball","width","square","game","ideal"]}
