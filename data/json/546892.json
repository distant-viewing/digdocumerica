{"path":"546892.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a moment within an industrial waterway setting. In the foreground, a young man is engaged in an activity aboard a small boat. He is bending over the edge of the boat, wearing protective clothing which includes a grey jacket, yellow rubber bib overalls, and red rubber gloves, likely handling equipment or a task related to water testing or collection. \n\nThe background prominently features an industrial skyline with multiple factories emitting large plumes of smoke into the sky, suggesting an industrial area with heavy pollution or manufacturing activity. There are multiple smokestacks and industrial structures, and the atmosphere appears slightly hazy, possibly due to emissions from the factories.\n\nThe water appears calm and the sky is partly cloudy, indicating fair weather conditions during the time of the photograph. A camera, which seems to be mounted on a tripod or part of the boat, is visible in the right edge of the frame, introducing a layer of meta-narrative about documenting the scene or activity.\n\nOverall, the image contrasts the tranquility and simplicity of water with the complex, pollution-heavy backdrop of industrial activity, perhaps highlighting environmental monitoring or industrial impacts on natural bodies of water.","title":"Ron Jones, a member of the EPA Annapolis field office, is taking bottom samples of the area near the Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrows Point.
