{"path":"553428.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph displays a somewhat bleak and industrial atmosphere. There's a canal-like body of water running diagonally from the foreground towards the background, flanked on its left side by a large, dark structure which appears to be a long building. The building is somewhat shadowy, reinforcing the image's overall dim impression.\n\nThe water is unusual in its coloring, having a creamy or muddy hue, and it reflects the dark tone of the building beside it. Along the sides of the waterway and at the bases of the building are small patches of lush, green vegetation, which add a slight contrast of life against the otherwise dreary backdrop. \n\nThe sky is not fully visible, contributing to the enclosed and somewhat secretive feel of the scene. This setting appears deserted with no visible presence of people or animals, emphasizing a sense of quiet and solitude. The scene could potentially be located in an old industrial area or near a service canal of some sort where there is little to no foot traffic.","title":"The Nashua River flows past the Fitchburg paper mill.
