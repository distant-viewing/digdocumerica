{"path":"557960.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat dimly lit scene of a steam locomotive crossing a bridge over a river. The train, labeled \"Cuyahoga Valley Line 4070\", appears prominently in the upper portion of the frame, positioned on a bridge consisting of steel and stonework. The stonework, supporting the bridge at the riverbanks, appears aged and sturdy.\n\nThe backdrop features a serene river, reflecting some of the bridgework and trees. Dense foliage surrounds the river, highlighting verdant green trees under a partially cloudy sky. The lighting in the image creates a contrast between the shadowed areas under the bridge and the brighter sky above, giving the scene a tranquil yet slightly mysterious aura.\n\nThe overall composition, combining elements of historical transportation and natural beauty, evokes a sense of quietude and nostalgia, capturing a moment where nature and human engineering coexist harmoniously.","title":"Cuyahoga valley line steam powered weekend passenger train crosses the cuyahoga river at the deep lock quarry, a park which is part of the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system.
