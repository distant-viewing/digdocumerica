{"path":"557960.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat dimly lit scene of a steam locomotive crossing a bridge over a river. The train, labeled \"Cuyahoga Valley Line 4070\", appears prominently in the upper portion of the frame, positioned on a bridge consisting of steel and stonework. The stonework, supporting the bridge at the riverbanks, appears aged and sturdy.\n\nThe backdrop features a serene river, reflecting some of the bridgework and trees. Dense foliage surrounds the river, highlighting verdant green trees under a partially cloudy sky. The lighting in the image creates a contrast between the shadowed areas under the bridge and the brighter sky above, giving the scene a tranquil yet slightly mysterious aura.\n\nThe overall composition, combining elements of historical transportation and natural beauty, evokes a sense of quietude and nostalgia, capturing a moment where nature and human engineering coexist harmoniously.","title":"Cuyahoga Valley Line steam powered weekend passenger train crosses the Cuyahoga River at the Deep Lock Quarry, a park which is part of the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system. The train leaves the Cleveland Zoo Station and travels along the river and Cuyahoga Valley which is part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. It is the last major undeveloped land remaining between the two metropolitan areas.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["557959","557962","557975","557966","550966","556769","552064","557090","555749","557967","557965","557963","548064","557513","555730","551527"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","stonework","river","locomotive","aura","quietude","nostalgia","engineering","steel","steam"]}
