{"path":"550973.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene of an industrial area. In the foreground, there is a school bus marked with the number \"23\" on its front grille and labeled \"School Bus\" over the windshield. The bus is an older model, commonly seen in the mid-20th century, painted in the traditional yellow and black colors. The bus is moving on a paved road that stretches across the frame.\n\nTo the right of the frame, there is a sign that reads \"ALLOY UNINCORPORATED,\" suggesting the name of the location or a nearby town. The backdrop is dominated by a large industrial facility that produces significant smoke or steam, billowing out of multiple tall stacks. These emissions are quite dense, indicating heavy industrial activity. The facility comprises various buildings with visible roofs and metal structures.\n\nThe environment includes lush green hills surrounding the area, indicating that the setting is in a valley. There is a clear sky above, which contrasts with the pollution from the plant.\n\nThe composition captures a juxtaposition of a school bus, representing everyday life or education, against the industrial setting, perhaps hinting at the economic backbone of the community or environmental concerns related to industrial pollution.","title":"Union Carbide's ferro Alloy plant at Alloy, WV., on U.S. Route 60","placename":"Charleston (W.
