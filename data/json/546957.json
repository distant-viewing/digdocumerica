{"path":"546957.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures an agricultural scene set in a lush, green environment. In the foreground, a large mule or horse, outfitted with a harness and a yoke, is being guided by a man wearing a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and a sunhat. The man is actively engaged in plowing the field using a traditional, animal-driven plow.\n\nDirectly in the background, another individual can be seen. This person appears to be using a hoe or similar tool, actively working the soil amid the crops. They are dressed in a white long-sleeve shirt and dark pants.\n\nThe field itself is dense with vegetation, likely a crop of some kind, that reaches various stages of growth. Tall trees and shrubbery mark the field's surrounding area, emphasizing a setting that is rich in forestry and under a clear, bright sky. The overall scene conveys a sense of traditional farming practices, where manual labor and animal power are utilized in agricultural activities.","title":"A St. Helena's Island farmer cultivates his corn field.","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["546996","546986","557521","553665","544319","557696","554204","554108","555878","554202","544888","554203","547436","552577","555619","547297"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["plow","crop","field","animal","sleeve","harness","pant","forestry","shrubbery","kind"]}
