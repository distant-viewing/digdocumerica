{"path":"550552.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This aerial photograph captures an expansive industrial site situated in a large, open area surrounded by dense forests. The composition shows multiple rows of long, white-roofed buildings that appear to be warehouses or storage facilities. These buildings are arranged in a highly organized manner, in three main clusters. To the left of the image, alongside the tree line, smaller buildings and open spaces filled with miscellaneous materials can be seen, possibly indicating an operational area or additional storage.\n\nA distinct network of roads intersects and surrounds the site, facilitating access and movement within the complex. In the foreground, to the left, there appears to be a body of water adjacent to the road, with a small collection of boats visible along the shoreline, suggesting that the site may also have water access or use.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is predominantly forested, suggesting a remote location. The greenery of the trees provides a natural background that contrasts with the industrial appearance of the site. The overall impression is one of a large-scale, possibly industrial or logistical operation located in a secluded, natural setting.","title":"Alyeska pipeline service company's Fairbanks pipeyard, with more than 200 miles of 48-inch pipe.
