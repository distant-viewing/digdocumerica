{"path":"550623.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a river winding through a densely forested landscape. The river is broad and displays a mix of clear and silty sections, meandering with multiple curves and bends that create several natural oxbows. Surrounding the river are expansive patches of greenery, indicative of a lush forested area.\n\nOn the eastern side of the river, there is a notable development consisting of buildings, roads, and cleared land, suggesting a small community or industrial facility. The built area is connected by roads that intersect the forest, providing access through the green landscape. The roads appear to be either gravel or dirt, enhancing the rustic nature of the setting.\n\nThe photograph was taken from a high altitude, offering a panoramic view that emphasizes the contrast between the natural riverine environment and the human-made structures. The dominant colors are the greens of the forest and the brownish-gray of the river water, reflecting natural sediment. Overall, the scene depicts a remote, primarily undeveloped region where the river plays a central role in the landscape's geography and possibly its economy or way of life.","title":"Pipeline crossing at the klutina river, west of the town of copper center.
