{"path":"545543.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts an extensive outdoor area littered with a large amount of waste, primarily consisting of discarded egg cartons. The cartons vary in color including pink, blue, green, and white, and are scattered across what appears to be a grassy field. Some of the cartons are intact while others are broken. Amongst the debris, there are also pieces of cardboard and some wooden crates.\n\nIn the background, a bridge is visible, spanning across the scene with a calm and wooded environment around it. Underneath the gray, overcast sky, the setting seems desolate and neglected, emphasizing an issue of pollution or improper waste disposal. The overall composition of the image offers a stark commentary on environmental neglect, highlighting the impact of human waste on natural landscapes.","title":"A three hundred dozen egg misunderstanding on Interstate 59, fifty miles north of Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["547971","550801","542494","544823","547525","543824","544637","550352","557307","551440","552100","547907","555228","556419","547516","546854"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["waste","crate","commentary","cardboard","disposal","amount","issue","neglect","pollution","bridge"]}
