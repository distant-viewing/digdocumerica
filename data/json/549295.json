{"path":"549295.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a partially folded newspaper being read. The topmost visible section of the paper is a column bearing headlines such as \"Massport Plan Ideal Home For Neptune Rd. Owners Who Will Sell\" and smaller subheadings that mention an action to \"clean up harbor soon.\" The newspaper is titled \"East Boston Times - Free Press,\" dated May 5-11, 1989.\n\nThe photograph focuses sharply on the print and fold of the newspaper, with the text crisp and legible against the off-white background of the paper. The rest of the image, including a slight glimpse of what might be parts of a person's hands or arms holding the newspaper, is blurred, leaving them indistinct.\n\nThe background behind the newspaper is a nondescript blur of dark blues, and possibly parts of an urban environment or interior space, but it is too out of focus to delineate detailed features. The attention in the image is clearly directed towards capturing the content and detail of the newspaper itself, emphasizing the act of reading and the significance of the information carried in print media.","title":"Residents of the community bordering on Logan airport are engaged in a continuous struggle with massport (Massachusetts port authority).
