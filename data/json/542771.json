{"path":"542771.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene in a densely wooded forest. The key focus is a man standing near a large fallen tree. The tree, featuring extensive branches and roots, is diagonally sloped across the frame from the bottom left to the mid-right, having clearly been recently cut, as evidenced by the fresh wood and debris around its base.\n\nThe man is dressed in outdoor, work-appropriate attire, including a hard hat, which indicates he may be a worker, possibly a logger or forester. He holds a chainsaw, suggesting he was involved in cutting down the tree. His posture, facing the tree with his body slightly turned towards the viewer, suggests he may be inspecting his work or contemplating the next steps in his task.\n\nThe forest around him is thick with tall, dense coniferous trees, emphasizing a secluded, natural environment. The ground is littered with pine needles, small branches, and other natural debris, typical of a forest floor. The lighting in the scene indicates it could be either dawn or dusk, adding a soft and somewhat sombre tone to the image.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, focusing on manual labor intertwined with the raw beauty of nature, provides a narrative about human interaction with natural landscapes, possibly highlighting themes of nature conservation, forestry management, or the raw power of manual labor in natural settings.","title":"D.Jackson felling red fir tree","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["542769","542770","553602","542773","542787","553614","542788","553599","542786","553601","542716","542772","553608","553600","553604","542623"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["labor","forest","appropriate","cut","chainsaw","coniferous","contemplate","branch","tree","root"]}
