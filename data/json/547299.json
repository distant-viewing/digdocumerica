{"path":"547299.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of an architecturally decorative window from an older building. The window is large and arched, covered with a dark, translucent material that reflects some of the buildings opposite, making it difficult to see inside. \n\nThe arch of the window is adorned artistically: it features vibrant floral and vegetal motifs painted in red, green, yellow, and beige colors. These motifs include abstract flowers, leaves, and curvilinear designs that give it a quaint, historical appearance. Surrounding the window, there is a brick facade painted in light yellow, enhancing the contrast and visibility of the decorative elements.\n\nOn either side of the window, vertically running decorative panels can be seen. The left panel has a series of designs that echo the same floral and heart-shaped motifs found at the top arch, with a prominent presentation of a red tulip-like design at its bottom. The right panel has a similar style but is only partially visible in the photograph. The decorative elements suggest a cultural or regional style, possibly indicative of a specific historical period or architectural influence. The overall composition focuses on the artistry and detail of the decoration, presenting a snapshot that speaks to the preservation or restoration of historical architecture.","title":"Ornamental arch on this bank in Dwight shows influence of Czechoslovakian settlers.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["552535","547295","557093","552530","551753","543028","550042","557074","542815","549289","552492","556276","557066","548652","551870","557643"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["motif","panel","window","arch","restoration","design","artistry","preservation","heart","presentation"]}
