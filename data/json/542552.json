{"path":"542552.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph displays a contrasting scene of nature and industry. In the foreground, there is a field blanketed with yellow flowering plants, suggesting a rural or natural setting. These flowers appear vibrant and dense, covering the entire lower section of the image.\n\nIn sharp contrast, the background features an industrial plant. Notable structures include several large spherical and cylindrical storage tanks along with towers and other industrial buildings. Among these tanks, one prominent white spherical tank is labeled with \"Valley Nitrogen Producers\" indicating the likely nature of the industrial activity related to chemical or fertilizer production. There are also various pipes and chimneys, some of which are emitting smoke or steam.\n\nThis juxtaposition may emphasize a narrative or theme related to environmental impact or the encroachment of industrial development into natural landscapes. Additionally, the clear sky and seemingly undisturbed condition of the foreground give a serene feel to the natural aspect of the image, creating a visual and thematic contrast with the industrial setup in the background.","title":"Valley Nitrogen Products Co","placename":"San Joaquin (Fresno County, Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin, California","nn1":["542551","546170","542589","542707","544676","545989","546207","543159","545971","543013","542553","546064","546398","543913","551082","546130"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["tank","flower","encroachment","relate","plant","production","blanket","pipe","steam","chimney"]}
