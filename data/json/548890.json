{"path":"548890.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures two motorcyclists riding side by side down what appears to be a wide, dusty and somewhat desolate highway. The setting conveys a sense of starkness and vast open space typical in less urbanized or industrial areas. Both riders are helmeted, with one wearing a light-colored helmet and the other a dark helmet, and they are dressed in casual riding attire.\n\nThe background reveals a flat landscape under a hazy sky, possibly indicative of dust or pollution in the air. A range of distant mountains can be seen blending into the haze, adding a sense of depth and remoteness to the scene. Alongside the highway, there are power lines and utility poles stretching into the distance, enhancing the linear perspective of the photograph. At the side of the road, there are further indications of road infrastructure such as street lamps and signs that are partially obscured by the dust.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, along with the presence of industrial elements and a blurred, dusty atmosphere, suggests a scene from a roadway in a rugged or semi-industrial area, possibly near the outskirts of a town or in a more barren landscape. The motorcyclists, traveling side by side, add a dynamic element to the otherwise still environment.","title":"Dry heat and high winds equal eye-stinging, nose itching dust storm","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["544844","544840","551382","551237","554874","545530","553954","545598","553955","544422","556418","548987","545150","545134","554876","546645"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["dust","helmet","highway","riding","side","starkness","remoteness","indication","rider","outskirt"]}
