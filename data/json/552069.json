{"path":"552069.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental scene featuring a small stream or water runoff in a natural setting. The primary focus is on water cascading over rocks and mud, suggesting a mini waterfall or spillway. There are several visible elements of pollution within the scene. Strewn around the area are pieces of trash, including a visible metal can and other debris, which are partially submerged in the muddy water or caught among the wet stones and branches.\n\nThe surrounding area comprises earthy materials such as soil and stones, indicating erosion or recent rainfall that has disturbed the terrain. Tree branches, both living and broken, overlay the scene, creating a sense of natural chaos and contributing to the feeling of an untended and neglected environment. The lighting in the image is natural, possibly filtered through tree canopies, casting highlights and shadows that enhance the texture of the muddy water and rocky ground. The overall impression is of an ecosystem experiencing stress or degradation, evident from the pollution and uncontrolled water flow.","title":"Untreated domestic waste being discharged into the Kansas River at 7th Street on the south bank.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552062","543819","557999","552811","556942","552022","555550","544810","548206","550812","551077","552046","552023","553434","555549","545871"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollution","spillway","stone","stress","runoff","branch","water","chaos","rainfall","waterfall"]}
