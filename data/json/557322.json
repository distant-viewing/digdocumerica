{"path":"557322.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an interior scene of a functional greenhouse with a person sitting and reflecting or supervising the plant growth. The greenhouse structure is made of a semi-transparent material supported by a light-colored metal or plastic frame, allowing diffused sunlight to permeate the space.\n\nInside the greenhouse, it is well utilized with dense plant cultivation. The floor is filled with an assortment of plants arranged methodically in rows and also in various pots and containers scattered around. The plants look healthy, displaying a variety of greens and are of different species, potentially herbs, vegetables, and small fruit-bearing shrubs.\n\nThere is a sizable blue barrel positioned towards the back right of the greenhouse, perhaps used for storing water or compost. In the center-back of the greenhouse, seated on a chair is an individual, possibly a woman, dressed casually. She seems engaged and slightly turned towards something outside the frame of the image or is perhaps resting while observing the garden.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, alongside the natural light and the dense greenery, evokes a sense of tranquility and industriousness in a self-sustained environment. The slight wear and casual arrangement in the greenhouse suggest that it is a practical, working space devoted to gardening.","title":"Solar greenhouse owned and built by peter howell, located at about the 8,500 foot level in the front range","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["557321","555300","555299","555361","555359","554622","555298","555356","555372","542691","557323","555362","546286","555357","555360","555364"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["greenhouse","plant","garden","industriousness","permeate","vegetable","pots","fruit","self","supervise"]}
