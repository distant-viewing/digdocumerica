{"path":"546018.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in an outdoor setting, featuring a large, cone-shaped structure constructed from logs and wooden beams. The structure, reminiscent of a teepee frame, dominates the background and reaches high into the sky, while two boys are climbing it. The sun, low in the sky, suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, lending a warm, golden hue to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, two young men stand side by side, appearing to pose for the photo. The person on the left is wearing a green military-style jacket with a patch that reads \"Steve,\" a white t-shirt underneath, and dark trousers. He has medium-length, tousled brown hair. The person on the right is dressed in a horizontally striped sweater in shades of blue and white, paired with dark trousers. His hair is cut in a straight, bowl style and he wears a serious expression.\n\nThe background beyond the wooden structure offers a view of a clear sky and sparse, leafless trees, suggesting the season might be either late autumn or early winter. The grass and ground are visible with muted brown and green tones, indicating a rural or semi-rural setting. The overall mood of the photograph is serene, capturing a moment of youthful adventure and exploration.","title":"Lumber is stacked on Mississippi river levee for the traditional christmas eve bonfire.
