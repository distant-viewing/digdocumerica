{"path":"554590.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a plant, likely a small shrub or tree, with thin, vertical branches prominently featuring clusters of white flowers. The thin branches are densely packed with these blossoms and small, slender leaves, with some branches notably bereft of flowers, suggesting varying stages of blooming or seasonality.\n\nThe background comprises a dark, densely wooded forest, creating a contrast that accentuates the delicate, brighter flowers on the plant. The trees in the background are dark and blurred, providing a uniformly textured backdrop that emphasizes the details and the lighter color of the foreground plant. This setting suggests the picture might be taken in a woodland or forested area, perhaps during late spring or early summer when such flowers are more likely to bloom.","title":"Shadbush or serviceberry (Amelanchier), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545720","555106","554587","554576","545726","553588","547642","554745","555037","553368","554575","555040","545695","555007","553366","544875"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","branch","plant","blossom","woodland","forest","comprise","bloom","close","up"]}
