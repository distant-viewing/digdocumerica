{"path":"555198.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a densely wooded forest area marked by signs of logging activity. In the foreground is an area of exposed soil and scattered debris, including cut tree trunks and upturned roots, suggesting recent tree removal. The middle ground shows a clearing or pathway, with a large accumulation of sawdust or wood chips, indicating a processing or staging area for the felled trees. The surrounding landscape is dominated by tall trees, primarily conifers, that densely cover the steep slopes extending into the background. The trees display varying shades of green, suggesting a lush, moisture-rich environment.\n\nThis scene likely illustrates the impact of logging operations on a forested hillside, highlighting environmental alteration. The clearing process has left behind a rugged terrain, potentially disrupting the natural ecosystem. The composition, with its focus on the cleared area transitioning to untouched woodland, emphasizes the contrast between natural forest and human activity.","title":"Erosion in the Canyon River drainage system in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
