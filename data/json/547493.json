{"path":"547493.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted water body with visible environmental degradation. The foreground features the rusty, oil-slicked surface of the water, showing swirls of different colored pollutants such as yellows and reds, indicative of possible chemical contamination.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a stretch of rocky, red-stained shore extends along the water's edge, going off into the distance. Rocks, possibly put there to prevent erosion or as part of landscaping, line the water's side, gradually disappearing into the distance where the shore bends slightly out of view.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, a dirt road or pathway runs parallel to the shoreline. Along this path, a largely eroded and barren landscape can be seen, with what looks like tire tracks marking the dry, reddish soil.\n\nIn the background, there is a glimpse of a tree line and some greenery indicating the border of a forest or wooded area facing the shore, offering a stark contrast to the more desolate areas shown in the foreground. Moreover, a barrier or guardrail, likely part of the road infrastructure, is partially visible, extending alongside the road.\n\nAn old, rusty barrel partially submerged in the water appears on the right corner of the photograph. It adds to the observation of environmental neglect, suggesting that the area might be used for unauthorized dumping of industrial waste. The entire scene is under a neutral, overcast sky, which casts a somber mood over the setting.","title":"Highway construction in background cuts through a corner of putts bog, a previously undisturbed natural area","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["551560","544810","552127","547614","547626","552811","550812","544175","544804","551561","548741","547907","547590","551559","543762","550800"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["shore","road","slick","put","disappear","guardrail","dumping","prevent","contamination","pollutant"]}
