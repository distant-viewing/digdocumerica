{"path":"544726.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a striking rural scene teeming with contrasts between nature and human-made structures. At the forefront, two horses—one black and one white—are seen walking across a parched, brown field. The open expanses suggest a broad, flat terrain.\n\nDominating the background is a series of tall electricity pylons, arranged in a line and extending into the distance, suggesting a powerful manmade presence imposed upon the landscape. The pylons carry multiple layers of power lines that crisscross the sky above.\n\nIn the distance, rolling hills or low mountains provide a natural backdrop, partially shrouded in a haze that gives a sense of depth to the scene. The landscape is lit with a soft light, indicating either early morning or late afternoon, which adds a warm hue to the scene.\n\nSuch a juxtaposition highlights themes of technology and development alongside natural elements, depicting a quiet moment of daily life perhaps in a rural part of America. The composition blends these elements together, creating a narrative about coexistence and the impact of human infrastructure on natural landscapes.","title":"Power lines and horses","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["546130","543728","555609","545050","557977","544955","544355","549110","549191","544695","557525","544405","544730","543903","542622","558107"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["pylon","impos","teem","electricity","crisscross","shroude","coexistence","horse","technology","narrative"]}
