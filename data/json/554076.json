{"path":"554076.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of water, potentially a sea or ocean, under strong sunlight. The predominant feature of the image is the dazzling reflection of sunlight on the water's surface, creating a pattern of glittering, undulating ridges and patches. These illuminated areas contrast sharply with the darker sections of water, which absorb rather than reflect the light. The image conveys a sense of fluid motion and natural texture, emphasizing the play of light and shadow. There are no visible landmarks, people, or objects in the scene; the focus is entirely on the interaction between light and water. The overall effect is both dynamic and serene, hinting at the vastness and untouched beauty of the natural world.","title":"Late afternoon surf at maliko bay","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["553180","544725","543888","543138","552237","557814","555803","543144","550914","542808","544253","545882","548818","547047","543317","555713"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["glitter","absorb","landmark","sunlight","undulate","world","water","ridge","vastness","light"]}
