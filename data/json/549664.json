{"path":"549664.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a busy urban construction site scene, likely from the mid-20th century given the style of the machinery and general ambiance. The focus of the image is a large red crawler crane located at the center, indicative of major construction or excavation work. Several construction materials, such as long pipes and wooden planks, are scattered around the site. The presence of wooden scaffolding suggests that either a new structure is being built or an existing one is being significantly modified.\n\nIn addition to the crane, there are several construction barriers and cones placed strategically around the area, likely for safety and to direct pedestrian traffic around the construction zone. The image also shows one individual, a man, walking across the open area dressed in a dark color suit and hat, which contrasts with the industrial backdrop. \n\nSurrounding the construction area are historic-looking buildings, suggesting that this site is located within an older city neighborhood. These buildings add a textured layer to the composition, providing a stark contrast between the old architectural styles and the industrial machinery involved in modern construction. The windows and facades of these buildings are dark, which could indicate either their age or the lighting conditions when the photo was taken. Moments like these capture the continual evolution and redevelopment occurring within urban environments.","title":"Subway construction near St. Stephens Cathedral","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["547181","549913","549308","549912","557729","546833","547235","548559","550907","548431","547970","546030","547240","544167","545070","555593"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","crane","evolution","cone","machinery","scaffolding","addition","one","plank"]}
