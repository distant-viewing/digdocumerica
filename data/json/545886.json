{"path":"545886.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a long, straight stretch of road cutting through a vast, arid landscape under a purple-hued twilight sky. The road, adorned with reddish-brown tarmac, divides the scene horizontally and recedes into the distance, bordered by dry, scrubby vegetation which covers the flat terrain. Alongside the road, there is a simple wire fence visible in places.\n\nIn the distance, a mountain range provides a soft, hazy silhouette against the sky. The low mountains form a gentle undulating line against the horizon. The lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late evening, contributing to the dramatic and somewhat muted colors of the landscape.\n\nThere are visible imperfections on the image, suggesting it might be an old or weathered photograph. There's a lone vehicle, possibly a truck, seen traveling down the road, adding a sense of scale and motion to the otherwise static nature scene. This element helps emphasize the vastness and solitude of the depicted environment.","title":"Afternoon rain storm","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["544043","549013","554154","554127","544178","549002","557468","554131","545367","554130","554155","554832","544080","545349","545575","554805"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["road","imperfection","tarmac","mountain","stretch","purple","twilight","distance","wire","vastness"]}
