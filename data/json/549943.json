{"path":"549943.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a landfill site. The foreground shows two large mounds of dirt, with a mass of assorted garbage spanning the area between and around these mounds. On the left and the nearer center, there are yellow bulldozers actively working, likely spreading or compacting the waste. Further back, there are various types of trucks, including what looks like a garbage truck with distinct coloring possibly due to company logos or decorative designs.\n\nThe background is more natural and less cluttered, featuring a hazy sky that meets the horizon line where gentle hills or low mountains can be faintly seen. The overall lighting in the image suggests it could be taken either early or late in the day, given the soft, diffused light and subdued color saturation. This environmental setting illustrates the stark contrast between human waste management activities and the natural landscape in the distance.","title":"Trucks dump earth fill over garbage at landfill operation in Croton.","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["549937","546231","546246","546235","548322","546251","546234","546239","549938","546257","543828","546250","549792","546247","549795","546238"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","mound","waste","truck","compact","coloring","mass","landfill","bulldozer","company"]}
