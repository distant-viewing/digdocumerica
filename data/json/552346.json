{"path":"552346.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sailing scene, possibly during a regatta, set against an early evening sky. A prominent sailboat, featuring a large, triangular sail marked with the number \"1338\" and racing symbols, stands out near the left side of the frame, silhouetted against the sky with its sail partly illuminated by the subdued sunlight. The sailboat is inclined slightly towards the viewer, suggesting active sailing. \n\nIn the mid to far background, numerous other sailboats with similarly styled sails can be seen scattered across the calm waters, some more distant and others nearer, creating a layered effect on the water. These boats appear smaller, likely due to their distance from the point of view. \n\nThe sky above is painted with clouds that range in color from light to dark blue, indicating that this might be either late afternoon or just before sunset. The water reflects this dusky light, adding to the overall peaceful and picturesque setting. The setting is possibly a large lake or a calm bay, suggested by the absence of large waves and the enclosed feeling created by the distant shoreline subtly visible under the horizon. \n\nThis scene effectively conveys a tranquil, recreational atmosphere typical of sailing events, where the focus is on the grace of navigation and the beauty of the water environment.","title":"Sailboat race by members of the tacoma yacht club on puget sound on an almost windless evening","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544669","552345","544663","548510","552343","543936","548519","548526","549424","552355","548118","548117","544665","547781","543941","549425"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sail","sailboat","regatta","grace","dusky","racing","distant","peaceful","subdued"]}
