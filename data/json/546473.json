{"path":"546473.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a modern architectural structure with a series of geometric-shaped buildings, predominantly featuring sharp triangular and pyramidal roofs. The buildings are constructed with what appears to be red brick, complementing the striking design against a clear sky at either dawn or dusk, given the soft natural lighting.\n\nThe main building is prominent and central in the composition, with its largest triangle peak pointing upward, while smaller sections with flat and sloped roofs extend horizontally from it. The design includes elongated vertical and horizontal windows that break up the solidity of the walls and add a rhythmic visual element to the facade.\n\nIn the foreground is an expansive, lush green lawn, enhancing the isolation and prominence of the architectural design on the landscape. The grass displays a slightly darker tone, suggesting either the time of day or a shadow cast by the low sunlight. On the far left, there is a solitary, small tree, which adds a touch of nature to the otherwise stark architectural environment.\n\nOverall, the photo conveys a sense of serene, almost solemn atmosphere, emphasizing the modern and somewhat austere architectural style of the building. The setting appears to be quite open and possibly located within an institutional or campus-like environment given the formality of the design and its placement within the expansive lawn area.","title":"First baptist church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546481","546464","546468","546469","546531","546456","546480","546702","546485","546472","546484","548866","546543","546542","546506","555318"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["lawn","design","formality","campus","prominence","placement","building","roof","complement","dawn"]}
