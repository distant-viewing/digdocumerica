{"path":"553100.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural scene in a vast, open landscape likely characteristic of a North American plain or prairie. The foreground and middle ground are occupied by a group of livestock, specifically cows, scattered across the yellow-tinted dried grass. There are three individuals managing the cows: one standing on the left side of the frame facing the herd, another on foot closer to the center, and a third person mounted on a horse towards the right. All three appear to be involved in herding the cows.\n\nIn the background, several distant mountains stretch across the horizon under a mostly clear sky with few scattered clouds, suggesting a dry, sunny day. The image offers a sense of expansive, open space typical of pastoral or agricultural areas and highlights aspects of rural farming or ranching life. The vastness of the landscape and the positioning of the cattle and people suggest a scene focused on the daily activities of livestock management in a rugged, natural setting.","title":"Spring roundup of Paiute-owned cattle begins at Sutcliffe Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation.
