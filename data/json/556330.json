{"path":"556330.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and somewhat derelict scene in a rural setting, possibly a small town or village. The main focal point is a large, dilapidated building with a weathered wooden structure and a sagging roof, some sections of which appear to be caving in. The building is two stories high and seems to be abandoned, with debris and foliage surrounding it. On the structure, faded letters spell out \"MASON SUPPLY\" suggesting it might have once served as a store or warehouse for building materials.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a paved road that curves past the building, lined with a drainage ditch and some utility poles. Along the road, other small, shabby structures can be seen, which contributes to a sense of overall neglect and abandonment in the area.\n\nThere is one vintage automobile parked near the main building, adding a sense of timelessness and decay to the scene. The environment is surrounded by wooded hills, which encase the area with a backdrop of evergreen trees. This rural landscape hints at a community that was likely more vibrant in the past but now shows signs of significant decline and disuse. The overcast sky and lack of visible people evoke a somber and deserted atmosphere.","title":"Old coal company store which was gutted by fire in the Fentress County, Tennessee, town of Wilder near Cookeville.
