{"path":"545832.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph depicts a rustic, solitary windmill set against a vast, rugged landscape. The windmill, at the center of the image, stands tall with its structure made of metal and appears aged, with its wood support frame weathered and darkened. It's a traditional wind-pump type, commonly used in rural areas to pull water from underground.\n\nThe background is dominated by large hills or low mountains, stretching across the horizon with their surfaces mostly barren and covered in sparse vegetation. The color palette of the landscape is predominantly shades of blue and grey, suggesting either overcast weather or the onset of dusk, giving the scene a muted, somewhat somber tone.\n\nThe terrain in the foreground features low grasses and small shrubs, typical of semi-arid regions. The ground is flat where the windmill is located, but it gradually ascends into the hills. There are a few scattered bushes and small patches of greenery, which provide a slight contrast to the otherwise dry and rocky environment.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the windmill positioned slightly off-center, draws attention to its isolation in the vast natural space, emphasizing themes of solitude and the impact of human structures on natural landscapes. The overall mood is quiet and contemplative, with a sense of enduring presence amidst the expansive wilderness.","title":"A wooden windmill, relic of a bygone day, stands in the Davis Mountains.","placename":"Odessa (Tex.)","location":"Odessa, Texas","nn1":["549216","549210","549211","555291","549212","544868","545828","549213","547283","552462","547347","545848","549217","547345","545852","547293"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["windmill","onset","ascend","pump","endure","darken","hill","pull","weather","wilderness"]}
