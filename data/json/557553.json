The sign is advertising land for sale by Fred Sands Realtors. It reads \"FOR SALE\" in bold, followed by the details including \"Ecology Drive,\" \"Four Homesites zoned for horses\" and \"Utilities Available Ready to Build Now.\" The sign also includes a diagram depicting four numbered plots of varying sizes, along with their respective acreages.\n\nThe background of the image shows a scenic view of lush, green mountains under a light blue sky interspersed with a few clouds. The terrain in the immediate vicinity of the sign is a rough, unpaved area with sparse vegetation. This setting suggests a rural or undeveloped area, potentially just beginning to be opened for development. The mountains in the distance offer a serene and natural backdrop, emphasizing the undeveloped and tranquil environment of the location being marketed.","title":"Sign advertises homesites in the santa monica mountains off mulholland drive on the western edge of Los Angeles.
