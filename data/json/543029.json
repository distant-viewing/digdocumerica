{"path":"543029.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic, outdoor setting during what appears to be the late afternoon or evening, given the low light and long shadows. The scene is centered around a dirt pathway leading through a rural landscape with trees and small wooden buildings. In the foreground, a goat with a predominantly white body and distinct dark patches is seen from behind, standing in the middle of the pathway, looking towards a person in the distance.\n\nThe focal person in the image, dressed in an orange jacket and blue jeans, is walking towards the camera carrying a black backpack. The person's stride suggests movement and purpose as they navigate the path which curves slightly to the left. Surrounding this central activity are tall trees that impart a natural, forest-like feel to the setting, with shadows casting patterns across the ground.\n\nIn the background, two rustic buildings, possibly barns or sheds, add to the rural charm of the photograph. The nearest building, on the left, features dark wooden panels and is partially obscured by shadow and foliage. Another building is visible on the right, smaller and appearing somewhat dilapidated, with a white picket fence that is similarly in a state of neglect.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of tranquil rural life, highlighted by the presence of animals and the simplicity of the surrounding structures. The low lighting adds a touch of drama and coziness to the scene, emphasizing the late-day activities in a countryside setting.","title":"Goat farm, early morning","placename":"Mendocino County (Calif.)","location":"Mendocino County, California","nn1":["542795","552562","554928","557747","543117","547326","558101","552581","554916","542960","556963","543044","544317","544933","554932","545592"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["pathway","goat","person","picket","drama","stride","shadow","countryside","backpack","building"]}
