{"path":"550248.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a bleak and polluted scene at a landfill or dumpsite. In the foreground, there is a large, murky pool of water reflecting the sky, possibly containing leachate or runoff from the waste. The body of water features floating debris and slicks of substances that could be oils or other pollutants.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo is dominated by a massive heap of trash extending throughout the scene. The waste includes a variety of discarded materials such as broken wood structures, possibly parts of furniture or pallets, mixed with random garbage like paper, plastics, textiles, and household trash. The assortment is chaotic and densely piled, suggesting the landfill is heavily used.\n\nIn the background, a garbage truck is visible with its back end hoisted up, tipping more waste onto the already substantial pile. The truck is large, indicating it is designed for bulk waste management. Behind the truck, there appears to be more accumulated waste and possibly some scattered vegetation, though the view is mostly obscured by dust and smoke, contributing to the overall grim atmosphere of the setting.\n\nThe sky is overcast, and the lighting is dull, casting an overall gloomy mood that complements the environmental degradation depicted in the image. There appears to be no human activity visible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention on the environmental impact and the scale of waste production.","title":"Landfill operation on Warner Road, alongside Mill Creek which flows into the Cuyahoga River","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550801","546246","543828","549936","548210","549750","550252","550256","546235","547983","546761","544637","557307","554541","544799","549749"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","landfill","truck","garbage","trash","dumpsite","pallet","runoff","pollutant","household"]}
