{"path":"555274.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a striking image of the former Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan, New York City, seen from a low perspective. The two skyscrapers dominate the composition, soaring upward into a vivid blue sky speckled with a few scattered clouds. The iconic, narrow windows of the towers create a repeating vertical pattern that emphasizes their extraordinary height. To the right side of the frame, other tall buildings are visible, their dark silhouettes and architectural details contributing to the urban skyline. A metal fence, possibly atop a concrete barrier, runs along the lower edge of the image, hinting at a separation between the viewer and the towers, possibly taken from a street or another public space. The overall atmosphere of the picture is a blend of architectural awe and a clear, sunny day, capturing a moment in the life of a bustling metropolis.","title":"World trade center in New York city","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549302","555275","547691","548409","549915","548387","549764","549301","555278","548319","549918","549914","548408","548386","555741","550116"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["towers","soar","repeat","separation","atop","awe","speckle","skyscraper","barrier","scattered"]}
