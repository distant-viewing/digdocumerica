{"path":"549927.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment along a waterfront. Two men are seated on what appears to be a raised border or edge, possibly a part of a pier or walkway. They are facing each other, engaged in a conversation and eating. The man on the left, wearing a green and white striped shirt, is drinking from a bottle, while the man on the right, in a yellowish shirt and blue jeans, is holding food in one hand.\n\nIn the backdrop, a wide body of water sets a calming scene, upon which a small boat or tugboat is visible. The boat is moving away into the distance, suggesting activity along the waterway. Beyond the water, the city landscape includes various buildings, most likely warehouses or industrial structures given their size and nondescript architecture. The sky overhead is fairly clear with only a few clouds, suggesting it might be a warm, sunny day.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a casual, relaxing atmosphere, where people are enjoying a simple moment outdoors, taking in the view, and possibly sharing a meal.","title":"Morton Street Pier on the Hudson River","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543042","546077","550245","543465","551253","543231","552870","543885","547595","554196","551386","544412","546134","552180","551762","553519"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["boat","tugboat","meal","overhead","border","bottle","walkway","man","warehouse","food"]}
