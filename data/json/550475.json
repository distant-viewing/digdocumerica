{"path":"550475.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a textured and layered rocky surface. The rocks appear to be brittle and sharp with jagged edges, mostly breaking off in thin, flat shards. Lighting plays an important role in this image, as the shadows cast by the sun accentuate the uneven and fragmented nature of the rocks, creating a dynamic interplay of light and dark. The texture of the rocks suggests they could be slate or shale, known for their fine-grained and foliated structure. There is a strong detail in the image revealing the intricate patterns and lines within each rock piece. The color palette is mostly dark with shades of gray, black, and occasional lighter highlights where the light touches the edges of the rocks. The photograph's focus is tightly centered on the rocks, omitting any broader landscape or sky, which emphasizes the detailed surface texture.","title":"Close-up of slatey rock chips in the Atigun Gorge, 5 miles east of the pipeline crossing of the Atigun River. These chips, here about one-half inch long, are gradually being weathered down by frost wind and water into soil.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552546","550474","550483","543421","545795","554410","553582","544907","545558","545589","544682","553770","552543","545597","543151","543148"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","highlight","edge","role","texture","surface","interplay","palette","sun","piece"]}
