{"path":"548823.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a scenic view of a lush golf course with a foreground centered on an ornate fountain. The fountain consists of multiple jets of water spraying from around a central feature that includes a rugged rock and two sculptural elements that might be cacti, set within a circular basin. Just behind the fountain to the right, there is a large, densely foliated tree with clusters of white blooms.\n\nThe background of the photo showcases an expansive golf course dotted with smaller trees and patches of greenery, leading towards distant water, possibly a large lake or river, bordered by low hills or mountains under a clear sky. The entire scene conveys a sense of tranquility and the beauty of a well-maintained and serene landscaped setting.","title":"Golf club at lake havasu city","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["543633","557268","549069","548821","554148","546959","554149","557282","551793","547784","552608","550161","553980","550747","557261","550072"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["fountain","golf","spraie","basin","jet","course","mountains","bloom","centere","dot"]}
