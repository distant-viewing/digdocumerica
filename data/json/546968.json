{"path":"546968.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial scene, likely taken during the mid-20th century. The main focus is a large industrial complex emitting copious amounts of white smoke from several stacks, which indicates heavy activity within the facility. The plant comprises various buildings, some with visible heavy-duty pipes and one particularly tall tower-like structure for industrial processing.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a paved street lined with parked cars of various models that point to the photograph's mid-20th-century origin. On the left, a water tower stands adjacent to the industrial buildings, suggesting the provision of water required for industrial processes or employee usage.\n\nA woman is walking along the sidewalk, dressed in what appears to be a light-colored dress, typical of the conservative yet practical fashion of the time. Overhead, utility lines and street lights stretch across the road.\n\nThe front of the industrial complex features old-fashioned signage, and banners reading phrases like \"Everybody Works,\" perhaps indicative of a company slogan or a morale-boosting message. This detail, along with the nestled American flag, reflects a sense of industry-driven patriotism or pride prevalent in that era.\n\nThe colors in the scene, from the blue sky littered with puffs of white clouds to the green grass bordering the concrete, add a vivid contrast to the earthen hues of the industrial buildings and the metallic structures. This image captures the essence of industrial growth and activity from a past era, juxtaposed with everyday life occurring alongside it.","title":"Union Camp chemical plant","placename":"Savannah (Ga.)","location":"Savannah, Georgia","nn1":["551034","557224","546866","550868","546074","550199","549967","546107","543993","557225","545443","550956","545236","546908","545507","552037"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["complex","patriotism","tower","employee","origin","era","slogan","pride","phrase","century"]}
