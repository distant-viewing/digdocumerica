{"path":"556589.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This vintage photograph captures a tender moment between a woman and a young child. The woman, who has a bob haircut and wears large hoop earrings and a simple white top, is focused on helping the child read a newspaper. The child, who appears to be a toddler with blonde hair, is wearing a red shirt and is intently looking at the newspaper, holding it up with both hands.\n\nThey seem to be sitting outside, possibly on a porch, given the presence of a white siding background and a corner of a red lattice structure. Notably, hanging on the white siding behind them is what appears to be a dried plant, adding a rustic touch to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of engagement and learning, with the child seemingly curious about the newspaper's contents, guided by the attentive woman. The setting suggests a casual, homely environment, capturing a slice of everyday life. The woman's encouragement and the childâ€™s interest in the activity depict a learning moment, possibly emphasizing the importance of literacy and education from an early age.","title":"Mrs.  Sharon bowling, 25, and son, mark, 2, outside their home in Cumberland, Kentucky.
