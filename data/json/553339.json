{"path":"553339.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a man standing in the middle of a bubbling stream, engaged in the activity of fly fishing. He is dressed in typical fishing attire, including waders that reach his chest, a light-colored hat, and a vest that likely holds his fishing gear. The riverbed is visible through the clear water, showing off an array of rocks beneath the shimmering surface.\n\nThe surrounding environment is a dense, lush forest. The trees, mostly bare of leaves, suggest early spring. The sunlight filters through the branches, creating a dappled pattern on the water and providing a serene, naturalistic setting for the fishing scene. The light catching on the moving water adds a sparkle to the overall ambiance. The picture evokes a sense of tranquility and connection with nature, typical of a remote, forested waterway ideal for fishing.","title":"Water diversions of all kinds are enjoyed in the fresh, clean waters of the Squannacook River.
