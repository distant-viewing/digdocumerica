{"path":"543069.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, expansive beach scene. In the foreground, there is a large accumulation of driftwood, consisting of assorted logs and wood fragments scattered haphazardly. These pieces appear weathered and bleached, suggesting they have been aged by the sea and sun. Flanking the driftwood on either side are dark, jagged rocks adding a rough texture to the scene.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows the sandy beach stretching wide across the frame. The sand appears smooth with a wet sheen, likely from the recent tide, creating reflective surfaces that catch the light. This part of the beach is nearly empty except for a solitary figure in the distance, who is small and indistinct, contributing to the scale and emptiness of the landscape.\n\nThe background features the ocean, where multiple layers of waves can be seen breaking towards the shore under a hazy sky. The horizon is visible and mostly clear, marked only by a few low-lying clouds that add depth to the vivid blue sky above.\n\nThe entire scene is bathed in natural light, which enhances the textures and natural colors of the beach, ocean, and sky, contributing to a peaceful and somewhat isolated atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the vastness and natural beauty of the coastal environment.","title":"Cast-off timber piles up on beach","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542889","544989","542890","542886","543052","543075","543078","545111","543287","543054","546970","542888","551554","548757","542887","547607"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["driftwood","beach","ocean","bleach","emptiness","isolated","tide","sheen","assort","fragment"]}
