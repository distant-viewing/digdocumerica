{"path":"548932.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a significant industrial scene, likely linked to water management or electricity generation, possibly a hydroelectric power station. The focus is on four large, parallel pipes that extend down a barren, rocky slope. These metallic gray pipes, with white bands at regular intervals, stretch away from the camera toward an imposing structure at the base of the hill. The structure appears to be a terminal or control tower connected to the pipes, painted a light gray or blue and featuring vertical rectangular windows.\n\nSurrounding the pipes is a rough, excavated landscape with exposed dirt and minimal vegetation, suggesting an arid region or recent construction activity. Unpaved roads or paths cutter through the landscape, looping around and between the pipes and the surrounding installations that include various small buildings and parked vehicles possible related to maintenance or operation of the facility.\n\nThe overall setting appears isolated and industrial, with a focus on functionality and utility, indicative of infrastructure that plays a critical role in energy or water supply. The steep incline and rugged terrain suggest challenging construction conditions. The composition captures the scale and purpose of human ingenuity in manipulating natural landscapes to serve technological and societal needs.","title":"Los Angeles Metropolitan Water District aqueduct at Parker Dam","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545615","547571","542528","543170","545841","549000","549118","557387","551983","543759","544068","550684","544102","552432","544569","552689"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pipe","interval","excavate","incline","loop","electricity","generation","manipulate","construction","need"]}
