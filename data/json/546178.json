{"path":"546178.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a striking moment featuring a large airplane in mid-descent against a vivid blue sky adorned with scattered clouds. This commercial aircraft, featuring four engines, approaches from the right side of the frame, as its landing gear is extended and ready for touchdown. \n\nIn the foreground, there is a brightly colored structure, most likely a gas station, identified by a prominent signage that reads \"SPUR\" within an oval-shaped logo with a red background and a white starburst design to the left of the text. The architecture of the gas station includes a large, sloped red roof that stands out in contrast to the commercial and natural elements surrounding it.\n\nAdditionally, there is a distinctive red and white striped canopy structure in the precinct of the gas station. This structure is adorned with multiple strings of small flags, presumably for decorative or promotional purposes, which add a festive touch to the setting. These strings of flags are attached to a central pole and extend outward like the spokes of a wheel.\n\nThe environments encompassing this setup include lush greenery and palm trees, confirming a tropical or semi-tropical locale. Beyond the immediate vicinity of the gas station, there are other nondescript commercial buildings with flat roofs. The overall ambiance is vibrant yet everyday, juxtaposing the routine of ground-level commerce with the drama of air travel.","title":"Jet comes in for landing.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["547824","548448","548447","548485","547810","553731","553888","548484","548486","544606","542720","548469","554092","548445","548487","548881"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["gas","station","string","flag","descent","drama","landing","airplane","locale","commerce"]}
