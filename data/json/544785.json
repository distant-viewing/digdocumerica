{"path":"544785.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of an extensive, open-pit mining operation set in a rugged mountainous region. The main feature of the image is the large, circular excavation site, displaying concentric terraced layers indicative of the mining process. The layers have different shades, ranging from light gray to dark brown, depicting various mineral deposits or stages of excavation.\n\nThe site is surrounded by numerous dirt roads that swirl around and lead to the center of the pit, as well as to the upper terraces. These roads are likely used by heavy mining machinery, some of which can be seen parked or in operation within the site, appearing as tiny compared to the vast scale of the excavation.\n\nBeyond the boundaries of the mining site, the terrain rises into rugged, undisturbed mountain slopes, covered with sparse vegetation. These mountains form a stark contrast with the heavily altered landscape of the mining area. In the distant background, further mountain ranges can be seen under a clear blue sky, adding depth and a sense of scale to the image.\n\nThe photograph has a dramatic and somewhat stark aesthetic, emphasizing the environmental impact of such large-scale human activities on natural landscapes.","title":"Abandoned mine near Clear Creek, west of Dumont","placename":"Dumont (Colo.)","location":"Dumont, Colorado","nn1":["544789","544111","543758","544064","549242","549172","543857","544100","549177","555621","549174","544112","552177","544054","543754","549167"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","excavation","site","pit","scale","mountain","terrace","layer","deposit","operation"]}
