{"path":"546933.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a busy industrial scene, most likely associated with coal handling or similar operations. In the foreground, a group of workers wearing bright yellow and orange safety gear are gathered around a set of railroad tracks. They appear to be engaged in some kind of manual labor or discussion related to the operation or maintenance of the tracks or associated machinery.\n\nThe scene is set in a complex industrial environment where multiple railroad tracks converge and diverge, surrounded by large industrial structures and machinery. To the right, there's a coal car and a conveyor system that transports coal or similar materials into a larger structure, suggesting a coal processing or shipping facility.\n\nThe background is slightly obscured by the industrial haze but shows additional infrastructure and possibly distant buildings, hinting at an extensive industrial zone. Various pieces of equipment and structures are distributed throughout, creating a dense impression of industrial activity.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is dreary and cloudy, which might indicate either an overcast day or pollution associated with industrial activity, common in such environments during the time implied by the style and quality of the photograph. The color tones are primarily muted grays and blues with splashes of color from the workersâ€™ safety gear, enhancing the focus on human activity within this industrial setting.","title":"At the clinton marine terminal, some workers load freight cars with coal and others repair railroad track","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["542989","551006","555561","556871","554632","556893","556900","556322","556899","556866","556376","545503","551921","556898","556886","556859"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["coal","associate","railroad","track","gear","safety","worker","diverge","machinery","converge"]}
