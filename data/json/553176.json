{"path":"553176.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment among a crowd, focusing on an elderly man as the central figure. The man is dressed in a formal, dark suit and is wearing a classic fedora-style hat. He appears to be captured in mid-step, looking slightly off to the side, which suggests he is either walking through the area or momentarily pausing. His attire and the style of his glasses give a nod to mid-20th-century fashion, indicating the photo might be from an earlier era.\n\nThe surrounding figures are blurred and mostly in shadow, giving the impression of a busy, possibly urban setting. These silhouetted figures contribute to focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the elderly man by providing a dark contrast to his lighter, clearly focused form.\n\nThe background shows indistinct, leafy trees that are sunlit, suggesting an outdoor setting in a place with ample greenery, possibly a park or a street with trees. They are slightly out of focus, which helps in keeping the man as the main subject of the image. The lighting is natural, with sunlight filtering through the trees, casting varied shadows and highlighting different aspects of the man and the scene.\n\nCompositionally, the image utilizes a shallow depth of field, concentrating clarity on the man and allowing the rest of the scene to fade into soft focus. It forms an effective portrait amid an everyday setting, encapsulating a moment that feels both intimate and fleeting.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["556149","548218","557713","543037","548226","554857","547330","542613","552103","548302","547820","552871","547437","548236","548616","556443"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["man","figure","fedora","portrait","pause","concentrate","focus","form","utilize","keep"]}
