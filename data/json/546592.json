{"path":"546592.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a daytime scene at a bus stop, featuring several people and a public bus. The bus, prominently displayed in the foreground, is painted in bright red and white colors with \"GMC\" and \"NYC\" labels, indicating it's a GMC model operated in or by a company tagged with NYC, and it has the route number \"18X\" and destination \"Pentagon\" displayed at the top front. The bus's number \"1106\" and additional signs are visible on the front and side.\n\nThere are four individuals visible near the bus. To the left of the scene, a man in a dark coat and another in a military uniform, possibly an officer given the insignia, are in a conversation. A third man in a tan coat is in the process of boarding the bus, stepping up into it. Behind them, partially obscured, a fourth man dressed in a dark coat is also standing near the bus. The military presence and attire suggest some official or formal activity might be occurring, or that it is a routine part of traveling in this area, possibly due to proximity to the Pentagon.\n\nThe background shows a slightly blurred view of what appears to be a parking area with several cars and basic landscaping with barren trees, indicating it might be late fall or winter. The overall atmosphere appears calm and orderly, typical of a public transportation setting on a chilly day. The lighting suggests it's either early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Springfield, va park and ride metro bus station.  This will be a terminal when the metro subway is completed.
