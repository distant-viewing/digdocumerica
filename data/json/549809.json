{"path":"549809.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in an urban environment, likely a storage or collection area for recyclable materials, specifically newspapers. The central focus is a large, stacked pile of bundled newspapers which occupies much of the frame. The bundles are variously aligned but mostly stacked vertically, creating a somewhat haphazard but dense wall of paper.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a person appears to be actively engaged in the process of moving these newspaper bundles. The individual, who has long, flowing dark hair, is dressed in a dark jacket and is carrying a stack of newspapers. The person's expression and posture suggest a moment of action, possibly caught while shifting the bundles from one place to another.\n\nThe surroundings have a gritty and utilitarian look, with bare concrete flooring and walls that have some graffiti and posters. The lighting in the image is dim, contributing to the moody, industrial ambience. In the background, partially obscured by the newspapers, are additional elements like cartons and loosely scattered papers on the floor, enhancing the impression of a busy, somewhat cluttered workspace.\n\nOutside, through what seems to be an open garage door, a glimpse of a street scene is visible, with a car passing by, indicating that this space is directly connected to the street. This outdoor view provides some context of the urban setting in which this activity is taking place.","title":"The recycling center in park slope (Brooklyn) handles three tons of newspapers per week.
