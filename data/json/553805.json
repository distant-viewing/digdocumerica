{"path":"553805.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a serene coastal landscape. In the foreground, the rocky coastline is adorned with vibrant greenery and sporadic red flowers, which adds a splash of color contrasting the dominant blues and greens. The main focal point in the foreground is a large, moss-covered rock jutting out from the sea, around which the waters swirl.\n\nThe ocean occupies the middle ground and is characterized by its dark blue hue, with white foamy waves consistently rolling towards the shore. The rhythmic pattern of the waves creates a sense of motion and enhances the natural beauty of the seascape.\n\nIn the background, the scene is dominated by a large hill or mountain that slopes gently down towards the sea. The hill is covered with a blanket of lush green vegetation and few bare patches of earth showing through, suggesting either rocky terrain or areas worn by natural elements. The hillâ€™s contours are softly highlighted by the sunlight, which seems to be coming from the right side of the frame, casting gentle shadows and giving the landscape depth.\n\nThe sky above the scene is clear and vivid, contributing to the overall vibrant and refreshing atmosphere of the image. The natural light enhances the textures and colors of the landscape, creating a peaceful and picturesque setting.","title":"Point Lobos. (From the Sites Exhibition.
