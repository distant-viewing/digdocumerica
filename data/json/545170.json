{"path":"545170.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene at sunset. In the foreground, a large boat or small ship is sailing on calm waters, appearing to move from the left side of the frame towards the right. The boat is equipped with numerous antennae and a cabin; it looks like it might be used for fishing or as a work boat. A wooden structure, possibly part of a pier or wharf, is visible in the front left corner, framing the scene. In the background, the water extends toward the horizon beneath a dramatic sky, with a band of dark clouds along the top. Off to the right side of the frame, there is a navigational or marine signpost standing isolated in the water, equipped with what looks like a signal light.\n\nThe lighting of the scene is particularly notable, with the sunlight filtering through the clouds and reflecting off the ocean, creating a metallic sheen on the water. This gives the photograph a golden and warm tone, while the silhouette of the boat and other elements adds a sense of depth and interest. The tranquil water and the fading light evoke a peaceful, end-of-day mood.","title":"Oregon--Oswald West","placename":"Oswald West State Park (Or.)","location":"Oswald West State Park, Oregon","nn1":["543411","544251","553990","551215","548117","545055","553991","543956","548118","547110","544247","552038","547561","548247","543143","545120"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","antennae","signpost","water","sheen","standing","band","cloud","cabin","pier"]}
