{"path":"557583.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of what appears to be a weathered piece of timber or log with distinct textures and features. The wood surface is predominantly dark, charred and deeply textured with various cracks, crevices, and patterns that suggest it might have been exposed to extreme conditions like fire.\n\nThe texture varies across the frame; some areas are rough and jagged, while others appear more smooth and worn. In particular, there are linear, elongated formations and grooves that run along the wood, indicative of natural wood grain patterns and possibly the effects of weathering or decomposition.\n\nThe coloring of the wood is rich and dark, with varying shades of black and gray that hint at a history of burning or prolonged exposure to harsh elements. There's an interesting contrast in the image as well, with a tiny, noticeably lighter object - possibly a small leaf or piece of debris - situated on the wood. This small element stands out due to its lighter color and provides a focal point amidst the dark, textured background.\n\nOverall, the composition is primarily horizontal, emphasizing the length and linear qualities of the wood, and the photograph conveys a sense of age, endurance, and the natural processes of decay and change in organic materials.","title":"Hemlock seedling growing in a burned clear-cut area of the olympic national timberland.
