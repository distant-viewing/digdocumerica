{"path":"554141.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic volcanic landscape dominated by a rough, uneven expanse of solidified lava. In the distance, a small eruption is visible with bright orange lava spurting upward, flanked by plumes of white and gray smoke that billow into the air, creating a stark contrast against the dark, hardened lava field in the foreground.\n\nThe terrain is rugged and appears barren, characterized by the shiny, textured surface of the lava which reflects light in some areas, giving it an almost metallic sheen. Several visible fissures and cracks add to the harshness of the environment.\n\nThe composition of the photo uses a slightly high angle, capturing the vastness of the lava field that stretches out towards the erupting volcano, emphasizing the isolation and raw power of the natural scene. The sky is not visible, focusing all attention on the geological activity and the stark, natural beauty of the volcanic landscape.","title":"Volcanic mauna ulu in eruption","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554140","555227","544694","555161","555158","543707","553037","550813","555885","554138","554142","554090","551284","552424","555084","543798"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["lava","harshness","sheen","field","crack","billow","plume","vastness","flank","power"]}
