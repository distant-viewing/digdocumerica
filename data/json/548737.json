{"path":"548737.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a relaxed outdoor scene featuring several individuals engaged in fishing alongside a river. There are six people visible, spaced at intervals along the bank. The setting appears to be a sunny day as indicated by the bright lighting and shadows cast on the ground.\n\nFrom left to right, a young boy is walking along the edge of the water with a fishing rod in his hand, gazing towards the river. Next to him, a younger child, slightly blurred, stands holding a fishing rod, looking out over the water.\n\nFurther along, an adult, likely a woman, is focused on casting her line into the river. She is joined by three more individuals; the first is another adult in a casual stance holding a fishing rod, the second (in the center), wears a white hat and red shorts, actively casting a fishing line, and the third, further to the right, also prepares to cast or is in the midst of fishing.\n\nThe background features a dense growth of greenery across the river, likely mangroves or a similar type of riverine forest, contributing to a serene natural ambiance. The river's water appears calm, reflecting some light and bordered by a shoreline that is somewhat rocky or covered in small debris, possibly shells or pebbles.\n\nOverall, the composition and the attire of the individuals suggest a casual, recreational atmosphere, likely a family or a group of friends enjoying a day of fishing in nature.","title":"Vacationers at Spanish Harbor Key find sheltered cove offers good fishing.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["550848","546811","549935","543164","542564","542648","544223","553081","543516","550850","542647","548190","546800","542560","544274","551430"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","rod","river","mangrove","adult","interval","shell","individual","pebble","friend"]}
