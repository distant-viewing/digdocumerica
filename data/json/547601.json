{"path":"547601.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This color photograph features a dilapidated and rusty car that has evidently been abandoned by a body of water. The car, which appears to be from the mid-twentieth century based on its design, is missing its wheels and is in a state of significant decay; its paint is worn away, exposing rusty metal, and the interior seems gutted and exposed to the elements.\n\nThe car is positioned on a shoreline covered with rubble and debris, suggesting a neglected or possibly post-disaster area. To the left of the image, the water surface is calm and extends toward a bridge visible in the distance, possibly indicating a municipal area. Beyond the bridge, structures which look like homes or buildings can be glimpsed.\n\nThe background displays a cloud-filled sky which contributes to the somber and desolate mood communicated by the discarded state of the car and its surroundings. The overall scene relays a poignant blend of neglect and the persistence of nature.","title":"Car abandoned on Seekonk River bank","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547481","547484","546318","547839","547605","547835","547911","547597","546315","547923","549107","545540","552073","546173","548752","553007"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","state","bridge","rubble","wheel","paint","neglect","interior","decay","home"]}
