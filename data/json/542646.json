{"path":"542646.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures a man engaged in fishing, set against a serene, natural riverside backdrop. The man, whose appearance is shown from behind, is holding tightly onto a fishing rod that is significantly bent, suggesting that he is battling to reel in a catch. He is dressed in a light beige shirt and appears to be focused on his task.\n\nThe location is picturesque, featuring a flowing river surrounded by hilly terrain. The banks of the river are rocky and sparsely vegetated, indicating a somewhat arid region. Sparse foliage and medium-sized trees dot the landscape which slopes gently up into hills in the background. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting good weather conditions for outdoor activities.\n\nIn the distance, beyond the river, there is a visible road with a couple of parked cars, hinting at a relatively accessible location rather than a remote wilderness. The overall composition and lighting of the photograph provide a sense of tranquility and focused outdoor activity.","title":"Fishing for rainbow trout below dam","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["554520","550666","550313","554519","550317","550665","542529","551025","555576","542509","549935","550217","551024","548138","542744","543628"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","river","catch","location","riverside","rod","couple","wilderness","bank","task"]}
