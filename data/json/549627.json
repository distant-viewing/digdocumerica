{"path":"549627.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor scene likely within a laboratory or technical environment, featuring two men engaged with sophisticated equipment. The photo is lit predominantly in blue tones, creating a subdued and serious atmosphere.\n\nOn the left side of the image, one man, wearing dark glasses and dressed in a white shirt, is seated and focusing intently on something out of the frame. To his right stands another man, who is partially facing the camera. He is dressed in a light polo shirt and is manipulating or adjusting a component of the large cylindrical device positioned in the center of the photo.\n\nThe cylindrical device, which dominates the central area of the photograph, appears to be a large piece of machinery or experimental apparatus, possibly related to scientific research or industrial processes. Itâ€™s connected to various tubes and has sections that are transparent, through which a blue light emits.\n\nThe background is dark and mostly obscured, focusing the viewer's attention on the subjects and the equipment. The overall setting suggests a controlled and precise environment typical of a scientific or engineering research facility. The mood is concentrated and professional, with an emphasis on the interaction between the individuals and the technology they are handling.","title":"Scientists with photochemical tube reactor manufacture smog at the statewide air pollution research center","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["542667","549367","549684","555334","556557","551595","552386","542765","542665","546344","555332","549364","553329","542659","542664","552356"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["research","device","polo","manipulate","tube","equipment","laboratory","apparatus","engineering","technology"]}
