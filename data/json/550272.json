{"path":"550272.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph presents a somber environmental message through a close-up of a warning sign attached to a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. The sign, which appears weathered, bears a message in bold capital letters: \"WARNING - THIS WATER IS POLLUTED - IT IS NOT SAFE FOR WADING OR BATHING - BY ORDER OF CITY HEALTH - CITY OF CLEVELAND\". The backdrop features a blurred view of an open field and what appears to be industrial smokestacks emitting smoke or steam in the distance, reinforcing the pollution theme. The natural colors are muted, mostly in shades of green and gray, suggesting an overcast or gloomy day. The composition and elements in this image collectively underscore concerns about pollution and environmental health.","title":"White city beach on lake erie","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550276","550223","550280","550688","544813","550258","544804","544784","551560","547493","551562","547992","550812","546805","552989","553749"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["warning","message","wading","pollution","barbed","capital","health","emitte","chain","link"]}
