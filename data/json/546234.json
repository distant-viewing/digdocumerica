{"path":"546234.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This image depicts a landfill or waste disposal site, heavily cluttered with mountains of trash and debris. In the forefront, there's an abundance of scattered waste, primarily consisting of cardboard boxes, broken wood pieces, and miscellaneous trash that blends into a carpet of discarded items.\n\nProminently featured in the middle of the photo are three bulldozers, actively engaged in the task of moving and compacting the waste. Each bulldozer is operated by a person, visible in the driver's seat, contributing to the ongoing management of the site. The bulldozers, covered in dirt and debris, illustrate the grim reality of waste management operations.\n\nAt the back, beyond the machinery and heaps of waste, a large mound of dirt is noticeable, likely used to cover the landfill each day to minimize the odor and keep animals away. Thereâ€™s also a glimpse of a truck on the left side of the image and some industrial buildings in the far background, suggesting that this site is on the outskirts of an urban area, separated from residential spaces.\n\nOverall, the scene is a stark snapshot of environmental burden, illustrating the ongoing challenges associated with waste management and disposal. The sky is clear, indicating a dry, sunny day, which adds sharpness to the details of the trash and equipment at work.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
