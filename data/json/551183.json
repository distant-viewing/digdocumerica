{"path":"551183.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial complex adjacent to a water body. The scene is heavily industrial, with various large buildings, numerous storage tanks, and tall chimneys emitting smoke. The proximity to the water is structured with wharves at which several flat barges are docked.\n\nThe facility seems to spread extensively with equipment and infrastructure dedicated presumably to the processing or manufacturing operations typical in heavy industry. The area is densely packed with metal frameworks, pipelines, and large cylindrical structures that could be part of the machinery or storage facilities.\n\nA noteworthy aspect is the discharge from the complex directly into the water, visible as a plume of different coloration, suggesting pollution or effluent release. The surrounding environment features little to no vegetation, highlighting the industrial dominance in the area.\n\nThe general wear and the somber color palette indicate either the old age of the structures or the kind of heavy industrial activity that takes place, which appears to have significant environmental impacts, as seen by the state of the adjacent water and the lack of green spaces.","title":"Effluent from the union carbide chemical plant flows into the kanawha river.
