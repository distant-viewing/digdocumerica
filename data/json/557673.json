{"path":"557673.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The image features an expansive garden lined with rows of young, green plants that are vibrant against the rich red-brown soil. There are multiple rows visible, prominently featuring corn stalks in the foreground. The middle of the photo shows two white trailer homes positioned side by side, indicating a residential setting. These trailers have small steps leading up to their doors, and various items are scattered around them, typical of a lived-in outdoor spaceâ€”such as a white propane tank next to one trailer, and around the area, clotheslines with hanging garments suggest daily domestic activities.\n\nThe background shows a densely wooded area with lush green trees on a hill just behind the trailers, portraying a rural or semi-rural setting. The sky above is mostly clear with only a few fluffy, white clouds, suggesting a bright, sunny day which contrasts with the dark, forested hills. The entire scene is overlaid with power lines at the top, hinting at the integration of modern utilities in this rustic environment. This mix of man-made structures with natural elements provides a peaceful coexistence of rural life.","title":"Garden and Mobile homes on unicoi street in helen, Georgia near robertstown.
