{"path":"555063.jpg","date":"June 1965","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up view of a deeply textured wooden surface, likely from a piece of petrified wood or heavily weathered wood. The wood's texture is rich with deep cracks and crevices running horizontally across the image, giving a sense of layered history and natural decay. Each layer varies slightly in color from shades of brown to black, reflecting different stages of exposure and weathering.\n\nA small green plant, probably a sapling or a resilient type of weed, emerges from one of the crevices near the left side of the image. This juxtaposition contrasts the enduring, hard texture of the old wood with the delicate, youthful greenery, symbolizing new life sprouting from aged environments.\n\nAdditionally, there is a thin, slightly curved object embedded in the wood towards the center-right. It appears metallic and could possibly be an old nail or another piece of debris that adds to the narrative of past human interaction with this piece of wood.\n\nThe overall composition highlights themes of resilience and rebirth in nature, with textures and objects that create a compelling visual story of survival and history.","title":"A millipede on a dead log with a Douglas fir seedling in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557583","555001","555059","545521","542749","555141","555188","555016","551355","555183","555082","553586","542571","554604","557616","555181"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["wood","crevice","history","piece","survival","sprout","texture","embed","weed","symbolize"]}
