{"path":"554085.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph presents a serene coastal landscape framed through what appears to be slats of wood. It captures a lush and tranquil rural setting under a clear blue sky with a few scattered clouds. \n\nIn the foreground, a dirt road or path curves gently, lined on one side with a lush greenery and shrubbery. A small house or cabin with a light-colored roof and green walls is nestled among scattered palm trees and other vegetation, adding a quaint touch to the scene.\n\nIn the midground, the terrain slopes down towards the ocean, featuring neatly organized agricultural fields. This area has sparse vegetation interspersed with patches of grass and a few figures that can be seen walking or working in the fields, emphasizing the area’s agricultural use.\n\nBeyond the fields, the landscape opens up to a dramatic view of the ocean, meeting the horizon in a calm expanse of blue. The coastline is visibly rocky and rugged, contrasting with the man-made elements and cultivated land.\n\nThe composition and natural framing created by the wooden slats add an artistic feel to the scene, directing the viewer’s focus towards the central and lower parts of the image. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, depicting a simple, rural lifestyle close to nature.","title":"House in rural district along highway 36 near hana.
