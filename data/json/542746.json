{"path":"542746.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a lively campground scene, nestled among tall pine trees. The image has a vintage quality, likely taken in the mid-20th century, judging by the style of vehicles and trailers visible.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a large, older model camper with an extended awning, under which several people are gathered around a campsite. A man, visible only from the back and partially obscured by trees, is standing near a table, appearing to be either cooking or organizing camping gear. Beside him, there are various camping items scattered around, including what looks like a white cooler.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows a variety of vehicles and trailers, highlighting the popularity of the site. There's an impressive array of 1950s to 1970s vehicles and recreational vehicles, including a distinct silver Airstream trailer. The vehicles are parked amidst the trees, suggesting a blend of nature with recreational activity.\n\nIn the background, more trees and vehicles are visible, indicating the expansive nature of the campground. The dense forest setting suggests that this campground is likely in a mountainous or northern forested area, providing a shady retreat with ample outdoor activities.\n\nOverall, the scene is bustling with the dynamic of outdoor life, where families or groups of people come to enjoy nature, illustrated by the casual dress of the individuals and the relaxed setting. The atmosphere is convivial and informal, a snapshot of recreational pastime in a bygone era.","title":"Lodgepole campground during Memorial Day weekend","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["554181","554479","557514","545160","544387","542747","544449","548668","553133","554478","554863","548748","554681","548796","554480","545225"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["trailer","vehicle","camping","popularity","cook","campsite","camper","awning","retreat","dynamic"]}
