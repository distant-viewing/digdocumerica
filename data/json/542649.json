{"path":"542649.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows two individuals—a man and a woman—walking along a path near a large dam. The dam itself is a massive concrete structure, occupying the entire left side of the image, with water flowing down at the center of the dam face. The landscape around is rocky and features some grassy and bushy areas on the slopes.\n\nIn the foreground on the right, there's a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire which frames the scene. Attached to this fence is a prominent yellow warning sign with the text: \"WARNING: WATER RELEASES FROM THIS DAM ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT CHANGE - U.S. ARMY ENGINEER DIVISION, SACRAMENTO DISTRICT.\" This sign indicates the potential danger or unpredictability associated with water release from the dam.\n\nBoth individuals are dressed in casual outdoor attire suitable for hiking or walking in a rural setting. The man has a beard and wears a plaid shirt, jeans, and boots, while the woman wears a light jacket, pants, and carries a small backpack. They appear to be engaged in a leisurely activity, possibly exploring or walking near the dam area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of a quiet, natural setting with an undertone of caution due to the proximity of the dam and the potential dangers associated with it. The bright sunlight and clear blue sky suggest that the photo was taken on a sunny day, enhancing the visibility and vividness of the surroundings.","title":"Girl carries 18\" rainbow trout","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["546199","550846","550213","546338","550743","551212","549486","553137","552117","550654","543978","544151","557241","544141","549004","553412"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["dam","danger","warning","fence","undertone","engineer","caution","link","backpack","hiking"]}
