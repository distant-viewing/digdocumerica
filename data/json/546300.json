{"path":"546300.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures two individuals involved in an environmental or scientific activity in a marshland. The setting is an open water area surrounded by dense, tall grasses and reeds, under a cloudy sky. The mood conveys a sense of serene engagement with nature.\n\nOn the left, there is a woman wearing a short-sleeved shirt, denim pants with a belt, and eyeglasses. She has long, straight hair and appears to be pouring a liquid from a white bucket into a smaller container, perhaps collecting water samples. Her expression is focused as she performs her task.\n\nOn the right, a man, bare-chested and wearing denim shorts, is examining a transparent, long measuring device, possibly a water sampling tube or a measuring stick indicative of similar environmental research activities. His expression, like his counterpart’s, is one of concentration.\n\nBoth individuals are standing in the water, suggesting the depth isn’t very significant where they are, but it's sufficient for their research activities. Their attire and equipment hint that they are perhaps scientists or researchers studying the water quality or aquatic environment.\n\nThe sky and water blend in palette, creating a holistic natural environment that enhances the focus on the individuals and their activity. This image tells a story of environmental exploration and engagement, highlighting a moment of human interaction with the natural world.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory biologists on a field trip to a salt marsh.
