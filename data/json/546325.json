{"path":"546325.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of a man engaged in a precise laboratory activity involving archaeological or geological specimens. The man is partially seen on the left side of the frame, focusing intently on his task. He wears a red shirt and has short, light-colored hair.\n\nThe man is handling a fossil or rock embedded in a clear block of material, possibly acrylic or some form of resin, using a small hand tool, likely for detailed cleaning or examination. His hands and the tool are near the center of the frame, drawing the viewer's eye to the delicate nature of the work being performed.\n\nIn the background, there is a wooden box divided into multiple compartments, each containing similar rocks or fossils as the one being handled. This arrangement suggests a systematic study or cataloging process. Beside the box, there is what appears to be electronic equipment, perhaps related to the analysis or preservation of the specimens.\n\nThe setting appears to be an indoor laboratory or workshop, as indicated by the technical equipment and organized work environment. The floor is covered with a patterned mat, and the overall ambiance suggests a scientific research atmosphere, focused on the detailed study of geological or biological samples.","title":"Epa Gulf Breeze Laboratory: bioassay wet lab.
