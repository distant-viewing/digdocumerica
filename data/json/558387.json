{"path":"558387.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Villalobos, Horacio","caption":"This photograph features a young man standing while playing an acoustic guitar. He appears absorbed in his performance, gazing off to the side with a contemplative expression. He is dressed in a dark blazer over a lighter shirt and wears round, tinted glasses. His hair is styled in a typical 1970s fashion, slightly shaggy and just over the ears.\n\nIn the background, there are other people, presumably an audience or fellow performers, sitting in what looks like pews, suggesting the setting might be inside a church or a similar establishment with wooden interiors. The vertical, wooden panels and large window panes contribute to an aesthetic of simplicity and function, typical of such venues.\n\nThe lighting in the photo highlights the performer, emphasizing his central role in the scene. The overall ambiance is one of casual, intimate performance, possibly during a small gathering or an informal event.","title":"Religion plays an important part in the lives of residents. The largest group of churchgoers are Roman Catholics. A member of the parish is shown playing a guitar at a folk mass. This weekly event was begun for the younger people and has become the most popular mass with standing room only. The New Ulm Cathedral interior is decorated with baroque carvings reminiscent of churches in southern Germany's Bavarian.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["553152","554283","551317","558391","551479","548560","553890","556474","558283","551782","556305","551709","556307","558263","548262","556310"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["performer","performance","pew","guitar","ear","blazer","pane","venue","audience","establishment"]}
