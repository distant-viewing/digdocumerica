{"path":"544042.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural scene interspersed with signs of human impact. It shows a body of water likely a lake or pond, edged by a rough, rocky terrain. The water, dark in color and rippled, contrasts with the bright hues of the rocky shore. A distinctive feature in this scene is a creamy white and rusty red layered deposit, perhaps sediment or mineral effluence, curving along the water's edge, which adds a textural and color contrast to the scene. Also noticeable is a discarded black tire lying partly on these layered deposits and partly in the water, hinting at environmental pollution. The surrounding area is strewn with large and small rocks in varying shades of reddish-brown, typical of a rugged terrain, possibly a quarry or a mining area given the mineral streaks in the deposit. The overall composition emphasizes a stark yet vivid interface between natural elements and human-induced changes.","title":"Waste-rock dump","placename":"Morenci (Ariz.)","location":"Morenci, Arizona","nn1":["555626","552443","543552","555549","545014","545904","544692","550492","547905","547493","543815","550368","544580","551519","544790","552811"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["deposit","creamy","ed","quarry","interface","strew","streak","mineral","pond","sediment"]}
