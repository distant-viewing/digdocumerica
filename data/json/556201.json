{"path":"556201.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph depicts an urban parking lot scene that appears to be from around the 1970s, based on the style and model of the vehicles visible. The area is busy, with various activities occurring simultaneously:\n\n1. Various types of vehicles, including sedans, vans, and a truck, are randomly parked in the lot. The cars primarily feature the boxy design typical of the mid-20th century automobile design, with prominent chrome bumpers and square body shapes. Several cars have their doors open, indicating that people have recently arrived or are preparing to leave.\n\n2. Numerous men are scattered throughout the lot, primarily dressed in formal or semi-formal attire, which suggests business or official duties. Most wear white shirts, some have ties, and others have their sleeves rolled up, indicating activity or work.\n\n3. Two men to the right are engaged in a conversation beside a car; another is walking towards the van in the center that appears somewhat like a service or utility vehicle with its doors open, suggesting some logistical or preparation activity taking place. \n\n4. There is some clutter on the ground near the central van such as boxes and what appear to be sandbags or weights, indicating some kind of work, setup, or cleanup is in progress.\n\n5. In the background, there are industrial structures, and the blur in the photo doesn't allow for detailed identification but suggests a developed, possibly urban environment. Multiple parking lots with many more cars are visible further back, indicating a large, busy area.\n\n6. The environment and quality of the air appear a bit hazy, possibly due to pollution or heat, typical of urban landscapes in that era, especially in industrial areas or during hot days.\n\nThe overall scene captures a moment in a bustling urban setting, likely involving some level of professional or logistical activity, surrounded by the architectural and automotive designs characteristic of the 1970s.","title":"Motorists wait in line at soldier's field, one of nine auto pollution test sites conducted free by the city of Chicago's environmental control department.
