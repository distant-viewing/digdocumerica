{"path":"556909.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a serene coastal landscape, characterized by a blend of natural and man-made elements. The scene is likely captured during either the late afternoon or early evening, based on the muted lighting and gentle shadows.\n\nThe image prominently features a calm body of water that reflects a cloudy sky. Along the left-hand side of the photo, the shoreline curves gracefully, hugged by a winding road bordered by dense, dark green forests. The lush tree line indicates a rich, temperate rainforest environment typical of regions like the Pacific Northwest.\n\nOn the shores, central to the composition, lies a facility that appears to specialize in seaplane operations. Several seaplanes are neatly aligned along a series of docks, suggesting a hub for either tourist excursions or local transportation. There is also a substantial building adjacent to the planes which likely serves as the main operations center or terminal for the facility. \n\nThe infrastructure for this seaplane base includes multiple docks and a large parking lot indicating considerable human activity, although no individuals are discernible in the scene. The arrangement of the planes and the orderly nature of the docks and parking area suggest a well-maintained and operationally efficient facility.\n\nThe backdrop and surrounding environment feel somewhat isolated and tranquil, with no evident signs of urban development beyond the immediate vicinity of the seaplane base. This setting is evocative of areas where natural beauty is preserved and where air travel via seaplanes provides a necessary or more practical mode of transportation.","title":"Aerial view of Bangor annex.
