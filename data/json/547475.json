{"path":"547475.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and atmospheric scene of the ocean. The image is dominated by the varying shades and textures of the sea water, depicted in a monochromatic purple tone. The horizon blends seamlessly with the sky, creating a sense of depth and vastness.\n\nThe foreground features gentle waves breaking near the shore, with white foamy textures that contrast against the darker tones of the water. The middle of the frame shows slightly rougher waters, with waves forming whitecaps as they roll towards the shore.\n\nThe surface of the water is reflective, picking up the light and creating glistening patterns that add to the serene ambiance. The overall lighting is subdued, suggesting this might be either dawn or dusk, contributing to the purple hue and somewhat moody feel of the scene.\n\nBeyond the waves, the ocean extends to the horizon in a smooth gradient of dark to lighter purple, indicating the vast, open and calm sea continuing into the distance without visible interruption. The sky above the horizon is featureless and maintains the uniform color scheme, emphasizing the simplicity and tranquility of the view.\n\nNo people, objects, or other distractions are present, allowing the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the natural beauty and peacefulness of the oceanic landscape. This composition invites contemplation and evokes a sense of isolation and infinite space.","title":"Rhode island sound","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["554003","555717","543138","557814","555713","544679","548754","550391","554002","553989","543091","547638","543025","555803","553852","557813"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["wave","interruption","ocean","whitecap","horizon","shore","sea","distraction","immerse","pick"]}
