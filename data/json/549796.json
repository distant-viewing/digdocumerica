{"path":"549796.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a rugged, industrial scene centered around a large bulldozer at work in a landfill. The bulldozer is captured from a slightly elevated angle, showing it amidst a mountain of trash. It's an older model with a visible cab and large, dirty wheels, moving forward and pushing debris which includes various types of waste. Plumes of dark smoke emit from the bulldozer's stack, rising into the air and adding to the gritty atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe landfill itself is filled with a chaotic assortment of refuse. The mixture includes discernible items such as twisted metals, fragments of household items, and other unidentifiable debris that has been discarded and piled up. The ground is uneven and covered in patches of dirt and scattered waste, reinforcing the harshness of the environment.\n\nThere's a stark contrast in the scene, with the mechanical, smoke-emitting bulldozer against the passive heap of waste, showcasing a moment in waste management and environmental impact. The background is mostly obscured by the mound of trash and the bulldozer, but it suggests a barren, open landscape that further emphasizes the isolation and desolation of the landfill setting.","title":"At Staten Island landfill.
