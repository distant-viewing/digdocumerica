{"path":"546272.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic moment during a baseball game. In the foreground, three players are the main focus. On the left, a young batter in a white and gray uniform with \"LYONS CO.\" printed on the front, is in the midst of a powerful swing, body turned as he follows through after hitting the ball, his right foot pivoted and left leg bent for leverage. He’s wearing a batting helmet, cleats, and has striped socks.\n\nBeside him, focused on catching the ball, is the catcher, clad in the traditional protective gear including a catcher’s mask, chest protector, and leg guards. His posture is low and ready, glove positioned to catch the ball. A squatting umpire, wearing protective gear and a bright red polo shirt, occupies the space directly behind the catcher, observing the action closely.\n\nIn the background, visible through a black chain-link fence marked with a \"VISITORS\" sign, is a group of onlookers and players in varying casual wear and sports uniforms, emphasizing that this is likely a community or school sports event. They are mostly standing, watching the game, positioned under the shade structures probably due to sunny weather as indicated by the bright daylight casting sharp shadows on the ground.\n\nThe setting is a well-maintained dirt baseball field with sections of grass visible around it, suggesting a park or recreational sports facility dedicated to baseball. The overall mood is intense yet playful, typical of youth sports, capturing a quintessential slice of American culture in athletics.","title":"This little league baseball field was built on sanitary landfill.","placename":"Jackson (Miss.)","location":"Jackson, Mississippi","nn1":["553042","556303","549284","551103","557780","556302","552024","549318","556507","551094","551099","550078","551095","549271","555916","550170"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["ball","baseball","sport","player","game","leg","uniform","catch","gear","leverage"]}
