{"path":"545640.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a panoramic view of a river landscape surrounded by rugged terrain. The river, which meanders through the scene, reflects the sky and has various hues of brown and red, potentially indicating sediment or clay content. The riverbanks are uneven and marked with layers of sedimentary rock, showcasing geological stratification.\n\nTo the left of the photograph, the landscape dips into a valley where a part of the river widens into what appears to be a small basin or delta. In this area, there are several small structures or vehicles, suggesting human activity, likely related to either monitoring or tourism. Some green vegetation is scattered around these structures, indicating moisture presence that supports plant life.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is mountainous and arid, characterized by deep reds and browns which are typical for canyon or desert regions, possibly pointing to an erosion-rich environment. The sky above is partly cloudy but allows enough light to illuminate the vibrant, earthy tones of the landscape.\n\nThis setting could be indicative of a river valley in a desert area, perhaps in the southwestern United States, known for its dramatic and colorful landscapes shaped by water erosion over millions of years. The overall composition highlights the stark contrasts between the waterway and its harsh, dry surroundings.","title":"Aerial view upstream of boom site in Monument Valley, Utah where oil spill into the San Juan river was contained before flooding caused overflow of oil and debris into lake powell.
