{"path":"543045.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image provides a stunning aerial view of a rugged coastal landscape. The photograph shows a long, curved beach flanked by dramatic cliffs. The coastline stretches into the distance, enveloped in part by a blanket of white clouds hovering above the sea and partially covering the land. The clear skies above this fog bank reveal a vast expanse suggestive of a calm day.\n\nThe ocean near the coastline is clearly turbulent, as evident from the white waves crashing against the cliffs and the foamy surf along the beach. The cliffs are steep and appear as a gradient of deep browns and shadows, indicating erosion or varied geological formations.\n\nTo the right of the image, the land rises gently compared to the cliffs, showing rolling hills that fade into the horizon, where the land meets more distant clouds or fog. The colors are natural and earth-toned, dominated by the blues of the ocean and sky, the white of the surf and clouds, and the varied browns of the cliffs and landscape. The scene is devoid of any visible human activity or man-made structures, presenting a pure and natural vista.","title":"Redwood forests cover much of this region of northern California","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["545934","543328","543300","543085","543430","547991","554023","545129","543184","545125","545230","543061","545222","543434","553771","554024"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","surf","fog","coastline","land","browns","cloud","ocean","crashe","beach"]}
