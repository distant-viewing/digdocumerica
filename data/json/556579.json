{"path":"556579.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and slightly misty mountainous landscape featuring a winding road. The road, coated in asphalt, curves gently to the left and is marked with double yellow lines at the center, indicating a no-passing zone. The road's edges are bordered with solid white lines, and a metal barrier runs along the right side, separating the road from the lush, dense greenery.\n\nOn the road, there's a solitary car, possibly a sedan, painted in a bright color that contrasts sharply with the surrounding muted tones of green and gray. The car is driving away from the viewpoint, heading around the curve.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is heavily forested with a variety of trees, possibly including evergreens and deciduous trees, showing rich, deep green hues. The atmosphere is hazy, suggesting either early morning mist or a damp, overcast day, which adds a layer of mystique and tranquility to the scenery.\n\nIn the background, the mountains layer into each other, creating depth with each successive ridge fading into a lighter tone due to the fog or mist. This effect gives the photograph a sense of vastness and quiet isolation, emphasizing the natural beauty of the landscape. The sky is overcast, with no visible details other than a uniform grayish tone, suggesting a cool, damp climate.","title":"The West Virginia Turnpike north of Beckley winds through beautiful wooded countryside. It was the establishment of a network of lesser roads that allowed miners to commute a greater distance to work, and was one of the factors which lead to the decline of the company coal towns.","placename":"Beckley (W.
