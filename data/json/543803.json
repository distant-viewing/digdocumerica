{"path":"543803.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph shows an individual conducting some kind of experiment or observation with water. The person's body is not fully visible; we only see their hands and lower arms. The person is holding a clear, cylindrical glass container filled with water, examining its contents. This action takes place beside a water treatment or testing facility, evidenced by the infrastructure visible in the picture, which includes metal bars and concrete structures.\n\nIn the foreground, the focus is on the frothy, churning water, which seems to be flowing from one area to another through an opening partially obscured by a metal frame. This suggests the water is being aerated or purified as part of a treatment process. In the background, which is less focused, you can see a grassy area with a couple of trees, indicating that the facility is located in an open, possibly suburban setting. The overall scene captures a moment of water quality testing or observation, providing insights into environmental management or scientific study practices.","title":"Clear water at outlet of sewage treatment plant is cleaner than the water of the stream it will be dumped into.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["546904","543812","543808","549628","543799","543810","553901","543811","542990","542988","550720","546343","545634","542982","547568","548212"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["testing","treatment","observation","water","churn","insight","experiment","facility","conduct","bar"]}
