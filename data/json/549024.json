{"path":"549024.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers a dramatic aerial view of a significant engineering achievement, featuring a large dam surrounded by a mountainous landscape. The dam itself, which is an arch-gravity type, curves gracefully across the image from the bottom right hand corner towards the center, backed by a sprawling blue reservoir. This reservoir is cradled by rugged terrains colored in shades of brown and gray, indicative of a desert environment. Several roads zigzag around the hills, connecting various facilities and viewpoints. To the bottom of the dam, the river continues its course, bordered by steep canyon walls that accentuate the height and grandeur of the dam itself. In the broader context, this dam is encircled by undulating mountain ranges, which fade into the horizon under a hazy sky, suggesting the vastness and isolated nature of the location. The overall composition showcases human ingenuity seamlessly integrated into the natural world, emphasizing a balance between construction and the environment.","title":"Hoover Dam on the Colorado River","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548927","548947","548936","549004","544166","548012","548013","548975","553828","548920","544141","548007","548003","548930","548938","548925"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","reservoir","cradle","gravity","bottom","zigzag","achievement","encircle","course","canyon"]}
