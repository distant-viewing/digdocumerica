{"path":"550962.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph depicts a man engaged in an activity on a boat or riverine setting. The man is dressed in a black cap, dark sunglasses, and seems to wear a black jacket over a darker shirt. He is kneeling on a solid surface while working with a cylindrical gas canister and what appears to be a metal hose or a sampling device. Multiple clear glass jars are placed nearby on the surface; some with lids attached, possibly used for collecting samples.\n\nThe background reveals a large body of water, likely a river, which extends into a horizon bounded by wooded hills. Few structures, possibly houses or shacks, are visible on the far banks of the river, and the sky is partly cloudy.\n\nThe setting gives a sense of outdoor research or environmental monitoring work, emphasizing the focus on natural water bodies and possibly checking water quality or similar scientific activities. The overall muted and natural tones suggest the photograph could be taken during a colder season or on a cloudy day, adding a serene yet focused ambiance to the scene.","title":"The Kanawha River","placename":"Charleston (W.
