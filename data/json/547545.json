{"path":"547545.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a beachscape predominantly featuring a winding array of black, tar-like blobs scattered across the otherwise smooth, light-colored sandy beach. The tar blobs vary in size and shape, some small and rounded, others larger and irregular, speckled with shiny spots that suggest they might still be wet or sticky. These splotches form a trail that curves slightly as it travels down the length of the beach, closer to the water's edge on one side.\n\nThere's a stark visual contrast between the natural sandy texture of the beach and the harsh, man-made appearance of the tar. In the distance, the beach continues along the shoreline, curving out of view. The horizon is clear, showing either a very calm body of water or a low-lying mist that obscures the separation between sea and sky. On the far right of the image, there appears to be a small, indistinct figure or possibly some equipment near the water line, suggesting there might be people or activities occurring farther away.\n\nThe scene is set under bright, daylight conditions that highlight the textures and disparities in materials. Overall, the photograph probably aims to draw attention to environmental issues, such as pollution, affecting natural coastal areas.","title":"Oil stained beach--result of a spill by a tanker in Narragansett bay","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["546393","550197","546965","548741","547831","547607","544989","551554","550280","550215","557484","548747","544617","546374","542890","543089"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["beach","curve","separation","affect","occur","aim","issue","continue","trail","texture"]}
