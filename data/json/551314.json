{"path":"551314.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene nighttime camping scene outside. It features three children of various ages gathered around a small, glowing campfire. They seem to be engaged in a casual outdoor activity, potentially roasting marshmallows or enjoying the warmth of the fire. The children are sitting close to the ground, and it appears they are attentively watching the fire or talking to each other.\n\nIn the background, there is a tent set up, suggesting that these children are on a camping trip. The tent is partially illuminated by a bright light source, possibly from a portable lamp or a nearby campsite light, which also lights up the surrounding area slightly. Thereâ€™s a sense of a wooded or rural campground, although specific details of the environment are subdued due to the nighttime setting.\n\nThe entire scene is cast in shadows and hues typical of a night lit only by fire and artificial lights, creating a cozy and intimate outdoor atmosphere. The image effectively captures a typical moment of adventure and relaxation that is often experienced during camping trips.","title":"St. Louis family gather around a campfire in the Lake of the Ozarks State Park campground.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["551315","544855","551399","545778","542727","554863","548792","551431","543230","548796","545774","548797","543889","548795","549450","545698"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["camping","fire","nighttime","tent","trip","child","campfire","campsite","warmth","night"]}
