{"path":"544222.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up image of a young boy, who appears shirtless and is holding a small bird in his hands. The bird, seemingly a fledgling, has dark feathers and a prominent beak. The boy is looking slightly off-camera with a subtle half-smile, giving him a mischievous or contemplative expression. He has tousled, shoulder-length hair partly falling over his forehead.\n\nThe boy's expression, combined with the way he gently holds the bird, suggests a moment of tender interaction with nature. His hands are carefully wrapped around the bird, with one hand supporting its body and the other lightly holding its head, indicating both care and curiosity about the creature.\n\nThe background is largely out-of-focus with a soft, undefined light gray or cloudy color, which highlights the subjects at the front. The light on the boyâ€™s face and the sharp focus on his and the bird's features draw the viewer's attention directly to them, emphasizing a moment of connection between human and bird. The overall composition and natural light contribute to the emotive and serene quality of the image.","title":"This fisherman's son lives in Bayou Gauche, deep in the wetlands of Louisiana","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["545214","544211","542542","551022","553876","543870","543866","545307","557628","544505","553170","544547","553494","549299","557204","556606"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","boy","hand","forehead","hold","tousl","beak","tender","creature","feather"]}
