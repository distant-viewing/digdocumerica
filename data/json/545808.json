The horse's location is on a dry, stony ground with sparse vegetation including some small bushes. Beyond the immediate foreground, the landscape transitions into a massive hill or rock formation that fills the central and background portion of the image. This formation features a smooth, barren surface, suggesting an environment with harsh, dry conditions. The sky above is a clear, vivid blue, indicating a sunny day without any visible clouds.
