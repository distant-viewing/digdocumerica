{"path":"557996.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image captures a serene natural scene focused on a river environment. In the foreground, we see a variety of vibrant wildflowers and green plants, suggestive of late summer or early autumn. The river itself is calm, with water flowing gently. In the river, heaps of driftwood and logs are scattered around, which might indicate recent storms or natural water flow disruptions.\n\nTo the left, there is a bridge constructed of concrete and metal, seemingly aged and partially covered with vegetation, suggesting it might not be in frequent use. The bridge creates a link between dense tree-covered banks on either side of the river. The trees appear lush, displaying different shades of green which hint at a healthy, untouched natural area.\n\nThe background shows more of the river extending away from the viewer, surrounded by similar dense foliage, and no visible human activity, enhancing the feel of tranquility and isolation in this natural setting. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful, with a gentle interplay of light and shadow casting across the scene, emphasizing the natural beauty of this secluded spot.","title":"Remains of the aqueduct that carried the Ohio-erie canal over the cuyahoga river seen in the foreground, north of main street in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.  The canal connected the great lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi river systems between 1833 and 1913 when a disastrous flood and trains put the waterway out of business.  It is now a part of the cuyahoga valley national recreation area located between Akron and Cleveland which was signed into law in december, 1974","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["553355","550656","555075","542844","557250","547526","551536","545861","542653","550845","558015","550844","557024","550839","542523","542555"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","bridge","flow","driftwood","disruption","storm","heap","wildflower","link","concrete"]}
