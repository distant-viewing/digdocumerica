{"path":"544107.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene at an open-pit mining operation. The focus is on a large, red mining truck loaded with dark grey rocks, moving along a broad, dirt road that curves through the mining site. The truck, prominently seen in the foreground on the right, contrasts sharply in scale and color against the expansive pit.\n\nThe background features a vast, rugged terrain sculpted by excavation activities. Various shades of brown, grey, and red dominate the landscape, which is marked by tiers and slopes created by systematic digging. In the middle distance, a large mechanical digger, also loaded with rocks, stands on another level of the pit. This machinery, with its extended arm and large bucket, is positioned on one of the spiral paths that snake around the pit's interior.\n\nThe overall topography of the scene is barren and devoid of vegetation, underlining the industrial nature of the environment. The earth is visibly layered, indicating different mineral compositions and the intensive extraction process. This mining site, under bright lighting conditions that cast deep shadows, vividly illustrates the scale and operation of modern resource extraction. The entire composition is framed to emphasize both the massive scale of human machinery and the altered landscape of the pit.","title":"Phelps Dodge Corp.'s Lavender Pit mine","placename":"Bisbee (Ariz.)","location":"Bisbee, Arizona","nn1":["549245","544112","553049","549172","545831","544110","549171","549241","544100","544099","554765","552177","554828","549240","549242","554631"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["pit","mining","extraction","scale","digging","truck","tier","machinery","site","operation"]}
