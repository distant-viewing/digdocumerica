{"path":"549771.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts a vividly yellow street sweeper parked on an urban roadway. The vehicle is quite bulky and utilitarian, featuring a cabin with visible square windows and an additional side window on the door for better visibility. The sweeper is equipped with thick black brushes mounted at the front on its right side, designed for cleaning streets. Its tires are large and rugged, indicating its functionality for heavy-duty work.\n\nIn the background, there is a concrete wall and a nondescript, somewhat dilapidated building with faded signage reading \"DRAPES\". The environment suggests an industrial or less-maintained urban area with no visible vegetation or other vehicles. The sky is clear, offering a crisp contrast to the strong yellow of the street sweeper. The overall composition focuses heavily on the machine, emphasizing its role in urban maintenance, set against a backdrop that underscores the need for such services.","title":"Garbage truck at the 91st Street Marine Transfer Station (MTS).
