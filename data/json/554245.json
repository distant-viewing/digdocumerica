There is a group of skiers gathered around a ski lift, preparing to embark on their run. The skiers are dressed in typical winter sports attire which includes colorful ski jackets, pants, and hats. The variety in their colorful outfits creates a vibrant and dynamic scene.\n\nIn the background, you can see tall pine trees covered with snow, indicative of a snowy, mountainous region ideal for skiing. The ski lift itself is prominently featured to the right side of the frame; it's a chair lift painted red, with people seated and ready to be carried up the slope. The liftâ€™s structure and cables contrast against the white and green snowy landscape.\n\nThe foreground shows skiers of various ages, standing with their skis and poles, facing towards the ski lift, seemingly in the process of queuing or arranging themselves before starting their ski session. The atmosphere appears lively and enjoys typical winter outdoor activities, with several people interacting and moving towards the lift line.\n\nOverall, the image captures a common, joyful moment in winter sporting life, emphasizing recreational skiing and the social interaction that occurs in such settings.","title":"Boarding the Cloud 9 chairlift at the Aspen Highland ski area, the highest ski slope at Aspen--11,800 feet","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554234","554239","554235","554242","554247","554244","554238","550004","554254","554267","554292","550017","554276","554257","554236","549993"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["ski","lift","skier","skiing","winter","sporting","session","run","resort","pine"]}
