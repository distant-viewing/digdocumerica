{"path":"542702.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural setting showcasing a cluster of three mailboxes along a dirt road, adjacent to a vast agricultural field. On the left, one of the mailboxes is prominently labeled with \"LOMPOC RECORD,\" indicating it is likely used for newspaper delivery. The center mailbox, slightly raised and positioned above the others, features a small roofed structure labeled with a name \"EARL.CALVERT.\" The rightmost mailbox is standard in design and simply marked \"U.S. MAIL.\"\n\nBehind the mailboxes, the field stretches across the mid-ground, filled with dense, vibrant, blue-colored crops that create a striking contrast against the earthy tones of the path and the green crops further away. The background is dominated by a soft blue sky and a chain of gentle, rolling hills that frame the horizon.\n\nThe image not only emphasizes the rural charm but also illustrates a typical agricultural landscape, possibly indicating the region's farming practices and the kind of crops that are cultivated. The clear skies and bright sunlight suggest a sunny, calm day, ideal for capturing the vivid colors and serene scenery.","title":"Earl Calvert's mailbox","placename":"Lompoc (Calif.)","location":"Lompoc, California","nn1":["549006","556984","557760","547290","549257","552476","557759","552468","554132","557566","555635","549005","544481","547316","549222","545040"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["mailbox","crop","record","delivery","newspaper","field","ideal","practice","kind","chain"]}
