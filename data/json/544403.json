{"path":"544403.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph features a young girl and a young boy seated on the ground in a desert-like environment, surrounded by various items laid out neatly on what appears to be a white sheet. The array of items primarily consists of colorful, elaborate bead necklaces and other jewelry, suggesting a display for sale or showcasing. The children are dressed casually; the girl is in a long-sleeve purple shirt and black pants, while the boy wears a simple dark shirt and pants.\n\nThe environment is barren with a predominantly sandy and rocky surface, devoid of vegetation. The sky is mostly clear with a few clouds, indicating a sunny day. Small rocks are used to hold down the corners of the sheet and to separate rows of necklaces.\n\nThis setting gives the impression of an outdoor market or a vendor setup where local handcrafted goods are displayed for tourists or passersby. The vast, open background suggests this might be in a remote or rural area, adding a cultural and possibly traditional element to the scene.","title":"Beads for sale","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["544407","542657","544398","544408","555990","545757","543496","552591","544424","543612","544257","544404","543855","556166","546043","545602"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["necklace","sheet","girl","boy","jewelry","passersby","item","vendor","pant","tourist"]}
