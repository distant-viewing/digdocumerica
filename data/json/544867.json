{"path":"544867.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a fast-moving stream or small waterfall cascading over rocks. The water flows rapidly, appearing particularly white and frothy where it hits and rushes over the dark, jagged stones, creating a striking contrast. The image focuses on a few large boulders at the forefront, with water flowing around and over them, highlighted by the sun reflecting off the wet surfaces.\n\nThe photograph has a blueish tint, suggesting it might have been taken during a particular time of day or under specific lighting conditions, possibly in a shaded area or during the early morning or late afternoon. The motion of the water is captured in a way that conveys its speed and the force with which it moves through the natural rocky environment, evoking a sense of nature's power and the tranquility of a secluded spot. The overall composition draws attention to the textures and the interplay of light and shadow on the water and rocks, enhancing the visual impact of the natural scene.","title":"East Dallas creek","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["544862","552061","544856","543869","550843","554407","545882","553416","545839","543172","542743","544854","545874","550697","542699","549550"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["flow","cascading","rush","hit","shaded","move","rock","tint","boulder","waterfall"]}
