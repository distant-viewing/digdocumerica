{"path":"548009.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large, expansive river with multiple bridges and a dam. The river splits into several branches, surrounded by various islands and peninsulas. On one side of the river, there are several large structures including the dam which has numerous gates and sections, appearing as a long, straight construction running across the river.\n\nTowards the left of the image, one can see a bridge close to the dam, connecting two land masses. Another prominent bridge is visible further into the scene, characterized by what appears to be a suspension system, with towers and cables.\n\nThe background features a mountainous landscape with scattered buildings and infrastructure, including roads and smaller structures. Dominating the background is a large snow-capped mountain, suggesting the setting might be in a region with significant elevation and possibly volcanic activity.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is rich in geographical features and human engineering, showcasing a blend of natural landscapes and constructed facilities that manage water flow and connectivity between different areas. The photo captures a vivid sense of both human intervention in a natural setting and the grandeur of the natural environment itself.","title":"The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River.
