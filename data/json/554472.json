{"path":"554472.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The image captures a serene scene situated on a river surrounded by lush forest. A lone person is in a canoe, which is positioned towards the left side of the frame. The canoe is slender and green-colored, floating gently on the calm dark waters of the river. The individual in the canoe appears to be engaged in fishing; they are dressed in a light-colored fishing vest, a bucket hat, and are handling what looks like a fishing rod.\n\nThe river itself bends softly around a richly vegetated area, with sunlight dappling through the trees and reflecting off the water, creating patterns of light and shadow. The water is clear enough to show reflections of the surrounding trees and hints of the riverbed. This setting exudes a feeling of tranquility and isolation, removed from the hustle and bustle of urban life.\n\nThe overhead perspective of the photograph offers a view that emphasizes the greenery surrounding the river and the activity of the individual in the canoe against the natural backdrop, illustrating a moment of peaceful solitude amidst nature.","title":"Canoe on north branch of moose river below rondaxe lake in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554471","551537","553806","554609","555078","550000","550217","550768","554466","554474","553409","543628","545968","551350","550767","555576"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","fishing","river","dapple","remove","riverbed","hustle","vest","rod","surround"]}
