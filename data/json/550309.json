{"path":"550309.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of three people in a canoe moving swiftly over the surface of a shimmering body of water. The canoe, which is green, is tilted slightly upwards towards the front, suggesting quick movement and possibly the operation of a small motor at the back. The first individual, seated at the rear, appears to be controlling the direction and speed of the canoe. The second person, in the middle, and the third, at the front, are facing forward, likely enjoying the ride.\n\nThe water surface is textured with circular ripples and light reflections, emphasizing the movement of the canoe through the water. The background is densely wooded, featuring a variety of trees with green foliage, suggestive of a forested area possibly in the late spring or early summer. The natural setting implies a tranquil, yet adventurous outdoor activity in a remote location. The focus and composition of the photograph draw attention to the dynamics between the canoeists and their vibrant interaction with the natural surroundings.","title":"Fisherman and guide on st.
