{"path":"555619.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures an agricultural scene set in a vast, open field under a clear blue sky. The foreground shows a man standing on the bed of a dark blue Ford F-250 truck. The truck looks to be from the late 1970s or early 1980s, and it is parked on tilled soil. The man, dressed in work attire consisting of a light jacket, jeans, and a cap, appears to be handling burlap sacks that may contain agricultural products or supplies. \n\nIn the midground, a large yellow harvesting machine is actively working in the field, kicking up dust as it moves. This machine is attached to a long orange trailer, which seems to be collecting whatever is being harvested. The presence of the machine suggests the field is undergoing active agricultural processing.\n\nThe background of the photograph features a hilly landscape dotted with some sporadic greenery and small buildings or houses on the horizon, indicating the proximity of a rural community. The overall composition focuses on agricultural activities, highlighting the machinery and the labor involved in farming. The combination of natural landscape and agricultural equipment paints a picture of rural life and farm operation.","title":"Truck loaded with seed awaits the bulldozer-pulled spreader.
