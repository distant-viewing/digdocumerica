{"path":"545418.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic and moody industrial scene at sunset. The primary subject is the sun, large and centrally located in the frame, casting an intense orange glow across the scene. It appears just above the horizon, which is marked by a silhouette of industrial structures.\n\nThe industrial silhouette includes tall smokestacks and complex machinery, possibly part of a factory or a power plant, characterized by heavy piping and various mechanical components. These structures are detailed and intricate, creating a striking contrast against the brightly lit sky. The lower part of the image shows a lighter area, potentially indicating some vegetation or underbrush at the edge of the industrial site, adding to the layering of the composition.\n\nThe sky transitions from a deep red near the upper edges of the smokestacks to a lighter, vibrant orange around the sun, suggesting either the natural hues of sunset or perhaps influenced by industrial pollution. The atmosphere created by the color palette conveys a sense of intensity and perhaps a commentary on energy consumption or environmental impact.\n\nOverall, the composition utilizes the natural light of the sunset combined with the dark silhouettes of the industrial landscape to present a powerful and thought-provoking image.","title":"Dramatic red-orange glow of Birmingham night comes from emissions of steel plants, which operate around the clock.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["548851","548886","545438","546384","544708","545421","545430","545425","552156","553847","545414","544684","551956","547090","550300","558140"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["sunset","silhouette","smokestack","orange","consumption","layering","provoke","sun","commentary","piping"]}
