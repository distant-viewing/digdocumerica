{"path":"547793.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph depicts a dramatic and moody landscape, characterized by a heavy, cloud-filled sky and a somewhat dimly lit foreground. The clouds are thick and expansive, showing shades ranging from dark gray to lighter gray highlights, suggesting either an impending storm or the tail end of one. The sky takes up a majority of the frame, adding a sense of heaviness and drama to the scene.\n\nIn the middle distance, there is a calmer scene of a lake or large pond, which reflects the dense clouds above, adding a symmetrical element to the composition. The lake is framed by trees on either side, appearing as dark silhouettes that contribute to the overall somber and quiet ambiance of the setting.\n\nThe foreground is less illuminated, featuring wildflowers—possibly daisies or similar—showing pale yellow and white hues. These flowers add a touch of brightness and life to the otherwise dark setting. The natural setting hints at being a wild or rural area, untouched by overt human presence.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a feeling of solitude and contemplation, brought forth by the dark tones and the tranquil, though slightly ominous, natural environment. There is a play between light and shadow, and a juxtaposition of the slightly brighter flowers against the dominant gloom of the sky.","title":"River view.
