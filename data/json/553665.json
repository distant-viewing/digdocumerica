{"path":"553665.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural scene under a bright blue sky with scattered clouds. In the foreground, there is a yellow tractor pulling a black traditional farm implement, possibly a plow or a harrow. A man is driving the tractor, dressed in white and wearing a hat, facing forward as he operates the machine.\n\nBehind him, there are two other individuals on the farm implement, also dressed in white shirts. They appear to be engaged in manual labor related to either adjusting or operating the equipment. The ground is barren and appears tilled, suggesting that this is either a planting or plowing activity.\n\nIn the background, the scene opens up to a vast landscape with low hills that gradually rise in the distance. Sparse vegetation can be seen scattered across the terrain, typical of a semi-arid or arid region. The sky above is vivid, suggesting the photograph was taken on a clear, sunny day which casts strong shadows onto the ground from the tractor and the people. The overall composition highlights a moment of agricultural activity, emphasizing the machinery and teamwork involved in farm work.","title":"In the Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Buddy Vidovich, Paiute farmer and former tribal chairman, seeds a field with alfalfa and oats.
