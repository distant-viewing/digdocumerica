{"path":"555828.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene on a deck of a ship at sea. In the foreground, three men are busy with various tasks. One is standing near a railing, looking out to sea, and holding what appears to be binoculars or a camera. Another man is engaged with some type of machinery or equipment on the deck, and a third is sitting, possibly operating controls or taking a break. The deck is cluttered with tools, equipment, and safety helmets, indicating ongoing work or maintenance.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a long boom extends from the ship, equipped with pulleys and lines, suggesting that it is used for lifting or handling cargo or equipment. At the end of this boom, a piece of equipment, which looks to be part of a submersible or underwater apparatus, is suspended above the water, indicating the involvement of underwater activities, likely for research or repair.\n\nThe sea is visible in the background, calm and vast. The weather seems clear, with bright sunlight illuminating the entire scene, creating sharp shadows and vivid colors on the ship and the equipment. The composition and elements present suggest that this ship is likely engaged in specialized work, possibly related to marine research, exploration, or similar operations.","title":"National oceanographic and atmospheric administration ship \"ferrel\" with crew checking current meters in the New York bight water circulation in the bight is not yet fully understood and current research aims to determine the exact flow which will give a better picture of how well the sludge and other wastes are being dispersed by the bight's natural circulation","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["555827","555832","555829","549603","549597","555831","555797","549590","551046","552861","549356","549588","549351","549616","552862","549602"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["ship","equipment","deck","boom","sea","research","binocular","specialized","lifting","underwater"]}
