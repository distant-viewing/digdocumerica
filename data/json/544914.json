{"path":"544914.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of four mule deer in a sprawling grassland at dusk. The setting sun casts a warm, golden hue across the landscape, highlighting the tall, dense grasses that cover the ground. The deer are spaced out slightly, with three of them clustered to the left side of the frame, while the fourth stands alone slightly apart to the right. Each deer is alert and oriented in different directions, suggesting they are cautious of their surroundings.\n\nIn the background, the grassland stretches out to meet a flat horizon. The absence of trees or other tall vegetation emphasizes the openness of the terrain. The lighting conditions and the shadowy outlines of the deer give the image a tranquil, yet vibrant atmosphere, capturing a moment of natural beauty and calm in the wilderness. The overall composition and the play of light create a peaceful yet dynamic view of wildlife in their natural habitat.","title":"Great sand dunes national monument","placename":"Colorado","location":"Colorado","nn1":["546232","542959","542963","544114","553808","543326","545902","542961","542955","549219","546088","546198","544571","545898","544916","543369"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","grassland","openness","orient","absence","calm","habitat","wildlife","meet","direction"]}
