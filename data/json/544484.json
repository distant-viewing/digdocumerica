{"path":"544484.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape, featuring a tall, slender heron perched elegantly atop a weathered wooden fence post, lined with barbed wire. The bird, displaying an elongated neck and sharp beak, exhibits a mix of rust-colored and white plumage accented by distinct darker markings at strategic points—the shoulders, wing tips, and tail region.\n\nBehind the heron, a verdant field stretches across the frame, populated with several specks that, upon closer examination, appear to be cattle grazing peacefully. The distance between the foreground heron and the blurred cattle suggests a spacious pasture. The field is framed above by a clear blue sky and below by an untrimmed line of dense, green bushes, reinforcing the image’s immersion in a lush, natural setting.\n\nThis tranquil, almost pastoral scene is likely aimed to convey the harmony and quiet beauty of rural or natural environments, emphasizing biodiversity and the calm coexistence of wildlife with agricultural life.","title":"'Heron'","placename":"Clewiston (Fla.)","location":"Clewiston, Florida","nn1":["548731","547630","544480","545142","544489","550471","551378","544482","545967","544838","544543","543063","545991","544488","548729","550388"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["heron","cattle","immersion","beak","pasture","plumage","biodiversity","examination","harmony","tip"]}
