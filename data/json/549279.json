{"path":"549279.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, natural scene embellished by residential architecture. In the foreground, lush greenery, predominantly leafy shrubs and a tree with a sparse canopy, sets a vibrant stage. The midground hosts a traditional, two-story house painted in dark brown. This house features a steep gabled roof and a balcony extending along its side, enhancing its quaint, rustic charm.\n\nBehind the house, another dark structure is slightly visible, possibly another residential building sharing similar architectural themes. Notably, atop the house, a flag pole proudly displays a flag, fluttering gently in the breeze, adding a touch of patriotism to the setting.\n\nIn the background, the clear sky, tinged with a hint of blue, suggests a fine, sunny day and completes this tranquil, suburban tableau. The overall composition of the image, with its combination of nature and neatly appointed homes, conveys a peaceful, settled residential area. The clarity and brightness of the day are well captured, making it a snapshot of calm everyday life.","title":"Logan Airport area.
