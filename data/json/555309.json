{"path":"555309.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene primarily focused on a large solar panel positioned in the foreground. The solar panel, which appears quite sizable relative to the composition, is tilted at an angle to effectively capture sunlight, which is visibly reflecting off its glossy surface.\n\nIn the background, a portion of a small, light-colored structure, possibly a building or a container, is visible. This structure features a grey metallic surface with some visible signs of weathering or wear, and has a rectangular window framed in white. It seems to be positioned directly behind the solar panel, implying a possible connection, perhaps housing tools or equipment related to the solar panel's function.\n\nThe background shows a landscape that seems arid, with rocky and bare soil surrounding the installation. There are scant traces of vegetation, just small, sparse green plants close to the ground near the base of the building. The overall environment suggests a remote or rural setting, likely chosen for optimal sunlight exposure crucial for solar efficiency. \n\nThe setting and objects combine to give a functional, utilitarian feel, focusing on renewable energy usage in possibly isolated or under-resourced areas.","title":"One of two solar panels utilizing a circulating fluid of water to provide the family with 120-degree water for domestic use in a home near Corrales, New Mexico.","placename":"Albuquerque (N.M.)","location":"Albuquerque, New Mexico","nn1":["555288","557320","555327","555333","555294","557312","555347","555349","555331","555348","555343","555323","557328","555292","555293","555320"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["panel","efficiency","trace","usage","installation","weathering","housing","sunlight","function","connection"]}
