{"path":"548183.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a beach scene where the primary focus is an old, rusted metal barrel partially buried in the sand near the shoreline. The barrel appears deteriorated, with corrosion and several holes, hinting at prolonged exposure to the elements. The beach sand has a dark hue, likely wet from the nearby water, with patterns formed by water flow and erosion clearly visible. Small rivulets of water can be seen flowing back into the lake, which is calm with minor ripples. The scene is unoccupied by people, emphasizing a sense of quiet and abandonment. The water and the subtle gradients in the sand's color add to the serene yet somber tone of the image.","title":"Detail of Columbia River shoreline showing drainage pipe","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546393","548812","547041","543257","548810","548051","548808","544989","546961","548184","545132","542887","543078","547607","548809","543244"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["sand","barrel","beach","corrosion","hole","water","gradient","erosion","exposure","ripple"]}
