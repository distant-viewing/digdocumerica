{"path":"543037.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures the back view of an elderly man walking down a city street, using a cane to aid his movement. He is dressed in a classic, possibly vintage style: a dark-colored suit and overcoat paired with a light-colored fedora hat. The man's posture is slightly bent forward, indicative of careful, measured steps.\n\nThe setting is a typical urban street, lined with buildings of various designs. The road appears to be nearly empty, enhancing the focus on the solitary figure. Additionally, the shadows cast on the ground suggest that the photo was taken on a sunny day, likely in the mid to late afternoon given the length and angle of the shadows.\n\nDetailing in the background includes some greenery, which can be seen outgrowing the edge of the sidewalk, and sporadic street signage. The color palette has a somewhat muted tone, which combined with the scene conveys a quiet, somber mood. This image portrays a moment of everyday life, emphasizing themes of aging, solitude, and the urban environment.","title":"California--Bodega Bay","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["547816","547820","553176","546419","551940","548426","553486","556733","547330","554845","545368","547310","558330","550118","554260","549297"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","cane","overcoat","fedora","aid","measure","aging","step","length","sidewalk"]}
