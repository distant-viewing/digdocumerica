{"path":"547165.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph shows an elderly male police officer standing at the entrance of a log cabin structure. He is dressed in a dark, neatly pressed police uniform with a prominent star-shaped badge on his left chest, suggesting his role as a sheriff or a similar law enforcement officer. The officer wears glasses and has a serious expression as he looks directly at the camera.\n\nHe is holding a clipboard in his left hand and a pen in his right, indicating he might be in the process of writing a report or taking notes. The background features the rustic texture of the log cabin, with wooden logs stacked horizontally to form the walls. There's a simple, unadorned door just behind him, enhancing the no-nonsense setting typical of a practical workspace or official premises.\n\nThe officerâ€™s pose and attire reflect an aura of authority and professionalism, set against the rugged backdrop which might suggest a rural or semi-rural setting. His attire is clean and formal in contrast to the rustic and natural texture of the log cabin, creating a contrast between the man-made order and the natural surroundings. The lighting is bright, likely indicating daytime, and casts shadows that add depth to the composition.","title":"A guard is posted on the only access road to the lakeside community of dune acres","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547402","547412","542757","553516","546657","556006","556285","546068","547759","542756","557844","551896","548888","546633","546663","546637"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["officer","log","cabin","police","press","professionalism","enforcement","authority","law","clipboard"]}
