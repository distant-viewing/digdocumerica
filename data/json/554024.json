{"path":"554024.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image appears to be an aerial view of a rugged coastline. The scene includes a vast, open landscape with textured terrain that varies from barren, dark fields to some vegetation-covered areas. In the foreground, there is a peninsula jutting into a body of water, likely an ocean, surrounded by choppy waves and white foam indicating the water's edge.\n\nThe central part of the image shows a slightly raised plateau that extends into the distance, gradually fading into a more uniform, distant landscape under a vast, cloudless sky. The water is a deep shade of blue, contrasting with the mostly dark earth tones of the land.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a perspective that captures a sense of isolation and untouched natural beauty, typical of remote coastal areas. No human activity or people are visible in the image, emphasizing the wild and undeveloped character of this landscape.","title":"Aerial view of the western shores of Molokai Island.
