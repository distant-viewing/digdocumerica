{"path":"543106.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures an interesting juxtaposition between a suburban housing development and the natural landscape that surrounds it. In the foreground, there is a dense cluster of houses with similar brown and beige rooftops, organized in tight rows, suggesting a suburban neighborhood. Each house appears to have a small yard, and the entire area has a uniform, planned structure.\n\nDominating the middle part of the image is a large white building with the word \"RENTING\" painted in black letters. This building, likely a commercial or apartment complex based on its size and standalone nature, contrasts with the residential houses in terms of its design and prominence.\n\nThe street in front of the \"RENTING\" building is visible, lined with street lights and featuring some cars that indicate a moderate level of traffic. Signs on the roadside, probably for the apartment complex or additional services, are partially visible, enhancing the urban feel of the scene.\n\nIn the background, in stark contrast to the developed area, rolling hills dotted with occasional trees create a serene and less developed landscape. These hills are grassy with patches of trees and no visible buildings, presenting a rural environment that sharply contrasts with the suburban development in the foreground.\n\nThe entire scene is cast under a soft, natural light suggesting either early morning or late afternoon, which softly illuminates the scene and enhances the natural green and browns of the environment. The sky is blue with some light overcast, contributing to the gentle lighting. The composition effectively showcases the encroachment of urban development into natural landscapes, highlighting the blend and tension between built environments and natural spaces.","title":"California--Marin County","placename":"Marin County (Calif.)","location":"Marin County, California","nn1":["553938","553936","557440","545205","553129","557437","557547","557438","553704","553692","544600","557427","557530","557552","545201","558059"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Residential Neighborhoods"],"terms":["apartment","development","house","complex","encroachment","tension","prominence","rooftop","building","street"]}
