{"path":"551335.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts two elderly men seated next to each other on metal-framed chairs against a dark brick wall. Both men look directly into the camera, exhibiting calm facial expressions.\n\nOn the left, the first man is wearing a light green short-sleeved shirt with vertical stripes and dark pants. He has a name tag pinned on his shirt that reads \"Sam.\" He uses a cane, which he holds in his right hand. His left hand rests on his thigh, and he has a serious expression.\n\nThe man on the right is dressed in a light-colored short-sleeved shirt and dark trousers. His shirt also has a name tag, reading \"Thomas.\" He sits with his arms resting on his thighs and displays a subtle smile, making his overall expression slightly more relaxed compared to his companion.\n\nBoth individuals appear to be wearing similar black shoes, and the setting suggests a casual or semi-formal gathering, possibly a reunion or a community event. The simplicity of the background focuses attention on the two men and their poised demeanor.","title":"Bagnell Dam, which created the Lake of the Ozarks, also brought about the demise of the town of Linn Creek, which lay in the path of the rising waters. James Dillon (left), and Walter Pope (right), are pictured at the second reunion of former townspeople and their relatives. Mr. Dillon at one time ran a tugboat on the lake. Mr. Pope now has a peanut and popcorn concession at Bagnell Dam.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["557152","554097","547411","553519","556271","554444","553484","547330","551338","553202","557907","556153","557079","545044","547359","546077"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["thigh","tag","name","expression","man","shirt","cane","companion","hand","smile"]}
