{"path":"558060.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing a small township surrounded by a natural landscape. The central feature of this image is a river that snakes through the area, partitioned in part by a small bridge that connects two sections of the community. Alongside the river, there are patches of dense trees displaying early autumn colorsâ€”hints of oranges and browns amidst the predominant green.\n\nOn either side of the river, there are residential areas with houses interspersed with wooded areas, lawns, and some driveways. The houses vary in design, and the rooftops are mostly in shades of grey and brown. Several roads cut through the landscape, providing structure to the residential areas and offering access to the homes and possibly other local amenities.\n\nOn the right edge of the photograph, adjacent to the river, there appears to be a more industrial or commercial area, indicated by larger buildings, possibly warehouses or shops, and a clearer presence of paved parking spaces.\n\nThe photograph provides a serene depiction of a small, possibly suburban community, harmoniously blended into a natural environment, with human habitation closely nestled among mature trees and waterways. The general atmosphere is peaceful and scenic, typical of small-town settlements in many regions with temperate climates.","title":"Aerial view of Peninsula, Ohio, north of Akron with the cuyahoga river at the right.
