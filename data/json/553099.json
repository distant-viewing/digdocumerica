{"path":"553099.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph depicts a casual outdoor setting on what appears to be a sunny day. Two girls are enjoying a moment together, sitting on the trunk of a vintage white sedan. On the left, one girl is seated on the trunk's edge; she is wearing a light-colored t-shirt and white sneakers. On the right, another girl is also sitting on the trunk, wearing a black sleeveless top, red pants, and white shoes with red socks; she is smiling broadly.\n\nIn the foreground, two dogs are relaxing on the ground; one is a black and tan dog, and the other is predominantly black. Both appear calm and restful.\n\nThe background features a rural landscape, with another truck visible in the mid-ground under some trees. The area is dusty and shaded by trees, suggesting a back yard or a farm-like setting. The license plate on the car and other background elements suggest a homey, rural environment in the United States.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of leisure and companionship, framed by elements of rural life and personal relaxation.","title":"Two children of Merwin Wright, elected tribal chairman of the Paiute Indian tribe, Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["548306","552615","546093","554497","549928","548303","544389","543856","557367","557766","551123","543947","557004","553526","545320","543040"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["girl","trunk","sleeveless","sneaker","sock","companionship","license","plate","dog","t"]}
