{"path":"543437.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a coastal scene with a rocky cliffside and a series of buildings scattered across the landscape. The area near the shoreline features jagged cliffs predominantly on the left side, and the ocean waves can be seen crashing against these rocks. To the right, the terrain rises and forms more gentle slopes lined with a road along the ridge.\n\nThe buildings, appearing as a small community or a resort, are varied in design and layout, suggesting different functions. Prominently, there is a large, long building with a dark roof and large windows, which look like they might be a communal hall or a series of connected lodges. This building has adjacent green lawns and a sizable rectangular swimming pool in front. Along with that, several other smaller buildings, possibly houses or cabins, are located further up the slope and along the roadside.\n\nThe rest of the imagery includes faintly viewable roads that weave through the terrain, providing access to these isolated structures. The vegetation around the area is sporadic, with patches of grass on otherwise bare land, which adds a rugged natural feel to the scene. The overall view offers a tranquil yet remote atmosphere, typical of a coastal retreat or a residential area adapted to its challenging yet scenic environment.","title":"California -- Monterey","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["545110","543426","543438","554144","543340","553983","543427","557453","547633","557429","557451","547644","553931","556953","545934","543422"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["slope","lodge","series","building","imagery","hall","retreat","resort","swimming","roadside"]}
