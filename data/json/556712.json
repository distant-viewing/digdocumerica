{"path":"556712.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph appears to capture a city street scene, likely from the 1970s based on the cars and the overall visual quality. The main focus of the image is a white Volkswagen Beetle parked on a roadside. The car has a \"Bicentennial\" license plate, suggesting the photo might be taken around 1976, the year of America’s bicentennial celebration. The Beetle's rear and round brake lights are prominently visible. \n\nAdjacent to the Beetle, further along the road, there is a line of various other cars parked, with one tan-colored sedan standing out just beside the Beetle. The street is bordered with a curb and a sidewalk, and there’s a streetlight and traffic sign pole very close on the right side. The signs indicate various parking restrictions during specific times, suggesting a busy urban area with controlled parking measures.\n\nIn the background, the surroundings include multiple office buildings or possibly apartment buildings with modern façades typical of mid-20th-century architecture. There are several pedestrians walking on the sidewalk, including one person who appears to be wearing a hat.\n\nThere are also indications of other vehicles and activity in the farther distance, providing a bustling street scene. The overall atmosphere suggests a typical weekday in an urban setting.","title":"Police were forced to virtually ignore the majority of illegally parked cars during a bus strike in Washington, district of Columbia, in may, 1974.
