{"path":"546639.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a rainy street scene, possibly taken during the 1970s based on the style of vehicles and fashion. In the foreground, multiple cars are in motion. These include a brown car with a white roof in the front and a blue car on the opposite side, with a partially visible yellow car behind them.\n\nCentral to the picture is a person crossing the street, donned in a vibrant orange raincoat with a matching rain hat, facing left. This individual seems to be calmly navigating through the busy, wet street.\n\nThe background features an urban street lined with buildings. One prominent building has a large \"TWA\" sign, indicating a TWA airline travel agency office, which suggests this might be in a downtown area frequently visited by travelers and business personnel. Additionally, there's another person visible in the background under a pink umbrella, also crossing the street.\n\nA city bus is also captured to the right side of the photograph, hinting at a bustling city environment.\n\nThis scene conveys an everyday urban life moment, accentuated by rainy weather and busy city dynamics. The orange raincoat stands out brightly against the more muted city tones, drawing attention to the pedestrian's calm demeanor amidst the busy surroundings.","title":"Traffic cop hemmed in by homebound traffic at intersection of 16th and k street nw","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546643","546660","556734","556710","548368","556199","556725","551863","551933","546656","556726","549863","550128","546626","548369","553184"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["raincoat","street","city","car","cross","personnel","traveler","visit","don","umbrella"]}
