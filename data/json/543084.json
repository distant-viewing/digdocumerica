{"path":"543084.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a coastal area with a distinct separation between urban development and the natural landscape of a beach and ocean. The upper section of the image shows the ocean, with visible white wave crests breaking near the shore. The coastline is largely undeveloped, featuring a beach that transitions into sand dunes and sparse vegetation.\n\nDirectly adjacent to the natural coastline, there's a highly structured arrangement of housing. The housing consists of rows of identical or very similar buildings, likely residential units, organized in a grid pattern. The buildings closest to the beach are uniformly constructed and appear reddish-orange, possibly denoting a specific type of roofing material or building style.\n\nCloser to the foreground, the urban development becomes more varied. There are still rows of houses, but with varied architectural styles and possibly newer constructions. Several larger buildings, parking lots, and what appears to be a water tower or similar structure are also visible.\n\nThe contrast between the grid-like, human-made environment and the natural, undulating forms of the coastline presents a clear delineation between urban development and natural landscape. The image also reflects a common coastal urban scenario where residential areas are developed very close to the shoreline.","title":"Houses built right up to the shore","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557452","555757","557451","557453","555756","557504","543438","548636","547629","543427","543015","548643","553671","547508","548779","547636"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["coastline","beach","housing","development","grid","delineation","ocean","separation","row","crest"]}
