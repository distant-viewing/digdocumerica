{"path":"544831.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a scrapyard. The central focus is a pile of various scrap materials, primarily metal chunks and parts, likely from different types of vehicles or machinery. These objects are in a haphazard arrangement, piled on and against each other, creating a textured, almost jagged landscape of metallic waste.\n\nThe foreground prominently features parts of what appears to be a dismantled vending machine or similar equipment. Notably, one of the visible panels is bright red with white lettering saying “Here's the real thing” alongside the logo of Coca-Cola, creating a stark contrast with the worn-out, discarded state of the objects around it. This combination visually emphasizes the theme of consumerism and disposability.\n\nThe background is simple and understated, consisting of a clear blue sky that provides a clean backdrop to the chaotic, colorful details of the scrapyard. This helps in accentuating the shapes and colors of the scrap materials. The sunlight illuminates the scene, casting shadows and highlighting the textures of corroded metals and battered structures.\n\nOverall, the composition gives the viewer a sense of abandonment and decay, potentially invoking reflection on issues like waste, consumer culture, and environmental impact. The elements of recognizable brands and products lend an almost ironic tone to the scene, emphasizing the gap between the marketed image of products as desirable and their ultimate fate.","title":"National metals junkyard","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["544830","542585","552740","554300","554318","554301","554346","548109","546267","545010","554357","547611","547625","548753","556640","557308"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["scrapyard","scrap","product","waste","metals","thing","consumer","pile","chunk","gap"]}
