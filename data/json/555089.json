{"path":"555089.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape heavily impacted by what could be natural destruction or deforestation. The scene is on a steep, hilly terrain, covered with numerous fallen and broken trees. Many of the trees are stripped of their branches and foliage, and lie scattered across the ground, pointing in various directions. The hill itself appears barren in several patches, showing soil and debris, suggesting recent and severe disruption.\n\nThe background is covered by darker, dense forest on the upper slopes, contrasting with the scattered, lighter colored debris-field in the forefront. This shift from dense forest to a more devastated zone highlights the extent of damage to the landscape. There is no visible wildlife or human activity in the photograph, emphasizing a sense of abandonment or aftermath. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of destruction and desolation, capturing a moment of significant environmental impact.","title":"Three-year-old Douglas firs in the foreground were aerial seeded in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555136","555162","545254","555142","555088","555230","545264","555208","555086","555104","555207","555221","555150","545138","557008","542819"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["destruction","deforestation","extent","shift","disruption","forest","debris","aftermath","desolation","damage"]}
