{"path":"546459.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures the striking upwards view of a church steeple silhouetted against a dramatic sky. The steeple, sharply pointed and sleek, extends directly upward into the frame, its tip nearly touching the top border of the image. It is part of a structure featuring a roof with wide, clean lines that converge towards the steeple, emphasizing its height and form.\n\nThe roofing material has a reflective quality, catching the light on its textured surface, which provides a hint of shine that contrasts with the dark tone of the steeple. The sky serves as a compelling backdrop, filled with clouds that vary in intensity—from light, wispy sections to denser, darker patches—creating a dynamic and somewhat moody atmosphere.\n\nLight filters through the clouds, providing a mix of shadows and bright spots. This interplay of light not only highlights the architectural elements of the steeple but also adds a dramatic and almost ethereal quality to the scene. The overall composition of the photograph, with its strong vertical lines and contrasting textures and tones, draws the viewer’s eye upward and emphasizes a sense of reaching towards the sky.","title":"Mabel McDowell Elementary School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546466","546451","545873","558399","546048","546455","550001","547346","554700","547439","554207","558034","557333","550295","558019","557310"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["steeple","tip","roofing","quality","cloud","intensity","border","church","line","spot"]}
