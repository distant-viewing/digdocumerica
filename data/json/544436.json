{"path":"544436.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The photograph displays a tranquil and scenic outdoor setting. There are multiple shelters or makeshift structures set up in a densely vegetated area. The shelters are constructed from various fabrics including tarps and sheets, some of which are adorned with patterns or colors -- particularly notable is a large American flag hanging prominently from one of the structures. This flag is displayed on the left side of the image, with its stripes and stars clearly visible.\n\nThe landscape is dotted with lush greenery, and the ground is blanketed with vibrant yellow wildflowers adding a bright and lively contrast to the scene. The flora suggests a spring or summer season. Sunlight filters through the leaves of the trees, creating patterns of light and shade across the scene, highlighting the verdant backdrop.\n\nThe setting appears to be a makeshift campsite, possibly for a group of nature enthusiasts, protesters, or participants in an outdoor festival. There are no visible people in the photograph, enhancing the sense of peaceful solitude. The overall composition evokes a sense of rustic living and closeness to nature, with a hint of patriotic expression.","title":"Campsite; part of loga vista lake development, on lake travis","placename":"Austin (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Texas","nn1":["554480","542732","544855","548796","548798","545500","545293","552589","553899","557947","552898","549450","554515","543889","548748","545780"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["shelter","flag","tarp","campsite","closeness","enthusiast","festival","sheet","star","participant"]}
