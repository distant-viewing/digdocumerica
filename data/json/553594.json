{"path":"553594.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a dense forest landscape viewed from an elevated vantage point. The image captures a seemingly endless expanse of dark evergreen trees in varied shades of deep greens and blues under overcast lighting, suggesting either dawn or dusk. The area is hilly, with a slight mist or haze that blurs the line between the forest canopy and the sky, enhancing the depth and vastness of the scene.\n\nTowards the middle of the image, a small open area offers a visual break from the dense forest, possibly a clearing or a meadow. A hint of an off-white or light gray structure or natural feature is visible, although it's not distinctly clear due to the distance and the shadows cast by the trees.\n\nOverall, the composition evokes a sense of solitude and wilderness, emphasizing the natural beauty and isolation of the forested landscape. The photograph's color palette, consisting of predominantly muted and cool tones, adds to the serene yet mysterious quality of the scene.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora. Aerial view shows the Woods River Forest Service fire lookout. Although in the center of the burn area, the lookout was unharmed.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["555133","555128","542849","543487","553567","542924","552844","553570","557019","550566","550537","555217","553574","555675","555119","550791"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["forest","meadow","break","clearing","vantage","dawn","mist","haze","wilderness","vastness"]}
