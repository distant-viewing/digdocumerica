{"path":"552465.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a rural scene, predominantly featuring a group of cows gathered around a muddy water source in an expansive field. The cattle, including various black and white as well as tan cows, appear to be cooling themselves or drinking from the puddle. The ground around the water is muddy and has visible cracks, suggesting dry or drought conditions.\n\nThe backdrop is a vast, flat landscape under a clear, blue sky, indicating a bright, sunny day. Sparse vegetation can be seen in the field, and the horizon is flat, with only a few small structures and possibly farming equipment in the distance.\n\nThis setting suggests a farm or a pastureland, likely dedicated to livestock. The presence of multiple cows and the vastness of open land highlight an agricultural environment focused on cattle rearing. The image captures a pastoral, serene, yet somewhat harsh setting due to the apparent lack of lush vegetation and the stark, muddy conditions underfoot.","title":"Dairy herd in Zearing","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["551157","544535","548984","542626","545153","542627","549027","555645","553100","554560","550833","557022","549214","546102","557012","553105"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["cow","cattle","drought","crack","livestock","puddle","field","condition","source","lack"]}
