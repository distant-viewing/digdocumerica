{"path":"556726.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene likely from the 1970s or 1980s, evidenced by the style of the cars and the overall atmosphere. In the foreground, a woman is captured mid-stride as she crosses the street. She is dressed in a long, dark trench coat and a hat, suggesting a cool weather setting. Her posture and the motion suggested by her swinging arms convey a sense of purpose and brisk movement. \n\nThe street is lined with a variety of vintage cars, including a red car in the immediate foreground and a station wagon stacked with wooden planks towards the center. The cars featured range in color and model, adding a colorful diversity to the scene.\n\nIn the background, there are lush green trees and a two-story building with white facade and large windows. A small sign on the building reads \"Crown Royal Hotel,\" which, along with light posts and other street signs, provides a semi-urban feel to the setting. \n\nOverall, the combination of the womanâ€™s vintage outfit, the assortment of old cars, and the architectural styles visible suggests a snapshot from a bustling town scene several decades ago, infused with a sense of everyday life and activity.","title":"Many policemen in Washington, District of Columbia, were diverted from their normal duties to directing traffic during a bus strike in May, 1974. Some 250,000 persons were forced to find alternate forms of transportation, usually the auto. Monumental traffic jams were the result as drivers learned there were more cars than places to park legally. The Metro bus system usually has 1,800 buses on the streets during the morning and evening rush hours.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556715","556711","546626","548369","556723","547191","556710","549882","551913","556742","556718","556225","556709","557805","550139","547788"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["car","street","trench","stride","wagon","assortment","diversity","woman","combination","decade"]}
