{"path":"547082.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a man peering over the edge of a large structure, likely a stationary storage tank, which is prominently labeled \"BUNGE FUEL SINCE 1867\". The image is set against a dark background, emphasizing a mood of isolation or concentration. The man, dressed in casual attire with a long-sleeve shirt and a cap, has his forearm resting on the edge and holds onto what appears to be a hose or cable. His expression or specific features are not visible, but his pose suggests he is engaged in a task or is looking down at something out of frame.\n\nThe background consists of indistinct, dark-toned industrial or architectural elements that complement the central subject of the tank and the man. The overall composition and moody lighting focus viewer attention squarely on the man and the stark white lettering of the \"BUNGE FUEL\" branding, offering a slice of industrial life with a strong visual and thematic contrast between the worker and his environment. The atmosphere is gritty and somewhat somber, reflective of an industrial setting.","title":"Coal delivery in Chicago's North Side","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557386","556391","558306","556447","544128","544105","553025","544171","555815","542989","543648","544835","544832","556320","542497","556156"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["tank","branding","man","fuel","hose","lettering","cable","edge","pose","slice"]}
