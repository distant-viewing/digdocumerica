{"path":"542959.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene nature scene featuring a group of deer-like animals in a grassy field. The image is captured from a low angle with the sun backlighting the subjects, creating silhouettes highlighted by the glow of the sunlight around their edges.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent animal, likely a deer, is featured in silhouette with its ears perked up, facing toward the viewer. This animal is outlined by the sunlight, emphasizing its graceful form. Just behind this animal is another, facing away, grazing on the grass. In the background, additional animals can be observed, their forms less distinctly silhouetted but still clearly part of the herd engaging in similar grazing behavior.\n\nThe background is gently out of focus, suggesting an expansive, open field with no distinct trees or obstacles interrupting the horizon. The sky itself is not visible, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on the play of light and shadow on the animals. The overall mood is peaceful, highlighting a moment of natural harmony.","title":"Grazing deer","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546232","544914","542963","542955","553808","545902","544114","542961","546198","546088","549219","543326","545898","544571","558368","543369"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["animal","deer","obstacle","herd","behavior","silhouette","form","harmony","ear","field"]}
