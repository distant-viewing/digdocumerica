{"path":"555121.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image features a dense grouping of tall, slender trees in a forest setting. The trees are tightly packed, with their trunks occupying nearly the entire frame of the photograph. The trunks are mostly straight and vertical, with a few exceptions that slightly lean to the sides, enhancing the natural and unarranged appearance of the woods.\n\nThe bark of the trees varies slightly in color, ranging from darker browns to lighter grays, indicating possibly different types of trees or variations in bark aging or moisture. Many of the trees have short, stubby branches, which are devoid of leaves and jut out perpendicularly. These branches help to convey the dense, slightly wild nature of the forest.\n\nThe background is dark due to the thick canopy of leaves above, which casts a shadow and creates a somewhat muted and mysterious ambiance. This darkness contrasts with spots of light that appear to filter through gaps in the canopy, highlighting patches of the tree trunks and giving the scene a textured and layered look.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene yet somewhat somber forest scene, filled with closely set trees that suggest a secluded, perhaps rarely disturbed woodland area.","title":"Stagnating Douglas firs and hemlocks in need of thinning in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
