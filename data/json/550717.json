{"path":"550717.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural scene featuring a river winding through a forested landscape. The river, running through the center of the image, has dark water reflecting the overcast sky above. The banks of the river are uneven and prominently display layers of soil and sediment, indicating erosion. On the left bank, there is a noticeable buildup of sandy and clayey deposits forming a steep edge.\n\nDebris, composed of several logs and assorted branches, is scattered along the edges of the river, hinting at previous water activity that might have dislodged these from further upstream. The right bank of the river features lush green foliage, possibly small shrubs and bushes, softening the boundary between the water and the forest.\n\nThe surrounding forest consists mainly of tall, dense trees that obscure much of the sky and provide a rich green backdrop to the scene. The overcast lighting conditions create a muted color palette, emphasizing the natural greens and browns of the landscape. The atmosphere is quiet and calm, suggestive of a secluded location removed from urban disturbances.","title":"Allen Brook with effluent from the mill of the International Paper Company at Jay on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["555075","542844","555076","553003","557250","555214","552953","554629","550527","550622","542523","551348","546171","554762","545148","544861"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","bank","forest","remove","deposit","disturbance","soften","sediment","edge","boundary"]}
