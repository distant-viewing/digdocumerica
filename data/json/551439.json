{"path":"551439.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly woman seated outdoors. She is sitting on what appears to be a bench with her body slightly hunched and her face covered by her hands, held under a striped scarf draped around her head. She wears a dark coat and a patterned green and blue skirt. Her footwear consisted of simple black shoes. Beside her is a blue shopping bag with large white polka dots.\n\nThe background is simplistic, featuring a plain, light-colored brick wall which contrasts with the detailed elements of her attire. The image has a somber tone, communicated by the posture and obscured face of the woman, suggesting a moment of distress or deep thought. The lighting is natural, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of her clothing and the shopping bag. The overall composition of the photograph evokes a sense of solitude and contemplation.","title":"An old lady rests sore feet and swollen legs on a bench in Nicollet Mall.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551828","554051","555530","556498","551448","551438","553501","553156","551845","557177","556594","558319","553484","546977","555975","553486"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["shopping","bag","footwear","distress","polka","face","scarf","dot","skirt","thought"]}
