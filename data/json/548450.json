{"path":"548450.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This image features a man’s hands holding a measuring device, which appears to be a sound level meter, used to assess noise pollution or environmental noise. The device is black, with a gray top housing and several controls. Prominently displayed on the front is a gauge with a scale and a needle showing the measurement. The gauge is labeled in both dB(A) and dB(C) scales, typical for sound measurement.\n\nThe man’s hands are partially visible; he is wearing a watch and a patterned, long-sleeved shirt. The setting suggests an outdoor urban environment, possibly near industrial facilities given the presence of what appears to be factory-like structures and metal fencing in the blurred background. The environment and the device suggest that the photograph could be documenting an environmental study or noise pollution measurement.","title":"Noise meter, held at Logan Airport end of Neptune Road records over 86 decibels.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548449","547740","549052","542662","557829","556592","542661","552371","542663","548879","547718","552358","549610","542659","543799","549625"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["noise","measurement","device","gauge","pollution","assess","meter","fencing","scale","measure"]}
