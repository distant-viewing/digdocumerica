{"path":"550163.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a suburban street scene focused on municipal waste collection. In the foreground, two workers are actively engaged in garbage collection, seen throwing transparent bags into the back of a beige garbage truck. One worker is in a halfway bent position lifting a bag, while the other appears to be assisting or directing. The truck is a prominent feature in the image, with \"Division of Streets\" and a \"Keep Cleveland Clean\" slogan visible on its sides, hinting at the location being Cleveland.\n\nThe background is residential with houses visible on either side of the street. The houses feature typical suburban architecture with neat lawns and driveways. The street is lined with vibrant, pink-flowering trees, likely cherry blossoms, adding a splash of color and a springtime atmosphere to the scene. There are also other garbage cans and bags placed on the curb ready for collection.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a routine yet essential urban service in a picturesque suburban setting, emphasizing everyday municipal operations against a backdrop of residential normalcy and seasonal beauty.","title":"Curbside pickup speeds the work of the sanitation crew.
