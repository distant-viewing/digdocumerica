{"path":"557570.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape scene at dusk or dawn with a layer of mist hovering over a calm lake. The mist adds a mystical quality to the scene, blurring the reflection of the surroundings on the water's surface. In the background, silhouettes of mountains and trees can be seen under a fading or emerging sky, possibly during twilight hours, which provide a rich gradient from deep blues at the top to lighter hues near the horizon.\n\nIn the midground, tree-covered hillsides frame the lake, with some built structures partially visible among the trees, suggesting a remote, perhaps residential area nestled in this natural setting. The overall composition, with the smooth water in the foreground reflecting the peaceful transition of day and night, creates a tranquil and contemplative mood. The photo also features a dark silhouette of leaves in the upper right corner, adding depth and framing the scene naturally.","title":"Early morning at Malibu Lake in the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. This area so far has escaped intensive development pressure. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressure.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557021","554752","557561","543590","552336","543577","554405","554397","543604","550735","557000","552319","550746","557572","557569","550745"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["mist","hover","lake","silhouette","emerge","night","hillside","hour","gradient","midground"]}
