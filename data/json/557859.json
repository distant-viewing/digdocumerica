{"path":"557859.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph features a somewhat dimly lit indoor setting, likely a garage or vehicle inspection center. At the center of the image, there is an equipment unit labeled \"Sun Infra-Red,\" which is presumably a device used for analyzing vehicle emissions or engine performance. This unit has several gauges and red front panels.\n\nOn the left side of the image, partially obscured by the foreground, is an individual, probably a driver, sitting inside a vehicle. Only the arm and part of the shoulder are visible, resting on what appears to be a car door with the window rolled down.\n\nTo the right, there is another individual wearing a light-colored uniform, suggesting a professional environment, maybe a mechanic or an inspector. This person is facing away from the camera, partially out of focus, and is positioned near the control unit, possibly operating it or observing the data.\n\nThe overall composition uses deep shadows and limited light sources, creating a somewhat mysterious and focused atmosphere, emphasizing the interaction between the technician and the machinery while hinting at the presence and role of the vehicle and driver in this setting.\n","title":"Woman sits in her car watching the readings on the exhaust analyzer in an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio.
