{"path":"545892.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a cityscape, depicting a mix of residential and urban infrastructure amid a vast green landscape. The foreground prominently features a well-structured highway interchange with multiple entry and exit ramps. Adjacent to the highway, a large canal or river channel partitions the scene, with dirt embankments and minimal water flow visible, forming a distinct separation between the communities or districts.\n\nOn one side of the channel, there is a densely packed residential area. The houses are closely spaced with small yards and are surrounded by mature trees, offering shade and adding greenery to the neighborhood. The other side of the channel also shows residential areas, but they are interspersed with larger buildings that might be commercial properties or public facilities, set among spacious, open lawns.\n\nIn the distance, the city's skyline looms with tall buildings clustered together, contributing to an impression of a bustling urban center. The skyline against the hazy background suggests a large metropolitan area. The overall composition of the photograph uses natural and man-made lines—like the highways and the river channel—to draw the eye towards the central urban skyline, suggesting the interconnected nature of city life.","title":"Outside Houston - city skyline in background","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["549478","553015","553559","546574","548344","546581","547764","553838","546678","548092","547765","555743","557501","549476","555781","548414"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["channel","highway","skyline","partition","interchange","exit","separation","ramp","entry","embankment"]}
