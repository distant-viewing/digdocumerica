{"path":"552371.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, a man is shown working closely with a complex mechanical apparatus inside what appears to be a technical or laboratory environment. The man, who has a beard and medium-length hair, is dressed in a light-colored long-sleeve shirt and is looking intently at the equipment in his hands. This equipment includes metal parts with tubing connected to it and seems to be related to environmental monitoring or testing, noting his meticulous use of a smaller tool or cleaner.\n\nIn the immediate background, a large piece of machinery or electronic instrumentation panel is visible, which includes various dials, gauges, and digital displays. Prominently displayed on the edge of this panel is a logo of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), suggesting that the setting is related to environmental research or regulation activities undertaken by or in coordination with the EPA.\n\nThe overall environment suggests a setting well-equipped for scientific or technical tasks, possibly within a mobile lab or a specialized room designed for environmental analysis. The focus and precision of the man's activity underscore the seriousness and scientific nature of the work being conducted.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["551595","542661","551594","543797","549607","542666","546328","542664","546276","556557","553329","549612","549364","546327","546284","557829"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["panel","tubing","seriousness","coordination","gauge","regulation","analysis","testing","precision","dial"]}
