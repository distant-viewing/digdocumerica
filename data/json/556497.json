{"path":"556497.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph features an older African American man in the foreground, looking directly at the camera with a solemn expression. He wears a dark cap and a denim jacket over a collared shirt, with a pipe in his mouth. Behind him, on a wooden porch of what looks like a traditional weathered house, a woman and four children are visible.\n\nThe woman stands on the porch, dressed in a sleeveless top and patterned pants, looking off to the side. The children are of various ages and are engaged in different activities: one child is climbing the porch stairs, another is standing on the porch, while two younger children play on and around the stairs. The house's exterior is wooden, with peeling paint suggesting age and wear.\n\nThe overall scene is set against a background that suggests a rural or semi-rural area, with soft, natural light that indicates either early morning or late afternoon. The composition captures a slice of everyday life, portraying a moment of serene, yet vivid familial and community interaction.","title":"Retired coal miner ed Austin with some of his 20 children in fireco, West Virginia, near Beckley.
