{"path":"555006.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph features a close-up image of a tree branch or root partially submerged in a dark, possibly wet environment. The woody element appears aged and sturdy, exhibiting natural textures such as roughness and segmentation typical of deadwood. There are signs of moss or other small vegetation on its surface, indicating that it might be in a moist setting, like a forest floor or near a water body.\n\nNotably, several mushrooms and fungi can be observed growing on the branch. These fungi vary in color and shape: some are elongated and whitish, others are smaller and darker, suggesting a rich micro-ecosystem supported by the decaying wood. The background is uniformly dark, enhancing the focus on the details and textures of the branch and fungi.\n\nThe mood evoked by the image is solemn and quiet, perhaps mirroring the stillness of a forest or another similarly tranquil natural habitat. The dark tones and natural subject matter suggest themes of decay, growth, and the cyclic nature of ecosystems. The lighting appears to be natural, possibly filtered through a canopy above, highlighting parts of the fungi and moss, and casting much of the branch in shadow.","title":"Spruce sap in the Queets Corridor of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555181","555179","557624","558081","554997","558076","555008","554973","555183","554593","557620","544731","557622","555015","555185","555180"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["branch","moss","ecosystem","matter","root","forest","stillness","habitat","texture","growth"]}
