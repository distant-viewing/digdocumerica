{"path":"555015.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a dark-colored bracket fungus growing on a tree surface heavily covered by moss. The fungus has a typical shelf-like, semi-circular appearance. Its upper surface is mottled, showcasing a combination of ash black and gray with a rough, pitted texture, perhaps partly covered with a thin layer of moss or lichen. The edges of the fungus are uneven, slightly curved, and exhibit some pale, possibly beige areas which look eroded or nibbled, adding to its rugged appearance.\n\nThe tree on which the fungus is growing is richly clad in green moss that looks lush, highlighting variations in texture and color between deep dark greens and lighter shades. The lighting in the photograph brings out the contours of the moss and fungus, enhancing the overall moisture-laden and dense texture of this ecosystem.\n\nThe background retains a shallow depth of field, resulting in a blurred effect that helps in drawing attention to the sharp focus on the fungus. The natural lighting and the angle of the shot emphasize the rugged texture and organic growth patterns, making it an engaging study of life in a humid forest environment.","title":"Fungus conch growing on a bigleaf maple in queets corridor of Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554593","558081","555180","555181","557595","555006","558076","551373","555179","555018","555017","557624","554985","554571","555016","555025"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["moss","grow","texture","mottle","bracket","laden","retain","pit","greens","appearance"]}
