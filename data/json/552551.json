{"path":"552551.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph features a dramatic and expansive view of a complex, fallen tree with numerous sprawling and twisted branches. The tree appears old and weathered, with light-colored, barren branches that stretch outward from a central trunk in many crooked and interwoven patterns.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is rugged and arid, showing sedimentary rock layers which suggest this might be a canyon or a dry desert environment. Some sparse vegetation can be seen, which includes small bushes and dried grass, indicating the harsh climatic conditions of the area. \n\nThe sky is overcast with grey clouds, lending a somber tone to the image and enhancing the starkness of the dead tree. The ground around the tree is mostly barren soil or sand, contributing to the desolated and wild nature of the scene. The perspective of the shot, taken from ground level and looking slightly upward towards the tree, emphasizes the sprawling, almost chaotic nature of the branches and the vastness of the landscape beyond.","title":"Piceance basin, semi-arid range land","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["543722","543843","542570","545747","543718","555204","555002","555207","546121","554994","553577","542749","544942","544921","557622","555151"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sprawling","branch","yon","twiste","starkness","tree","can","arid","shot","dry"]}
