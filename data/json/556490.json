{"path":"556490.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a quiet, somewhat desolate scene featuring old, neglected infrastructure. Two young boys are shown from behind, walking along a disused railroad track. The boys appear to be together, and one carries a red backpack. \n\nThe railroad itself is in a state of disrepair, with missing wooden ties and gravel scattered around unevenly. The area around the railroad is overgrown, hinting that it has been out of use for quite some time. The tracks lead into a wooded area, which takes up the background of the image.\n\nTo the right of the frame, there is a red pickup truck parked on a muddy road that runs parallel to the railroad track. This road also shows signs of neglect, with puddles and patches of mud.\n\nThe setting suggests a rural or semi-rural area, and the mood is somewhat lonely or nostalgic, highlighted by the muted colors and the overcast sky. The focus on the two boys and the decaying infrastructure could evoke a sense of adventure or reflection on transition and the passage of time.","title":"Youngsters walk on ties of the railroad tracks that pass through Fireco, West Virginia, near Beckley. In the old mining communities, the railroads always went through the center of the towns which were built in the valleys around them. It was the railroads which made it possible to ship out the coal, the reason the towns were built. Fireco was in the middle of a once great coal area, but declined as the mines gave out.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556588","544402","554353","547656","544706","554834","552674","545953","551003","554561","552673","554356","556548","556783","556313","547050"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railroad","boy","track","infrastructure","pickup","backpack","puddle","time","mud","disrepair"]}
