{"path":"550660.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a scene beside a river, specifically named the Androscoggin River. The central element in the foreground is a black informational sign with a cut-out silhouette at the top, possibly of a fish or local wildlife, which is mounted on a post. The sign has white text that gives visitors historical information and context about the river. The river itself is visible in the background, stretching across the frame, characterized by its rapid and turbulent waters reflecting bright sunlight.\n\nThe riverbank is bordered by lush greenery; dense forests of coniferous trees can be seen on the far side of the river. These trees are tall and densely packed, covering the hills that slope upwards from the river's edge. The sky above is partly cloudy, allowing for ample sunlight that illuminates the entire landscape, enhancing the vivid greens and blues.\n\nIn the foreground, just around the signpost, there is grass and some shrubbery, signaling that the point from which the photo is taken is a well-maintained area, likely a designated viewpoint or rest area for visitors. This setting appears tranquil and pristine, typical of a natural reserve or a park, suggesting a space dedicated to both conservation and educational purposes. The overall composition of the photograph, with the sign prominently placed to the left, directs the viewer's attention not only to the natural beauty of the scene but also to the cultural and historical significance of the location.","title":"Sign in \"13-Mile Woods\" on the Androscoggin River near Errol gives information about the river and locality.","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["552108","550658","550656","542558","548156","544861","542557","542537","550700","542523","550682","551348","552953","550717","555075","543793"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["river","visitor","signpost","reserve","sign","shrubbery","information","sunlight","conservation","significance"]}
