{"path":"551461.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts a person sitting on a low concrete wall next to a tree on an urban sidewalk. The person, who appears to be a young adult, is dressed casually in blue jeans and a dark top, paired with boat-style sneakers. They wear a light-colored, broad-brimmed canvas hat and are holding what appears to be a fast food drink cup in one hand and a straw wrapper or similar small item in the other hand.\n\nThe setting has a distinctly urban character, with a brick-laid sidewalk and a column with ornate metal work that provides subtle yet elegant detailing in the background. Behind the person, there is a glance of a busy city street life which includes another pedestrian who is partially visible; this individual holds an umbrella or sunshade, suggesting sunny weather.\n\nThis scene, full of casual everyday moments, captures the essence of city life with its mix of relaxed personal time and the active environment. The large tree next to which the person sits adds a natural element to the otherwise concrete-centric urban landscape. The canopy of the tree casts a light shadow over the area, possibly providing respite from the sun.","title":"Lunching on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["550188","551741","553156","546492","547251","551815","553150","551502","551434","546443","551970","553222","547748","550037","552723","553166"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["person","sidewalk","sits","respite","glance","concrete","canva","sneaker","umbrella","straw"]}
