{"path":"555579.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a striking view of a grand Victorian-style house characterized by its intricate architecture and ornamental details. The primary focus is the decorative facade and the elegant entrance of the home.\n\nThe house exhibits several hallmark features of Victorian architecture: a complex roofline with multiple gables and scrollwork, a prominent turret with a conical roof, and a spacious, wrap-around porch adorned with ornate railing and slender columns. The windows, particularly those in the attic and above the porch, include pointed arches and decorative frames, enhancing the historic charm of the building.\n\nThe entrance of the house is inviting, with a series of wide steps leading up to double front doors. The doorway is framed by columns and an architrave embellished with scrollwork. Flanking the entrance are large planters holding lush, leafy plants, adding a touch of greenery.\n\nSurrounding the house is a well-maintained garden, including a neat row of bright red rose bushes that line a pathway. The lushness of the plants against the predominantly light-colored exterior of the house creates a vibrant contrast.\n\nOverall, the composition gives a sense of opulence and detailed craftsmanship typical of the Victorian era, projecting a serene and welcoming atmosphere. The photograph captures the essence of a well-preserved piece of historical architecture, showcasing a dedication to ornamental design and aesthetic elegance.","title":"One of the many beautifully maintained homes built in the earlier 1900's","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["555578","558159","557077","558150","548666","557069","558156","557071","542816","542967","557092","557076","557066","558160","557067","542818"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","entrance","column","architecture","porch","turret","embellish","dedication","lushness","planter"]}
