{"path":"547138.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man seated on the steps of a wooden porch, engaged in the act of eating a banana. The man is dressed in rugged attire suitable for cooler weather, including a denim jacket and jeans, a dark-colored knit cap, and work boots. He appears focused on the banana he's peeling and eating, holding it close to his face.\n\nThe surroundings suggest a rural or semi-rural setting, with a modest, weathered house in the background, demonstrating signs of age and functional use rather than aesthetic embellishment. The porch where the man sits is simple and utilitarian, made of unpainted wood with visible wear and a few white railings.\n\nBeside the man on the ground, there's a large white sack or bag, partially dirty, contributing to the rustic, everyday life theme of the image. The ground is unpaved, consisting of bare soil with some gravel scattered around, typical of an outdoor area frequently used for work or passage.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, combined with the natural, diffused lighting, gives the image a candid and somewhat poignant quality, evoking a sense of quiet solitude or a moment of rest in the man's day.","title":"Seaman from ludington ferry","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["556489","553090","552523","545524","547330","547313","557115","545986","556488","551961","554926","545974","547355","555529","547792","558330"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["eat","porch","man","rustic","sack","embellishment","knit","demonstrate","peel","act"]}
