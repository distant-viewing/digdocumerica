{"path":"552445.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a rugged, textured foreground dominated by a large, weathered rock formation, which has an unusual, almost sculptural shape. The rock's surface is rough and cracked, indicating erosion and environmental wear. It is various shades of ochre and brown.\n\nThe background offers a stark contrast to the arid-looking rock in the foreground. It shows a lush landscape that includes a curved dirt road, flanked on either side by greenery. Beyond this verdurous area, there appears to be agricultural fields, visible in patches of regular, rectangular plots that hint at a mix of different crop types. This indicates that the area might be a blend of natural and cultivated land.\n\nThe sky above is clear and very bright, likely indicative of a sunny day, which casts deep shadows over the rock formation and highlights the textures and contours vividly. The overall composition of the image places the viewer on a high vantage point looking over the far-reaching landscape, emphasizing the natural and rural beauty of the setting.","title":"Oddly shaped outcroppings often appear on the mounds of red clay and shale that mark the sites of abandoned deep mines scattered throughout north central Illinois. The one shown here is near the town of Standard.","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552444","545804","545589","544363","545724","549197","554410","552890","555592","549228","543838","543421","551520","545696","544745","544429"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","formation","plot","crop","contour","vantage","erosion","wear","blend","shape"]}
