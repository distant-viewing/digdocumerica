{"path":"548833.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and intimate moment of two people, a man and a woman, sitting together and facing a beautiful landscape. They are perched on the edge of a rocky cliff overlooking a large body of water, possibly a lake or river, at sunset. The man is wearing a red shirt with a yellow graphic on the back, while the woman has long hair and is dressed in a light-colored top with darker pants.\n\nThe setting sun at the horizon emits a soft, warm glow, coloring the sky in hues of pink, orange, and purple which reflect lightly off the water's surface, enhancing the tranquility of the scene. The landscape around them is fairly barren, with sparse vegetation and gentle, undulating hills in the distance.\n\nTo their right, a large, shadowy rock formation frames the scene, adding a dramatic touch and contrasting with the softer colors of the sunset. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on the pair and the vast, open space around them, evokes a sense of peaceful isolation and the beauty of nature. It is a tranquil visual narrative about companionship and appreciating quiet moments amidst the natural world.","title":"Two young people overlook the Colorado river from \"castle rock\", a promontory north of lake havasu city","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["551945","549471","554901","543950","543203","545767","551859","551967","545612","552977","554900","549756","547834","545194","545489","547595"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["sunset","graphic","companionship","appreciate","perch","overlook","undulate","world","woman","purple"]}
