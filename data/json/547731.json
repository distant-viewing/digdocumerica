{"path":"547731.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset view over a landscape dominated by a winding body of water, possibly a river or wetlands. The sky displays subtle gradients of orange, pink, and purplish hues as the sun sets along a low-lying horizon, partially obscured by distant landforms that silhouette against the vibrant sky. \n\nThe water reflects the colors of the sunset, creating patches of luminous orange and pink amidst the darker areas that mirror the dark land. The composition invites a sense of calm and majesty, emphasizing the expansive sky above and the intricate, meandering pattern of the water below which cuts through mudflats or small islets. The lighting conditions enhance the tranquil and somewhat melancholic atmosphere of the scene, suggesting a quiet, reflective evening ambiance.\n\nNo people or manmade structures are visible in the image, which focuses completely on the natural beauty and tranquil setting, evoking a sense of isolation and the wild, untouched character of the landscape.","title":"Sunrise over the lower Colorado river near the intersection of the California, mexico, and Arizona borders","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["544711","557447","552294","557497","552230","554404","544707","552263","552335","548909","548904","545145","554759","550646","550296","545000"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","mudflat","islet","majesty","landform","wetland","calm","gradient","character","mirror"]}
