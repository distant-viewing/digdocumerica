{"path":"552299.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a man engrossed in repairing or examining what appears to be a fishing net. The man is dressed in a plaid, long-sleeve shirt that's predominantly red and white, with hints of blue and yellow stripes. His hair is tousled and he has a focused expression as he works on the net, which is fine mesh and sprawled around in front of him.\n\nThe setting is a waterside location, as evidenced by the presence of calm water in the background where a boat is moored. The boat has a cabin and a small deck, and appears to be a small fishing or recreational type. The environment looks tranquil and somewhat overcast, suggesting a cool or cloudy day.\n\nIn the background beyond the boat, there are faint outlines of trees on the other side of the water, which adds a natural, serene element to the scene. The overall composition places the man in the foreground, engaging in a routine yet essential task in a fishing or maritime context, set against a picturesque, natural backdrop.","title":"Preparing a purse seine for use in Alaska at home port of Gig Harbor in southern Puget Sound.
