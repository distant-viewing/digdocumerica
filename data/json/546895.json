{"path":"546895.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial wastewater treatment facility. The image is taken from a high vantage point, looking down on numerous rectangular aeration tanks filled with bubbling water. The tanks are arranged in a grid pattern, extending across the frame. The water appears frothy, indicating the process of aeration, where air is forced through the water to reduce waste and promote the breakdown of contaminants by microorganisms.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple pipes and valves are visible, laid across the tops of the tanks. These likely serve to distribute air and possibly other treatments to the water. Five round structures, possibly vents or additional equipment related to the aeration process, are aligned diagonally across the tanks from the foreground towards the middle of the image.\n\nIn the background, beyond the tanks, the landscape features bare trees and a clear sky, suggesting a cold or temperate season. A small building is visible towards the right side of the frame in the distance, potentially housing operational controls or equipment for the facility. The general tone of the image is industrial and functional, with a focus on environmental management and water treatment processes.","title":"Water filters at the back river sewage treatment plant, a primary treatment facility for the Baltimore area","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["548216","547239","548212","547568","547262","553900","547260","545840","543574","543572","547257","544052","549636","543573","553837","543571"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["treatment","tank","process","breakdown","wastewater","air","valf","reduce","tanks","water"]}
