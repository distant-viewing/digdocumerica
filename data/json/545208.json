{"path":"545208.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaged in an activity on a rocky beach. They are bending over what appears to be a net spread out on the ground, carefully examining or sorting through its contents which look like fish or some marine catch.\n\nThe person on the left is a man wearing a brownish shirt and blue jeans, paired with sneakers. The individual on the right is wearing a reddish-orange jacket, white pants with a colorful pattern at the cuffs, and similar style sneakers. The figure on the right also wears a cap. Both individuals seem focused on their task, handling the objects in the net with care.\n\nThe background of the image is dominated by dark, rough-textured sand or soil, which extends to the top of the frame, giving a sense of a secluded or less-traveled beach. There's a piece of rock near the right edge of the frame, adding to the rugged natural landscape.\n\nThe overall lighting suggests it might be a sunny day as the shadows are distinct and sharp under the bright sunlight. The setting is natural and outdoor, emphasizing a sense of activity in a wild, possibly coastal environment.","title":"Examining a catch of smelts","placename":"Yachats (Or.)","location":"Yachats, Oregon","nn1":["552278","552286","546290","546360","554008","543492","545077","547504","545085","546330","545086","547020","545178","546222","547117","545080"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["sneaker","net","beach","cuff","catch","individual","spread","care","fish","content"]}
