{"path":"549210.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image captures a serene and remote landscape, likely characteristic of a rural or agricultural region. The focal point of the photograph is a traditional windmill, constructed with a metal frame and featuring a multi-blade rotor. The windmill stands stark against a vast, open sky with scattered clouds, which dominantly covers the upper portion of the image.\n\nThe horizon is flat, punctuated only by the sparse installation of mechanical and possibly storage structures in the mid-ground, suggesting an area devoted to either agricultural production or energy generation. The terrain is covered with grass and small shrubs, indicating a natural, rural setting. The scene is enveloped in a subdued lighting, likely from an overcast day, which gives the colors a muted tone, enhancing the sense of tranquility and isolation.\n\nThere are no people or animals visible in the scene, emphasizing the solitude and functional focus of the environment. The composition of the image, the spread of the landscape, and the cloud-filled sky contribute to a feeling of expansiveness and the timeless utility of wind power in rural landscapes.","title":"Windmill in the river rolling ranch lands near powder river Wyoming","placename":"Wyoming","location":"Wyoming","nn1":["549216","545832","555291","549211","549212","549217","545828","544868","549213","547347","552462","545852","547283","547293","545848","547345"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["windmill","rotor","expansiveness","generation","installation","cloud","production","punctuate","envelop","energy"]}
