{"path":"549798.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This image appears to be taken inside the cabin of a vehicle, possibly a truck or machinery used for heavy operations, with a view both inside the cabin and outside through the large windows. Inside the cabin, there is a man sitting facing the window, revealing a profile view. He appears contemplative or focused on the scene outside. The man is middle-aged, with medium-length hair, and he is wearing a plaid shirt which suggests a casual or work-oriented environment.\n\nThe cabin features a large steering wheel in the foreground, and various other controls and gauges, hinting that the vehicle might be used for construction or industrial purposes. Outside the windows, there is a large, cluttered pile of debris consisting of assorted materials like chunks of concrete, metal, and other unidentifiable rubble. The pile of debris sprawls across the middle and background of the external view, and water and a distant landmass can be seen further in the background, which might indicate that this is a coastal or riverside location, possibly a dumpsite or construction/demolition site.\n\nThe overall scene conveys a sense of industrial activity, possibly related to waste management or construction, alongside a thoughtful or observational moment captured of the man in the cabin.","title":"Operator of steam-shovel used to unload garbage scows from Manhattan sits in his cab at Staten Island landfill.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544379","556083","546176","542606","556547","552382","548279","555297","546092","556320","548999","554042","542497","557370","556187","552381"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["cabin","construction","pile","dumpsite","window","demolition","chunk","gauge","landmass","steering"]}
