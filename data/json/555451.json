{"path":"555451.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a multi-lane highway scene, likely captured from an overpass or a high vantage point. The highway has multiple lanes in each direction, separated by a central concrete barrier. The image shows vehicles traveling in both directions, including cars and a large truck. The vehicles appear to be models from the 1970s or 1980s, with various designs and sizes, including a pickup truck closest to the viewer which is packed with items in its bed.\n\nSurrounding the highway are areas of grass and trees, suggesting a suburban or semi-rural setting. There are green traffic signs visible, one indicating an exit for 'Mercer Island' and 'Renton', and another displaying a caution for 'Merging Traffic'. The environment looks well maintained and orderly.\n\nThe composition of the photo focuses on the flow of the traffic, leading the eye along the highway towards the horizon where an overpass crosses the road. The lighting and colors in the image are typical of daylight conditions with clear skies, giving a bright and open feel to the scene.","title":"Traffic flow on the Salem freeway of interstate #5 south of Tigard, Oregon on sundays was reduced to a fraction of the normal load because of the sunday ban on gasoline sales during the fuel shortage","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555437","549890","557471","546686","556785","547811","547823","547569","555505","542764","546612","548391","556194","548084","549902","546607"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","overpass","direction","traffic","truck","caution","pickup","exit","bed","separate"]}
