{"path":"543662.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The image features a vast, open landscape comprised of rolling meadows and hills. The foreground shows a gentle slope covered in lush green grass, scattered with small rocks and patches of bare soil. To the left, a line of tall, thin trees stretches into the distance, bordering what seems like a field. The middle of the image shows a wider expanse of the meadow, interrupted by an occasional tree and small bushes.\n\nThe background presents a contrasting mountain range with its peaks partially covered in snow, suggesting perhaps a late spring or early autumn setting. The mountains are dark, rugged, and majestic, rising starkly against a lightly clouded sky which fills the top part of the image.\n\nThe terrain is divided in places by what appears to be wooden fencing, possibly indicating areas of farmland or grazing land. The scene is rural and serene, devoid of any visible buildings or people, emphasizing a natural, untouched environment. The overall mood is peaceful and idyllic, typical of a pastoral landscape.","title":"This area will be developed into a resort for skiing and vacation housing.","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["549236","557087","554722","549218","549142","549157","543654","549155","552903","545040","555671","549256","556990","544892","549146","550667"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["meadow","fencing","farmland","mountain","autumn","spring","peak","slope","snow","bush"]}
