{"path":"547999.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view capturing a vibrant and dynamic industrial setting. The primary feature of the image is a large railway yard where several trains are visible; some are producing significant amounts of white smoke, contributing to a sense of bustling activity. The railway yard contains multiple tracks and a variety of buildings possibly related to the railway operations, such as warehouses or maintenance sheds.\n\nAdjacent to the railway, a parallel road can be seen, highlighting the area's connectivity and infrastructure. Beyond the immediate railway and road, the landscape hosts a river that curves through the scene, bordered by sandy and vegetated banks. This natural feature adds a contrasting element of tranquility compared to the industrial foreground.\n\nThe photograph also shows various plots of cultivated land, which appear lush and green, adding a patchwork of color to the scene. These plots are interspersed with more arid and rocky terrain, typical of a mountainous or rugged geographical area. The backdrop comprises hills or mountains, further emphasizing the diverse topography of the region.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a mix of industrial activity with natural landscapes, illustrating how human endeavors coexist closely with natural environments. The presence of smoke and industrial structures juxtaposes with the serenity of the river and green fields, conveying a narrative of development within a naturally rich setting.","title":"Industrial plant on the upper Columbia River","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548167","556464","556382","550974","546719","556852","545354","550860","551194","545988","545541","555564","554632","556783","551197","551192"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","plot","yard","smoke","patchwork","connectivity","host","coexist","serenity","produce"]}
