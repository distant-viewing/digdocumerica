{"path":"545174.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of a man engaged in the task of lobster fishing. The man, who appears to be middle-aged and wears a striped, long-sleeve shirt and sunglasses, is seen handling a large, circular lobster trap. He is standing on a boat, and the focus is closely on his activities and part of the boat's edge, which appears old and worn.\n\nThe man is holding a lobster in his left hand, examining or preparing to remove it from the wire mesh of the trap, which is filled with several other lobsters. His expression appears focused and diligent, indicative of his engagement with his work. The background is blurred but hints at a water body, likely the sea or ocean given the context of lobster fishing.\n\nThe sunlight in the scene suggests it is daytime, enhancing the vivid colors and details such as the glistening of the water and the texture of the lobsters and trap. The composition of the photograph, with the manâ€™s actions centrally framed, draws attention to the rugged, hands-on nature of fishing work, emphasizing the personal effort and interaction with marine life.","title":"Jack Wiegardt, owner of Northwest Oyster Farm, Inc., works his Dungeness crab pots.
