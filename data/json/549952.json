{"path":"549952.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures two seagulls standing atop a large pile of trash in a landfill setting. The foreground prominently features one seagull with its beak open as if squawking, while the other seagull is eating from a piece of waste it holds in its beak. Both birds appear weathered, possibly indicating their frequent presence in such environments.\n\nThe trash beneath their feet comprises a variety of discarded items such as plastic bags, pieces of paper, cloth, and smaller unidentifiable debris, showcasing a mix of colors but generally bearing a grimy appearance. The scene is set outdoors, evident from the natural light casting on the subjects.\n\nIn the slightly blurred background, a white trash collection vehicle is visible, indicating ongoing waste management activities. Beyond the immediate surroundings of the landfill, a faint hint of hills or mountain ranges can be seen, suggesting that this landfill is located near a less urban area or in a valley.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment that highlights issues of waste management, environmental impact, and how wildlife interacts with human-altered landscapes. The photo also conveys a sense of neglect and destruction, common in landfills, which directly impacts local fauna.","title":"Seagulls scavenge at Croton landfill operation along the Hudson River","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["549951","549758","549737","549744","549754","554542","549953","549745","549738","547971","549946","549748","549741","547983","549742","549753"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["landfill","seagull","trash","beak","waste","management","fauna","piece","alter","eat"]}
