{"path":"555265.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"In this photograph, an older man, likely a scientist, is working within a cluttered and well-equipped laboratory. He is dressed in a white lab coat and glasses, standing upright while holding a small object in his hand, possibly a component or a sample. His posture and gaze suggest he is focused on this item or possibly observing equipment readings.\n\nThe laboratory is filled with various scientific instruments and electronic devices, indicating that this is a place for extensive research and experimentation. There are large machines, possibly computers or data processors, and racks filled with electrical switches and knobs. The background features numerous switches and gauges on a wall panel, contributing to the ambiance of a heavy-duty scientific environment.\n\nOne prominent machine is labeled \"UT-200\", and there are other devices with dials, switches, and digital displays. On the bench in the foreground, there are more equipment and possibly test samples in small containers. The overall color palette is composed of industrial grays, blues, and the white of the scientist's coat, contrasting with the darker shades of the equipment. The room is well-lighted, perhaps by fluorescent lamps, enhancing the visibility of the detailed setup of the workspace.","title":"An environmental protection agency laboratory technician in New York city is shown working with a gas liquid chromatography machine that separates pesticides components for analysis","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555280","549332","546284","542666","549608","555250","546278","555249","549333","555248","551594","546277","542665","546295","549607","555251"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["switch","scientist","sample","laboratory","machine","device","equipment","coat","experimentation","knob"]}
