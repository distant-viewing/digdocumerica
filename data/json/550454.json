{"path":"550454.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts three mountain goats in a rocky environment. The goats are off-white, with slightly curved, pointed horns and are all focused on grazing or searching the ground for food. The terrain they are in is rugged; composed primarily of dark and lighter gray rocks. The backdrop is slightly blurry, emphasizing the goats in the foreground and providing a sense of depth, whilst the lighting suggests either early morning or late evening, casting a gentle glow on the scene and creating a somewhat moody atmosphere. The overall composition portrays a moment in the natural behaviors and habitat of these mountain goats.","title":"Three young Dall sheep at the west salt lick in the Atigun Gorge, four miles from the point where the pipeline will cross the Atigun River.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550444","550447","550455","550456","550453","550452","550446","550450","550445","550449","550451","545901","543269","543029","550421","550448"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["goat","horn","behavior","mountain","food","habitat","glow","evening","morning","rock"]}
