{"path":"557429.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a serene coastal scene with multiple components in the landscape. The foreground shows a lush green field, likely wild grass or marshland, which adds a natural and vibrant touch contrasting with the water and urban elements. In the middle ground, there is a calm water body that reflects the blue sky, creating a tranquil atmosphere.\n\nOccupying the further part of the middle ground and stretching across to the background is a coastal cliff with varied vegetation. Notable are the distinct geological layers visible on the cliff face, suggesting erosion and other natural processes at work.\n\nBeyond the cliff, a residential area spans the upper portion of the image, illustrating a suburban neighborhood. The houses are closely packed together, demonstrating uniform architecture, most likely with red-tiled roofs and light-colored walls, common in coastal regions for reflecting sunlight. This settlement pattern provides a humanized contrast to the natural coastal and marine environment seen in the rest of the picture.\n\nThe background extends to fading hills, slightly obscured by haze, indicating distance and adding depth to the landscape. The sky is mostly clear with soft lighting, indicating either early morning or late afternoon, which enhances the colors in the photo from the lush greens of the grass to the reddish-brown of the cliffs and the varied hues of the residential buildings. Overall, the image captures a harmonious blend of natural and human-developed elements, typical of coastal communities.","title":"Part of the intensive residential development underway around the harbor at Bay.
