{"path":"543361.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic seaside setting, with a variety of elements creating a vivid coastal townscape.\n\nIn the foreground, a wooden pier extends into the beach, which is broad and sandy. The surface of the pier is visible, supported by numerous vertical pilings that are implanted in the beach. No people are visible on the pier, which lends a quiet and deserted feel to this area of the image.\n\nMidground of the photograph displays a series of buildings directly adjacent to the beach. A prominent building with multiple gabled roofs and a long horizontal design appears to host some commercial activities, possibly shops or restaurants given its style and large windows. Its architecture has a charming, somewhat quaint aesthetic, suitable for a coastal town.\n\nIn the background, the scene becomes more residential and vibrant. A hill slopes upward from the beachside buildings and is densely packed with houses. These houses vary in design and color, creating a picturesque and eclectic mix. Some homes have classic Victorian designs with rich details and bright color schemes including yellows, blues, and reds, while others appear more modern or simple. This part of the town is lush, with visible greenery surrounding the homes, enhancing their cottage-like charm.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its layering from pier to beach, commercial to residential areas, along with the colorful, densely packed hillside homes, paints a vibrant picture of coastal living. The tranquil yet lively atmosphere is a hallmark of such beachside communities.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543362","542913","553765","557523","554102","543053","545110","557463","545121","543427","550314","543363","543337","547984","550307","550322"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["pier","beach","home","town","design","piling","layering","seaside","restaurant","house"]}
