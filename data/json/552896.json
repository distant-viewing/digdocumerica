{"path":"552896.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid sunset scene with a dramatic, color-saturated sky. The sky features a mosaic of rich, fiery tones ranging from deep oranges to dark yellows, interspersed with streaks and patches of darker reddish-brown and black clouds, providing a textured appearance to the heavens. These colors suggest that the photo is either an early sunrise or a late sunset, times when the sun's angle casts such warm hues.\n\nIn the lower part of the photograph, a silhouette of a mountain range is visible, creating a dark, contrasting horizon line against the bright sky. The outline of the mountains is gentle and rounded, and they appear solid and uniform, occupying the entire width of the frame. \n\nThis composition emphasizes the vastness and beauty of the natural world, particularly highlighting the ephemeral nature of such colorful skies, which shift quickly and constantly. The focus is solely on the natural elements, with no human presence or man-made structures visible, creating a sense of isolation and serenity within the natural landscape. The image is horizontally oriented, typical for landscape photography, which enhances the broad, sweeping view of the sky.","title":"Dawn over the Lake Range, seen from the south tip of Pyramid Lake.
