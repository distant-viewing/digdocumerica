{"path":"545645.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a view from inside a helicopter cockpit, looking outward over a rugged, expansive landscape. Two pilots, seen from the back and wearing helmets, occupy the front seats of the helicopter. Each pilot's helmet appears equipped with communication gear, hinted at by the visible microphones near their mouths.\n\nThe cockpit is surrounded by various instruments and controls, visible in the lower part of the image and on the dashboard, although specifics are not entirely clear due to the focus on the view outside. The windscreen of the helicopter includes multiple sections that create a framed view of the scenery below and ahead.\n\nOutside, the terrain is vast and arid, characterized by rocky surfaces and sparse vegetation. The landscape offers a hint of plateaus or buttes, possibly indicating a desert or semi-arid region. The horizon stretches wide across the photograph, under a sky that, while not prominently featured, suggests a clear day. The image provides a sense of altitude and the broad openness typical of aerial perspectives.","title":"Helicopter lands near log boom in Monument Valley, Utah site of clean-up operations following a massive oil spill into the San Juan River. Helicopters were an indispensable aid, bringing supplies and changing crews, so that work could continue around the clock. This is a very remote location, accessible only by foot, boat, or helicopter.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["548899","553787","553786","548815","545642","546688","544737","545638","555825","545637","546687","544754","556657","544766","544771","544741"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","pilot","cockpit","helmet","butte","plateaus","specific","dashboard","microphone","communication"]}
