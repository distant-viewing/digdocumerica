{"path":"552554.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up shot of tall grass sprigs or flowering stalks, illuminated against a dark, almost black background. Each sprig has multiple branches adorned with clusters of fine, fluffy seeds or flowers that appear bright white due to the light. The botanical subjects are aligned vertically in the frame, and the lighting highlights their texture and delicate details, providing a contrast against the shadowy backdrop. The image conveys a serene and somewhat mystical glimpse of nature, emphasizing the elegance and fragility of the grass stalks. There are no people or man-made objects visible in the composition, reinforcing a sense of natural purity.","title":"Wildflowers bloom in the semi-arid range land of Piceance Basin.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["555031","544884","555106","557559","546156","555052","545495","545069","551370","555187","552485","550383","549232","547642","557104","557191"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["stalk","seed","elegance","grass","shot","cluster","flower","subject","glimpse","branch"]}
