{"path":"558343.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph shows an elderly woman engaged in the delicate craft of lace-making. She is working intently on a lace piece using a traditional lacemaking pillow. The woman wears a pair of glasses and a dark blue, polka-dotted blouse. Her hair is grey and neatly styled, and she appears to be smiling gently while focusing on her work.\n\nIn front of her, there is a round lacemaking pillow covered in a checked fabric. Many wooden bobbins with pins are organized around the edge of the pillow, used to weave and hold the lace patterns in place. Part of the intricate, white lace design she is working on is visible on the top of the pillow, demonstrating the complexity and beauty of her craft.\n\nThe background of the photo is soft-focused but shows a domestic setting with patterned curtains that blend colours like greens, oranges, and off-whites, adding a warm, homey feel to the scene. The lady's expertise and serene demeanor suggest she is experienced and finds joy in her craft, possibly indicating a moment of personal fulfillment and cultural tradition.","title":"Making \"bohemian lace\" is a tradition and craft handed down through generations of women living in New Ulm, Minnesota.
