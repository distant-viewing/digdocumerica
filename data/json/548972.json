{"path":"548972.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a tranquil and somewhat introspective scene masterfully captured through a reflection in water. The primary subject of the image is a man, who is depicted indirectly via his reflection in a body of water. The man appears to be in a crouching position on rocks beside the water, engaging in the act of drawing water into a metallic bucket.\n\nHe is dressed in typical outdoor or field clothing, consisting of a long-sleeve shirt, trousers, and a wide-brimmed hat, suggesting his activity could be related to nature or fieldwork. The reflective surface of the water not only shows the man and his actions but also captures the silhouettes and details of thin, leafy trees and branches that seem to belong to a lightly wooded area.\n\nThe visual effect is intriguing as the elements above the water line are not directly visible; instead, the viewer sees everything as inverted reflections. The colors in the image are subdued, dominated by the blues of the twilight or dawn sky mirrored in the water along with the darker tones of the foliage, lending a cool and serene atmosphere to the composition. The interaction of natural elements with the human activity underscores a sense of harmony and peaceful coexistence with the environment.","title":"Reflected image of epa technician collecting water sample from pahranagat lake about 10 miles south of alamo","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549007","542556","549012","550268","550826","548956","546963","546298","550389","550217","554623","542981","549446","545038","546293","543611"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["reflection","water","fieldwork","harmony","belong","intrigue","brim","outdoor","underscore","coexistence"]}
