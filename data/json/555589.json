{"path":"555589.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural landscape, primarily featuring what seems to be a tall, steep hill or cliff with distinct layers of vegetation cover. The hill has a rounded top covered in golden-brown grass. There is also a distinct vertical shadow dividing the rounded hill visually into two parts. The edge of this hill is dramatically steep, and cliff-like, continuing the vertical shadow down its face.\n\nThe foreground contrasts sharply with the high hill, having a mixture of greenery, golden grass, and shrubby plants scattered sporadically across an uneven terrain. The lighting in the image suggests that it might be either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft lighting and long shadows present.\n\nThe background offers a broad view of a gently rolling landscape that descends into the distance. This part of the landscape features the same golden hues of dried grass and is devoid of any distinct or imposing structures, creating an expansive feel. The distant hills blend under a hazy, possibly misty sky, contributing to the serene and naturalistic setting of the photograph.\n\nOverall, this image captures a tranquil and isolated moment in a rugged natural environment, emphasizing the beauty of undisturbed terrains.","title":"Irregular land formations result in areas previously stripped by the coal mine companies.","placename":"Athens (Ohio)","location":"Athens, Ohio","nn1":["550437","555592","552903","555616","549249","542644","556990","552582","549155","550434","550440","552553","555671","549147","550489","552442"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hill","cliff","grass","like","shadow","descend","isolate","dry","impose","continue"]}
