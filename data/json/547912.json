{"path":"547912.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image captures a large pile of dirt mixed with various debris, situated in a natural setting with trees in the background under a clear blue sky. The pile is composed primarily of soil, interspersed with bits of rubbish such as small pieces of plastic, twigs, branches, and possibly other unidentifiable trash components. Prominently displayed in the upper right corner of the image is a yellow sign that reads \"FOR SALE MASTER YU.7-3000\". The signâ€™s bright color contrasts with the earthy tones of the dirt pile and the green of the trees, drawing attention to itself against the natural backdrop. The scene suggests a land area that may be under development or clearing, where the soil pile has been left or is being used for filling purposes. The presence of debris within the pile indicates a lack of sorting or cleaning of the materials being used or dumped here.","title":"Site of real estate development on Hylan Boulevard, Staten Island.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543102","546246","543165","548807","546235","551245","544637","549957","549936","549795","551247","552031","550350","544174","550252","555086"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["pile","soil","cleaning","rubbish","dirt","twig","debris","clearing","plastic","lack"]}
