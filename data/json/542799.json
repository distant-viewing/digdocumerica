{"path":"542799.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a shop window of a bicycle repair shop. The large window is divided into multiple panes, forming a grid that partially frames the scene within. On the window, white painted letters spell out \"BICYCLE REPAIRING\" with the address \"626 2ND ST.\" at the bottom.\n\nInside the window display is an eye-catching, patriotically decorated bicycle. The bike is painted or covered in the pattern of the American flag, featuring stars and stripes in red, white, and blue. Attached to the bicycle's handlebars is a small sign that reads \"THIS SPACE 4 RENT.\"\n\nIn the background, visible through the translucent reflections and shadows on the window glass, there are subtle hints of the interior of the shop and possibly items or another part of the bicycle visible. The surrounding elements reflect a quiet street scene typical of a small town or city, suggesting a peaceful, everyday setting focused on local business. A faint reflection of other buildings can be seen across the street, adding a layer of depth and realism to the image.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551465","551464","552606","547817","547400","547342","543132","557535","555894","545328","551645","547886","549870","554312","551443","551456"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["bicycle","shop","window","realism","address","handlebar","reflection","bike","pane","star"]}
