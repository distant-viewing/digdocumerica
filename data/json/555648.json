{"path":"555648.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast cornfield under a clear blue sky. The field is densely filled with lush green corn stalks, each appearing well-tended and uniform in growth. The perspective is taken from within the field looking outward, giving prominence to the greenery. The horizon line is quite distant, suggesting the large scale of the farm.\n\nIn the background, there are patches of trees on the left side and what appears to be a gentle rolling hill or a distant construction site showing exposed earth and minimal vegetation on the right. The scene is rural and agricultural with no visible buildings or people, emphasizing a serene and isolated environment. The sunlight appears to be bright, casting clear, light shadows and giving the foliage a vibrant quality, which is typical of a sunny day. The overall mood is peaceful, capturing the essence of an abundant and healthy agricultural landscape.","title":"Farmland purchased by the Ohio Power Company near Chandlersville.
