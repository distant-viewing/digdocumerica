{"path":"553180.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures an up-close view of a rippling water surface illuminated by what appears to be a low, possibly setting or rising sun. The light striking the water creates a metallic and glossy effect, with golden and amber hues reflecting intensely off the undulating waves and ripples. The water's surface texture is richly detailed, varying from sharp, small peaks to broader troughs that create a dynamic and somewhat abstract pattern.\n\nThe overall lighting contrasts sharply with the dark water, highlighting particular details and adding a luminous quality to the scene. There are no distinct objects, people, or distinguishable background elements other than the water itself, which makes the image focus purely on the interplay of light, shadows, and the fluid dynamics of the water. The photograph can evoke a sense of solitude and tranquility, focusing on the natural beauty and complexity of a simple element like water under unique lighting conditions.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: rain on granite paving block.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["554076","544725","552237","543138","544711","543888","550237","552294","543144","545882","550389","548978","557255","547047","550914","544253"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["water","trough","dynamic","complexity","ripple","peak","surface","interplay","wave","solitude"]}
