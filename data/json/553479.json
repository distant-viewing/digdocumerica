{"path":"553479.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph presents an intriguing view of the upper portion of an old, weathered building. The image is framed to include the facade of the building, which shows significant signs of age and deterioration. The building has a classical architectural design with three visible rectangular windows aligned horizontally, two widely open without visible glass and the center one partially visible, perhaps shuttered or broken. The paint on the facade is peeling off, revealing layers and the wear of time.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is notably interrupted by an object labeled \"EXCLUSIVE BY\" diagonally across the lower corner of the image. This label, which partially obscures the building and appears to be a part of some physical barrier or piece of equipment close to the camera, adds a layer of depth and an element of mystery about the purpose or origin of the photograph.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is somewhat eerie and evocative, prompting questions about the history of the building and the story behind this particular photographic capture. The stark contrast between the aged facade and the label provides a visually striking and somewhat jarring juxtaposition.","title":"Mulky square is a neighborhood in the west side of Kansas City, an area of low-income dwellings.
