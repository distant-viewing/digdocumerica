{"path":"542665.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features two men in a laboratory setting, filled with scientific apparatus and equipment.\n\nOne of the men, visible in the foreground, is an older individual with glasses and a receding hairline. He is wearing a white lab coat over a shirt and tie, and is seated with his focus directed towards a cylindrical object in front of him, which appears to be connected to a chart recorder with graphs. The other man is standing behind a large, complex arrangement of glass equipment, akin to a chemistry setup involving round-bottom flasks, tubing, and stands. He is wearing a white short-sleeve shirt and is attentively working on or adjusting the equipment.\n\nThe background is cluttered with various other items, indicative of a busy lab. There are more scientific instruments, containers, and additional pieces of what appears to be laboratory glassware arranged on shelves and workspaces.\n\nOverall, the scene depicts a typical scientific research or testing environment, with the individuals engaged in experimental or measurement tasks using sophisticated tools and machinery, suggesting work that requires precision and technical expertise.","title":"Edgar Stephens, professor of environmental science at the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["555248","555249","546284","555258","555265","542666","545480","549333","555250","551594","552386","555280","546295","549604","555281","549627"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["lab","laboratory","equipment","expertise","tubing","chart","glassware","flask","measurement","glass"]}
