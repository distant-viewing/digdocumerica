{"path":"556013.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a slightly angled view of a rural scene featuring a small, dark brown building with the text \"FLORA CO-OP\" on the side. It appears to be an old, single-story commercial or utility building with multiple white-trimmed windows and a white-trimmed front door. The structure has a weathered appearance, featuring a large roof overhang and decorative trim, suggesting it might be from an earlier part of the 20th century.\n\nIn the foreground, lying on the ground, there's a large circular fallen sign partly visible, reading \"FLORA CO-OP,\" oriented sideways relative to the viewer. The sign is blue and white and has numerous bullet holes and signs of wear, adding a sense of decay or neglect. Grass and dirt are visible around the sign, emphasizing a somewhat unkempt, rural setting.\n\nElectrical or telephone poles intersect the scene both in the foreground and near the building, connected by wires that crisscross above. In the background, just visible over the top of the building, is a silo or grain elevator, hinting at the agricultural nature of the area.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the fallen sign in the foreground and the aged building in the background under a clear sky, might suggest themes of decline or abandonment in rural communities. The setting appears to be devoid of human presence, adding to the lonely or deserted atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Abandoned Santa Fe depot sign which once beckoned travelers at Halstead, Kansas, now rusts in weeds behind the station.
