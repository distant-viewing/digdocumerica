{"path":"557963.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque moment in a rural setting featuring a vintage steam locomotive moving along a curved railway track. The scene is enveloped by the vibrant foliage of early autumn, with trees showcasing a mix of green, yellow, and red leaves.\n\nThe train, appearing from the left side of the image, produces a thick, dark smoke from its stack, which billows upwards and blends into a blue sky partially obscured by the smoke. The locomotive has its headlight illuminated, adding a focal point against the lush backdrop of the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe railroad tracks are made of wooden ties and steel rails, curving gently to the right in the foreground of the image. Alongside the railway, there's a dirt path that parallels the track. \n\nOn the right side of the image, just beside the dirt path, several vintage cars are parked in a line on the grass, suggesting the presence of spectators or visitors, probably observing the train or visiting this scenic location. Beyond the cars, the terrain gently rises, covered with grass and sporadic trees, leading up to a wooded hill in the background.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the historical train in natural surroundings, evokes a sense of nostalgia and tranquility.","title":"Cuyahoga valley line steam powered weekend excursion train approaches the ira road terminal near Akron, Ohio.
