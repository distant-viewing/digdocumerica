{"path":"545717.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a desert landscape under a clear blue sky. The terrain is primarily covered in orange-red sand and rock, characteristic of arid regions. In the foreground, clusters of yucca plants with tall, blooming flower spikes are prominent. The yucca flowers appear robust and are tightly clustered, suggesting that they are in full bloom. The plants cast long shadows on the reddish ground, indicating that the photo was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon when the sun is low in the sky.\n\nThe background features more of the sandy terrain, gradually rising towards a flat, tabletop mountain or mesa, which is common in desert landscapes. This mesa stretches across the horizon, its dark silhouette contrasting sharply with the brighter sky. A few sparse shrubs can also be seen scattered across the landscape, adding a bit of greenery to the otherwise stark environment. The setting appears remote, untouched, and serene, emphasizing the rugged beauty typical of desert ecosystems.","title":"Yucca","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["544879","549123","549018","545583","555346","544893","545843","545754","545771","545903","545789","544027","545579","544887","544401","545575"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mesa","desert","flower","cluster","blooming","flat","brighter","shrubs","plant","bloom"]}
