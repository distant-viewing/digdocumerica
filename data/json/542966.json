{"path":"542966.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic scene of a person riding a horse along a beach. The horse, a sleek, brown animal with no noticeable markings, gallops across the sand, kicking up a light spray of sand behind it. Its mane and tail are mid-motion, adding a sense of speed to the image.\n\nThe rider, dressed in a traditional riding outfit complete with a light colored long-sleeve shirt, maintains a focused posture, holding the reins tightly. They wear sunglasses and their hair is neatly tucked under a hat, which suggests they are prepared for an active ride under sunny conditions.\n\nIn the background, dark, imposing cliffs loom over the beach, providing a stark, rugged contrast to the smooth, reflective surface of the wet sand at the water's edge. The cliffs are shrouded in shadows, highlighting their textures and contours against the bright sunlight bathing the beach.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—the alignment of horse and rider against the dramatic backdrop of cliffs and ocean—creates a vivid portrayal of adventure and the natural beauty of a coastal landscape.","title":"Trinidad Beach","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542810","542885","542806","544308","543014","542800","543071","544362","544420","544414","557051","552671","553118","557988","553116","542956"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","cliff","sand","rider","beach","riding","rein","mane","alignment","tail"]}
