{"path":"556769.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a set of railroad tracks extending through a tranquil, tree-lined environment. The tracks are set between two lush, densely packed areas of vibrant green foliage, creating a narrow corridor through which the rails stretch into the distance. Above the tracks, there are multiple utility poles aligned on either side, supporting several cables that cast slender shadows across the railway bed.\n\nThe dominant feature of this image is a steel bridge crossing over the railroad, some distance down the track. This bridge is constructed from metal beams, painted in light color, and appears aged with some corrosion visible. Beneath the bridge, the parallel rails converge toward a centralized vanishing point, inviting the viewer's gaze to follow along the tracks.\n\nThe scene is bathed in sunlight, hinting at a bright, clear day, though no sky is visible due to the thick canopy of trees. The overall mood evoked is one of tranquil solitude and the passage through nature, punctuated by human-made structures like the railway and bridge. The absence of people or moving trains emphasizes the stillness and quiet of the setting.","title":"Tracks from a view the engineer would see on a southeastern Pennsylvania transportation authority (septa) train in the northwest suburbs of Philadelphia.  Septa has 157 bus and train lines and 2,790 route miles in the metropolitan area.  About 30 million commuter passengers ride the system each year.  In 1974 the ridership totalled 293 million, up from 273 million in 1971.  Improvements in equipment, service and fringe parking were responsible for the increase","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["545378","550790","556856","557962","557975","544706","552064","556837","557513","556851","556759","556841","556873","557024","546112","556888"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["track","bridge","railroad","rail","railway","corrosion","vanishing","corridor","tracks","converge"]}
