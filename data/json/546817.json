{"path":"546817.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scene outside a stone-facade building, quite possibly a home. In the foreground is a vintage white car, a common model from around the 1960s or 1970s, parked on a street. The scene focuses on three women engaged in an activity involving the American flag.\n\nOn the left side of the image, standing on the sidewalk, is a woman in a light pink dress. She is handing up a flagpole with an American flag to another woman who is standing on a small elevated porch. This porch is part of a red-brick staircase leading up to a black metal gate, which serves as the entrance to the building. The woman on the porch is dressed in a bright, multicolored sleeveless dress and is reaching down to receive the flag.\n\nA third woman is visible behind the screen door on the porch, watching the exchange. She is wearing a light-colored top and seems to be an observer to the activity.\n\nThe building itself has an interesting facade, featuring large, cut stone blocks and a couple of windows with traditional shutters partly closed. The building has a sturdy, well-maintained look, typical of mid-20th century urban architecture. There is a visible house number \"432\" next to the door, indicating the address.\n\nThe overall atmosphere appears to be one of a sunny, pleasant day, likely during a patriotic occasion, judging by the act of handling the national flag with what appears to be care and reverence. The scene suggests a moment of community or possibly a preparatory act for a celebration like the Fourth of July.","title":"Residential street near the Locust Point terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550148","550152","557715","552589","557709","550106","554361","557873","545350","549571","542581","546329","546995","552654","544084","549626"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["flag","porch","woman","act","dress","facade","reverence","stone","exchange","address"]}
