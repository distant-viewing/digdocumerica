{"path":"542797.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene featuring an impressive, light-colored wooden church with distinct architectural features. The church has two tall, narrow towers with what appears to be decorative Gothic-style elements at the top. The main building of the church has multiple windows; each incorporating a pointed arch design that complements the towers. A large, rectangular central window sits under the gabled roof.\n\nIn the foreground, a classic black car is parked by the side of the road, facing towards the viewer. The street is marked with white painted lines indicating traffic lanes and a pedestrian crossing. A traffic light is visible to the left of the church.\n\nThe background of the image shows clear blue skies and hints of other urban infrastructure, such as street lamps and a building that appears to be covered in vines or climbing plants, which contrast with the structured and urbane feel of the main street scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it is taken on a bright, sunny day, casting shadows that give the church and the surrounding area a vibrant and lively appearance.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["547414","556240","558019","558018","547333","545366","550376","557088","557083","546455","558163","553327","554207","558034","554035","558030"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["church","towers","street","vine","traffic","incorporate","crossing","climb","lamps","gable"]}
