{"path":"549803.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a compelling perspective of the Statue of Liberty, viewed from a lesser-seen angle featuring a foreground of dilapidated and underdeveloped land. The Statue of Liberty itself is centered in the background, dominating the frame with its iconic pose holding a torch aloft and clad in a robe, positioned on a large pedestal. The sky above is clear and blue, providing a clean backdrop that highlights the statue's silhouette.\n\nIn the foreground, the scene is markedly contrasting with urban neglect: sparse grassy patches, mud, and standing water reflecting a patchy blue sky. There are objects scattered around such as pieces of wood, a cement block, and a decaying wooden structure, contributing to an unkempt, abandoned feel. Additionally, utility poles with wires stretch across the top left corner of the frame, adding an element of everyday urban infrastructure. This juxtaposition creates a visual statement about perhaps the neglect or urban decay in areas surrounding this revered national monument. The perspective gives a sense of distance and isolation between the viewer and the statue, intriguingly placing a symbol of freedom and ambition against a backdrop of neglect.","title":"Statue of Liberty seen from dumping area proposed as the site of the Liberty State Park","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["549761","549760","549763","554351","549790","554350","549781","555740","548351","555723","548352","553862","554359","548349","554296","549764"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["statue","neglect","decay","cement","statement","monument","pedestal","robe","freedom","perspective"]}
