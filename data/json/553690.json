{"path":"553690.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a vibrant beach scene filled with various water activities. The main foreground of the photograph features a group of about seven individuals paddling in a long, narrow outrigger canoe. They are seemingly coordinated in their effort, paddling in unison.\n\nBehind the canoe, the ocean is lively with several more activities. Multiple surfers are visible; to the right-middle of the frame, one surfer stands balanced on a surfboard, riding a wave smoothly towards the beach. Several other surfers are sitting or lying on their boards, and some are visible in the process of paddling.\n\nThe ocean sparkles under the influence of the sunlight, giving the water a glittering effect that contrasts beautifully with the deep blue of the sea. The waves create a dynamic texture on the ocean's surface, ranging from small, choppy ripples to larger, more substantial waves that the surfers are utilizing.\n\nThe horizon is clear and marks a distinct separation between the sea and the sky, suggesting a bright, sunny day with few clouds. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of active enjoyment and natural beauty, capturing a quintessential beach day where various groups engage harmoniously in water sports and activities.","title":"Outrigger canoes and surfers at Waikiki Beach","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553684","553781","553691","546397","546955","544291","543397","543458","556295","555923","553952","550919","543876","551546","553686","551931"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["paddle","canoe","ocean","beach","wave","surfboard","glitter","sea","separation","coordinate"]}
