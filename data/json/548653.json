{"path":"548653.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph presents a tranquil and somewhat mysterious view focusing on the details of a building's overhang, possibly a porch or similar structure. In the foreground, decorative elements featuring a series of interconnected circles with a pentagon shape inside each, linked together on a horizontal railing, draw the eye. Below each circle, decorative drops or finials extend downward enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the architecture.\n\nIt appears to be an outdoor setting, with the upper frame of the photo cast in shadow likely due to the roof of the structure, emphasizing depth and providing a shaded view. In the blurred background, we can see vegetation which suggests the presence of a garden or lush surroundings, giving the setting a serene and green ambiance.\n\nOverall, this composition uses depth of field effectively to highlight the architectural detail while gently blurring the natural elements in the backdrop, creating an inviting and mysterious atmosphere.","title":"Detail of one of the old wooden residences of Key West designed in the Bahamian style, these beautifully ornamented houses give the town much of its special charm.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548649","546472","548652","548657","548658","546480","546468","557074","545041","548664","543028","544012","557070","552530","546470","546463"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["circle","drop","overhang","appeal","detail","depth","garden","porch","railing","series"]}
