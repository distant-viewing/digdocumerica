{"path":"545774.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and contemplative outdoor setting during what appears to be either dawn or dusk. The central focus of the image is a young woman sitting near a vibrant campfire. She is dressed in a red jacket and light-colored pants, with her hair partially obscuring her profile as she looks away from the camera, possibly deep in thought or simply enjoying the surrounding environment.\n\nThe campfire itself is burning brightly, with vivid flames at the center and glowing embers around it, providing a stark contrast to the twilight lighting conditions of the scene. Pieces of wood and small logs are arranged around the fire, suggesting it has been well-maintained.\n\nIn the background, the landscape features a striking geological formation, likely a butte or mesa, which stands prominently against a sky streaked with shades of blue and light clouds. The horizon blends various dark and silhouetted earthy tones, creating a peaceful and remote feeling, suggestive of a wilderness area.\n\nThe composition effectively conveys a sense of solitude and tranquility, emphasizing the beauty of nature and the simple pleasure of a campfire in a remote outdoor setting. The mood is reflective and somewhat introspective, amplified by the solitary figure and the expansive landscape.","title":"Camping in the Maze, a remote and rugged region in the heart of the Canyonlands.
