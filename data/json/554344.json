{"path":"554344.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"In the photograph, the environment is subdued with low lighting, focusing on an indoor setting that appears to be a lecture or a meeting. The main figure in the image is a woman located in the right half of the frame. She wears glasses and a bright red jacket over a darker blouse. She stands behind a lectern, suggesting she may be giving a presentation or speech.\n\nHer expression is earnest and attentive, indicating she is engaged in her activity, potentially addressing an audience. The dark background offers no distinct features, highlighting the woman as the central subject.\n\nBlurry and scarcely visible in the foreground is another person to the left, mostly out of focus. This individual appears to be listening to the speaking woman. The overall mood conveyed by the lighting and arrangement suggests a serious, academic, or professional setting.","title":"Participants in a citizens' forum held in Midtown Manhattan to discuss transportation problems and clean air strategies for New York City proposed by EPA's regional office","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554337","554343","554342","544318","557703","554322","556244","551337","558393","556414","546558","557037","545547","554851","546479","554345"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["speech","woman","presentation","meeting","audience","half","blouse","arrangement","subject","lighting"]}
