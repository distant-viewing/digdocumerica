The man is standing on the edge of a red flatbed truck, which is laden with multiple white and red wooden crates. He is depicted in a bending position, either loading or unloading a crate from the truck. He is wearing a light-colored long sleeve shirt, dark pants, and a yellow hard hat.\n\nThe setting includes a small, white structure with a shingled roof next to the truck, which might be a storage outpost or a small workshop. In the background, there are other buildings, including a larger structure with a white facade and a dark roof. There are also tangled overhead wires and lush green trees further in the background, suggesting an urban or suburban environment.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the activity and industriousness of the scene, highlighting the interaction of human effort with the environment around him.","title":"Truckload of corn being checked at a grain elevator in White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy in Doniphan County in the extreme northeast corner of the state.
