{"path":"548511.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a serene moment on a sailboat named \"Kathy\" from Alexandria, VA, which is gently gliding over calm waters. The scene is set against a backdrop of a hazy, perhaps early morning or late afternoon sky, and expansive open water that fades into a misty horizon.\n\nOn the sailboat, four people are visible, each engaged in different activities, suggesting a relaxed yet active scenario typical of a sailing expedition. From left to right:\n\n1. A man standing at the stern is actively involved in what seems like adjusting or managing the sail. He wears blue swimming trunks and is shirtless, indicating warm weather. His posture and focus signal that he is possibly handling the mainsheet or another part of the boat's rigging.\n\n2. Seated towards the middle of the boat is a young boy, wearing a red and white striped T-shirt and blue shorts. He appears to be watching or learning from the man handling the sail.\n\n3. On the opposite side, a woman sits facing the rear of the boat. She sports a red, white, and blue swimsuit which suggests a patriotic theme or a holiday like the Fourth of July. Her attention is directed out toward the water or perhaps another aspect of managing the boat.\n\n4. Next to the woman and closer to the stern, another individual, with their back facing the camera, appears to be occupied with activities at the back of the boat. The person is also in a bikini with a pattern similar to the American flag, complementing the thematic attire of the other woman. \n\nThe American flag prominently displayed on the back of the boat adds a patriotic touch to the image, while a lifebuoy, some ropes, and other sailing equipment are visible, highlighting the operational and safety aspects of the sailing environment.\n\nOverall, the composition and mood of the photograph are peaceful and reflective, with a focus on leisure and the shared experience of sailing. The attire of the people and the flag suggest that this might be a special occasion, such as a national holiday celebration.","title":"Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547453","549397","549415","549386","547465","552345","547458","549410","549408","548513","544224","549399","548502","548527","549373","549411"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","boat","flag","holiday","back","sailboat","sail","manage","aspect","woman"]}
