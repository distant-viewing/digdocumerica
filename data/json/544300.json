{"path":"544300.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph features a large electrical transmission tower structure composed of numerous interconnected steel lattices. These towers are imposing and complex, with a myriad of beams and cables forming a dense grid against a clear blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a segment of a concrete bridge or platform. This structure is sturdy and utilitarian, supporting a simple railing and a flat surface, possibly for maintenance or observation.\n\nBeneath this foreground structure, there is a rugged terrain visible, characterized by mounds of deep red rocks which suggest a desert-like environment.\n\nThe scene captures a synthesis of human engineering set against natural elements, highlighting the stark contrast between the geometric precision of man-made structures and the organic forms of the natural landscape.","title":"Power line castle","placename":"Red Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Red Rock, Arizona","nn1":["544355","549110","548136","544296","553028","544405","555574","543903","553830","557298","547936","549011","557977","548145","542524","546054"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["myriad","tower","lattice","transmission","precision","engineering","form","observation","segment","cable"]}
