{"path":"546061.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural scene centered around a reflective body of water, likely a lake. In the foreground, there is a floating platform equipped with a diving board, protruding into the lake. The platform and diving board are older or weathered, hinting at regular use or long-standing placement in this location. Several signs are visible on the platform, but the exact text isn't clearly readable, likely indicating rules or safety information for using the diving board.\n\nThe background is densely populated by tall trees draped with Spanish moss, creating a quintessentially southern swamp-like or wetland ambiance. The trees are lush and thickly gathered, tower over the scene, and contribute to a slightly shadowed but vibrant environment under a partly cloudy sky. The sky above displays a light blue hue with soft white clouds.\n\nReflections in the clear, calm water beautifully mirror the trees and the blue of the sky, enhancing the overall tranquility and natural beauty of the scene. The image conveys a peaceful, untouched aspect of nature, commonly found in secluded lake areas, potentially within a forest or a protected park area. Overall, the photo captures a quiet, idyllic spot perfect for contemplation or a quiet swim.","title":"Natural gas well in the scenic Bayou Segnette.
