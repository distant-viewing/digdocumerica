{"path":"547524.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures an environmental issue, depicting a polluted water body surrounded by debris and garbage. The foreground shows dark, murky water filled with floating refuse such as pieces of plastic and other unidentifiable waste. Sparse vegetation, primarily thin grasses and reeds, protrudes from the water, partially entangled with the garbage.\n\nIn the middle ground, there's a patch of clearer water revealing more submerged trash. Alongside the water edge, more dense reeds are visible, suggesting a somewhat natural habitat struggling to exist amidst the pollution.\n\nThe background features a hill of rubbish that dominates the upper part of the composition. It is comprised of a variety of discarded materials, including large chunks of concrete, mounds of earth, and fragments of household waste. There are green areas of vegetation interspersed throughout the landfill, indicating that life persists even in such degraded environments.\n\nThe sky is relatively clear with a few clouds, contrasting with the degradation and neglect visible in the terrestrial elements of the scene. Overall, the photograph conveys a powerful message about environmental pollution and its impact on natural ecosystems.","title":"Looking from the refuse laden salt marsh to the Middletown dump on its border","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["550812","547537","552811","550352","552098","552080","551440","555228","550800","552127","550687","547907","547520","549820","544810","555848"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["reed","garbage","waste","pollution","exist","struggle","rubbish","chunk","water","household"]}
