{"path":"553060.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This image is an aerial view of a city, likely taken from an airplane. The photograph shows a dense urban area with numerous buildings of varying sizes. Several taller buildings are clustered together near the center, suggesting this might be the downtown area of the city. The city is organized in a grid pattern with streets running parallel and perpendicular to each other.\n\nIn the background, mountains are visible, adding a natural contrast to the urban landscape. The terrain surrounding the city appears relatively flat, which then rises abruptly to form these rugged mountains. The foreground and the spaces between urban developments are dotted with smaller structures, which might be residential or industrial areas.\n\nOverall, the photo captures the sprawling nature of a metropolitan city situated near mountainous terrain, showcasing both developed and natural landscapes. The colors in the photo suggest it might have been taken in the mid to late 20th century, given the film's vintage quality and color saturation.","title":"Aerial of Phoenix, Arizona.
