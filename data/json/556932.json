{"path":"556932.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a landscape that includes a large, sprawling airport set amidst heavily forested areas. The airport, with multiple wide and long runways, is clearly visible in the central part of the image and appears fully operational with runway markings and adjacent taxiways. The airport is surrounded by dense patches of dark green forests that dominate the composition, indicating a remote or less urbanized setting.\n\nIn the background, there is a wide river or lake that meanders through the scene from the left, extending into the distance towards the upper center part of the image. The body of water follows a winding course and appears calm, reflecting a muted sky. It shapes the landscape, defining the edge between the water and the land.\n\nThe photographic effects include a slightly muted color palette, with blues, greens, and earth tones subdued under a diffuse light, likely from an overcast sky. This gives the image a somewhat serene yet mysterious quality, emphasizing the isolated and natural surroundings of the airport. The overall impression is of a quiet, sparsely populated area where the airport stands out as a significant human-made structure within a predominantly natural landscape.","title":"Aerial view looking southeast across the navy's Bangor annex to dyes inlet and the tracyton-Bremerton area.
