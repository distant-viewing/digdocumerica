{"path":"543241.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image shows a man walking away from the camera along a dilapidated wooden pier. The pier seems to be in disrepair, as evidenced by the broken fences and bent metal barriers on both sides. Some sections of the fencing are entirely missing, replaced by temporary wire mesh or simply open to the sea below. The planks of the pier show weathering, and several are missing, adding to the sense of decay and neglect. The sea is visible on the left side of the pier, merging with a foggy, misty skyline that obscures the horizon, enhancing a mood of isolation and abandonment. Despite the pier's condition, the path is straightforward, leading towards a structure at the far end, barely visible due to the fog. The overall atmosphere is somber and slightly eerie, as the man walks alone in this desolate place.","title":"California--zmudowski state park","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"Zmudowski Beach State Park, California","nn1":["550310","543408","547575","551985","548105","547180","546871","551978","543320","547577","545005","547582","547594","547584","547150","547040"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["pier","missing","sea","fencing","foggy","walk","mesh","dilapidate","misty","merge"]}
