{"path":"548167.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic aerial view of a bustling railway yard adjacent to a significant water body, believed to be a river. The image reveals a panoramic vista where the river gently curves to the right of the frame, surrounded by barren, rolling hills in the distance that feature minimal vegetation, suggesting a semi-arid region. Sunlight reflects off the water’s surface, indicating this photo was likely taken on a clear day.\n\nThe railway yard below is packed with numerous railway cars, which fill virtually the entire length of the image. The cars, various in design and color, are tightly arranged on parallel tracks, illustrating a busy transit or cargo hub. Apart from the railway operations, the photograph shows a small town right next to the yard. The town seems peaceful, with modest residential buildings, some surrounded by lush green trees and gardens, contributing to a stark contrast with the surrounding dry terrain.\n\nNear the center and extending to the right side of the railway yard, there is a distinct alignment of infrastructure which could be part of the railway's logistical facilities—it includes larger buildings and possibly grain elevators, typifying an integrated community where daily life is closely tied to the railway operations. The overall composition of the photograph, with its vast, open skies, tranquility of the river, and the industrious rail yard threaded through a small community, captures a vibrant yet serene landscape illustrating a blend of nature and human activity.","title":"Railroad cars on the banks of the Columbia River at wishram Washington, with view of the Oregon shore","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["556464","547999","552063","548129","547140","546719","547265","556783","547050","557958","555887","544664","556692","556852","556382","556888"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","yard","illustrate","town","typify","river","thread","alignment","vista","community"]}
