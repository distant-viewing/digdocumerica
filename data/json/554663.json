{"path":"554663.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of a group of hikers navigating through a densely wooded forest. The time seems to be either late afternoon or evening, as suggested by the soft, muted lighting and the shadowy tones pervading the scene.\n\nThe forest is thick with a variety of trees, primarily thin, tall trunks suggesting a mature growth. The foliage displays a range of colors from green to yellow, indicating either a variation in tree species or the onset of fall. The understory is moderately dense, populated with smaller shrubs and plants which add texture to the scene.\n\nCentered in the image is a group of five individuals from behind, trekking along a narrow, leaf-strewn trail. They are equipped for hiking; some carry backpacks, and their clothing suggests they are prepared for cool weather. The group appears engaged in their hike, moving closely together, which adds a sense of camaraderie to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on nature and the subtle interaction of the hikers within this environment, evokes a sense of tranquility and the simple joys of being outdoors. The inclusion of the hikers adds a human element that contrasts with the wild, natural setting around them. This image beautifully conveys a moment of adventure and exploration in the wilderness.","title":"Backpackers and hikers on a trail in the Mount Marcy area of Lake Placid, note the width, hard-packed surface and heavy use of the trail in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554705","554662","543331","545512","543446","554502","543388","554501","554558","557005","553357","547045","554509","557206","553464","554720"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["hiker","group","onset","hike","inclusion","camaraderie","forest","backpack","hiking","leaf"]}
