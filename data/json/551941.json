{"path":"551941.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"In this photograph, we see a scene that likely involves a traffic incident or roadside interaction. The setting appears to be a sunny day on a city street.\n\nKey features and activities included in the image are:\n\n1. **People**:\n   - There are four adults involved in a discussion near a light-colored, older model car which might be from the 1960s or 1970s.\n   - Two middle-aged men, one standing outside the car wearing a striped shirt and leaning on the car door with an agitated expression, the other man, dressed in a black shirt, appears to be talking to the others.\n   - A middle-aged woman with a perm hairstyle, wearing a plaid dress, listens to the conversation.\n   - A police officer in a light blue uniform, cap, and sunglasses stands slightly apart from the group, holding some paperwork and appears to be listening or speaking.\n\n2. **Vehicle**:\n   - A vintage car in a light tan or beige color is prominently featured. The car has its driver-side door open and is parked on the street.\n\n3. **Background**:\n   - The street scene includes another blue car passing by in the background, and a tree-lined sidewalk adjacent to what appears to be a large modern building or structure, possibly an office building. The overall setting suggests an urban environment. Thereâ€™s also a metal railing which partially obscures the background.\n\nThe interaction among the individuals seems serious, possibly involving a discussion about the circumstances of a traffic violation or an accident. The presence of the police officer implies that there is an official aspect to their conversation. The clear weather and daylight conditions contribute to the visibility and color vibrancy in the photograph.","title":"Policeman questions interested parties for accident report Lake Shore Drive near Irving Park Road","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557841","557865","546654","547185","555944","547205","546637","546663","546661","548355","547706","550967","546630","557872","557874","546665"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","officer","police","discussion","listen","involve","street","paperwork","incident","accident"]}
