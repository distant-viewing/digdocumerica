{"path":"553923.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a striking scene set against a backdrop of the vast sea. The foreground is dominated by a complex structure of wooden beams and trusses, possibly part of an unfinished building or a large architectural framework, taking up most of the scene. The structure's precise and dimensional array of lines and vertices provide a geometrical visual interest.\n\nA person is positioned at the center of the image, standing on the wooden framework. They appear to be involved in some physical activity, possibly construction or inspection, as they lean forward, placing their hands on a beam, looking downwards; they seem engaged in their task. The person is dressed in casual clothing, suggestive of a labor-intensive environment.\n\nIn the distance, the calm and vast sea extends to the horizon, providing a serene contrast to the intricate foreground. The sea's deep blue is rich and consistent, suggesting a clear day. The lighting of the photograph suggests midday, given the brightness and the way shadows play on the structure, highlighting its complexity and depth.\n\nOverall, the image presents a juxtaposition of human activity within an industrial setup against the natural serenity of the ocean, encapsulating themes of development and nature.","title":"Hawaii-kai, built on a swamp and a hillside, is a fast growing area east of downtown Honolulu.
