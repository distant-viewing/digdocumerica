{"path":"550038.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The image shows a large, ornate five-story building with a distinctive architectural style that features multiple rows of large, arched windows on each floor. The facade of the building is painted in a deep red color, highlighted with darker red details around the window frames, giving the structure an elegant and imposing appearance.\n\nOn the building's exterior, two large American flags hang vertically from flagpoles. One flag is located near the center just above the entrance, and the other is positioned adjacent to it, towards the left side of the frame. The flags add a patriotic touch to the otherwise somber color palette of the building.\n\nThe main entrance to the building is visible and slightly off-center to the left in the composition. It consists of large double doors painted in the same dark red hue as the rest of the facade, flanked by smaller, paned windows. Above the entrance, a signage area, perhaps indicating the name or the purpose of the building, appears somewhat worn and less legible, adding a sense of history and age to the building.\n\nIn the background, there's a glimpse of the sky, but it is mostly overcast, creating a slightly gloomy atmosphere which contrasts with the strong architectural details and the vibrant flags. The overall composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on vertical lines and symmetrical arrangement, emphasizes the grandeur and historical significance of the building.","title":"Fulton Street, part of old wholesale market area","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550042","558146","545881","558162","548866","545870","557073","556046","553063","546329","558122","549360","557643","558130","558031","555949"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["flag","entrance","building","facade","window","flagpole","history","significance","detail","rest"]}
