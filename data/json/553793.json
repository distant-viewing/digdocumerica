{"path":"553793.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts the interior of a boat's cabin, capturing a busy and focused maritime scene. In the foreground, a man is seen piloting the boat, seated on the left side of the frame. He is wearing a casual blue shirt and white pants, and his right hand is handling the steering lever, while his left hand appears to be operating other controls or holding something small. His attention is focused on the task at hand, suggesting concentration and responsibility associated with navigating the vessel.\n\nBehind him, standing near the center and right side of the image, are two other men, also dressed in casual attire, engaged in conversation or observing the surroundings. The man in the center is highlighted by his distinctive sports sunglasses and a relaxed pose with hands on his hips, exuding an air of casual observation or oversight.\n\nThe cabin is functional in appearance, with various controls and gauges visible on the boatâ€™s dashboard, indicative of the operational complexity of the vessel. Large windows envelop the cabin, allowing ample light to fill the space and providing a clear view of the marine environment outside.\n\nThrough one of these windows, the open sea and a distant coastline featuring prominent structures can be seen, suggesting that the boat is not far from land. The overall ambiance is of an active, well-coordinated maritime journey, combining elements of navigation, observation, and communication among the crewmembers.","title":"\"sea transit\" ferry has been operating for one year between downtown Honolulu and pearl harbor - an alternative to freeway congestion.
