{"path":"547207.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a cityscape during twilight, presenting a view of rooftops against a dusky sky. The foreground features multiple industrial or residential structures, characterized by flat rooftops interspersed with various rooftop elements such as chimneys, vents, and small structures, possibly mechanical units or access points. Some rooftops show patches of snow, indicating cold weather.\n\nFurther back, the middle ground is dominated by taller buildings that stand out against the horizon, among them distinctive features like large rectangular buildings and smokestacks, hinting at an industrial part of the city. The skyline is somewhat irregular, with building heights varying, contributing to a layered and textured urban profile.\n\nThe backdrop consists of a moody sky, where the clouds are illuminated by the fading light, giving the scene a dramatic and somewhat melancholic ambiance. The sunlight appears to be reflecting off some wet surfaces on the rooftops, adding spots of brightness to the mostly dark scene.\n\nThe overall composition uses silhouette and contrast effectively, emphasizing the outlines of the buildings against the lighter sky, and creating a stark, somewhat stark and gritty urban scene.","title":"Rooftops on Chicago's North Side","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["555736","545406","544090","547107","547206","543965","548396","548383","545499","550194","544082","553821","548384","547429","548328","544660"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["rooftop","vent","building","brightness","profile","unit","twilight","access","chimney","outline"]}
