{"path":"544713.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a serene, expansive view of a bay area during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft, diffuse light and slight haze present. The focal parts of the landscape include various maritime and architectural elements against a backdrop of layered mountains.\n\nFrom the left part of the image, you can see several vessels, possibly cargo ships, docked or anchored near the shore. These ships are bulky and dark, breaking the surface of the calm blue water. Just slightly rightward, there are large industrial structures that appear to be part of a port or marine terminal, with cranes and other facilities typical for such a location.\n\nThe middle and right portions of the image are dominated by a visual extension into the distance, showing more of the bay and a series of mountains that fade gradually into the background due to atmospheric perspective. The mountains are rendered in soft blues and grays, suggesting distance and creating a serene mood.\n\nAt the right edge of the photograph, part of a bridge structure is visible, which stretches towards the mountainous horizon. This bridge, featuring distinct architectural elements like towers and suspended roadways, partially frames the scene.\n\nAbove all these, the sky occupies the upper third of the frame, hazy and imbued with a pale blue tint, possibly due to the time of day or weather conditions.\n\nThe entire scene is quiet, devoid of any visible human activity, focusing solely on the interplay of natural and man-made elements within this coastal environment. The overall composition and elements suggest a cool, tranquil coastal scene, likely captured from a high vantage point considering the encompassing view of the landscape.","title":"Richmond harbor under fog","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["545277","542804","542870","552192","547109","556905","555731","547147","542907","544383","545030","555706","544705","545022","542910","542877"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["bay","ship","bridge","part","extension","render","imbue","consider","anchor","third"]}
