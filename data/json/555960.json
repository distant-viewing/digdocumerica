{"path":"555960.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photo depicts a bustling railway station scene. The foreground shows several passengers walking or standing, some blurry, suggesting movement and a busy atmosphere. There are people of different ages and genders, some solo and others in groups. The shiny, tiled floor reflects the lights and colors of the scene, enhancing the sense of activity.\n\nIn the middle ground, a large, prominently displayed Amtrak logo hangs above between archways that lead to various tracks, indicated by letters such as C, D, G, and H displayed over each archway. Beneath these signs, there are benches where more passengers are seated, some looking at the tracks, while others seem to be waiting or resting.\n\nThe background is characterized by muted tones and soft lighting, giving a warm ambience to the station. Architectural details include high ceilings and decorated arches, typical of traditional railway stations. Digital clocks and information boards provide passengers with time and possibly train schedules, located centrally above each corresponding archway to the train gates.\n\nThis scene captures a typical moment of transit in an Amtrak railway station, illustrating the motion and diversity of commuter life. The composition balances activity and structure, with central depth leading the viewerâ€™s eye from the busy floor to the architectural features and signage in the station.","title":"Interior of the Los Angeles Union Passenger Terminal built for the 1932 Summer Olympics held in that California city.
