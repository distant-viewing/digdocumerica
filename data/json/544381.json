{"path":"544381.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"In this photograph, a group of approximately seven people is engaged in pushing a medium-sized boat into a lake. The setting is an outdoor environment with a sandy shoreline leading into calm, blue water. The individuals involved in the activity appear to be working together; some are in the water while others are on the edge of the shoreline, all pushing against the hull of the boat.\n\nThe boat is white with a tan stripe and has its bow pointing towards the water, indicating they are either launching it or possibly retrieving it from the water. It has a windshield and is possibly a motorboat.\n\nThe people in the photograph display a range of attire that suggests a casual, warm setting, likely a day of leisure or recreation at the lake. There's a mix of short-sleeved shirts, hats, and shorts, with one individual noticeably wearing a bright pink cap. The expressions and gestures suggest effort and coordination in their task.\n\nThe background shows an expanse of the lake with gently rippling water, reflecting the light and contributing to a serene and peaceful ambiance, complemented by a clear sky overhead.","title":"Launching at Lake Powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["551310","544122","552982","548054","546352","546302","544980","553405","552283","554177","553406","545223","550236","543944","543943","551228"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["lake","boat","shoreline","coordination","pointing","water","windshield","motorboat","overhead","gesture"]}
