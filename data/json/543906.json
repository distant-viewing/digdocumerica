{"path":"543906.jpg","date":"March 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between two individuals in what appears to be a caregiving setting. The image features an elderly man and a younger woman, who seems to be a nurse, sitting close to each other. The elderly man has prominent facial hair and wears a white sweater; he looks towards the viewer with a serious expression. The nurse, dressed in a white medical uniform and wearing an ID badge on her waist, has short dark hair and a contemplative or slightly worried expression on her face. She appears to be listening or talking to the man.\n\nThe environment suggests an indoor setting, possibly in a medical or care facility, evidenced by the sterile colors and blurred out figures and shapes in the background, which hint at other patients or medical equipment. The emotional tone of the photo is somewhat somber and intimate, highlighting the closeness and possible concern of the nurse for the elderly man. The overall composition and natural light focus on the interaction between these two individuals, drawing attention to their facial expressions and the connection between them.","title":"A nurse helps an elderly patient leave Louisville memorial hospital.
