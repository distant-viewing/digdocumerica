{"path":"554227.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a moment on a sunny winter day with an individual walking along a snowy sidewalk. The man is dressed in a casual, wintry outfit comprising dark slacks, a blue jacket, and brown shoes, and accessorized with a belt and sunglasses. He is deeply engrossed in reading a newspaper he holds open in both hands.\n\nThe setting is a residential neighborhood. Snow patches cover the grass around, and thereâ€™s snow piled up neatly along the sides of the sidewalk, indicating recent shoveling. Trees mostly bare of leaves, suggest it's late in the winter season. The background features a mix of traditional houses, bare winter trees, and parked cars, indicating a peaceful suburban atmosphere. The photograph exhibits a calm, routine day in a community, focusing on an individual's engagement with current events through the newspaper. The lighting suggests it might be midday, as the sunlight is bright and direct, enhancing the shadows on the ground.","title":"Catching up on the news","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["552749","556603","545510","547820","547816","554223","551481","556775","551970","547310","554229","554258","547388","557408","547067","546423"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["winter","newspaper","sidewalk","snow","slack","midday","belt","shoe","sunglass","neighborhood"]}
