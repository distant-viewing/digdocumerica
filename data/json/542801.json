{"path":"542801.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene pastoral scene featuring a large white farmhouse on a rural property. The house, which appears to be two stories tall with a brightly lit porch, is positioned slightly left of the center in the image. A small outbuilding is visible to the left of the main house, possibly used for storage or as a workshop.\n\nIn the foreground, a wooden fence runs parallel to the viewer, lining a grassy field populated with various cows grazing and moving leisurely. This fenced area stretches across most of the front of the photo and appears to be an active part of the farm used for livestock.\n\nTo the right, there is a large red barn, typical in design for rural farm settings, contributing to the agricultural ambiance of the scene. The background features rolling hills dotted with trees and additional greenery, suggesting a lush, rural landscape. Overhead, utility lines stretch across the sky, indicating the integration of modern utilities in this otherwise tranquil, natural setting.\n\nThe lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, providing a warm glow that enhances the pastoral quality of the scene. The overall composition emphasizes a peaceful, productive farm environment, nestled in a verdant, hilly area.","title":"Organic farm reclaimed from swamp","placename":"Eel River (Calif.)","location":"Eel River, California","nn1":["555635","556963","554767","551305","557946","547289","547309","548065","549256","547658","554819","555577","556959","551333","547293","547288"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["farm","pastoral","utility","outbuilding","farmhouse","verdant","cow","integration","graze","house"]}
