{"path":"550676.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a dramatic and somewhat somber industrial scene under an overcast sky. The primary subjects of the image are two large factory smokestacks emitting thick smoke into the sky. The smoke merges with the cloudy sky, creating a continuous flow of dark hues that add a sense of heaviness to the atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, multiple power lines run diagonally across the frame, suggesting the presence of electricity and adding a layer of depth and complexity to the composition. These lines intersect the image and lead the viewerâ€™s eye towards the factory in the background.\n\nThe factory itself appears to be large and complex, with several visible structures including buildings and additional smokestacks. The industrial complex is bathed in shadows, enhancing the moody and polluted environment. The color palette consists mostly of dark purples and blues, reinforcing the gloomy and foreboding mood captured in this industrial setting.","title":"Chimneys of the brown paper company mill, one of Berlin's major industries","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550333","550328","550982","550195","557218","545447","550172","550983","550344","550981","545439","542999","550168","546908","545446","550336"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["factory","smokestack","forebod","smoke","electricity","gloomy","pollute","merge","purple","intersect"]}
