{"path":"551740.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph prominently features a blooming flower tree, possibly a type of cherry or apple tree, filled with white blossoms in the foreground. The branches of the tree are spread out, densely packed with clusters of small white flowers, each with a visible yellow center. The foliage of the tree is not very dense, allowing the flowers to be the main focus.\n\nBehind the tree, there is an apartment building that rises in the background, forming a contrasting backdrop to the natural foreground. The building is of modern design, characterized by a vertical orientation, multiple stories, and a grid-like pattern of windows and balconies. The exterior of the building appears to be clad in light-colored, possibly beige brick or facade, and each balcony is rimmed with a railing, which is hard to discern in detail due to focus on the tree.\n\nThe balconies are staggered and there are visible elements of plants and possibly outdoor furniture, suggesting a residential use of the space. The natural light and composition create a juxtaposition between urban living and natural beauty, emphasizing a springtime theme.","title":"Crab apple in full bloom at Fifth Avenue and 79th Street in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550033","551741","550035","543551","546533","545720","551644","554590","546497","551652","545726","557257","551653","546534","551781","551685"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["balcony","flower","tree","blossom","orientation","furniture","apartment","living","grid","exterior"]}
