{"path":"557026.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and somewhat atmospheric scene of a small village or settlement surrounded by woodland. The setting is characterized by a series of modest, wooden structures which include small houses and sheds. Many of these buildings have a traditional log cabin design, suggesting a rural environment, possibly in a mountainous or forested area.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a fenced yard containing a white horse and a few scattered bushes, hinting at some form of domesticated life. The middle ground shows several small cabins with different orientations. Some of these buildings have piles of chopped firewood stacked against their walls, emphasizing the community's reliance on wood for heating. A noticeable feature in this part of the photo is the white smoke rising in the background, possibly from a chimney or an outdoor fire, contributing to the overall pastoral and serene atmosphere, yet also evoking a sense of ongoing daily activity.\n\nThe properties vary in their state of upkeep, with some looking more maintained than others. Laundry is hanging outside one cabin, indicating the presence of daily life and human activity. The greenery surrounding the buildings is lush, further enhancing the rural charm of the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is somewhat muted and misty, likely either due to the weather conditions at the time the photo was taken or from the smoke that permeates the air, potentially from wood stoves or a communal fire. This mist contributes to a serene, isolated feel, enveloping the settlement in a quiet, timeless fog. The image has an evocative quality, capturing both the simplicity and the resilience of life in this secluded setting.","title":"Typical year-round dwellings of berry pickers who live along Highway #305 on Bainbridge Island. Increased land use pressure is expected in rural areas like this when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby. A \"new city\" is proposed to house a substantial portion of the projected 27,000 people who will move into the area when the naval installation is completed.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["554413","557025","544865","554401","551076","557947","546149","554084","551111","558102","556472","545233","551101","556580","550311","557691"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cabin","settlement","fire","reliance","stove","heating","wood","upkeep","smoke","village"]}
