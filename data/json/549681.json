{"path":"549681.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a street scene in what appears to be a European city. Centered in the background, there is a large, ornate archway leading into a courtyard, topped by a majestic dome adorned with sculptures and decorative elements. The dome's surface has a green patina possibly due to oxidized copper, which contrasts with the stone architecture surrounding it.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is walking towards the camera. He is dressed in a patterned shirt, sunglasses, and light-colored trousers. His posture and stride suggest he is moving confidently down the street. Behind him, there are cars and pedestrians, suggesting a lively city atmosphere. Among the vehicles, there's a vintage car with people inside, which adds a touch of historical or classic flair to the setting.\n\nThe scene also includes a glimpse of daily life and commerce. Visible on the left, there's a sign for a parfumerie. Various people can be seen walking and conversing, adding to the bustling urban environment. The architecture of the buildings framing the scene is traditional, with detailed facades and European-style embellishments.\n\nOverall, the image captures a richly detailed urban moment, blending historical architecture with the everyday life of the city's inhabitants and visitors.","title":"Kohlmarkt Street, famous for its silversmith shops and cafes, ends at Michaeles Tor, the main gate to the imperial palace of the Hapsburgs.","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551786","549660","551788","549659","551790","549646","551864","551804","551911","549991","557656","549676","551493","549662","551870","551849"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["dome","architecture","city","courtyard","inhabitant","flair","embellishment","archway","stride","sculpture"]}
