{"path":"544160.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an industrial mining site. In the foreground, a worker stands on a metal platform. He is dressed in a work uniform, including a grey jacket and pants, and is equipped with a safety helmet which has a light attached to it. He appears to be handling or adjusting some form of equipment, possibly for communication or measurement, held in his hands.\n\nTo the worker's side, there is a large metal box which is part of the infrastructure and probably used for storing tools or equipment. The platform on which he stands overlooks a vast, rugged landscape scattered with large piles of dark rocks or coal.\n\nIn the background, two large, heavy dump trucks are visible, moving across the terrain. These trucks are laden with material, suggested by the dust and debris they're kicking up as they move. The environment is overwhelmingly dusty and barren, giving the scene an intense industrial feel.\n\nThe sky is bright and mostly clear, illuminating the scene with natural light that contrasts with the dark colors of the ground and the industrial equipment. This setting portrays a typical day at a large, open-pit mining operation, emphasizing the scale and rough nature of the work.","title":"Navajo workmen at the Peabody Coal Company","placename":"Black Mesa (Navajo County and Apache County, Ariz.)","location":"Black Mesa, Arizona","nn1":["556329","544386","543639","556893","544139","554765","544135","544165","544099","544161","556518","556358","544107","556903","552418","549245"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["mining","equipment","platform","worker","truck","dump","measurement","pit","communication","coal"]}
