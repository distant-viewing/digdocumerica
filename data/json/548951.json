{"path":"548951.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph shows a warning sign prominently positioned in the foreground on dirt ground. The sign reads: \"UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL KEEP OUT - RADIOLOGICAL RESEARCH PROPOSAL FARM - EPA\". It is written in bold, black letters against a white background. To the right of the sign is a dirt road with a shadow falling onto it that appears to be cast by the sign itself. Beyond the road, there are several scattered industrial structures, including what looks like tanks or silos. A distant landscape is visible in the background with clear skies and a few sparse hills, evoking a remote or isolated setting. The overall look of the photo suggests a restricted or controlled area likely used for experimental purposes.","title":"Experimental farm operated by EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549129","543645","555858","549357","555856","553905","557412","557474","548845","546240","548836","555647","548865","546303","544845","552212"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","dirt","warning","silo","research","road","letter","look","purpose","tank"]}
