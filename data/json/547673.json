{"path":"547673.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a landscape scene with multiple layers of activities and backgrounds. In the foreground, there is a large field, which appears to be barren or recently harvested, with dry brown earth visible. This scene is potentially viewed from a higher vantage point given the perspective on distant objects.\n\nIn the middle ground, there are various buildings that form a small urban area. These include both residential structures, which are average in size and fairly close together, and commercial buildings such as a large industrial warehouse. This area has a good amount of greenery interspersed among the buildings, suggesting it is a fairly well-established community. \n\nVisibly striking in the photograph is the presence of thick black smoke in the background, which appears to be rising aggressively into the sky, suggesting a large fire or industrial incident. The smoke is dense and widespread, covering a significant portion of the sky above the town.\n\nIn the very back, partially obscured by the smoke but still distinguishable, is the silhouette of a large suspension bridge with noticeable white towers, which connects over a body of water or valley. This bridge adds a structural and geometric element to the composition.\n\nThe scene overall captures a juxtaposition between a peaceful town and an urgent, potentially hazardous event in the background, which could evoke a sense of concern or curiosity about the source and impact of the smoke. The natural and built environments are starkly contrasted with the industrial or emergency activity occurring.","title":"Long a center of Navy activities, Newport is the home of the Naval War College.
