{"path":"557057.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene, presumably during an event, in what appears to be a park or parade route specified by a sign as \"Prairie Parkway.\" The image features a large group of spectators gathered next to a historical marker for Kansas, which describes the location as a \"Landmark of Distinction.\" The people, varied in age and clothing, are sitting and standing around the marker, some on a stone wall and others on folding chairs or standing. The spectators are dressed in typical casual wear from around the 1960s or 1970s, suggesting the photo's vintage.\n\nThere are two vehicles prominently in the foreground of the photograph—a brown station wagon and a gold possible sedan—both having a classic American car design, which aligns with the era. The cars are facing opposite directions, indicating they might be parked or momentarily stopped.\n\nThe background includes lush, leafy trees, providing a sense of a summer setting with the sunlight diffused through the foliage. Visible overhead signs mark the location as \"Prairie Parkway,\" reinforcing the setting in a park or a designated route for perhaps a parade or public gathering.\n\nThis scene captures a moment of community gathering, likely in anticipation or observation of an event, characterized by a casual and relaxed atmosphere.","title":"People congregate in the town square in cottonwood falls Kansas, near Emporia, waiting for the parade to pass.
