{"path":"552145.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural landscape featuring expansive mudflats at low tide. The mudflats display an intricate pattern of water channels and sediment, highlighted with different shades of blue, brown, and grey, creating a mesmerizing texture across the surface. A prominent feature in the photograph is a large flock of white birds scattered across the mudflats, their bright plumage starkly contrasting with the darker tones of the mud and water.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by a dramatic mountain range with peaks visibly capped with snow, suggesting a cooler climate or high altitude. The sky above the mountains is clear and a crisp blue, indicating a likely sunny day. This backdrop adds a majestic and serene feeling to the overall composition.\n\nThe photograph, taken from an elevated angle, possibly from a hillside or a low-flying aircraft, offers a sweeping view that emphasizes the vastness and beauty of the natural environment. The composition of the image, with its significant horizontal layers of mudflat, water, mountains, and sky, leads the eye smoothly from the foreground to the distant mountains, illustrating a quiet yet dynamic ecosystem.","title":"Snow geese in flight over stillaguamish river estuary on puget sound near stanwood","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552147","552910","542869","553867","544729","545656","544687","545183","552236","545294","550402","550399","550592","550403","544834","555683"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mudflat","mountain","flock","plumage","tide","fly","aircraft","mud","channel","sediment"]}
