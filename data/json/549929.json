{"path":"549929.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The image captures a lively scene at an urban waterfront area during a sunny day. In the foreground, a woman and three children are walking along a boardwalk. The woman, wearing a red top and dark shorts, holds hands with a young girl in a colorful dress. Behind them, two young children walk closely together; one wears a white shirt with red shorts and the other wears a blue shirt with red shorts. They seem cheerful and are probably enjoying a walk or a day out in the area.\n\nThe boardwalk is busy with people engaged in various activities. To the right, there are several people sunbathing on benches and on the walkway itself. One woman, dressed in a blue swimsuit, lies on a bench, while others in swimsuits and summer attire relax nearby.\n\nIn the background, an industrial setting is visible, characterized by large brick and metal buildings with many windows. One prominent building has \"HUGHES INC.\" written across the side, indicating a commercial or industrial business. The scene also includes a mixture of old and new architectural elements, like steel structures that possibly support or are part of infrastructure related to docks or warehouses.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is vibrant yet relaxed, with a hint of the area's industrial backdrop providing a unique contrast to the leisure activities of the people present.","title":"Young students learn about their city as teachers guide them on a tour through Morton Street Pier on the Hudson River.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546219","550228","555948","549329","545176","549910","546955","551711","546145","544185","551959","546797","550937","557272","555945","557772"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["boardwalk","swimsuit","short","bench","woman","child","walk","people","walkway","warehouse"]}
