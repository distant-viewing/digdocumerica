{"path":"542648.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a group of four individuals, likely a family, involved in an outdoor activity that appears to be fishing. The setting is a grassy area with an atmospheric haze in the background, potentially mist or pollution, that partially obscures a large, concrete structure, possibly a bridge or dam.\n\nFrom left to right, the first individual is a woman dressed in a plaid, flannel jacket and jeans, carrying a tackle box and a fishing rod. Following her is a young girl, also holding a fishing rod and wearing a dark jacket and jeans. Next is a young boy dressed in a white t-shirt and jeans, who seems to be carrying a fishing net. Lastly, there's a man in a black t-shirt and dark pants, also holding a fishing rod and a tackle box. The group walks on a dirt path, and they all appear focused on the activity ahead.\n\nThe environmental setting, particularly the foggy backdrop and large concrete structure, suggests that the location is near a water body and an industrial area, contributing to the somber ambiance and hinting at the ruggedness of the terrain and activity. The casual clothing and equipment carried by all participants highlight a leisure outing centered around fishing.","title":"Girl carries 18\" rainbow trout","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["548737","543164","551410","550848","544223","549935","542564","554517","546800","552821","553081","551430","543516","551390","542560","548190"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","rod","jean","box","flannel","jacket","ruggedness","dam","group","net"]}
