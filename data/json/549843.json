{"path":"549843.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an urban street scene. At the forefront, there's a tree surrounded by a makeshift circle of concrete blocks, bricks, and debris. The area around the tree is littered with various items including discarded paper, plastic bags, an old chair, and fragments of other unidentifiable litter. Patches of grass or weeds are visible, growing sporadically around the bricks and on the pavement.\n\nThe paved street adjacent to this tree shows signs of wear and tear, with visible stains and dirt. There seems to be some water accumulation forming a puddle on the street. The concrete sidewalk and the gutter are also cluttered with garbage and debris, which includes paper, plastics, and other discarded items.\n\nThe photograph captures a desolate and neglected atmosphere, highlighted by the random deposition of trash and the poorly maintained urban setting. There's a seemingly abandoned feel to the place, devoid of human presence in the scene, enhancing the solitary and forlorn aura captured in the image.","title":"Littered sidewalks and curbing on Manhattan's 172nd street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549786","549784","549785","552750","557345","552102","549944","544648","550253","544640","550264","557350","548214","550246","543165","549833"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["plastic","litter","discard","street","paper","deposition","brick","item","aura","weed"]}
