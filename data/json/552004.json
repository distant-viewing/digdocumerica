{"path":"552004.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, barren industrial area, which appears to be a mining site or an excavation area. The terrain is mostly flat and features various shades of brown, beige, and dusty pink, indicating perhaps clay or a similar material. There are visible tracks and patches of darker soil mixed throughout the area, suggesting recent movement or activity. The surface appears dry and cracked in places, adding to the desolate feel of the landscape.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a rugged edge leading down to the flat expanse, with some sparse vegetation like grass and small bush on the edge. In the middle of the site, several mounds of earth are piled up, with heavy machinery and a few vehicles scattered around, indicating ongoing work. The vehicles look small against the vastness of the space, emphasizing the scale of the site.\n\nIn the distance, the background features a more urban setting with residential or industrial buildings visible on the horizon, suggesting the proximity of this site to a populated area. The sky is partly cloudy with ample daylight, which brightly illuminates the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a stark contrast between industrial activity and its immediate surroundings, highlighting the impact of such operations on the landscape.","title":"Clay pits, once one of the major industries of the Woodbridge Township area, now abandoned.","placename":"New Jersey","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554765","552422","554804","547225","545677","545533","554764","554811","555614","544390","555634","544498","544139","554836","550574","542513"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["site","clay","pink","crack","edge","mound","excavation","vehicle","proximity","mining"]}
