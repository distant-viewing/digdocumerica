{"path":"545623.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph portrays a striking landscape view predominantly taken up by what seems to be a large salt flat or a similar mineral-rich body of shallow water. The composition is separated into distinct horizontal layers which add depth and structure to the scene.\n\nThe foreground prominently features a textured and shimmering surface of the salt flat, reflecting light and showcasing varied shades of white and light gray. This creates a visually intriguing and somewhat abstract aspect, with the rough texture becoming slightly darker as it recedes towards the middle of the image.\n\nIn the midsection, the image depicts several parallel ridges, likely created by the extraction processes or natural shifts in the mineral layers. These lines add an industrial feeling to the otherwise natural scene. There is also a distinct brownish dirt track or road running adjacent to these ridges, indicating human activity and access through the area.\n\nFurther emphasizing the human presence, a small grouping of vehicles is visible, which appear to be some sort of heavy machinery or trucks commonly used in mining or large-scale agriculture. They are positioned on one of the brown tracks, awaiting or engaged in activity.\n\nIn the background, rising from the salt flat, is a layer of reddish-brown dirt or rock, contrasting sharply with the predominantly white and gray color palette of the flat. This backdrop hints at a more rugged natural terrain beyond the meticulously structured foreground.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a stunning interaction between human activity and natural mineral formations, presented through a vivid play of textures and colors. The image can evoke considerations of nature, industry, and the subtle beauty found in utilitarian landscapes.","title":"Setting ponds of the Texas gulf sulphur company's potash division plant located between Moab and the Canyonlands National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["543644","555865","553867","544721","555883","548703","544418","546110","544774","554817","551557","544778","549170","555845","555863","546208"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["salt","flat","mineral","ridge","layer","brownish","await","grouping","track","consideration"]}
