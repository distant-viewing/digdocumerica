{"path":"555208.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph displays a rugged, deforested landscape, most likely the result of logging activity. The scene is set in a sloping terrain filled with numerous pieces of timber, branches, and tree trunks scattered messily across the ground. The sharp and broken wooden fragments cover much of the soil, indicating recent logging work or natural disturbances.\n\nJust beyond the massive accumulation of wood debris, the background features live, dense forests standing on the edges of the cleared area, hinting at the contrast between the disturbed site and the untouched natural environment. Tall trees in the background form a dark, dense curtain of greenery, framing the scene of environmental interruption.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is somewhat bleak and stark, highlighting human impact on natural forest landscapes. The absence of any human figures or machinery in the photo focuses the viewer's attention fully on the consequences of such activities rather than the process itself.","title":"Stream in a clear-cut area in the Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
