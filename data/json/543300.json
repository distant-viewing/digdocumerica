{"path":"543300.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning coastal landscape from a high vantage point, offering a panoramic view that spans a stretch of ocean along a rugged coastline. The scene is primarily dominated by the dynamic interface between the sea and the land. The ocean is a deep blue and is peppered with whitecaps, suggesting a breezy day with active wave action.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there is a steep cliff face that descends dramatically to an unspoiled sandy beach. The beach curves gently and appears deserted, highlighting a sense of remote natural beauty. The sand is a pale, golden color, contrasting with both the deep blues of the ocean and the darker, rocky outcrops that punctuate the coastline.\n\nThe vegetation on the cliff is sparse but hardy, typical of coastal flora, comprising low bushes and grasses that are adapted to the salty, windy environment. These plants add a touch of greenery to the otherwise earthy tones of the cliff.\n\nFurther along the coast, the terrain becomes more rugged and mountainous. There are additional rock formations visible both in the water and on the land, contributing to the wild, natural character of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with the vast expanse of water on one side and the imposing cliffs on the other, creates a dramatic contrast and conveys a sense of solitude and the grand scale of nature. The coastline gently recedes into the haze towards the horizon, where it meets a sky that matches the blue of the sea but is slightly lighter, possibly due to mist or sea spray in the air.","title":"California--Big Sur coastline","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["553775","543328","543085","545125","543061","545934","543184","543297","543374","543309","545129","543424","545226","543090","543430","545122"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","coastline","ocean","blue","sea","beach","pepper","descend","interface","wild"]}
