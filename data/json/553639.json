{"path":"553639.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a lone worker in a rugged, terrain-charred landscape following what might be a forest fire or similar natural event. The worker, clad in practical outdoor attire including a dark jacket, blue jeans, and sturdy boots, is actively using a tool—possibly a shovel or a similar digging instrument—to work on the scorched earth. He is wearing a red safety helmet which suggests an element of professional engagement, possibly related to forestry or land management activities.\n\nIn the immediate background, the devastation of the forest is evident with stark, burned tree trunks standing against a backdrop of a sparse forest and gray skies which convey a gloomy ambiance. There's no foliage on trees near the worker, reflecting the extent of damage to the area. Further into the background, some green trees that managed to survive or are far from the zone of destruction are visible, providing a stark contrast to the foreground. The terrain is uneven, muddy, and covered with remnants of underbrush and debris, indicating recent heavy activity or aftermath.\n\nThe scene suggests a remote, possibly secluded area focused on recovery or analysis post-disaster, with the worker playing an active role in either clearing, rehabilitating, or assessing the damage to the land. The presence of a solitary worker also hints at the scale of the task at hand, emphasizing both isolation and the magnitude of human effort required in the face of natural calamities.","title":"In August 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora, California. Salvage operations on acreage owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California, began promptly. A forester chips the base of a tree to inspect cambium (a protective layer between bark and inner wood). If this is damaged, the tree cannot survive and will be marked to cut.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553611","553596","553598","545269","550251","545258","553614","553597","553635","556445","553599","553624","542771","553600","542716","554437"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["worker","damage","forest","magnitude","recovery","extent","analysis","devastation","shovel","land"]}
