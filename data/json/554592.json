{"path":"554592.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of the bark of a tree, highlighting its textured, rugged surface. The bark's appearance is characterized by its rough, deeply grooved pattern, which is covered in patches of a lighter colored lichen or moss, giving it a speckled appearance. The contrasts in color between the dark bark and the light moss are pronounced. A gray, slightly curved metal or plastic cable runs vertically alongside the tree, partially blending in with the dark tones of the bark but distinct in its smooth, non-textured surface. The background is softly blurred with hints of a natural, wooded environment, suggesting that the photo was taken in a forested area. The overall focus and lighting emphasize the detailed texture of the tree bark and the interplay of natural elements.","title":"Fungus on a dead beech tree in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York state","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553587","554974","551355","544662","553586","557616","545288","545292","550703","550792","557621","542749","542774","543488","555001","555181"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","moss","groove","lichen","pronounce","appearance","cable","plastic","surface","interplay"]}
