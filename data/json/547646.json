{"path":"547646.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an evocative nature scene highlighted by contrasting elements. The focus is on small, delicate white flowers with bright yellow centers, floating above what appears to be a dark body of water. The flowers are dispersed at varying distances from the viewer, giving the scene a layered depth. To the right, a large, rough-textured grey rock serves as a significant, solid component of the composition, occupying a substantial part of the frame. \n\nThe rock's surface is rugged and irregular, displaying shadows and patches of sunlight. The dark, possibly reflective surface of the water creates an illusion that the flowers are suspended mid-air as their shadows and reflections are not clearly visible, which accentuates their ethereal appearance. The overall ambiance is serene, highlighted by natural elements and a sense of tranquility. The background is quite dark and unobtrusive, ensuring the viewer's attention remains on the interplay between the rock and the delicate flowers above the shadowy water.","title":"Bluets and Boulder","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["543195","544894","547635","553997","545279","545718","557618","542969","547642","545703","543199","544435","544875","543623","549228","544443"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","rock","viewer","component","shadow","surface","interplay","water","mid","air"]}
