{"path":"554412.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor rural scene where an individual is engaged in the process of gathering and loading wood. In the foreground, various logs of different sizes, freshly cut with visible rings and bark, are scattered on the ground. Some of the logs are piled up, while others lay strewn around the dirt and leaf-covered terrain. The central focus of the image is a person dressed in a rugged outfit, including a blue jacket and jeans, bending over as they load logs into the back of a vintage pickup truck. The person is wearing a bright red hat, which adds a pop of color to the otherwise subdued, earthy tones of the scene.\n\nThe pickup truck is colored in shades of blue and grey and appears to be from an older model, judging by its classic design and rounded edges. The bed of the truck is partially filled with logs, indicating that the task of wood collection is underway.\n\nIn the background stands a small, white house with a dark roof and a porch, suggesting a domestic setting nestled within a wooded area. Trees with bare branches envelop the scene, creating an impression of a chilly or autumnal season.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of rural life and labor, emphasizing themes of self-sufficiency and the rustic outdoor environment. The subdued lighting and natural setting contribute to a serene yet industrious atmosphere.","title":"Woodsman at big moose unloading hardwood logs (mostly beech) to be sawed and split for firewood","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["543588","554411","544767","554413","553631","555470","552583","555472","553612","554416","555154","542856","542855","554942","542596","558315"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","pickup","truck","self","wood","pop","ring","loading","leaf","person"]}
