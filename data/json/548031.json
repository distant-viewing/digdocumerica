{"path":"548031.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a prominent road sign reading \"COLUMBIA RIVER\" mounted on a white pole. The sign is rectangular with a white background and bold, black lettering. The background of the image provides a natural setting, showing the blurred silhouettes of trees and what appears to be a hint of a distant river or water body. The trees have dense foliage and are likely in a lush area, hinting that the location is possibly near the river indicated by the sign. The sky behind the sign and trees appears to be overcast, suggesting a bright yet cloudy day. The composition focuses sharply on the sign, making it the clear subject of the photo, with a blurred natural scene serving as a backdrop.","title":"The Columbia River at Cathlamet","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548140","550660","549517","548063","544262","552076","542567","549010","544239","551962","543724","554038","555214","548209","556943","550624"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","river","lettering","tree","subject","pole","silhouette","foliage","hint","location"]}
