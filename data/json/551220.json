{"path":"551220.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene of a body of water, likely a lake, under a dusky sky. The water surface glitters with reflections that resemble countless tiny sparkles, possibly due to the low angle of the sun or another light source off-camera. On the water, three small boats are visible; one on the left and two towards the middle and right of the frame. Each boat appears equipped with an outboard motor and is riding low in the water, suggesting they might be engaged in leisure activities such as fishing.\n\nThe background features a dark, distant treeline that spans the horizon, creating a silhouette effect against the sky, which itself is rendered in deep tones, indicating the photo was taken either during twilight or under heavy overcast conditions. The overall atmosphere evoked by this photograph is serene and picturesque, characterized by a sense of quiet and the subtle interplay of light and shadow.","title":"Float plane lifts off in the late afternoon on the main Osage arm of Lake of the Ozarks near Bagnell Dam.
