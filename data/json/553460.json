{"path":"553460.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph vividly portrays an industrial setting with natural elements in the foreground. In the center of the image, the Fitchburg Paper Company mill dominates the view. The multi-storied brick building features long rows of windows and has two tall chimneys, from which white smoke is emitting, suggesting ongoing industrial activity. The building sits beside a calm body of water which reflects its image, adding a serene quality to the otherwise industrial scene.\n\nThe foreground of the image has rustic autumnal tones with tall, dried grasses and some shrubbery, creating a contrast between the natural environment and the man-made structures. A large tree on the left side partially frames the scene, its trunk visibly textured, leading up to thin branches that are losing leaves, indicating it might be late fall.\n\nThe overall composition uses the reflection in the water and the natural framing of trees to blend industrial and natural themes, suggesting a harmony or coexistence between the environment and industry. The lighting suggests it could be late afternoon based on the soft shadows and the clarity of the light.","title":"Fitchburg paper company, a major polluter of the Nashua river","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553461","552194","553451","545996","550814","557377","553399","554630","547519","546236","546118","543813","557376","550818","552040","557225"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["lose","harmony","shrubbery","mill","coexistence","framing","dry","clarity","chimney","trunk"]}
