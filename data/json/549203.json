{"path":"549203.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of road construction or maintenance in a rugged, hilly environment. Several heavy construction vehicles, mainly consisting of bulldozers and motor graders, are lined up along a dusty, unpaved road. The machinery predominantly displays a yellow color, which is typical for construction equipment.\n\nThe background features slopes with sparse vegetation, primarily small shrubs and coniferous trees, which indicates that the location might be in a semi-arid or mountainous zone. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting either an early or late day timeframe when this photograph was taken.\n\nThe road on which these vehicles are stationed winds gently to the left and then disappears into the distance, illustrating some of the challenging terrain that these machines are possibly working to improve. The setting is quite isolated, with no visible buildings or other structures, emphasizing the focus on the construction activity within a natural landscape. The composition of the photograph, with the arrangement of machines and the curvature of the road, directs the viewer's eye along the path that the road takes through the hills.","title":"Construction vehicles at railroad construction site in Sarpy Basin.
