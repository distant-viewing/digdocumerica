{"path":"553472.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban setting showing two old, somewhat dilapidated buildings side by side under clear blue skies. The architecture of the buildings suggests they are residential and likely date back to the early 20th century. The building on the left is a row house constructed with notable architectural features such as ornamental cornices and columns around the entrance, though the front door and windows are boarded up, hinting at abandonment or disrepair. The building on the right also features brick construction and includes a second-story balcony with iron railings. This building has visible signs indicating vacancies and information about new management and availability for rent.\n\nIn front of these buildings, there is a sedan car parked on the street, partially obstructing the view of the left building's lower portion. The street and sidewalk appear worn, reinforcing the sense of an older, perhaps economically struggling neighborhood. Signs and windows on the buildings convey a narrative of transition or neglect, common in urban areas undergoing change. The contrast between the sunny sky and the condition of the buildings evokes a poignant atmosphere of past prosperity and present decline.","title":"Mulky Square is a neighborhood in the west side of Kansas City, an area of low-income dwellings.
