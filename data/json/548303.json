{"path":"548303.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of four people gathered around an old white station wagon in an outdoor, natural setting. The vehicle appears weathered, with visible rust and wear, and is parked on a gravel surface surrounded by greenery, suggesting a countryside location.\n\nOn the left, a boy with blond hair and freckles is dressed casually in a light grey sleeveless top and bright yellow pants. He is standing with his hands on his hips and a mildly serious expression, looking towards the camera.\n\nNext to him, a taller, young man stands prominently in the foreground, holding what looks like a mug in his right hand. He has curly dark hair and is wearing a long-sleeve, dark blue shirt with wide collars, bell-bottom pants, and is barefoot. His expression is neutral as he gazes off to the side, not directly at the camera.\n\nIn the center but a bit to the back, another young man is perched on the bumper of the car, largely obscured by the central figure in the foreground. He wears a striped T-shirt and dark trousers, with his left arm reaching up towards his face.\n\nTo the right, an older man leans against the hood of the car. He wears a plaid red and white shirt, a dark baseball cap, and brown trousers, with a rugged, outdoorsy look. He smiles slightly as he looks directly at the camera, adding a warm, inviting feel to the group.\n\nThe background features tall trees and dense shrubs, accentuating the rural atmosphere of the setting. Two pairs of shoes lie on the ground in the foreground, indicating a relaxed or impromptu gathering. The overall feel of the image is casual, capturing a moment of these individuals possibly enjoying a break or a leisurely day in a natural environment.","title":"Fisherman and family at Owl Bayou on Highway 51 between LaPlace and Manchac.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["548306","554479","557004","554872","543947","543856","557684","546093","554543","544389","553117","552615","546092","544361","545225","552585"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["trouser","camera","mug","look","hip","bell","bumper","countryside","shirt","pant"]}
