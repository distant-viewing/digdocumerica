{"path":"551245.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, outdoor waste disposal area, commonly known as a dump. The scene is cluttered with a variety of discarded objects spreading over an expansive area, which extends towards a forested background under a partly cloudy sky. Visible items include numerous pieces of household waste such as broken furniture, containers, boxes, appliances, and other miscellaneous debris, illustrating a significant environmental pollution issue.\n\nA dirt path leads through the dump. At the right side of the image, there is a rustic, handmade sign attached to a tree, featuring cartoonish depictions and text. The sign reads \"THROW IT OVER HERE\" and humorously illustrates a person tossing trash over their shoulder. This sign seems to be directing where to dispose of additional garbage, adding a human element to the otherwise depersonalized waste landscape.\n\nThe setting is in a rural or semi-rural area, considering the natural surroundings visible in the distance beyond the waste. The image captures the aftermath of human consumption and the environmental impact of improper waste disposal practices.","title":"This dump at Sunrise Beach is scheduled to be covered over.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["550801","557307","550798","543824","554541","552446","549936","549750","551242","544637","547983","546805","546761","544823","546246","551247"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","dump","disposal","consumption","appliance","sign","household","furniture","aftermath","practice"]}
