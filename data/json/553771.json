{"path":"553771.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged coastal scene, featuring a series of layered, weathered rock formations that form a cliff face extending into the ocean. The rock layers, having a dark, reddish-brown hue, show evidence of erosional patterns, providing a textured appearance to the cliff. The sea abuts the base of the cliffs, where white foam from waves hints at the constant barrage of water against the hardened rock, slowly shaping the landscape over time.\n\nThe ocean itself appears choppy, with a deep blue color, indicating depth and the presence of open waters beyond the immediate rocky outcrop. The sky overhead is partly cloudy, with small, white cumulus clouds scattered across a pale blue backdrop, suggesting fair weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nThis coastal environment seems mostly untouched by human activities, focusing instead on the natural and enduring battle between sea and land. The absence of human elements and structures lends a wild, pristine quality to the scene, emphasizing nature's dominance in this rugged coastal area. The perspective of the photograph allows the viewer to trace the length of the cliff as it disappears into the distance, giving a sense of the vast scale and the isolation of this striking landscape.","title":"Part of conservation zone along highway 72.
