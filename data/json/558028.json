{"path":"558028.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a street scene, likely in a small town, captured in a monochromatic blue tint, giving it a vintage, melancholic feel. The setting is dominated by a two-lane road meandering gently towards the horizon, flanked by telephone poles and crisscrossed with numerous overhead wires.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, there are several small businesses visible. Prominently displayed signs include \"AMOCO\" and \"LAR'S SERVICE\" suggesting a gas station and automotive service shop. The architecture is simple and functional, typical of mid-20th-century commercial buildings in rural or suburban North America.\n\nFurther down the road, on the left side, the scene includes more greenery and what appears to be residential structures or small town buildings obscured partly by the shadows and tree line. The roadway shows no marked lanes and appears slightly worn, hinting at a less trafficked, possibly older thoroughfare.\n\nOne distinct feature is the sky, which due to the photo's coloring and age, offers a gradient transitioning from a lighter to a denser shade of blue, dramatizing the overhead cable network. The absence of modern vehicles or people suggests the photo might be taken during an early morning or less busy period, or it dates back to an era when lesser traffic was common.\n\nThere's also a subtle presence of vintage street lamps (or traffic signal) hanging from one of the wires in the middle of the street, enhancing the historical feel of the photograph. This setting intimately captures a slice of past American life, emphasizing simplicity and a slower-paced lifestyle.","title":"Copy of a black and white photo taken about 1900 showing a view west on Main Street in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron, with a store and service station on the right.
