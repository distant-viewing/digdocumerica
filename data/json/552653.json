The point of view is from behind a gathering of spectators who are watching the procession. In the foreground, children and adults can be seen seated and standing on the edge of a street. Three balloons with cartoonish faces, likely representing popular characters, float in the lower right corner, adding a colorful and playful touch to the scene.\n\nThe main focus is on a march of cheerleaders wearing red and white uniforms, performing with pompoms as they pass along the street. The parade appears lively and well-attended, with the spectators closely packed along the side of the road.\n\nThe background reveals an urban setting with old commercial buildings. Notable signage includes \"Midland Hotel\" and \"MC's Caf√© Lounge\". The sky above is deep blue, punctuated with fluffy white clouds, suggesting a clear, sunny day.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements in the photograph provide a glimpse of a festive community event, filled with enthusiasm and traditional parade elements.","title":"Labor Day weekend brings the annual Garfield County Fair parade.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["557710","556274","552660","552657","552656","552652","546991","556279","547022","549569","549566","549577","557714","549567","556280","549576"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["parade","spectator","procession","enthusiasm","balloon","street","character","uniform","signage","corner"]}
