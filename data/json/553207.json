{"path":"553207.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a relaxed, urban scene centered around a large, multi-tiered water fountain. The fountain, which is the main focus, appears powerful with water forcefully jetting out from various spouts, creating a dynamic and refreshing visual spot in the middle of an urban setting.\n\nIn the foreground, three individuals and three bicycles are positioned in front of the fountain. From left to right, the first person, who seems to be a young adult, is sitting on a ledge, barefoot, relaxing and looking away from the fountain, presumably observing the surroundings or conversing with the person next to them - a second person who also sits barefoot on the ledge, directly in front of the fountain. This individual is pictured with one hand on their head, which might suggest thoughtfulness or rest. The third person, also appearing to be a young adult, is similarly seated and engaged in adjusting or fixing something on their bicycle, which adds an element of everyday life and leisure activities to the scene.\n\nThe bicycles are casually leaned against the ledge, adding a touch of casual urban lifestyle where bikes stand as symbols of mobility and eco-friendly transportation.\n\nIn the background, the setting includes other pedestrians, and elements like parked cars and city buildings, typical of a bustling city environment. There's also a glimpse of what seems to be a commercial advertisement on a vehicle (“what're ya doin' after the pool?”), alluding, perhaps, to urban commercial life and leisure.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with its focus on the fountain and relaxed posture of the individuals along with parked bicycles suggests a moment of pause and leisure within a cityscape, reflecting a blend of dynamic urban life and tranquil personal moments.","title":"Bicyclists take a breather at Tyler Davidson Fountain, in Fountain Square.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551663","550747","551449","551793","551772","549982","553289","551480","551647","557258","551451","551858","551658","553224","551661","557282"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","bicycle","ledge","leisure","person","adult","mobility","pause","life","bike"]}
