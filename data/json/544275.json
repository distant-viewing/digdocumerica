{"path":"544275.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"In this photograph, a middle-aged man stands in a lush garden or farm area. He is dressed in a casual, light blue button-down shirt which is tucked into his dark blue jeans, held up by a black belt. The man wears round-rimmed glasses and has a thin mustache and beard. He is balding but has short grey hair on the sides of his head. He holds a yellow tomato in his right hand, offering it towards the camera with a slight smile on his face, appearing proud or pleased.\n\nThe background shows rows of dense, green tomato plants laden with fruits, supported by wooden stakes. The soil is visibly dry and cracked, suggesting a hot or dry climate. The man is standing on a narrow dirt path between the rows of tomato plants.\n\nOverall, the image captures a scene of agricultural activity, potentially in a personal or community garden, emphasizing a connection to nature and self-sustenance. The simple and neat attire of the man, along with his cheerful demeanor, adds a personal and inviting touch to the scene.","title":"Manuel Soares, tomato farmer","placename":"Saint Bernard (La.)","location":"Saint Bernard, Louisiana","nn1":["544236","544240","544295","550760","552812","547416","544250","555360","551628","557681","551961","554794","554797","545087","549051","549298"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["tomato","garden","stake","fruit","self","row","man","rim","tuck","mustache"]}
