{"path":"545846.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph appears to show an aerial view of a large-scale excavation site, possibly a mine or a quarry. The main features of the image include a long, narrow chasm or pit filled with water, reflecting a murky blue hue that contrasts with the surrounding brownish earth tones. Along the edges of this water-filled pit, one can see various shades of earth, suggesting layers of soil and possibly some mineral deposits.\n\nDominating the scene is a large crane situated on the edge of the pit. The crane is colored primarily in red with some white segments, and is equipped with an extended arm, possibly for excavation or lifting heavy materials. Around the crane, the ground appears significantly disturbed with tracks, likely from trucks or other heavy machinery, indicating recent or ongoing activity.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is relatively flat, and the backdrop features a rural landscape with patches of vegetation and a few structures that could be farms or houses, hinting that this might be located near a populated area.\n\nThere is a slight haze in the photograph, likely due to dust, which adds a somewhat muted tone to the colors and blurs the distinction between the sky and the earth at the horizon. This gives the image a somewhat somber or industrial atmosphere.","title":"Big brown coal mining operation","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545883","543861","545888","554545","548644","552427","545887","554833","555593","545831","555622","555614","555633","547225","554812","544498"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["pit","crane","earth","excavation","quarry","deposit","mine","segment","mineral","dust"]}
