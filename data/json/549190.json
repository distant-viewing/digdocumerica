{"path":"549190.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image features an industrial scene focused on a power plant, underscored by a dramatic, dusky sky. The plant is comprised of several large buildings and multiple smokestacks, from which thick plumes of dark smoke are billowing into the sky. These emissions suggest the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nIn the foreground, various utility poles and power lines create a complex lattice that partially frames the plant, adding a sense of depth and infrastructure connectivity. The landscape around the plant appears flat and sparsely vegetated, indicative of a possibly remote or less densely populated industrial area. The horizon is faintly visible in the distance under a broad sky, hinting at a vast and open environment.\n\nThe overall tone and lighting of the photograph give it a somewhat moody and stark atmosphere, emphasizing themes of industrial activity and environmental impact.","title":"This 750-megawatt power plant, located on the North Platte River, is part of the massive strip-mining development planned for the Powder River region.","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557302","549215","557374","544173","550981","550982","550168","544700","550983","550176","545447","550172","557299","551026","551054","557218"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plant","power","burning","lattice","connectivity","fuel","emission","vegetate","comprise","billow"]}
