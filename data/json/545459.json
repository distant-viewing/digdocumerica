{"path":"545459.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling outdoor scene, possibly at a fair or community gathering during the evening. The image captures a variety of people, mostly children and a few adults, engaged in casual activities typical of such events.\n\nIn the foreground, a young girl, on the left, is facing away from the camera, holding a large cotton candy. Close to her, a boy is also holding a cotton candy, while conversing with an out-of-focus man holding another cotton candy. To the right, dominating the scene, is an older woman with her back towards the viewer, cradling a large teddy bear with a colorful pattern on its chest. The teddy bear's fur appears fluffy and light-colored, contrasting with the darker evening setting.\n\nThe background is moderately lit, indicating evening or night-time, with several other attendees visible, including children and adults. Some are standing, while others appear slightly blurred, suggesting movement, likely wandering around or involved in various leisurely fair activities. The lighting is such that the center and right areas of the image are better illuminated, possibly by the ambient or artificial light sources outside the frame. The overall atmosphere is casual and lively, typical of a community event or fair.","title":"Cotton candy, jelly apples and stuffed animal prizes","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545465","545453","545464","545460","545449","551689","551688","545444","558294","553259","545454","553298","558295","551298","553142","546821"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["evening","bear","adult","hold","event","child","fur","community","standing","attendee"]}
