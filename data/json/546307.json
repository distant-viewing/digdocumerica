{"path":"546307.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures two men standing on a wooden dock over a body of water. The man on the right is engaged in some sort of scientific or environmental activity; he's dropping or retrieving cylindrical objects attached to a rope into the water, which could be water sampling equipment. He is wearing glasses, a blue and white striped short-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and is focused on the task at hand.\n\nThe other man, on the left, is watching the process. He is dressed in a red checkered short-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and appears to be bald or has very short hair. His hands are clasped behind his back, and he seems attentive to the work being done by the other man.\n\nThe background features lush greenery and tall grasses indicative of a marsh or wetland area. The sky is overcast with a non-distinct light, suggesting an early morning or late afternoon setting. The focus and composition of the image emphasize the activity and the setting of environmental research or monitoring, contributing to a narrative of scientific investigation or natural observation.","title":"Epa gulf coast water supply research laboratory, Dauphin Island.
