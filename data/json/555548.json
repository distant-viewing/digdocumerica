{"path":"555548.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a garden scene, specifically focusing on some leafy plants and the soil. The plants, which appear to be a type of cabbage or similar leafy vegetable, dominate the frame with their large, green, slightly dusty leaves clearly visible. The leaves have a rugged texture and some bear small droplets of water, adding a fresh, dewy aspect to their surface.\n\nThe background, although mostly obscured by the foliage, hints at more greenery and possibly other plants in the vicinity. The soil shown in the image seems moist and fertile, with a crumbly texture composed of small clods and a few visible pebbles. It's dotted with white flecks that could be mineral deposits or small particles of organic matter.\n\nOverall, the photograph has an organic and lush feeling, capturing the essence of a well-tended vegetable garden after a rain, with a focus on texture and the natural beauty of garden vegetation.","title":"Globules of chemicals used in the production of chlorine dot the dirt and leaves of a plant in a truck garden.
