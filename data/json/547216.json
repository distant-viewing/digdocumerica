{"path":"547216.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a misty, overcast day at a coastal or lakeside setting where construction or maintenance activity is taking place. At the center of the image, a large crane dominates the frame, extending diagonally from the bottom right toward the upper left of the picture. The crane is hoisting a sizeable, claw-like grapple that is suspended mid-air, carrying a heavy, irregularly-shaped boulder.\n\nTo the right side of the image, along a curved pathway that borders the coastline, two individuals dressed in work attire are observing the operation. They appear engaged, perhaps discussing the proceedings. The pathway is bordered by a sturdy, ornamental metal railing, suggesting that this area might be accessible to the public, at least when not under construction.\n\nThe background is obscured by fog or mist, giving the scene a muted, grey-blue tone that blankets the environment in a calm but cool atmosphere. Overall, the mix of industrial activity with the natural, serene background creates a juxtaposition that captures both human endeavors and the elements.","title":"Crane lifts Boulders into place to shore up road bed.
