{"path":"549639.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic, natural scene involving a water feature and a wooden structure. The primary focus is on a small waterfall cascading over a series of wooden logs that appear to be part of an old, makeshift dam or water control structure. The logs are stacked in a staggered, linear fashion and are bound together with wooden supports that add a rough, handmade quality to the construction.\n\nThe water flows energetically over the logs, creating a series of white, foamy cascades before continuing down a rocky, sediment-rich watercourse. The watercourse itself is colored with hues of brown and orange, possibly indicating the presence of minerals or sediment in the water.\n\nThe background and surroundings are not distinctly visible but suggest a natural, undeveloped environment possibly in a forested or mountainous area given the presence of muddy earth and additional wooden debris around the structure. The lighting in the image is soft, indicating that the photograph may have been taken on an overcast day, enhancing the moody, naturalistic feel of the scene. \n\nOverall, the composition gives the impression of a remote, untouched locale where the wooden structure serves a functional purpose in managing or utilizing the flow of water in a natural setting.","title":"Water polluted by mineral content seeps from the Argo Mine.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["544795","544796","543869","550843","557745","558006","550222","555220","550647","545882","554408","542594","555209","555153","558087","545839"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["log","cascade","sediment","bind","series","flow","water","locale","dam","waterfall"]}
