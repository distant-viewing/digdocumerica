{"path":"546411.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a partially constructed building, presenting an interesting interplay of architectural shapes and materials under a partly cloudy sky. To the left side of the image, there is a round structure with a curved, brick facade, possibly a tower or cylindrical section of the building, which remains open with visible steel beams and construction scaffolding inside.\n\nAdjacent to this, the building transitions into a more conventional rectangular shape with flat white walls. Notably, a section of the wall is adorned with a large glass window pane arrangement in a geometric, diamond-shaped design, adding a modernist touch to the architecture.\n\nThe foreground of the photograph is cluttered with construction materials and debris, highlighting the ongoing works. There are stacks of cinder blocks and other construction materials neatly piled, and construction equipment is also visible. A worker can be glimpsed through the large open section of the cylindrical structure, contributing to a sense of activity and progress in the scene.\n\nOverall, the image provides a snapshot of an architectural development in progress, showcasing both the structural elements of building construction and the temporary disorder that accompanies such a project.","title":"Construction of fodrea community school","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["548552","548551","556619","546414","546426","555373","547977","547829","550737","545877","546503","550273","555746","546422","547914","557730"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","progress","section","shape","material","cinder","disorder","diamond","scaffolding","pane"]}
