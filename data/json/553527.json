{"path":"553527.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures an interior scene of a cluttered and somewhat dilapidated kitchen. On the right side of the image is a sink area with visible signs of wear and tear. The sink is full of dishes and assorted kitchen tools. Above the sink, an open shelf holds various items such as cups, pots, and other containers, with a towel hanging down from it. The shelf and the wall around it show signs of degradation and poor maintenance, with visible stains and possibly mold.\n\nTo the left in the image, a person is seen from behind, standing at a small table covered with yellow and red patterned cloth, which appears to be a makeshift kitchen counter. The person, wearing a yellow sleeveless top and green pants, appears to be either cleaning or preparing something at the table, their focus directed down towards their task. Beside the table, there is a pile of clothes and a large accumulation of litter on the black and white checkered floor, emphasizing a sense of disorder. \n\nThe room is dimly lit, creating shadows and further emphasizing the neglect visible in the space. The atmosphere evoked is one of decay and confinement, highlighted by the closed or non-visible windows and the lack of vibrant coloration aside from the table cloth. The entire composition reveals a personal living space that seems to be in urgent need of care and renewal.","title":"Billy watkins, one of nine children of a biscuit worker's family, gets himself a bowl of cereal in the kitchen of their mulky square home","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["553531","557342","552094","558298","552093","552956","552095","544368","552096","552105","557356","552457","557343","556353","544356","553522"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["sink","kitchen","table","cloth","shelf","mold","renewal","disorder","dish","clean"]}
