{"path":"549181.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a vast landscape predominantly characterized by agricultural terrain. The focal point is a large, barren field with visible patterns of tire tracks or farming machinery marks, suggesting recent activity such as plowing or preparation for sowing.\n\nIn the foreground, the soil has several shades of brown and beige, with patches of green vegetation sporadically visible, indicating a mix of barren and somewhat fertile tracts. The composition of the land rolls gently, presenting undulating hills that add a dynamic contour to the scene.\n\nIn the middle distance, there is a distinct path that appears largely compacted and possibly serves as an access route cutting through the field. Surrounding this main field are areas with denser vegetation, including scattered trees and shrubbery at the edges and along the undulations, providing a natural border and contrast to the ploughed central area.\n\nFurther afar, the backdrop includes a lightly forested area with coniferous trees that create a darker green contrast against the lighter tones of the field. The horizon blends into a hazy blue sky, dotted with fluffy, white cumulus clouds, suggesting a clear and sunny day. This wide, open landscape offers a sense of tranquility and vastness, typical of rural or agricultural regions.","title":"Old spoil piles are flattened and planted in an attempt at reclamation.
