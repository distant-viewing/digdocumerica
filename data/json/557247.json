{"path":"557247.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a water outflow structure, likely part of a dam or a water treatment facility. The central focus of the image is a large, rectangular concrete structure that stands in water. Water forcefully flows out from a circular opening at the bottom center of the structure, creating a turbulent, foamy water jet that merges into the rippling water in the foreground. The structure appears sturdy, with a slightly arched top and what might be pipes or cables draped over it. The water, possibly a river or a reservoir, shows strong currents and waves indicating significant movement. The background is dark, helping to highlight the stark, functional design of the water outlet against the motion of the water. The overall mood is industrial, emphasizing functionality over aesthetics.","title":"Black water being discharged into the Ohio River from the coke and by-products area of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation plant at Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh.","placename":"Aliquippa (Pa.)","location":"Aliquippa, Pennsylvania","nn1":["548309","549564","547215","550720","542990","546891","553901","544795","556944","551180","553654","550654","549539","550715","550743","553137"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["water","outlet","reservoir","jet","treatment","dam","current","opening","functionality","structure"]}
