{"path":"550827.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful and scenic lakeside setting. In the foreground, the lake’s water is calm, reflecting a gentle rippling effect indicative of a serene day. The lake shore curves around gently from the right to the center of the image, with a sandy beach area providing the setting for the main activities in the scene.\n\nOn the shore, a group of five people, presumably a family, can be seen enjoying the outdoors. The family consists of two adults and three children who appear to be engaging in light, leisurely activities. One of the adults, a man standing to the right, is observing the children. Nearby, the children, of varying ages and heights, are either standing close to the water’s edge or stepping into the shallow parts of the lake. One child, positioned centrally and slightly forward within the group, is interacting directly with the adult female who is facing towards them from a farther point in the water.\n\nThe background is dominated by a dense cluster of tall, verdant trees which screen the area from direct sunlight, adding a sense of enclosure and lushness to the location. These trees are typical of a coniferous forest, suggesting the lake might be situated in a temperate or boreal climate zone.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its combination of still water, the gentle curve of the shoreline, playing children, and the forested backdrop, conveys a tranquil snapshot of family life and natural beauty, likely taken on a sunny day given the bright outdoor lighting and shadows cast on the ground.","title":"Shore of the Wisconsin river in the dells area, a picturesque region which attracts many visitors","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["543892","553431","545229","553440","552978","543536","545267","554499","546941","554517","543579","554476","552220","550236","543518","558093"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","family","lake","adult","temperate","rippling","shore","lushness","curve","female"]}
