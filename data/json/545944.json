{"path":"545944.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rogers, Chuck","caption":"The photograph captures a lively outdoor event on a river, surrounded by thick green foliage. The river scene is bustling, with numerous small boats and rafts scattered across the water. Most of these vessels are occupied by groups of people, suggesting a communal or celebratory occasion.\n\nIn the foreground, framed by dense, leafy trees, individuals on the riverbank are actively engaged in preparations or activities related to the event. Some people appear to be on larger, more stable platforms or docks, which are equipped with various items, possibly for logistics or entertainment. The atmosphere is lively, evidenced by the groups of people in each boat, many of whom are standing or sitting while facing each other, likely conversing or coordinating activities.\n\nThe background reveals a hilly landscape with a dense canopy of trees lining both sides of the river, emphasizing a sense of seclusion and a natural setting. The weather appears overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene, which contributes to the serene yet festive atmosphere of the photograph. The event captured seems to be a significant gathering, possibly a community or family-oriented function involving water-based activities and river navigation.","title":"Boating on the Chattahoochee River","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["543943","551282","545933","551538","545937","549939","545941","551218","550769","557972","554475","545732","557740","548077","549934","552283"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["river","event","entertainment","raft","occasion","logistic","boat","people","navigation","seclusion"]}
