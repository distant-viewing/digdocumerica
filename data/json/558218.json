{"path":"558218.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Rees, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a library card catalog room. The focus of the image is an older woman in the foreground, who is actively using the card catalog drawers. She is wearing glasses and a blue and white striped outfit and is flipping through a card catalog drawer that she has pulled out. Her expression is one of concentration as she searches for specific information.\n\nIn the background, another individual, a man, can be seen also using the card catalog. He is standing next to another row of file cabinets and appears to be either searching or writing something down.\n\nThe card catalog section of the library contains many rows of dark-colored wooden drawers, each equipped with a small label holder on the front for easy identification. Above these drawers are counters to place books or note-taking materials.\n\nFurther in the background, there are visible bookshelves filled with books, hinting at the extensive collection held by the library. This setting suggests a traditional library environment, focused on manual search methods before the widespread availability of digital catalog systems. The area is well-lit, promoting an environment conducive to reading and researching.","title":"Librarian at the card files at senior high school in New Ulm Minnesota.
