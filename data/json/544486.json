{"path":"544486.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph depicts a cattle egret in its natural habitat, a marshy area with sparse vegetation. The egret is standing in shallow water. Its body is predominantly white, with a light shade of orange on its head, stretching down to the neck area. The bird's pose is upright and alert, and it appears to be looking to its left, possibly watching for potential predators or prey. The beak is slightly open, and its legs are a shade of yellowish-orange.\n\nThe surroundings are characterized by a combination of muddy ground and patches of water, with some grass and reed-like plants growing sparsely throughout. The background is softly out of focus, which emphasizes the bird as the main subject of the image. The water reflects a bit of the sunlight, hinting that the environment is somewhat sunny. The color scheme of the background is composed of earth tones—browns and greens—which complement the white and subtle orange hues of the egret, providing a natural and serene setting.","title":"Cattle egret with breeding plumage near jetport","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544478","544516","544482","548732","544842","545967","544616","547745","544631","548729","544489","544539","548731","544543","544484","544620"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["egret","bird","beak","cattle","reed","scheme","neck","shade","pose","combination"]}
