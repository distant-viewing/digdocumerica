{"path":"554595.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a cluster of delicate pink flowers amidst a bed of green leaves. The flowers, which are the focal point of the image, have multiple petals spreading outward and stamens that are visibly protruding from the center, adding intricate details to their structure. The petals exhibit a soft pink hue that varies slightly in intensity.\n\nThe leaves surrounding the flowers add a robust green contrast with hints of yellow on their edges, indicating some variety in color and possibly some exposure to sunlight or environmental stress. The leaves and stems have a slight shine to them, suggesting that they could be slightly waxy or moist.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention primarily on the pink flowers. The overall composition is vibrant yet soft with natural lighting that enhances the vivid colors and delicate textures of the plant. The setting appears to be outdoors, in a natural environment, perhaps a field or a forest floor, where this plant species thrives in abundance. The photo captures the essence of the flora, highlighting the beauty of its small, colorful components in a natural setting.","title":"Dwarf azalea atop algonquin mountain in the forest preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["554843","553366","543597","542970","553588","557500","554115","557618","554587","544934","557167","544875","554576","550462","554111","554574"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","leave","stamen","stress","shine","abundance","thrive","stem","plant"]}
