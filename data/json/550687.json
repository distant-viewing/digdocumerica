{"path":"550687.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of environmental pollution juxtaposed against a natural landscape. In the foreground, a large amount of garbage is scattered over a rocky shore. The debris includes various objects like cans, bottles, a white plastic drum with visible dents, pieces of wood, smaller miscellaneous litter, and a partially visible green fabric which could be a piece of clothing or a bag. The composition indicates a careless disposal of waste in what would otherwise be a serene natural environment.\n\nIn the background, a body of water reflects the sunlight, suggesting that it is either a lake or a wide river. Beyond the water, a densely forested area stretches up to meet the hills in the distance. The horizon is dominated by a green, forested mountain, which sets a stark contrast to the polluted foreground. The sky above is clear and blue, adding to the natural beauty of the area, overshadowed by the immediate environmental issue represented by the litter. \n\nThe photograph may serve as a visual commentary on the impact of human waste on natural sites, highlighting environmental neglect and the need for proper waste management and conservation efforts.","title":"Riverside dump at gorham, at the confluence of the androscoggin river and peabody rivers.
