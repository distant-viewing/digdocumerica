{"path":"550663.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene featuring a river and a forested landscape. The river, appearing strong and tumultuous, is filled with white, foamy rapids suggesting fast-moving water. In the river, there's a small red and white canoe occupied by two individuals wearing personal flotation devices, paddling through the rapids. The people seem engaged in the activity, focused on maneuvering their canoe amidst the challenging water conditions.\n\nThe background of the image shows a rich, green forest on either side of the river, framing the scene naturally. Behind this forest, a large hill or low mountain covered with dense trees rises up, dominating the horizon. The sky above is mostly clear with a few puffy, white clouds scattered across a bright blue backdrop, contributing to an overall feeling of a clear, sunny day.\n\nThe composition of the photograph places the canoe slightly off-center towards the bottom right, drawing the viewerâ€™s eye through the river as it leads up towards the hilly background, creating a sense of depth and perspective amidst the natural beauty of the scene.","title":"Androscoggin river near the headwaters, looking downstream from the bridge at errol","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550659","555219","549439","553336","553806","558072","549442","554465","549447","550980","554471","544759","553333","549996","545733","550658"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["rapid","river","canoe","paddle","maneuver","forest","challenge","device","occupy","feeling"]}
