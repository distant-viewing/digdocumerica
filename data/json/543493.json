{"path":"543493.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene, predominantly in cool tones with a relatively dark exposure that evokes a tranquil, perhaps late afternoon mood. Two primary subjects, a child and an adult, are present in the bottom portion of the image, positioned on the sandy beach near the incoming surf. The child appears to be walking towards the left, while the adult, who seems to be carrying a bag and a bucket, stands facing partially towards the child, suggesting a moment of interaction or supervision.\n\nThe sea is a major part of the composition, reflecting the sunlight with a shimmering effect that spreads across the entire middle section of the image. The waves are moderate, breaking gently on the shore which adds a dynamic yet calming element to the scene.\n\nIn the background, the shoreline curves gracefully, leading to a heavily wooded area atop cliffs. The trees are silhouetted against a bright sky, enhancing the sense of a secluded and possibly remote location. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with a sense of quiet isolation or a moment away from the busier aspects of life.\n\nA small sand structure, possibly a sandcastle or a mound, is noticeable close to the subjects, adding a touch of playful human activity to the natural landscape. The entire scene is framed in a way that draws the viewer's eye across the water toward the distant trees, and back to the figures on the beach, creating a contemplative and immersive viewing experience.","title":"California -- Pebble Beach","placename":"Pebble Beach (Calif.)","location":"Pebble Beach, California","nn1":["547600","554159","547009","542890","547612","543287","555402","546970","547607","557509","546953","543252","552341","543244","548220","548221"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","child","adult","subject","surf","viewing","facing","wafe","mound","shimmering"]}
