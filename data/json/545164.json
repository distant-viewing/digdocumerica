{"path":"545164.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and intriguing scene focused on a body of water, likely a river or lake, exhibiting a large swirl of foam. The foreground shows the swirling mass of white, foamy water, creating outwardly expanding waves. The water surrounding the foam is dark and still, contrasting with the turbulent white center.\n\nIn the background, the environment is somewhat industrial. On the left side, there are large industrial buildings, possibly factories or processing facilities, characterized by their vast flat structures and a few scattered, tall smokestacks emitting white smoke or steam. This indicates a proximity to industrial activity.\n\nThe middle and right portions of the background display a semi-rural landscape featuring flat, sparsely vegetated land with sparse infrastructure in the form of small buildings or installations and a few electrical powerlines standing tall against the sky. The sky is mostly clear with a hint of clouds, suggesting a calm day weather-wise.\n\nThis composition juxtaposes a natural aquatic phenomenon with human industrial presence, highlighting an interaction between natural and manufactured environments. The image, due to its vintage feel, also suggests it was taken several decades ago, allowing for reflections on environmental changes over time.","title":"Effluent from pulp mills pollutes Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545168","557252","557240","550815","557238","550370","550817","549624","550371","544779","544775","550849","547502","550710","553388","552989"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["foam","phenomenon","swirl","mass","installation","decade","vintage","change","proximity","steam"]}
