{"path":"548778.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of an extensive coastal industrial area, displaying a dense arrangement of buildings and infrastructure. Below are key details of the image:\n\n1. **Runways or Large Plots:** Towards the right of the image, there are six large, parallel strips, possibly runways, roads under construction, or storage areas lined up next to a body of water. These structures are significantly marked by their white color, contrasting with the surrounding landscape.\n\n2. **Industrial and Residential Zones:** On the left side of the image, there is a built-up area with a grid layout, featuring numerous grey and white buildings that suggest a mix of residential and light industrial usage. This grid is organized around a central north-south roadway.\n\n3. **Water Bodies:** Surrounding the built areas, several large and small water bodies can be observed. These include a wide rectangular body of water adjacent to the possible runways and another indistinct water body near the upper left corner of the image.\n\n4. **Vegetation:** Areas of dense green vegetation can be seen to the north and partially mingling with the sandy areas around the runways, providing a natural contrast to the built environment.\n\n5. **Roads and Access:** Prominent roadways are visible, bisecting and bordering the built-up regions, suggesting a well-connected infrastructure suited for industrial and residential activities.\n\n6. **Background:** The horizon shows a vast expanse of a calm water body, suggesting this area's proximity to a major sea or lake.\n\nThis image likely depicts an industrial coastline with facilities related to manufacturing, transportation, or storage, integrated with residential zones, and positioned in a strategic location near water bodies.","title":"Permanent trailer park in Key Largo, with typical \"plugged\" canals.
