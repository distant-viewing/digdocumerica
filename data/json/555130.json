{"path":"555130.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This is a scenic photograph capturing a majestic and tranquil landscape, likely taken during dusk or dawn given the soft lighting and vivid colors. The background features a series of overlapping mountains that gradually recede into the distance, creating a layered effect. These mountains are cloaked in dense forests of coniferous trees, typical of a mountainous terrain.\n\nA distinctive feature of the image is the thick, white cloud cover engulfing the lower parts of the mountains and filling the valleys. This phenomenon, possibly indicating low-lying clouds or fog, creates an ethereal appearance as mountain peaks emerge dramatically above this white blanket. The clouds obscure most of the ground level details but partially reveal a lake or river snaking through the valley, its presence indicated by patches of visible water amidst the fog.\n\nThe color palette is rich with deep purples and blues, likely accentuated by the time of day the photo was taken. This imbues the scene with a mysterious and somewhat surreal atmosphere. The overall composition is serene and picturesque, evoking a sense of calm and isolation from the hustle of everyday life. There are no human activities or built structures visible; nature dominates the landscape entirely.","title":"Distant view of Olympic National Timberland, Washington near Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553825","554634","543023","557000","554962","554398","555131","542923","552695","557575","546764","544070","543643","555378","557558","554399"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","valley","phenomenon","hustle","blanket","cloud","fog","calm","purple","dawn"]}
