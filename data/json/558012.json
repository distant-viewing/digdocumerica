{"path":"558012.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and seemingly untouched forest scene. The setting is dense with lush vegetation, featuring a variety of trees and undergrowth. The various shades of green are complemented by the large number of fallen leaves which cover the ground in a carpet of orange, brown, and red, suggesting that the season is either autumn or the aftermath thereof.\n\nIn the middle distance of the image, there appears to be a fallen tree trunk lying horizontally across the scene, creating a natural barrier amidst the woodland. This trunk adds a textured, organic element to the scene and draws the eye as a focal point against the more chaotic background of leaves and branches.\n\nThe foliage is thick, with trees of varying sizes and types occupying the upper and middle portions of the photograph. They create a dense canopy that filters the light, casting subtle shadows and creating areas of dappled sunlight on the forest floor. The sky is not visible due to the density of the canopy.\n\nOverall, the composition has a wild, untamed quality that invites speculation about the wildlife and natural processes at play in this secluded woodland area. The absence of any human activity or man-made structures enhances the feel of an undisturbed natural environment.","title":"Nature has returned to the bed of the Ohio-Erie Canal northeast of Peninsula, Ohio. The canal carried heavy commerce between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi River systems between 1833 and 1913 when a flood and the railroads put the waterway out of business. The valley now is a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located in a 20-mile stretch between Cleveland and Akron. Over 80 percent of the valley is sloped and wooded.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["554425","547011","546947","554718","550791","555116","554958","543581","545488","558082","555054","555120","555118","554976","547643","555043"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["woodland","canopy","trunk","leave","carpet","forest","undergrowth","aftermath","density","absence"]}
