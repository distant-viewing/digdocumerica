{"path":"547932.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image captures a scenic view of a city skyline across a body of water, presumed to be New York City as observed from a viewpoint likely on the other side of a river, possibly the East River. The focal point of the composition is the iconic cityscape that features a variety of tall buildings and skyscrapers, including several notable structures like rectangular high-rise buildings and one with a distinct spire that might be a famous landmark.\n\nThe water in the foreground is lively with ripples and waves, indicating windy conditions, and there is a small boat speeding across, creating a track in the water. The sky is mostly clear with patches of cumulus clouds indicating fair weather.\n\nIn the immediate foreground, a section of a diamond-patterned, metal railing runs horizontally across the image, serving as a barrier at the edge of the waterfront. The railing is mounted on a more substantial metal structure, incorporating round poles that are connected to the ground, hinting at a viewing area or a public walkway alongside the water.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a vibrant urban scene, viewed from an accessible public spot, offering a vast perspective of the city's architectural elegance and the active life on the water.","title":"New York skyline from Staten Island ferry","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552261","548390","552260","552265","550754","552268","555734","557273","552251","548314","547967","548378","548387","555732","552252","548347"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["railing","cumulus","diamond","incorporate","elegance","water","spire","city","landmark","speed"]}
