{"path":"547489.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and natural wetland scene at dusk. The primary feature of the image is a body of still water that reflects the sky above it. The sky, slightly cloudy, displays a gradient of colors transitioning from a brighter, light blue or pale yellow near the horizon, suggesting the sun might be setting or is low in the sky.\n\nThe wetland is bordered with tall grasses and patches of what appear to be reeds or rushes, with several distinct clumps standing directly in the water. These grassy plants are silhouetted against the reflective water, creating a contrast between the dark vegetation and the lighter surface of the water.\n\nIn the background, there are faint hints of a wooded area or dense brush, adding depth to the scene and providing a natural boundary to the wetland. The entire setting is tranquil, with no visible human activity or man-made structures, emphasizing the untouched natural beauty of the scene.\n\nThe color palette is muted, with dark greens, blues, and subtle hints of purple and white, enhancing the feeling of calmness and the onset of evening. The composition of the photograph, with its focus on the reflection and the silhouettes, draws the viewer's eye across the water towards the horizon, making it a reflective and peaceful image.","title":"Salt marsh","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547589","547547","547488","547604","550788","545991","550389","553856","546066","550786","550341","544515","543611","547731","547500","547532"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","onset","rush","water","brush","clump","hint","reed","calmness","horizon"]}
