{"path":"546482.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph displays a contemporary art exhibit within an indoor gallery. The main focus is a series of large, graphic artworks mounted on a clean, white wall to the left. These artworks feature a minimalist style with bold geometric shapes, primarily circles and lines, in various colors (orange, black, red, blue) set against neutral backgrounds. The largest piece closest in the frame showcases vertical lines and a large orange circle, while subsequent pieces present different compositions with circles and dots.\n\nThe room is dimly lit, with focused lighting accentuating the pieces. Small light spots are visible on the floor, probably reflecting either an intentional part of the installation or ambient light filtering through. On the right side, the gallery extends into a darkened area leading to other unseen parts of the exhibition.\n\nThe atmosphere is quiet and contemplative, typical of an art gallery setting, inviting viewers to engage closely with the visual elements of each piece. The absence of people in the frame emphasizes the art itself and the serene environment of the gallery.","title":"Interior of Cummins corporate office","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546471","546475","553177","556261","557723","547763","556632","546558","555317","553883","546564","555315","544012","556019","546526","546511"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["circle","art","piece","artwork","exhibition","filtering","darken","installation","absence","invite"]}
