{"path":"542972.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and natural scene with significant warmth and rustic colors. The image features a white horse standing in a field, accompanied closely by a foal with a chestnut-colored coat. The subjects are positioned in a grassy area that is illuminated by what appears to be the soft, golden light of either sunrise or sunset.\n\nThe background reveals a broad expanse of water, likely the sea, which extends across the horizon and merges subtly with the sky. This creates an almost monochromatic backdrop in shades of muted gold and blue, contributing to a tranquil and somewhat ethereal atmosphere.\n\nThe landscape around the horses reveals gently rolling hills, adorned with long, dry grass that suggests the season might be late summer or early autumn. A sparse fence post is visible to the left of the horses, hinting at this being a managed pastureland.\n\nThe overall effect of the lighting, color palette, and composition gives the image a timeless, calm, and pastoral quality, emphasizing a close connection between the animals and the natural environment surrounding them.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542619","545894","542622","545890","557186","556958","551229","543726","551327","543678","542956","552501","543071","557988","544414","556957"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","gold","warmth","sunrise","connection","autumn","post","coat","summer","animal"]}
