{"path":"543891.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph shows a scene of considerable traffic congestion on a major highway. The foreground is dominated by a large, grassy field with tall, golden-colored grass. This natural setting contrasts sharply with the primary subject of the imageâ€”the busy highway filled with vehicles.\n\nThe highway cuts horizontally across the middle of the frame and is crowded with a variety of vehicles, suggesting heavy traffic at a standstill or moving very slowly. Both sides of the divided highway are visible, with vehicles facing opposite directions. The vehicles include trucks, cars, and trailers, which indicate a mix of commercial and personal travel. The predominant colors of the vehicles range from whites and blacks to various shades of browns and blues.\n\nIn the background, gentle hills dotted with trees line the horizon under a clear blue sky. The setting appears to be rural or semi-rural, providing a peaceful backdrop counterposed against the congestion and activity on the highway. The photograph captures a moment that contrasts the tranquil beauty of the natural landscape with the hectic, often stressful nature of travel and transportation infrastructures.","title":"Traffic on highway 25 exit off of interstate 65","placename":"Nashville (Tenn.)","location":"Nashville, Tennessee","nn1":["553727","553726","546603","546711","557229","547294","546725","546721","557471","546587","546734","546583","542764","548391","547785","546607"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","congestion","vehicle","travel","traffic","black","trailer","white","divide","crowd"]}
