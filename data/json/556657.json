{"path":"556657.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph offers a view from behind a person sitting in what appears to be the cockpit of a vehicle, likely an aircraft, as suggested by the presence of overhead compartments and controls. This person, wearing a red jacket, is looking forward through a glass panel that shows a view obscured by glare, which makes the specific details beyond the glass indistinguishable.\n\nThe cockpit is dimly lit and predominantly features dark tones, with various switches and controls on the upper part of the frame. Some equipment is also visible to the left of the person. The focus is more on the silhouette of the person and the interior details of the cockpit, making the setting feel quite enclosed and intimate.\n\nOverall, the composition frames the pilot within the narrow confines of the cockpit, using the viewpoint to create a sense of being present in the space, looking over the pilot's shoulder. The lighting and shadows contribute to a moody ambiance.","title":"Engineer peers out the window at the tracks ahead while at the controls of one of Amtrak's Metroliners on its way from Washington, District of Columbia, to New York City. Metroliner passenger trains make 16 round trips daily between the two cities, making four to five stops each way. Amtrak owned approximately 2,000 cars in 1974 and had acquired 110 new locomotives. The corporation leases the use of the tracks from various railroads.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["542671","545645","553787","553786","552382","556798","546675","546667","542668","547721","548899","555332","545935","548880","555825","542720"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["cockpit","pilot","person","control","glare","switch","confine","glass","compartment","aircraft"]}
