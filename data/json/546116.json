{"path":"546116.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene focused on environmental contrast. In the foreground, there is a narrow water canal, reflecting the surroundings and flanked by lush, green vegetation on one side and a more barren, polluted shoreline on the other. The polluted shore is covered with debris, including sticks and trash, along with discolored patches that appear foamy or oily, suggesting water pollution.\n\nIn the center and background of the image, industrial structures are visible. These include a large plant with multiple buildings featuring long horizontal shapes and vertical stacks emitting smoke or steam into the sky. This creates a stark juxtaposition between the natural environment in the foreground and the industrial activity in the background.\n\nThe overall composition highlights environmental issues, drawing attention to the impact of industrial activities on natural water bodies and their surroundings. The weather appears overcast, contributing to the somber mood of the scene.","title":"Contaminated drainage surrounding the tenneco carbon black plant near the olin-mathieson plant","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["550694","546206","551562","547907","552019","545854","552127","551559","544779","546117","552210","544784","544175","544294","552080","550193"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["polluted","foamy","surroundings","canal","stick","emitte","pollute","issue","trash","flank"]}
