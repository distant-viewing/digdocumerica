{"path":"556025.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a middle-aged Caucasian man, dressed in a grey work uniform and a red cap, struggling to maneuver a large, overloaded baggage cart at a train station. The cart is piled high with various suitcases and bags, which appear heavy and bulky. The man is bent forward slightly, exerting effort to push or steer the cart, and his facial expression suggests concentration or strain.\n\nIn the background, a train with a red and blue stripe can be seen parked under an industrial metal bridge structure, suggesting the setting is the exterior area of a busy train station. The ground is dark and appears to be wet, possibly from recent rain, and it reflects light, adding to the atmosphere of a bustling, active transport hub. The photograph captures a moment of everyday work life, emphasizing themes of labor and the movement of people and goods in an urban setting.","title":"Redcap unloading baggage at union station in Kansas City Missouri.
