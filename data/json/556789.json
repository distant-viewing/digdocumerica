{"path":"556789.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a bus during daylight hours. The primary focus is on a male standing near the front of the bus, presumably either entering or navigating within the vehicle. He wears a light orange shirt, dark pants, and white sneakers, supporting himself by holding onto a vertical handrail.\n\nThe bus interior features rows of seats on either side, occupied by various passengers. The seats are metal-framed, and the passengers appear engaged in quiet, individual activities typical for a bus ride. Notably, the atmosphere inside the bus seems calm and ordinary.\n\nIn the background, through the bus’s front windshield, a glimpse of the outside world can be seen, indicating that the bus might be either in a station or in traffic. Near the bus driver’s area, a \"NO SMOKING\" sign is visible, emphasizing the bus's regulations.\n\nThe overall composition of this image, along with natural lighting filtering through the windows, creates a candid and everyday feel, emphasizing a common scene in public transportation.","title":"Passenger heads for a seat on a Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) bus in Atlanta, Georgia.","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["556797","556745","556756","556739","556795","556743","556747","554241","554264","556748","553796","555978","556762","556796","556034","556793"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["bus","passenger","smoking","handrail","sneaker","regulation","windshield","filtering","seat","enter"]}
