{"path":"542666.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a middle-aged male scientist working attentively in a laboratory setting. The man, who appears focused, is dressed in a formal white shirt with his sleeves rolled up, demonstrating a professional yet hands-on approach. He wears black-rimmed glasses and is seen adjusting or examining a piece of laboratory equipment, possibly a flask or a distillation setup, supported by metal stands.\n\nSurrounding the scientist is a clutter of various laboratory glassware, including flasks, beakers, and tubes interconnected with each other, likely for an experiment involving the distillation or chemical reaction processes. The background is somewhat blurred but shows racks filled with other laboratory supplies and equipment, suggesting a well-used and functional laboratory environment.\n\nThe lighting in the image highlights the scientist and the glass equipment, focusing on the intricate details of the setup and the serious expression of the scientist. This setting provides a glimpse into the day-to-day work in a scientific or chemical research lab.","title":"Edgar stephens, professor of environmental science at the statewide air pollution research center","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["546277","555280","546284","549349","549605","555281","543801","545002","555250","546278","549608","549604","555251","549612","551594","549333"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["laboratory","scientist","distillation","flask","equipment","setup","glassware","reaction","interconnect","rim"]}
