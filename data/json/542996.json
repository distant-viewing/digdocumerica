{"path":"542996.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking aerial view of a river delta. The river, dark in color, snakes through the landscape, creating intricate patterns and shapes as it branches and rejoins while flowing toward the bottom of the image. Its banks are irregular and bordered by various sediments and possibly vegetation, suggesting a dynamic environment where water flow alters the shape of the land.\n\nThe surrounding landscape comprises broad areas of brownish land, which appear barren or sparsely vegetated, contrasting sharply with the dark hues of the river. The upper portion of the image shows glimpses of greener areas that could be fields, possibly used for agriculture, hinting at some human activity or modification of the landscape.\n\nIn the foreground, at the bottom of the image, there is what appears to be a ridge frosted with either thin snow or salt deposits, indicating climatic conditions that may support such features. The texture of this ridge is rough and uneven, and it clearly defines the boundary of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the contrasting textures and colors of the natural environment, highlighting the fluid and evolving interaction between water and land. This combination of natural elements creates a visually complex tableau that captures the essence of a river delta's ecological and geological importance.","title":"The Lake Earl area, one of three principal migratory bird stop and feed areas on the Pacific Coast, is presently under pressure from developers.","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["546355","552924","550582","550392","546351","557506","549081","550545","552908","550457","550597","544744","555753","550885","547227","552838"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","ridge","land","bottom","modification","shape","fluid","tableau","salt","snake"]}
