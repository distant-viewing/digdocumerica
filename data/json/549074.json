{"path":"549074.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph is an aerial shot of a large, sinuous body of water passing through a rugged terrain. The water is a deep blue contrasted against the brown and gray hues of the arid landscape. On one side of the lake, thereâ€™s a dam, identifiable by its distinct structure and the road running across it. Below the dam, a river continues its course between the barren hills. The surrounding terrain is rough, with variations in elevation and sparse vegetation, indicating a desert-like environment.\n\nSeveral smaller bodies of water branch off from the main lake, creating an intricate pattern of waterways. Facilities that appear to be related to the dam, such as buildings and roads, are visible near the water's edges, demonstrating human activity and infrastructure. The sky is clear, hinting at the photograph being taken on a bright sunny day. The horizon extends into a vast, open landscape, emphasizing the isolation and the expansive nature of the setting.","title":"Davis Dam on Colorado River.
