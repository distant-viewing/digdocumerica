{"path":"544542.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene on a large bridge overlooking a water body. The bridge is constructed of concrete and metal, featuring a sturdy guardrail and a series of thick, vertical beams supporting an overhead frame. The bridge's walkway is broad and paved, indicating it might be used for both pedestrian and possibly vehicular traffic.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a distant individual is visible, dressed casually and involved in an activity that could be either walking or fishing, given the context of the locationâ€”near a body of water. This figure is far down the length of the bridge, adding a human element to the otherwise structural scene.\n\nThe surrounding environment is natural and tranquil, with a broad expanse of calm water reflecting the sky, and lush greenery visible at the far ends of the view. The sky above is clear and vividly blue, suggesting a beautiful, sunny day.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of quiet leisure and the strength of man-made architecture integrated into a natural landscape.","title":"Fred Dayhoff, park ranger, at S-12A structure which releases water to feed into park areas.","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557969","547669","552846","542555","548064","551527","543087","557096","546810","558015","549547","548207","558051","552598","546870","549469"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["bridge","strength","guardrail","concrete","walkway","length","pedestrian","end","beam","fishing"]}
