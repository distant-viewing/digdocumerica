{"path":"546011.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a natural setting featuring various plants. At the forefront, there are clusters of leaves with distinct, vibrant autumn colors ranging from golden yellow to deep orange. These leaves appear small, round, and are tightly packed along the branches of a shrub. The branches of the shrub are slender and brown, slightly covered by the densely packed leaves.\n\nAround and behind this shrub, we can see other types of foliage including leaves with a bright green color and a more elongated, serrated edge, suggesting different plant species within the same area. The background is slightly blurred due to the focus on the shrub with yellow and orange leaves, yet it hints at a lush, green environment, likely a densely vegetated area, possibly a forest or garden during the autumn season.\n\nThe light appears to be natural, possibly filtered through the canopy of trees above, creating a soft, diffused illumination over the scene, which accentuates the warm tones of the autumn leaves. The overall composition gives a sense of tranquility and the beauty of natureâ€™s seasonal change.","title":"Plant life in photographer's yard","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552693","554735","554727","554743","554744","557165","554736","557127","550603","546090","558074","554730","554739","554668","554715","554737"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leave","shrub","autumn","pack","branch","illumination","plant","specie","vegetate","yellow"]}
