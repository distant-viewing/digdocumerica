{"path":"548771.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a moment aboard a boat, with a vibrant blue ocean in the background, embodying a picturesque day for sea exploration or education. The primary focus of the image is on a large informational board titled \"John Pennekamp Coral Reef Park.\" This board includes a variety of elements important for educational or touristic purposes.\n\nThe board displays several sections, with a central, prominent map showing the geographical layout of a coral reef area, labeled with various points of interest and depths, colored in shades of red and blue to denote different underwater zones. Surrounding this map are numerous smaller images in a structured grid layout. These images appear to represent the biodiversity of the coral reef, including various species of fish, coral formations, and other marine life, providing visual insights into the underwater ecosystem.\n\nIn the foreground, part of a person is visible from behind, looking attentively at the board. This individual is wearing a diving mask pushed up onto their head, suggesting they are likely a diver or snorkeler, possibly preparing for or returning from an underwater excursion. The top part of a scuba snorkel is also visible, reinforcing the aquatic nature of their activities.\n\nThe photograph suggests an educational or preparatory scenario where individuals on the boat are briefed or educated about the marine environment they are exploring or going to explore, emphasizing conservation and environmental awareness. The setting and equipment hint at a blend of leisure and learning, aimed at enriching the experiences of visitors to the coral reef park.","title":"Diver with group of shell oil scientists at john pennekamp coral reef state park near key largo examines a map of the underwater preserve","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["557481","548681","555834","548770","549265","555833","555830","548680","555832","552275","548714","546308","549616","543181","552861","544129"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["board","map","explore","layout","snorkel","awareness","reef","diver","education","excursion"]}
