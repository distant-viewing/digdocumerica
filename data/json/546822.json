{"path":"546822.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of environmental pollution and neglect. In the foreground, there are two overturned, large industrial refrigerators spilling their contents onto the muddy ground. These refrigerators are filled with assorted debris and waste, including crumpled papers, bottles, and other unidentifiable refuse, suggesting they have been used as makeshift dumpsters.\n\nThe setting is a wet, possibly flood-hit area, as evidenced by water surrounding the scene and submerging parts of the foreground and background. Behind the refrigerators, a metal fence partially encloses the area, and to the left, a railing along what appears to be a waterside promenade is visible.\n\nIn the background, there is a large, elongated wooden warehouse building built on stilts over water. The structure shows signs of wear and disrepair, with its wooden siding aged and weathered. The water surrounding it suggests this might be a waterfront or a flooded area. The overall atmosphere is dreary, with overcast skies and no visible vegetation or wildlife, highlighting a scene of decay and environmental distress.\n\nThe image captures the impact of human industrial activity on natural water bodies and the neglect of waste management in what could potentially be an industrial or semi-abandoned waterfront area.","title":"Painting the Silva while it is berthed at Port Covington terminal in Baltimore Harbor.
