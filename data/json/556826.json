{"path":"556826.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph features a close-up of a human hand with several items resting in the palm. The hand is open, showing the palm and slightly curled fingers, indicating a relaxed posture. In the center of the hand lie three coins. Two coins are stacked atop each other, and they show clear inscriptions and symbols, suggesting a specific currency although not immediately identifiable. The third coin is positioned slightly apart from the others, resting on its edge between the thumb and forefinger, giving a profile view that displays its thickness and edge design.\n\nThe image has a monochrome blue-tinted appearance, which sets a calm, almost serene mood. The background is uniformly blurred and featureless, ensuring the focus remains solely on the hand and coins. There are no distinguishing marks or accessories on the hand, making it difficult to infer anything about the person's identity or background from this angle.\n\nOverall, the composition accentuates simplicity and the details of human interaction with everyday objects like coins, potentially symbolizing themes of giving, receiving, trade, financial transactions, or personal wealth management.","title":"Three 35-cent tokens which are used in the New York city transit authority operated subway.
