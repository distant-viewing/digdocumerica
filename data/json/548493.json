{"path":"548493.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a large, intricately constructed bird's nest resting atop a red buoy floating on a body of water. The buoy has a white structure, likely a light, mounted on its top. Within the nest, there is one large bird, possibly an osprey, standing and looking vigilant. The bird's feathers are primarily dark with white speckles, suggesting it might be a juvenile. The nest is made up of an array of twigs, branches, and other natural materials, densely packed to form a substantial base.\n\nIn the background, the open water suggests a lake or coastal environment. On one side of the image, a blurred, green landmass is visible at a distance, possibly an island or a distant shoreline. The sky is clear, hinting at good weather conditions. The focus and composition emphasize the interaction between human-made structures and wildlife adaptation, capturing a moment where nature has made a home in a modified environment.","title":"Atop a channel marker in Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548490","548501","548505","548497","544513","544505","553876","544489","544501","549896","549231","542919","544547","548728","544539","557495"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","buoy","speckle","adaptation","landmass","feather","twig","island","wildlife","base"]}
