{"path":"548222.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph features a sunset scene captured on a sandy landscape, possibly a beach or dune area. The silhouette of two people can be seen standing in the middle distance on a raised embankment, their outlines blurred and backlit by the setting sun which casts a warm glow and highlights scattered clouds in the sky. \n\nThe foreground is dominated by rough, textured sand, appearing uneven and trodden, lit by the low sunlight which accentuates its rough contours. A stark post stands on the left side in the foreground, adding a vertical element to the composition. \n\nOn the right side, a small house with a steep roof and a chimney is visible atop an adjacent rise, partially silhouetted against the bright sky, suggesting a rural or semi-secluded setting. Other faint posts appear along the horizon line, and a small seated figure can be discerned to the left of the two standing figures. The overall atmosphere is serene and slightly moody, enhanced by the fading light and shadowy figures.","title":"Crane's beach, a federally-protected dune preserve, between essex and ipswich","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["543417","548230","547716","550288","552331","550296","547479","542890","548221","545203","545199","549847","554075","557509","547624","545207"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["figure","post","tread","embankment","silhouette","dune","standing","discern","contour","chimney"]}
