{"path":"545135.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene in a sandy, outdoor area that appears to be a recreational or off-road spot. On the left side of the image, there is a man standing next to a motorcycle and a yellow balloon trapped under the bike's front wheel. The man holding the motorcycle is seated and appears to be engaged in an activity involving the balloon and the bike, possibly a game or a trial to balance or burst the balloon. Another man stands nearby observing the activity. Both individuals are dressed in casual clothing suitable for outdoor activities.\n\nTo the right of the image, there is an old-model pickup truck with a distinctive light blue color. The truck features rugged, off-road tires, emphasized by the \"Sand Command\" lettering visible on the sidewall of the tire closest to the viewer. The license plate of the truck is from Oregon as indicated by the visible text.\n\nThe setting includes sparse vegetation, primarily small trees and bushes in the background, suggesting a region with sandy soil, possibly near a coastal or desert area. The overall atmosphere is informal and depicts a moment perhaps of leisure or playful experimentation with the motorcycle and balloon in a natural, outdoorsy setting. The lighting indicates either early morning or late afternoon, with hints of a cloudy or overcast sky.","title":"Motorcyclist receives ticket for riding on the National Seashore Park sand dunes.","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["545598","554877","545596","550935","543211","545150","554876","545094","553955","553662","545134","546104","551108","553056","548690","543207"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["balloon","motorcycle","bike","truck","tire","experimentation","license","pickup","game","plate"]}
