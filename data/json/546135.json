{"path":"546135.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a rural or semi-industrial scene featuring two prominent pumpjacks (oil well pumps) in the foreground, set against a field of wildflowers and dense green trees in the background. The pumpjacks, commonly referred to as \"nodding donkeys\" due to their head-like motion, are painted yellow and black, indicating their functional status, and they appear weathered, suggesting active but long-term use.\n\nIn the background, parallel to the pumpjacks, there's a large, somewhat rusted and weathered billboard advertising \"Donnell Pipe & Supply Co.\" The text on the billboard includes the words \"OFFICE\", \"TESTING\", \"SHOPPING\" and points towards the location related to the pump operationâ€”likely marking the nearby office or shop of the company managing these oil wells.\n\nThe natural environment is lush, with a mix of tall green trees filling the background, indicating a temperate climate. The foreground is overgrown with wildflowers and grasses, lending a slightly neglected or natural state to the area around the mechanical equipment.\n\nThe overall impression is of a working landscape where industrial and natural elements coexist, possibly indicative of a region where oil extraction is a significant activity. The scene is sunlit, with a clear sky suggesting warm, fair weather conditions.","title":"Abandoned oil field","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["549207","549208","546182","549209","549211","546179","546201","545827","544272","546064","546204","545815","546196","545963","542552","546168"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["oil","pump","billboard","wildflower","office","status","testing","shopping","advertising","extraction"]}
