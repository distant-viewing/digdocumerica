{"path":"549269.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor, urban setting with a few people engaged in different activities. There are concrete structures that appear to be part of an overpass or a similar infrastructure, complete with large supporting columns and beams. Two of the columns have visible graffiti.\n\nTo the left, two older men stand conversing near the base of the stairway that leads up to the overpass. The stairs form a dark shadow over the area where they stand, which contrasts the brighter daylight illuminating the surroundings.\n\nTo the right, another older man is actively sweeping the ground with a long broom. He is bending over, focused on cleaning debris near the corner of a column. Nearby, a young child, who is seated in a stroller, watches the man sweep while being attended to by an adult, likely a parent, standing next to the stroller. The child and the attendant are under the shadow of the structure, giving a sense of a casual, everyday life scene.\n\nThere is a chain-link fence in the background enclosing an area, and beyond that, several residential buildings, including one with distinct siding that faces the scene. Also noticeable is a parked car, which appears to be a station wagon from the era when the photo was taken, adding to the historical ambiance.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of ordinary urban life, possibly in a community setting, with elements of maintenance and casual supervision of a child outdoors.","title":"Matthew Vieira cleans up after Massport (Massachusetts Port Authority) fenced in their lot as he had requested.
