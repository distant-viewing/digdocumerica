{"path":"543132.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint street view focused on a window display of a building. The prominent feature in the window is a decorative piece with a slogan “Love One Another” surrounded by a floral design, conveying a message of peace and positivity. \n\nBelow this window decoration is a poster featuring a scenic image, possibly depicting a winter landscape with a structure that resembles part of a bridge or pier, overlayed with white lettering that appears to be signatures.\n\nOn the window glass, a small white paper is visible, which could be a note or a price tag, suggesting that the items displayed might be for sale.\n\nThe building itself is painted in a soft yellow and adorned with a taupe trim. The address, \"844,\" is mounted in metal numbers next to the window, providing a clear indication of the building’s location.\n\nIn front of the window, there is a small, thin tree which does not seem very healthy as it has sparse foliage, placed amidst a vibrant arrangement of flowering plants featuring red and yellow blooms.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph reflects a serene and inviting storefront, possibly a small business that emphasizes community and aesthetic appeal through its charming display and floral decorations. The environment suggests a peaceful neighborhood setting, inviting passersby to reflect on the positive message displayed.","title":"California--Cannery Row, Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["550031","557804","550115","556448","548242","557156","551722","548232","542802","549289","557656","551753","557806","556182","543028","551685"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["window","decoration","message","display","address","slogan","passersby","price","tag","indication"]}
