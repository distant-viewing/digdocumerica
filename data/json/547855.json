{"path":"547855.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a nostalgic scene at an A&W Drive-In restaurant, reminiscent of mid-20th century America. In the foreground is a menu stand, showing a large variety of options including beverages, floats, and food items such as burgers and sandwiches with prices listed next to them in cents. The menu images and texts are vivid and colorful, featuring items like root beer floats and coffee.\n\nTo the right, we see a bright yellow vintage car, adding to the nostalgic feel of the image. A tray attached to the side window of the car holds a meal consisting of a sandwich and what looks like a root beer float, typical fare for a drive-in dining experience. Inside the car, a man is visible, sitting in the driverâ€™s seat, wearing sunglasses and casually engaged in the act of eating, his focus directed towards something in front of him off-camera.\n\nThe background features another part of the restaurant and part of another vehicle, enhancing the busy, social atmosphere typical to drive-in locations. The design elements, from the typography on the menu to the architecture of the stand and the cars' retro designs, all evoke a sense of the past, making the scene both historical and vibrant.","title":"Drive-in restaurant","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547862","552614","547851","548544","555422","554188","554482","546183","554187","555438","556816","551085","550093","549113","555506","558136"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["menu","float","sandwich","beer","restaurant","root","stand","car","drive","option"]}
