{"path":"557933.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor setting where a small family is spending time together. In the foreground, there is a grassy area with a picnic table at which two adults and a child are seated. One adult, appearing to be a woman, is interacting with the child who is sitting on a small, wheeled toy vehicle, possibly a tricycle. The other adult, presumably a man, is sitting opposite them. There is a portable barbecue grill next to the table, suggesting they might be having a cookout.\n\nIn the background, there are two brick buildings with multiple windows and greenery climbing some of the walls, portraying a quaint and peaceful residential area. The scene is framed by overhanging branches at the top, which adds a nice touch of nature and partially shades the family. The environment feels relaxed and leisurely, typical of a warm, sunny day outdoors.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a charming family moment in a casually picturesque setting, typical of a community park or similar public space designed for relaxation and recreation.","title":"Picnickers outside the Jonathan Hale Homestead, a red brick house built in 1826 near Bath and Akron, Ohio. It forms the nucleus of the Hale Farm and overlooks 178 acres of fields, pastures and virgin woods. Near the house is the Western Reserve Village, a 19th century community being reconstructed with original buildings moved from different sites in the area. This historic area is a part of the 30,000 acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area between Akron and Cleveland.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["551027","547398","552033","547756","545228","546224","552036","552821","556298","558187","551004","544310","553065","542727","556531","555947"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["family","adult","table","tricycle","toy","grill","child","sit","picnic","spend"]}
