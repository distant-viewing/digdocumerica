{"path":"543797.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a person working inside what appears to be a laboratory setting. The individual, a man wearing glasses and a T-shirt, is visible through a transparent protective safety barrier, focusing intently on his task. He is adjusting or examining equipment, which includes a water tap and a glass container placed on a metal tray, potentially part of an experiment or a procedure.\n\nThe setting includes typical laboratory elements such as the white, sterile-looking surfaces and some items in the background that suggest a controlled scientific environment. The use of a protective barrier indicates the need for either contamination prevention or protection from potentially hazardous materials. The image captures a moment of concentrated scientific work, bathed in natural light from a sunlight source outside the frame, which highlights the clarity and intensity of the laboratory work environment.","title":"Lab technician at secondary treatment sewage plant","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["543801","542666","546278","546284","546277","551594","549607","549608","555251","549605","549333","549612","549332","546287","549342","555249"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["laboratory","barrier","procedure","tray","contamination","glass","experiment","need","protection","work"]}
