{"path":"554359.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of environmental neglect featuring scattered trash in a natural setting. The foreground prominently shows a muddy area littered with various pieces of garbage, such as metal scrap, paper, plastic bags, and bottles. Behind the littered area is dense vegetation, predominantly tall grass and bushes, suggesting an untended, wild area.\n\nIn the background, the iconic Statue of Liberty is visible, providing a stark contrast between the symbol of freedom and the foreground of pollution and disarray. This juxtaposition likely serves as a strong visual commentary on environmental issues in the vicinity of such a national symbol. The overall atmosphere is somber due to the muted colors and the overcast lighting, enhancing the photo's critical message about pollution and neglect.","title":"New Jersey flats near Hoboken.
