{"path":"555270.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling cargo port scene from an elevated perspective. The composition prominently features a large cargo ship loaded with numerous stacked containers, which are primarily red, with some being blue or brown. The photo provides a view of the shipâ€™s deck filled with neatly arranged containers, showcasing the scale and capability of modern shipping methods.\n\nIn the foreground, the topmost containers create a structured pattern across the frame. Toward the right side, a large, industrial crane extends over these containers, suggesting ongoing loading or unloading activities. The crane's structure, characterized by a series of beams and cables, adds a technical element to the scene.\n\nThe background consists of calm water reflecting dazzling sunlight. On the left side, a tugboat or small work boat is seen cutting through the water, leaving a wake pattern that textures the water surface. Beyond the immediate confines of the port, the opposite shoreline is visible, though details are minimal and focus on the industrial or port-related structures can be speculated.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is strong, with high contrast that enhances the reflective sparkle on the water and creates deep shadows beneath the containers and crane, emphasizing the depth and three-dimensional aspect of the loaded ship. The overall mood conveys a sense of industry, motion, and interconnectedness in global trade activities.","title":"Containers on a dock at the port of Newark, New Jersey await ships for transport to their destination.","placename":"New Jersey","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555271","555283","555760","550906","546881","546828","551577","555261","555260","550910","552303","555285","552200","553742","555811","547998"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["container","port","ship","crane","cargo","capability","trade","method","confine","unloading"]}
