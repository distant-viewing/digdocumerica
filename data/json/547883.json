{"path":"547883.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing scene involving a person and a significantly damaged vehicle. The vehicle, which appears to be an old car stripped of its paint and partially rusted, lies amidst a growth of wild greenery. The person, visible from the back, seems to be working or investigating something on the car, focusing intently on their task.\n\nThe individual, a young male, is leaning over a large rectangular opening at the back of the vehicle, where normally an engine might be located. He is holding a red plastic container which he seems to be either filling with something from within the car or using to pour something into the car.\n\nThe setting is outdoor, indicated by natural light and the presence of wild plants growing around and even within the vehicle, suggesting that the car has been in this spot for some time. The background is a stark, textured wall, possibly made of stucco, which provides a simple, unobtrusive backdrop that further accentuates the central focus of the image.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the person and the dilapidated car against the texture of nature and man-made structures, portrays a sense of abandonment, curiosity, and possibly a story of salvaging or repurposing from the remains.","title":"Abandoned tractor near Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553489","553007","548752","547587","547747","549272","549107","549273","546249","552995","553008","545540","550797","553010","554302","550795"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","vehicle","person","back","stucco","remain","engine","opening","curiosity","male"]}
