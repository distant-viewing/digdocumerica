{"path":"548446.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a striking juxtaposition between classic residential urban architecture and modern aviation. A large passenger airplane, adorned with red and white stripes, is in mid-flight and appears to be positioned very close to traditional multi-story residential buildings. The plane is angled in such a way that it seems to be flying incredibly low over these buildings.\n\nThe buildings themselves are old-style apartments with flat roofs and multiple balconies adorned with railings. Each building features a distinctive bay window structure, and they are painted in different colors, adding variety to the architectural facade. The windows show signs of everyday life such as blinds, curtains, and items on the balconies.\n\nIn the background, the sky is clear with scattered clouds, which accentuates the surreal and somewhat unnerving proximity of the large plane to the residential area. This placement might raise questions about noise and safety concerns for residents living in such close quarters to an airplane flight path.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image brings together elements of urban living with the dynamics of modern transportation, showcasing a scenario that highlights the encroachment of technological advancements into residential spaces.","title":"Near Logan airport--airplane coming in for landing over frankfort street at lovell street intersection","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548484","548447","548448","548486","553888","548469","548485","550156","550160","548481","548445","542672","547824","542673","544606","544610"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["plane","airplane","flight","balcony","advancement","noise","quarter","blind","question","aviation"]}
