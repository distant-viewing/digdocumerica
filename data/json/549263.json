{"path":"549263.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic maritime landscape. In the foreground, we see a large boat, the \"Vila Velebita,\" cruising over a body of water. The boat has a dark hull with the name painted in white, and it features a predominantly white superstructure. There are two visible crew members on the boat deck, dressed in casual wear, appearing to be engaged in typical maritime activities.\n\nBehind the boat, on a hilly elevation, is an old town creating a picturesque backdrop. Prominently featured is an elegant building with a bell tower, which could be a church or cathedral due to its architectural style, including arched windows and a spire topped with what looks like a statue. The surrounding architecture has a classical European feel, with visible houses built closely together, displaying varying light colors and historic styles.\n\nThe area is lush with greenery, with trees like cypresses adding to the Mediterranean ambiance. The weather appears to be overcast, giving the scene a soft, muted lighting which enhances the timeless feel of the setting. The overall composition of the photograph, combining elements of human activity, historical architecture, and natural beauty, presents a tranquil and harmonious seascape.","title":"The Vila Velebite II, the hydrobiological research ship of the Ruder Boskovic Institute, conducts several scientific projects for EPA.","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["549264","549371","549377","545057","549266","549362","542878","542907","542876","549414","557416","554101","542903","542872","542910","542877"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","superstructure","bell","spire","seascape","architecture","statue","crew","member","church"]}
