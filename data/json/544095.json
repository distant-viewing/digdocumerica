{"path":"544095.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photo captures a group of people observing a large mining pit. In the foreground, a person wearing a white shirt, green vest, and brown pants leans over a large black metal object labeled \"ANACONDA TWIN BUTTES,\" which sits on wooden beams. They are wearing a hard hat, implying a safety requirement at this site.\n\nTo the right, three individuals are facing away from the camera, looking out towards the vast pit. They are dressed in typical 1970's attire, including hats for sun protection. Two of the three women are wearing dresses, one in pink and the other in a dark skirt with a striped shirt, and the third person is in light-colored capri pants and a patterned blouse.\n\nThe landscape in the backdrop is desolate and expansive, showing off the wide-open scenery typical of large-scale mining operations with minimal vegetation, and the soil is visibly arid. Distant mountain formations rise slightly on the horizon under a bright blue sky, illustrating a stark, dry environment that contrasts with the group's focused attention on the site.","title":"Tourists at the Anaconda Co.'s Twin Buttes mine gaze into the 1,100 ft. deep, one-half mile wide, open pit mine.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["544108","549242","549241","555621","544100","544054","543758","554631","544112","549167","544785","544103","553049","549172","544111","549177"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["pit","mining","site","pant","hat","protection","pink","group","vest","person"]}
