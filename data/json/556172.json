{"path":"556172.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures an intimate indoor setting featuring two individuals apparently enjoying a lighthearted moment together. The person on the left, wearing a yellow t-shirt and a blue hat with a logo, is holding several U.S. dollar bills in their hands, with a playful expression on their face. The person on the right, clad in a striking patterned robe or blanket and a dark wide-brimmed hat, is also holding a dollar bill. The lighting is dim, casting deep shadows and highlighting the vivid colors of their clothing against a dark background. In the background, there appears to be a closet or an open wardrobe containing various items of clothing. The overall mood of the scene is candid and cheerful, emphasizing a sense of camaraderie or shared amusement between the two individuals.","title":"Black family count their cash in their apartment in South Side Chicago.
