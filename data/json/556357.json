{"path":"556357.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a miner at work, set in what looks to be an underground environment typical of a mine. The miner, a man, is focused on his task, illuminated by a lamp attached to his helmet. He is wearing dark, possibly oil-stained clothing that includes a heavy jacket and a protective helmet, suggesting a work environment that requires durability and safety gear.\n\nHe is standing next to a large, rugged metallic structure that appears to be part of the mining equipment or a vehicle used within the mine. Due to the photograph's lighting, details are concentrated on the man and his immediate surroundings, leaving the rest of the scene in shadows, which adds a bit of mystery and focuses the attention on him and his activity.\n\nThe miner's face is turned downwards as if inspecting something within the structure or perhaps operating some machinery. His posture and the concentration visible on his face highlight the laborious nature of his work. There is a touch of light reflecting off various surfaces near him, such as his helmet and parts of the metallic structure, which provides some depth and texture to the image.\n\nThe background is mostly engulfed in darkness with only faint hints of further structures or equipment, suggesting the deep, enclosed space of the mine where ambient light is scarce. This could indicate the photograph was taken during an active operation within the mine, potentially capturing a routine but vital aspect of a miner's day-to-day work life in such an environment.","title":"George King, long wall section foreman in Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #3 near Richlands, Virginia, looks at a conveyor belt coming from a working section of the mine. The white material is lime or rock dust to keep down the amount of coal dust in the air. Some 3,000 tons of coal per day pass over this belt on the way to the cleaning plant. Long wall mining is relatively new and allows about twice as much coal to be mined but is expensive because of machinery.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556358","556364","543775","556396","556366","556319","556515","556360","556367","556397","556359","556510","556363","556511","556329","556345"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Miner"],"terms":["miner","mine","helmet","work","face","equipment","mystery","darkness","oil","structure"]}
