{"path":"545426.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic industrial landscape under a dusky or twilight sky. In the foreground, there's a gas station marked by a lit sign reading \"PARADE\" next to other neon signs displaying gas prices and advertising a car wash. A quiet street extends in front of the station, with a few parked cars and minimal traffic apparent.\n\nDominating the background are multiple tall industrial structures, including several large smokestacks from which thick plumes of dark smoke are being emitted. The smoke billows into the sky, creating a stark contrast with the pink and purple hues of the evening sky. This suggests the photo could be capturing pollution from an industrial plant.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes everyday city life exemplified by the gas station against a backdrop of heavy industry and environmental impact, encapsulated by the smoke filling the sky. The scene elicits a sense of quiet amidst industrial busyness and environmental concerns.","title":"Fairfield plant of u.s.
