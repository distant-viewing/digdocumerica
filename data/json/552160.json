{"path":"552160.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet industrial scene focused mainly on log storage in a water basin. The long, snow-dusted logs are densely packed and aligned parallel to one another, dominating the foreground. Sections of the logs are submerged in water, creating reflective surfaces that mirror bits of the sky and the snowy logs themselves. Patches of snow settled on top of the logs add a wintry feel to the scene.\n\nIn the background, an imposing mountain with a snow-capped peak rises above the horizon, adding a majestic natural element to an otherwise industrial tableau. This mountain, lightly shrouded in clouds, lends a sense of scale and grandeur to the composition.\n\nThe industrial environment is augmented on either side by visible infrastructure: cranes, docks, and other equipment related to the logging industry occupy the mid to far background, hinting at ongoing activities related to the handling and processing of these logs.\n\nThe lighting in the photo, likely taken during dusk or dawn, casts a moody, blue-toned hue over the entire scene, which enhances the cold, snowy atmosphere. This lighting subtly plays up the contrast between the natural elements and the human-made industrial components in the photo.","title":"Logs rafted on Commencement Bay","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552174","552161","552197","542859","552163","552349","552162","546236","552249","545256","545036","545243","545260","542584","550321","552175"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","snow","parallel","basin","tableau","mountain","handling","grandeur","bit","dawn"]}
