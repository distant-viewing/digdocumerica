{"path":"544763.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a group of three men engaged in activities by a body of water, against a rugged natural landscape background.\n\nThe scene is set at a rocky shoreline, with a small gentle slope leading to calm water. The background prominently features a steep cliff or rock formation, indicative of a canyon or similar geographical feature. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a sunny day.\n\nThe men in the foreground are involved in some sort of logistical or exploratory activity, possibly related to environmental or geological work. They are dressed in outdoor, practical wear suitable for a fieldwork environment. Two of the men are positioned near a green boat on the water's edge; one is inside the boat, maneuvering or handling equipment, while the other stands beside it. The third man is active on the shoreline, holding a long, limp material that could be a hose or rope, suggesting they might be preparing or concluding some type of water-related work.\n\nNoteworthy in the composition is a metal construction crane stationed on the shore. It hints at operations that require heavy lifting, indicating the scope of work might be significant.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a moment of activity and preparation, possibly research-related, in a beautiful, remote outdoor setting. The inclusion of mechanical equipment implies that the work possibly involves significant interaction with the natural landscape.","title":"Small mining operation","placename":"Clear Creek County (Colo.)","location":"Clear Creek County, Colorado","nn1":["544755","546334","544770","547020","545666","544753","545658","545657","552861","549356","547033","548310","546307","545643","546302","544274"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["work","relate","conclude","shoreline","lifting","scope","fieldwork","man","inclusion","involve"]}
