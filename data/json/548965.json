{"path":"548965.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tender moment between two children outdoors, likely in a campground or a rustic outdoor setting. A young girl, wearing a white bikini paired with a floppy white summer hat, is climbing a metal pole. She is using both her hands and feet to ascend, showcasing playful determination. Assisting her or waiting for her turn is another child, who appears slightly younger, dressed in a light-colored T-shirt and matching shorts, also donning a white hat, though smaller and more fitted than the first child's. The hat styles and attire suggest a warm, sunny day conducive to outdoor play.\n\nThe setting is natural and somewhat wild, with specks of sunlight filtering through the foliage, casting soft patterns on the dirt ground where the children are playing. Behind them, dense shrubbery and a few trees provide a lush green backdrop, enhancing the sense of being in a natural environment. Further back, partially visible is a white caravan or trailer, suggesting this activity might be part of a camping trip or a family vacation in a rural setting.\n\nThe overall composition and mood of the photograph are quite evocative of childhood summer days, filled with simple, joyous activities. The focus on the children, along with the blurred background, highlights their innocence and the spontaneity of their play. The soft natural lighting adds a nostalgic, almost timeless quality to the image.","title":"Raising an oil-blackened foot from the polluted water of Lake Mead","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["547188","544354","543791","544200","549274","544207","551160","557410","543466","543677","543875","552702","543688","549674","556136","557409"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","play","hat","summer","determination","spontaneity","matching","innocence","vacation","bikini"]}
