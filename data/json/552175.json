{"path":"552175.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a river densely filled with large groupings of logs. The river makes a gentle bend as it traverses through the landscape. The logs are grouped into various rectangular configurations, secured by smaller, perpendicular logs, seemingly arranged for transport or processing.\n\nIn the background, a pastoral landscape with a small town is visible. Residential areas characterized by individual homes and green lawlets contrast distinctly against the industrial activity on the river. Beyond the town, agricultural fields stretch out towards the horizon where a striking mountain range with snow-capped peaks stands majestically. The sky is clear and blue, contributing to the overall vividness of the natural and human-made scenery.\n\nThe overall scene encapsulates a blend of natural beauty and industrial activity, hinting at economic practices such as logging that likely play a significant role in the local economy, set against the tranquil and picturesque setting of a rural landscape.","title":"Log rafts on Snohomish River at low tide","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551199","545152","552162","550330","550533","550327","547994","551195","548162","552163","542940","551603","552178","552140","550321","545036"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","town","river","grouping","configuration","economy","traverse","secure","vividness","practice"]}
