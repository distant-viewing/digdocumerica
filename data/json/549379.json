{"path":"549379.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph shows a focused young woman, likely a researcher or student, engaged in a scientific activity. She has long, straight dark hair and wears a white lab coat identified by a name tag reading \"CIM\". She is in a laboratory or classroom setting, evident from the background which includes what appears to be scientific posters and the wooden frame of a chalkboard.\n\nThe woman is closely examining a small bird, holding it with a pair of forceps in her left hand while manipulating it with another tool in her right. The bird is pinned, lying on its back, which suggests she might be conducting a dissection or anatomical study as part of a scientific or educational task. The focus and detail of the work imply a delicate and precise operation, possibly for biological or veterinary study. The setting and her attire emphasize a professional, educational environment dedicated to learning and scientific inquiry.","title":"Jasenka Pavicic studies the effects of heavy metals pollution on a small crab at the Ruder Boskovic Institute.","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["546288","546323","546327","549342","548860","548862","548891","542737","547710","546292","548856","548858","546328","549608","549607","549354"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["study","bird","inquiry","researcher","classroom","student","learning","tag","lab","poster"]}
