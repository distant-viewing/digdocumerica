{"path":"550820.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene at twilight, with the primary focus being a large factory or power plant located on the banks of a river. The factory has several structures, including a tall chimney from which dark smoke is billowing into the sky. The smoke contrasts starkly against the soft hues of the sunset.\n\nThe river in the foreground reflects the colors of the sky and the silhouettes of the buildings, creating a calm yet somber scene. The sky is painted in muted tones of orange, purple, and blue, typical of a setting sun, with scattered clouds that add depth and texture to the view.\n\nOn the far side of the river, partially obscured by the dusk, trees and some structures form a thin line, suggesting a distant landscape that borders the river opposite the factory. The overall mood of the image is somewhat melancholic, highlighting the environmental impact of industrial activity.","title":"Nekoosa Paper Company on the Wisconsin River.
