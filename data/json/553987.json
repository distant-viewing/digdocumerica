{"path":"553987.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image features a silhouette of mechanical parts against a twilight sky. A large wheel, possibly part of old machinery or an industrial setting, dominates the left side of the frame, displayed in outline due to backlighting. The wheel's form suggests that it might be a flywheel or part of a valve mechanism, given its spokes and circular shape. To the right and slightly lower, there are what appear to be levers or handles, standing vertically and showing cylindrical shapes against the sky. These elements suggest a manual operation component, typically seen in vintage or heavy-duty machinery.\n\nThe backdrop consists of a dusky sky, tinted with shades ranging from deep blue to purplish and hints of warmer tones near the top, likely indicating either dawn or dusk. A few bare branches of a tree are visible on the far right, partially obscured by the machinery, layering the composition with natural elements in contrast to the industrial foreground. This interplay emphasizes a juxtaposition between man-made machinery and the natural environment.","title":"Remains of abandoned wagon rest beside road on the \"Pineapple Island.\" 95 per cent of Lanai is owned by Castle and Cooke (formerly Dole Pineapple), and has only two highways.","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["546389","558365","554421","549592","558140","543121","546384","545418","544684","547090","548851","557231","547777","545430","545646","553621"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["machinery","wheel","lever","valve","backlighting","shape","mechanism","duty","tint","part"]}
