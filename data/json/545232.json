The man is wearing a pale yellow short-sleeved shirt and dark trousers, paired with a dark belt. His posture is relaxed and casual, leaning slightly back with one foot resting on the porch railing and both hands casually placed on the railing's edge. His expression conveys a sense of ease and attentiveness, possibly engaging in conversation.\n\nThe background shows a lush, verdant environment with dense greenery blending into a soft-focus, suggesting a quiet, secluded setting typical of a residential area surrounded by nature. The lighting suggests that it might be taken during the daytime due to the soft shadows and natural light illuminating the scene. The overall feel is serene, highlighting a moment of tranquility and casual interaction on a leisurely day.","title":"Harry Paget, environmentalist leader and president of local chapter of the isaac walton league","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["556489","556488","551269","558330","545524","547812","555580","551271","546209","556603","548660","552523","544219","557672","547792","552113"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["porch","railing","ease","attentiveness","foot","daytime","belt","rail","column","pair"]}
