{"path":"554901.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an intimate and serene moment between two people, likely a couple, who are lying down together near a body of water. The setting is tranquil, possibly in the late afternoon or early evening, given the soft, muted tones and the calm water reflecting light and surrounding trees.\n\nThe couple is resting on their sides, facing each other, on a grassy area beside the water. They are slightly intertwined, with the woman laying her head on the man's shoulder. The woman is wearing a white sleeveless top and denim shorts, and she has long, brown hair that sprawls across the man's chest. Her legs are bent and one sandal-clad foot can be seen.\n\nThe man is wearing a mustard-colored shirt and has brown hair. His arm is wrapped around the woman, contributing to the closeness of their pose.\n\nThe environment around them is natural and relatively undisturbed, with grass and small plants leading to the edge of the water. The focus and depth of field suggest a peaceful, isolated spot ideal for a couple to share a quiet moment away from the bustle of everyday life. The natural setting enhances the sense of privacy and detachment from the outside world. The overall mood of the photograph is one of tranquility, affection, and togetherness.","title":"Teenage couple embrace on the bank of the frio canyon river near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["552977","548465","548833","554900","551945","549471","548467","550238","551967","543950","543517","545489","549756","546320","551859","543951"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["couple","woman","affection","mustard","closeness","sandal","privacy","bent","bustle","hair"]}
