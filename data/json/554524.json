{"path":"554524.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts several fish, which appear to be trout, stacked inside a white bucket. The trout have a natural coloration, marked by patterns of dots and spots in shades of brown, yellow, and specks of red. They vary slightly in size and are positioned haphazardly, with some facing upwards showing their underbelly and others lying on their side, displaying a silvery flank.\n\nThe bucket is placed against a background of grass, suggesting an outdoor setting, likely near a fishing spot. The orientation and close-up focus on the bucket emphasize the fresh catch, indicative of a successful fishing trip. Overall, the image captures a typical angling outcome, highlighting both the beauty of the fish and the essence of recreational fishing.","title":"Plateful of fresh native brook trout before cooking.
