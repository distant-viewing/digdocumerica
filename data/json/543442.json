{"path":"543442.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking upward view of a forest of towering trees, likely redwoods or sequoias, given their thick, textured bark and immense height. The perspective is from the forest floor, looking directly up into the sky, which is mostly obscured by the dense canopy of lush green leaves. The trunks of the trees are strikingly vertical, leading the eye upwards along their length towards the small patches of sky visible through the treetops.\n\nThe bark of each tree has a rough texture, with variations in color ranging from dark brown to grayish hues. Some trunks show signs of weathering or moss, adding to the natural, untouched feel of the scene. The leaves at the top of the trees are sunlit, hinting at a bright day, with light filtering through in scattered patterns, creating a mix of light and shadow on the trunks.\n\nThe composition of the image, with trees at various angles but predominantly rising straight up, creates a sense of grandeur and the towering nature of the forest. It evokes a feeling of being small in comparison to the natural world, inviting the viewer to reflect on the age and majesty of these ancient giants. The overall mood is serene and awe-inspiring, typical of old-growth forests that have stood for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.","title":"California -- big basin redwood state park","placename":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park (Calif.)","location":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California","nn1":["542569","553576","554966","543449","542752","542745","554990","554967","542575","554968","554969","543447","542845","542725","554995","542930"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trunk","bark","towering","forest","redwood","treetop","comparison","tree","grayish","majesty"]}
