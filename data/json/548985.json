{"path":"548985.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural scene, primarily featuring a large piece of machinery that is actively engaged in harvesting grain. The machine, painted in red and rusty tones, appears to be a combine harvester with an extended arm that channels grain into a transport container. The arm is positioned over a trailer, effectively unloading a stream of grain into the trailer's bed. The grain is caught mid-air, portraying a dynamic and dusty atmosphere.\n\nThe environment around the machinery is a vast open field, which seems to be freshly harvested given the low stubble visible across the ground. The field extends into the horizon under a clear sky, suggesting an expansive rural setting. The lighting indicates it could be early morning or late afternoon, as the sun is low and casts long shadows while imbuing the scene with a golden hue.\n\nThe photo captures the essence of agricultural work, focusing on the machinery and the process of grain harvesting, without any visible human presence. The composition draws attention to this mechanized process in a vast, open landscape, emphasizing the mix of technology and nature.","title":"Harvesting barley grown in the Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548976","548982","548981","548964","548979","554044","547432","547730","555619","554045","549036","549046","549258","547436","551169","544888"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["grain","harvesting","trailer","machinery","harvester","arm","process","field","bed","technology"]}
