The man, who is only visible from the back and side, is wearing glasses and a yellow shirt. He is engaged in drawing or plotting on a large sheet of graph paper spread out in front of him.\n\nOn the desk, multiple objects related to drafting and measuring can be seen. These include a ruler, a T-square, a circular protractor, and a couple of other measuring tools with scales and slide adjustments. There are also documents, possibly calculations or instructions, scattered around the workspace. \n\nThe environment suggests a professional setting, potentially an architect's or engineer's office, indicated by the meticulous organization and the nature of the tools and documents. The focus and precision required for his task are palpable, highlighted by the array of precise tools and the attention to detail evident in his posture and engagement with his work.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552389","551899","556551","558220","546552","546281","542690","551897","556573","543745","543752","552356","556250","556399","551594","548455"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["document","tool","desk","engineer","adjustment","slide","instruction","precision","sheet","organization"]}
