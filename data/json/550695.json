{"path":"550695.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This is a photograph of a scenic, winding road surrounded by tall birch trees. The road curves gently through the scene, its asphalt surface marked by white and yellow lines delineating the lanes. The predominantly green surroundings suggest this image was captured in a heavily wooded area during a period when the trees were in full leaf, possibly in the summer months.\n\nThe trees on either side of the road feature white bark with black markings, typical of birch trees, and their slender, vertical trunks reach high, forming a somewhat closed canopy over the road. This creates a tunnel-like effect, enhancing the road's allure as it disappears into the distance. The light filters through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the road, and contributing to a serene and peaceful ambiance.\n\nNo people or moving vehicles are visible in the photograph, emphasizing the quiet and natural beauty of this wooded area. The perspective of the photo focuses on the curving path of the road, inviting the viewer's eye to follow it around the bend, creating a sense of wonder about what lies beyond. The overall composition and natural lighting highlight the tranquility and idyllic beauty of this forested route.","title":"Route 2 becomes a graceful avenue of birches near Shelburne on the Androscoggin River.","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["557010","557555","547659","548100","544860","550567","557528","554566","556579","556976","548099","544991","545262","557011","550614","551240"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","birch","allure","curve","month","wonder","delineate","disappear","tunnel","asphalt"]}
