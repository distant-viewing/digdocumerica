{"path":"543549.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph presents a natural scene, possibly captured from an aerial or elevated viewpoint. The majority of the image showcases a dense texture of brown foliage covering what seems to be a rugged terrain, suggesting a dense forest or a heavily vegetated hillside. The lower section of the frame transitions dramatically into a layer of large, chunky boulders or rocks. These rocks have a very light color, mainly white and grey, contrasting starkly with the dark brown of the vegetated area.\n\nThe composition is such that the boundary between the rocky area and the vegetated area runs diagonally across the image from the lower left to the upper right corner, creating a visual division between the two distinct textures and colors. This contrast highlights the natural variety in the landscape, possibly suggesting geological and botanical interactions such as a rocky riverbed adjacent to a forested area or a mountainous region gradually leading into a rockslide area.\n\nThe image is rich in detail, providing a textural depth that emphasizes the ruggedness of the natural environment. There are no visible human elements or activities; it's a pure depiction of nature's intricate patterns and rough beauty.","title":"Gradations of algae and silt from clear shore line  -  coast guard shore of lake tahoe","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["555029","545795","545724","545589","550395","555592","549151","558083","550478","551520","554410","543721","552685","542821","543185","550517"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["vegetate","division","riverbed","majority","ruggedness","rock","boulder","depiction","hillside","viewpoint"]}
