{"path":"544043.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph features a long stretch of highway extending into the distance, set in a wide and arid landscape. The highway is composed of two parallel roads, bifurcated by a central strip of desert terrain that includes sparse vegetation, a few scattered bushes, and the characteristic silhouette of several saguaro cacti, indicative of a desert environment possibly in the southwestern United States.\n\nThe road itself is empty apart from a few vehicles, which appear very small due to the expansive scale of the landscape. The road surfaces look worn, reflecting perhaps a harsh climate. The surrounding landscape is flat with scattered vegetation, primarily low bushes and a few more cacti, which add texture and a sense of isolation to the scene.\n\nIn the background, distant mountains, slightly hazy, rise against a muted sky, suggesting either the onset of dusk or the presence of dust in the air, common in desert areas. The scene conveys a sense of vastness and solitude, highlighting the expansive desert terrain and the road as a lonely connector slicing through the rugged environment.\n\nThe overall composition uses the leading lines of the road to draw the eye towards the horizon, creating a strong perspective and emphasizing the distance and desolation. The color palette is dominated by earth tones that blend with the natural environment, giving the photograph an intense and dramatic feel.","title":"The Brenda cutoff, Interstate 10.
