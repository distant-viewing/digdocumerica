{"path":"542924.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a layered landscape of forested hills, with variations in shadow and light creating a moody, almost surreal effect. The foreground features dense, dark green coniferous trees that form a thick forest. As the landscape recedes into the middle ground, the trees become somewhat sparser and lighter in color, possibly due to mist or a lighter variety of foliage.\n\nThe hills in the background are lighter and hazier, likely due to atmospheric perspective where particles in the air diminish color and contrast, making distant objects appear lighter and bluer. This effect gives the photograph a sense of depth. The sky is not clearly visible, but the overall lighting suggests either early morning or late evening, with low light conditions adding to the mystique of the scene.\n\nThere are no human activities or any apparent human presence in the photograph, which emphasizes a tranquil and untouched nature scene. The image has a serene, almost ethereal quality, accentuated by the soft transitions between the layers of hills and the calm, dense forest in the foreground.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555536","555119","553594","556587","548025","550602","542849","545012","542848","553593","555110","555133","556985","554398","556473","555126"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["hill","mystique","effect","particle","forest","variation","transition","mist","air","evening"]}
