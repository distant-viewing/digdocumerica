{"path":"548988.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is a beautiful and atmospheric photograph capturing a moment along the edge of a body of water, likely a lake or a broad river. The photo features a group of people standing on a pebbly shore. There are around a dozen individuals portrayed in silhouette against a bright backdrop, which provides a sense of intrigue and anonymity to the figures. One individual in the center seems to be wearing traditional attire, possibly including a cloak or shawl, which adds a cultural element to the scene.\n\nThe landscape around the group is relatively sparse; it appears arid or semi-arid, suggested by the mountains in the distant background and the quality of light which hints at a sunset or sunrise. The sunlight, reflecting on the wet stones and shallow water, creates sparkling highlights and gives texture to the water’s surface.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—with its focus on the figures set against the natural landscape and the striking natural light—provides a sense of tranquility and a moment of reflection. The scene might be depicting a social gathering or a communal activity such as a ritual or a casual group outing. The image effectively captures the harmony between humans and nature, and invites the viewer to contemplate the serene setting.","title":"Baptism ceremony performed by members of the \"Church of God in Christ\" of North Las Vegas.","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["548995","554477","547217","543892","549716","543203","544274","548826","550240","550236","552226","550826","548963","551389","547009","554759"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["group","anonymity","shawl","intrigue","dozen","harmony","figure","outing","sunrise","highlight"]}
