{"path":"552486.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of a weathered tombstone, primarily white with some visible signs of aging such as a buildup of dirt and moss, particularly notable at the relief features and the base. The tombstone is intricately designed with a pointed Gothic arch-style top. Within this pointed area, there is a semicircular feature housing a carved depiction which includes a cross. Below this, the centerpiece of the tombstone reads \"Bishop Chase\" followed by the numbers \"43 77\".\n\nThe stone stands on a larger base that includes a tiered platform with a darker, possibly metallic edging featuring ornate, rounded patterns that give an elegant finish to the lower portion. The immediate background is blurred but hints at greenery, suggesting that the tombstone is located in a grassy area, likely within a cemetery. The focus and framing on just the tombstone emphasize its textures and aging details, contributing to the solemn and historical ambiance depicted.","title":"Gravestone of bishop philander chase, founder of jubilee college in jubilee park","placename":"Kickapoo (Ill.)","location":"Kickapoo, Illinois","nn1":["554206","544259","552016","546098","557941","547417","554210","554792","558040","552451","557942","548239","546106","550365","552017","544267"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["tombstone","a","centerpiece","relief","desig","rounded","solemn","base","cemetery","featuring"]}
