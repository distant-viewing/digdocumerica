{"path":"553166.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a candid and informal moment of three young people hanging out in a public space. The setting is characterized by large geometric concrete structures, which they are using as impromptu seating. On the left, a young man and woman sit close together. The man has curly hair, wearing a sleeveless tank top and jeans with his shoes touching the concrete. The woman, dressed in a denim jacket and jeans, appears to be engaged in conversation with the man, gesturing as she talks.\n\nTo the right of them, another young woman sits alone, separated from the pair by a recess in the concrete structure. She has shoulder-length hair and wears a dark jacket over a lighter top with checkered pants. Her hands are clasped together and she is seated directly on the concrete ledge, her expression one of mid-speech or surprise, contributing a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph gives off a relaxed, possibly spontaneous vibe, enhanced by the casual dress and candid postures of the figures. The background includes blurred elements like greenery and the entrance to a building, indicating this could be an urban area. The focus on everyday life moments and architectural backdrop adds a human touch to the otherwise stark environment.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: seated on top of the air shaft of the underground garage--on a cool saturday afternoon","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551433","545358","546541","553167","549998","549909","553159","553164","553122","553185","552973","544325","553146","556525","553158","551450"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["concrete","candid","jeans","woman","recess","clasp","touch","jacket","sit","ledge"]}
