{"path":"553991.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene featuring a silhouette of a sailboat against an atmospheric backdrop. The time appears to be either sunset or sunrise, providing a dramatic intensity due to the low lighting conditions. Foreground details are limited to the dark outline of the sailboat, which is characterized by its prominent mast and the rigging that is faintly visible. The boat's hull is only partially visible, merged with the deep, dark tones of the water.\n\nThe water itself exhibits a choppy texture, suggestive of mild sea conditions with scattered reflections catching the faint light. Above the water, the sky dominates the composition with a spectacular display of clouds. These clouds range from thick and dense to more wispy forms, painted in a palette that suggests the sun is behind the clouds, filtering through in rays that add a mystical or dramatic quality to the scene. Rays of sunlight penetrate certain parts of the clouds, providing a natural contrast and depth to the texture of the sky.\n\nAdditionally, this image has a vintage or faded quality, perhaps due to the color saturation and contrast settings, simulating the look of older photographic film with its grain and color rendition. This adds a timeless element to the image, enhancing its aesthetic appeal and evoking a sense of nostalgia or tranquility. Thereâ€™s a sense of isolation conveyed through the solitary presence of the sailboat, positioned centrally and dwarfed by the expansive sea and sky, highlighting the vastness and the sublime nature of the marine environment.","title":"Sunset at Manele Bay","placename":"Lanai (Hawaii)","location":"Lanai, Hawaii","nn1":["548118","553990","545900","552344","552039","544663","545170","552345","543613","544669","548247","548117","544667","548516","544251","549380"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sailboat","ray","cloud","sea","rigging","nostalgia","mast","grain","appeal","quality"]}
