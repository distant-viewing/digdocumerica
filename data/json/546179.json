{"path":"546179.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts a somewhat unusual juxtaposition of a cemetery and an oil pump jack. In the foreground, various tombstones and grave markers are visible, scattered across a grass-covered area. Some of the tombstones are simple and vertical, while others are more ornate, and one prominent grave marker features a statue of an angel. Several of the graves have floral arrangements placed upon or next to them, signifying recent visits and remembrance by loved ones.\n\nIn the background, enclosed by a chain-link fence, stands a large oil pump jack. The industrial apparatus is in motion, indicated by its \"nodding donkey\" head which is common in oil extraction operations. This setting suggests a stark contrast between the tranquility and solemnity associated with a cemetery and the industrial activity related to energy production. The backdrop beyond the fence is comprised of a line of trees, which provides a natural border and partially obscures any further activity or scenery behind the area of the oil pump. \n\nThe scene is set under clear, blue skies on a sunny day, creating a vivid tableau that accentuates both the pastoral aspects of the cemetery and the mechanical intrusion represented by the oil pump. This contrast raises contemplative questions about the coexistence of natural and industrial elements within a shared space.","title":"Oil derrick in cemetery","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["546196","546204","546168","554825","546182","549207","546135","546379","549209","549208","547397","546038","546188","546147","552643","549211"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["oil","pump","cemetery","tombstone","grave","marker","fence","remembrance","question","solemnity"]}
