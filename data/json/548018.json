{"path":"548018.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a river log boom, a collection of large, freshly cut logs floating on a body of water. The logs, which show various cuts and natural tones of brown, are loosely gathered together on the water, creating an expansive and disorganized mass.\n\nSeveral people are visible in the scene. Some are standing on the logs, navigating the floating wood with apparent ease, while others are near the water's edge. The individuals appear to be engaged in activities such as fishing or possibly managing the logs.\n\nThe background features a riverbank, which includes a mixture of rocky areas and patches of vegetation. There are also small structures and vehicles visible, which might be related to the logging or fishing activities observed. The overall atmosphere is one of active, outdoor labor or recreation, set against a backdrop of industrial and natural elements coexisting along the waterway. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the entire scene, enhancing the muted, earthy colors of the landscape and the timber.","title":"Fishermen on a commercial log raft on the Willamette River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548004","545028","552178","545037","548162","550326","545036","548148","550325","552161","552197","552176","552175","552163","550338","545266"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","fishing","ease","mass","boom","cut","timber","logging","recreation","mixture"]}
