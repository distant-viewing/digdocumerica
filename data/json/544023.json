{"path":"544023.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures a barren landscape with a focus on a sign reading \"CITY OF PHOENIX FUTURE SANITARY LANDFILL LAND RECLAMATION PROJECT\". The sign is center-foreground and stands on two metal posts, with a desolate backdrop that includes a sparse environment mostly devoid of vegetation. The ground appears arid and dusty, with visible tracks indicating recent vehicular or machinery activity.\n\nTo the left of the sign, thereâ€™s a paved road that extends out of the frame, bordered by utility poles and a lone, dead palm tree that appears burnt or damaged. The road seems less traveled and disappears into the backdrop of the image.\n\nThe background features gentle mounds of earth and scattered small trees providing minimal greenery. There appears to be a hint of human activity in the distance, possibly related to the preparation or ongoing work at the site mentioned. The sky is clear and overwhelming, suggesting a dry climate typical of regions like Phoenix. The overall mood conveys a sense of desolation, development, and transformation, fitting for a landfill reclamation area.","title":"Saguaro cactus in Peer Valley, site of a new sanitary landfill","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["548210","547652","549957","549944","544017","546246","544799","547979","547653","545746","545620","546238","552004","549118","555382","543637"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["reclamation","transformation","disappear","sign","landfill","mention","burn","palm","fit","desolation"]}
