{"path":"553853.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph features a close-up image of water droplets on blades of grass. The blades run vertically within the frame, glistening with numerous small, spherical water droplets evenly spaced along their lengths. These droplets act as tiny lenses, each magnifying and warping the green and light hues behind them, adding a dream-like quality to the scene.\n\nThe background is blurred with a bokeh effect, where the light forms circular patterns in various sizes, contributing to the overall ethereal and delicate feel of the image. The colors in the background are primarily shades of cool green and patches of blue, likely a result of the diffuse sky light or reflections in the surrounding moisture.\n\nThe lighting appears soft and diffused, possibly indicating an early morning setting with dew still fresh on the grass. This lighting enhances the translucency of the water droplets, making them sparkle and stand out against the softer green background of the grass and other vegetation. The focus and depth of field are shallow, sharply capturing the droplets and the immediate surface of the grass while softly diffusing everything else into gentle hues and circular light patterns.","title":"Water drops on a blade of grass.
