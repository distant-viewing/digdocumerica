{"path":"552040.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, somewhat reflective scene split between industrial and natural elements. It features a calm body of water, possibly a river or lake, in the foreground, reflecting the scenery above it midway across the image. On the left side of the image, there's an industrial landscape, including tall stacks and large cylindrical storage tanks, likely part of a factory or a processing plant. These structures are large, with straight lines and simplistic forms, predominantly in shades of gray and silver, contrasting with the natural environment.\n\nThe right side of the image is dominated by lush, dense green foliage, extending from the edge of the water into the background. The trees are full and leafy, suggesting a setting in late spring or summer when plant life is most verdant.\n\nThe reflection of the industrial structures in the water is clear and almost symmetrical, adding a tranquil quality to the industrial backdrop. The overall composition juxtaposes man-made industry with natural beauty, highlighting a tranquil yet thought-provoking coexistence. The sky is not clearly visible, but the lighting suggests it is a bright and clear day. The photo seems to evoke themes of environmental impact and the balance between human activity and nature.","title":"Occasional oil spills on the highly industrialized Buffalo River, which flows through the city, are carried into the Niagara River, causing slicks on the Buffalo waterfront.","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["552717","547807","552041","547519","557377","551519","545996","550937","557376","546118","550995","552139","546974","552194","546073","556504"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["provoke","split","silver","plant","coexistence","scenery","spring","balance","summer","gray"]}
