{"path":"550296.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a large body of water, likely a sea or ocean. Dominating the horizon is a large, low-hanging sun that is at the brink of setting, producing a vibrant spectrum of oranges and reds that softly illuminate the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there are two individuals standing on what appears to be a partially submerged structure or sandbar, involved in an activity that resembles fishing. They are facing towards the water, likely focused on their task.\n\nThe water itself glistens with the reflection of the sunset, cast in shades of dark orange and crimson that sparkle subtly under the fading light. There's also a small boat visible near the horizon, just below the sun, which adds a sense of tranquility and isolation to the setting.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, the silhouette of a landmass or large rocks juts into the water, providing contrast against the otherwise open horizon and enhancing the compositionâ€™s depth.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a tranquil, almost meditative mood, underscored by the sparse human presence and the vast expanse of nature, illustrating a perfect moment of evening calm.","title":"Lake erie at sunset.
