{"path":"543525.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"In the photograph, there is a woman standing in front of a large advertisement sign for a real estate development called \"The Crystal Tower.\" The sign highlights the property as offering \"Exclusive Luxury Condominiums for the Discriminate Buyer\" and lists amenities such as a recreation room, swimming pool, and private beach. It also mentions that 2, 3, and 4 bedroom homes are for sale, and provides a contact phone number.\n\nThe woman is dressed in a fashion typical of the mid to late 20th century, wearing a pink, sleeveless top and dark sunglasses, and she appears to be smiling. She is standing near the open door of a white vehicle, which looks like a vintage car or truck based on the door and partial view of the vehicle's side.\n\nThe background behind the sign shows a stone wall, indicating that the photo might be taken in an urban or suburban setting with constructed landscaping. The sign casts a sharp shadow on the wall, suggesting the photo was taken on a sunny day.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment from a past decade, focusing on real estate promotion and a casually dressed woman in a sunny, constructed outdoor environment.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552985","553480","551132","551821","556047","547837","556715","545333","556726","550132","548958","546412","549882","557690","556711","551437"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["estate","sign","construct","promotion","woman","door","call","amenity","contact","list"]}
