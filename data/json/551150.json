{"path":"551150.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This image captures a river scene with a tugboat actively navigating the waters under a red bridge. The tugboat, predominantly white with a black hull and two visible decks, is pushing a large red barge. The barge spans almost the full width of the photo, and its flat surface suggests it could be used for transporting goods or materials.\n\nThe bridge above is a simple, single-span structure with a modest design, connecting two land masses. Underneath it, on one side of the river, the terrain rises steeply, forming a rocky hill that leads up to a building labeled \"MOTEL\" with a clear, classic motel-style architecture. Adjacent to the motel is a small structure with a green and white striped awning, adding a pop of color to the hillside setting.\n\nThe opposite bank of the river features lush green trees that provide a dense natural barrier, possibly marking the edge of a park or preserved natural area. In the background, beyond the bridge, more greenery and hillside can be seen, suggesting that this location is fairly remote or situated in a region with significant natural landscapes.\n\nThe overall color palette of the image includes earthy tones accented by the bright colors of the man-made structures (red of the bridge and barge, and the various colors of the motel and its surroundings), creating a visually dynamic image that captures both human activity and natural beauty.","title":"Barge passes under bridge that will link interstate-77 with the West Virginia turnpike","placename":"Charleston (W.
