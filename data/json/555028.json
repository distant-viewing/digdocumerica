{"path":"555028.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and dense forest scene. It appears to be set in a temperate rainforest, characterized by its lush and moist environment. The dominant flora includes tall trees with thick, moss-covered trunks, suggesting significant age and a cool, humid climate. These trees have sprawling branches, some of which hang low and are draped with long strands of moss, adding a somewhat ethereal quality to the scene.\n\nThe forest floor is a rich tapestry of vegetation, densely populated with large, vibrant ferns that fan out across the image. These ferns add a bright green contrast to the darker, earthy tones of the tree trunks and soil. The ground is also scattered with decomposing leaves and branches, contributing to the natural forest cycle of growth and decay.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is subtly dramatic, possibly captured during early morning or late afternoon, as evidenced by the soft, dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy. This creates patches of light and shadow that play across the scene, highlighting the texture and detail of the forest elements. The atmosphere evokes a sense of tranquility and the untouched beauty of nature, inviting the viewer to contemplate the quiet and complex ecosystem displayed. There are no visible human elements or disturbances, emphasizing the pristine and untouched condition of the forest.","title":"Mossy forest floor cover in a climax Douglas fir forest in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554965","545285","555043","555054","554425","554972","554958","555051","554970","554393","546947","554990","542753","555000","558082","555057"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","fern","moss","trunk","rainforest","fan","strand","branch","cycle","tapestry"]}
