{"path":"545474.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This image features two chest X-ray films displayed on an illuminated X-ray viewer. The photographs provide a detailed look at the skeletal and lung structures. Each film shows the rib cage, spine, and the clear lung fields characteristic of a chest X-ray. There's a contrast between the lighter areas, which represent the lungs filled with air, and the darker areas that include the bones such as the ribs and the spine. The clarity of these images typically helps medical professionals assess the health of a patientâ€™s lungs and thoracic area. The observable technical aspects, like the slightly visible graininess and artifacts, suggest these could either be older films or a result of the reproduction technique used for this photograph. The background is uniformly dark around the X-ray films, emphasizing the medical imagery.","title":"Black lung X-rays from patients of Dr. A.H.
