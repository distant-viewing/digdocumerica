{"path":"544709.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph presents a tranquil scene by a body of water. In the foreground, there's a vast expanse of cracked, dry ground that appears parched, indicative of a possible drought or low-water level area. A large accumulation of various sized rocks and some debris forms a rough barrier along the edge where the land meets the water. Some grass patches sporadically emerge from the cracks in the dried mud, adding a bit of green to the otherwise earthy tones of the scene.\n\nBeyond this barrier, the calm water extends towards the horizon, reflecting a hint of blue from the sky. The water surface is quiet, with no visible waves, and there are numerous, small, dark dots scattered across, likely birds or floating debris.\n\nIn the distant background, barely visible through what seems like a light haze or mist, the silhouette of a city skyline can be discerned. The shapes of high-rise buildings, including what might be towers or skyscrapers, are faint but recognizable against the sky. This inclusion of an urban outline provides a contrast to the natural and somewhat rugged terrain in the foreground.\n\nThe overall lighting in the image suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, given the softness of the light and the long, gentle shadows that are cast, enhancing the quiet solitude of the scene. The composition of the photograph, with its layers of dried ground, rocks, water, and distant city, creates a complex yet serene tableau, capturing the intersection of natural and human-made environments.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["547960","546109","551519","544695","552263","546865","542583","543058","552192","547147","545008","550268","547893","552715","550937","550947"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["crack","dry","barrier","water","drought","softness","inclusion","tableau","city","rock"]}
