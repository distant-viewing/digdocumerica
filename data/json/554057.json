{"path":"554057.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers a panoramic aerial view of a coastal landscape. Visible in the image are ocean waters stretching horizontally across with varying shades of blue, showing clear demarcation where ocean currents or water depths change. Alongside the shore, there is a visible mix of natural and developed land.\n\nTo the left of the photograph, the coastline features a small town or settlement with closely packed buildings situated near the water edge. The roofs of several buildings can be seen, along with a winding road that hugs the coastline. This area is interspersed with patches of greenery and trees.\n\nFurther inland from this settlement, there are extensive agricultural fields, which appear to be well-maintained, showing different colors perhaps indicative of various crops or stages of cultivation. These fields are organized in a grid-like pattern, pointing towards systematic farming practices.\n\nOn the right side of the image, extending towards the ocean, there are peninsulas covered in lush greenery and trees, and the coastal line is jagged and rocky, creating natural inlets and small bays. The ocean in this area displays white wave breaks, suggesting shallow waters near the shore.\n\nThe aerial perspective suggests the photograph was taken from a considerable height, offering a wide view that provides a comprehensive sense of the human settlement and natural environment interaction in this coastal region. The overall feeling conveyed by the photo is of a tranquil and scenic coastal area combining both natural and human elements.","title":"Hotels and condominiums are springing up in the rapidly developing Kaanapali area of Maui.
