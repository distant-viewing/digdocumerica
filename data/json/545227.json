{"path":"545227.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a scenic view centered on a large arched bridge spanning a calm river or bay. The bridge exhibits a series of arches, both large and small, with two prominent Gothic-style center arches that appear to support a roadway above. The structure is well-lit, possibly by late evening or sunset light, which casts a warm hue on the bridge and gives a silhouetted effect to the nearby foliage.\n\nIn the foreground, dense, dark vegetation frames the lower part of the picture, creating a natural border that adds depth to the scene. The water is mostly tranquil, with some gentle ripples, reflecting the soft light and the colors from the sky, which is not directly visible but influences the ambient light.\n\nIn the background, beyond the bridge, there are hints of a shoreline with buildings, including what looks like a commercial area with structures possibly related to marine or harbor activities. The photo evokes a serene and somewhat pastoral mood, despite the presence of human-built structures, blending natural beauty with architectural design.","title":"Florence bridge and estuary at dawn","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["557096","552598","549547","547669","552846","557959","543087","547703","548064","555937","548415","543313","546810","549068","546625","543050"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","arch","border","bay","roadway","light","ripple","sunset","picture","shoreline"]}
