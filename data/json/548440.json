{"path":"548440.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a vintage-styled living room with a distinct 1970s or 1980s decor. There are several prominent furniture pieces and decorative elements within the space:\n\n1. **Furniture**: A large, dark leather sofa is positioned centrally in the room, equipped with an assortment of throw pillows in bright, contrasting colors like orange, yellow, and green. A matching leather armchair is visible in the foreground. Both pieces appear plush and well-kept. In front of the sofa, there’s a rectangular coffee table made of wood, holding various decorative items and perhaps some reading material.\n\n2. **Lighting and Windows**: The room features tall floor lamps on either side, each with a large, cylindrical lampshade. These lamps are positioned next to windows dressed with heavy, patterned curtains that are tied back, and the windows themselves are fitted with white blinds. \n\n3. **Walls and Decor**: The walls are covered with a light-hued floral wallpaper and accented with framed pictures, including a portrait that can be seen next to one of the floor lamps. The room also includes built-in shelving filled with books, small decor items, and potentially family mementos or collectibles.\n\n4. **Person**: In the scene, there is a woman leaning over the sofa. She seems to be adjusting or picking up one of the pillows. She is dressed in a white, lace-patterned top and white shorts, which complements the light and somewhat informal, cozy feel of the room.\n\n5. **Overall Atmosphere**: The room’s ambiance is one of warmth and comfort, characterized by its rich textures, mix of functional and ornamental objects, and a lived-in feeling suggested by the personal items and organized clutter.\n\nThe photograph’s soft lighting and the arrangement of objects give a sense of everyday life, capturing a moment seemingly mundane yet intimate within this personal space.","title":"Sandra bruno straightens a pillow in the immaculate living room of her family's home at 39 neptune road","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548459","555310","556610","556647","555311","556627","543041","548563","552114","551278","555312","554897","546479","551267","556016","552646"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["room","sofa","pillow","lamp","leather","decor","item","armchair","shelving","floor"]}
