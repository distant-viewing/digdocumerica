{"path":"549552.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and picturesque scene overlooking a large waterfall. In the foreground, two individuals are seated on a rugged, rocky outcrop, viewing the expansive water feature. The person on the left is facing towards the waterfall, while the person on the right is slightly turned towards the first, creating a relaxed and intimate atmosphere.\n\nThe waterfall itself is vigorous and spans the middle to the background of the image, suggesting a powerful natural presence. The water appears frothy and white as it cascades over a series of rocky drops, contributing to a sense of dynamic movement within the otherwise tranquil scene.\n\nTo frame this central view, several large trees with thick trunks and lush foliage envelop the sides of the image, enhancing the secluded and natural feel of the setting. These trees cast partial shadows and create dappled light on the rocky surface where the individuals are seated.\n\nIn the distant background, beyond the waterfall, a faint outline of a city skyline is visible, juxtaposing the natural elements in the foreground with hints of urban life. The sky above is overcast, casting an even, soft light that saturates the colors of the landscape, enhancing greens and the blues of the water.\n\nThis photograph encapsulates a moment of peaceful contemplation amid a breathtaking natural landscape, highlighting the contrast between nature and urban development, and emphasizing the beauty and power of the natural world.","title":"Couple enjoy view of niagara river rapids from the shore of goat island, which separates the american and canadian falls at the brink of the cataract","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["553397","550979","554512","544335","549534","545874","557745","558087","545878","549545","555073","557820","554409","542594","548021","554408"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","envelop","drop","saturate","cascade","breathtaking","outcrop","seat","overlook","person"]}
