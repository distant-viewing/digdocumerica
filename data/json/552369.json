{"path":"552369.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a young man engaged in a meticulous task within an industrial or work environment. He is focused on handling long white cables, which he appears to be organizing or fixing. The setting suggests he is underneath or beside a large machine or vehicle, indicated by a prominent black cylindrical object that is partially framing the scene.\n\nThe man is dressed in a horizontally striped shirt with varying shades potentially of brown or beige, and he wears light-colored pants, kneeled down with one knee on the concrete floor. The environment around him is less discernible, but hints of a structured, possibly outdoor setting are visible in the blurred background.\n\nHis physical engagement with the task is apparent â€“ leaning forward intently, his expression concentrated. He wears a watch, suggesting an awareness of time, and his youthful, clean-shaven appearance portrays a blend of both professionalism and casualness typical of field or mechanical work. The ambient light is soft, suggesting either an overcast sky or well-diffused indoor lighting, contributing to the overall serene yet industrious atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["555239","553656","548455","553330","542497","553603","544822","544835","558379","551590","556315","544171","549595","553904","556771","558380"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["professionalism","awareness","task","fix","kneel","concentrate","knee","cable","work","machine"]}
