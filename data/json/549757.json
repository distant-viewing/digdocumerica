{"path":"549757.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive outdoor scene with multiple elements. In the foreground, there is a large flock of birds—possibly seagulls—congregated in an open field strewn with patches of grass and debris. The birds are densely packed, predominantly facing the same direction, suggesting a communal or feeding behavior.\n\nBeyond the field, there is a glimpse of an urban setting featuring various structures. A train is visible, composed of several cars, indicating either a commuter or freight route, traveling parallel to a line of industrial or small-scale commercial buildings. The presence of the train adds a dynamic element to the serene setting of the birds in the foreground.\n\nThe midground is populated by a mix of residential houses and low-rise buildings, which bridge the open field and the urban skyline in the background.\n\nIn the distance, a high-rise building dominates the upper section of the image, surrounded by a residential area draped over a hilly terrain. The landscape is dotted with trees and shows a variety of housing styles, contributing to the suburban feel on the city’s outskirts. The sky is clear, suggesting a dry, possibly cold day given the lack of foliage on the trees and the presence of some white possibly snowy patches on the ground.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes natural and urban elements, highlighting the proximity of wildlife to human habitats and infrastructure.","title":"Municipal garbage dump in Hackensack meadows attracts thousands of seagulls.
