{"path":"548732.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph presents a tall and slender Great Egret standing along the shoreline of what appears to be a lake or calm sea. The bird is featured prominently in the center of the image and is captured with its neck dramatically extended, displaying its graceful curve. Its plumage is predominantly white, contrasting sharply against the background.\n\nThe egret's sharp beak is slightly open and is a pale orange color, while its eyes are focused forward, suggesting attentiveness or that it might be in the process of hunting. The bird's legs are long and thin, black in color, matching its black feet that are partially submerged in the water.\n\nThe background consists of a blurry, deep blue water body that provides a simple yet effective contrasting backdrop to the white egret. The subtle waves near the egret’s feet indicate a gentle movement in the water, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene setting. The light appears to be bright, considering the vividness of the white plumage and the clear delineation of the bird's features against the water.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its emphasis on the egret’s elegance and the minimalistic background, highlights the beauty and grace of this bird in its natural habitat.","title":"White heron near Marathon in the central Florida keys","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["544616","544842","544482","544516","544478","547745","545967","544486","544631","548729","548731","544489","544539","547630","550388","544543"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["egret","bird","plumage","foot","delineation","hunting","grace","beak","attentiveness","elegance"]}
