{"path":"543904.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and intense scene of a large fire, possibly at an industrial site or storage facility, creating a massive and ominous cloud of fire and smoke lit up against the night sky. Powerful jets of water are being sprayed towards the fire from fire hoses, attempting to control and extinguish the flames. The water jets create an arc of fine mist illuminated by the fire's glow.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows a reflective wet surface, likely due to the water used to fight the fire, which mirrors some of the lights and activities. The environment suggests a contained area, perhaps surrounded by fences as hinted by some dimly lit structures in the distance which look like poles or fence posts.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—highlighted by the contrast of fiery oranges and yellows against the dark night, and the water jets crossing through the scene—creates a visually striking and somewhat tense image illustrating the scale and intensity of the firefighting efforts. The scene conveys urgency and the challenging conditions faced by emergency response teams.","title":"A texaco crude oil tank blazes against the night after being struck by lightning","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["543900","543933","543908","555482","555160","548854","557577","545528","543002","543983","545924","543020","550993","555156","550984","546017"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["fire","jet","night","fence","response","arc","team","urgency","emergency","flame"]}
