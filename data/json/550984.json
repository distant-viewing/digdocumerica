{"path":"550984.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and powerful scene dominated by a vast expanse of smoke. The smoke radiates an intense mix of orange and gray hues, possibly indicating a large fire or industrial activity. The sun, visibly muted by the thick smoke, appears as a faint, round glow in the sky, placed centrally between two large water towers.\n\nThese towers, positioned on the left and right edges of the frame, are silhouetted against the smoke-filled sky, drawing attention with their imposing, cylindrical structures supported by metal frameworks. The base of these towers is obscured by the dense smoke, enhancing the focus on their upper sections.\n\nThe backdrop features mountainous terrain, partially enveloped in smoke, suggesting that the location might be a valley. The scene evokes a sense of urgency or crisis, possibly due to environmental implications or an emergency situation. The overall composition of the photo, with the sun and towers framed by the engulfing smoke, creates a somber and impactful visual narrative.","title":"Emission from the Union Carbide ferro Alloy plant darkens the sky at Alloy, WV","placename":"Charleston (W.
