{"path":"548068.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene with a large factory or plant located on the far side of a body of water. The factory features multiple buildings and large smokestacks from which thick clouds of white smoke are billowing into the sky. The sky above is overcast with gray clouds, suggesting an atmosphere heavily laden with moisture or pollution.\n\nIn the foreground, the calm water provides a reflective surface, adding a slight mirror image of the billowing smoke and some of the industrial structures. Along the shoreline adjacent to the factory, piles of red materials, possibly ore or minerals, are visible, contributing to the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe color tones in the image are somewhat muted, with a dominance of grays and blues in the sky and water, contrasted sharply by the reddish hues of the materials on the shore and the stark white of the smoke. The overall mood is somewhat somber or foreboding, emphasized by the industrial activity and the environmental impact suggested by the excessive smoke emissions.","title":"Longview fiber mill on the Columbia River.
