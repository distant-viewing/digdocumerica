{"path":"553899.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene park-like setting with several key elements adding to its picturesque nature. It features a lush green landscape under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. In the middle of the image, there's a well-maintained grassy area with several picnic tables arranged under and around a large open-sided shelter with a white roof supported by dark wooden beams, which looks like a perfect spot for a group gathering or a family picnic.\n\nTo the right, in the background, there is a large red barn-style building with a steeply pitched roof. It appears to be a significant structure within this area, commonly used for storage or as a workshop in park settings. Around this building, there are a few trees providing shade and adding to the rustic charm of the surroundings.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, foregrounded and slightly out of focus, are some branches and leaves, suggesting the photo might have been taken from under another tree or shrub, lending a natural, framed aesthetic to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition and elements captured in the photo portray a peaceful, rural setting ideal for relaxation and recreation. The presence of picnic facilities and a large building suggests that this might be a community park or a similarly purposed area where people come to enjoy the outdoors.","title":"Attractive house (upper right) conceals waste treatment plant designed to blend in with residential development.
