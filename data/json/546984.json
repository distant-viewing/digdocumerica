{"path":"546984.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a waterfront scene in a natural environment. In the foreground, a man wearing a red long-sleeve shirt, black rubber boots, and a dark-colored cap is seen walking along a shoreline that is littered with what appears to be shell debris and organic materials. He appears focused and is walking from right to left in the frame, and he has a cigarette in his mouth.\n\nBehind the man, partially on land and partially in the shallow water, there are two old wooden boats. The nearest boat contains various items, possibly fishing gear like nets or traps. The other boat is more submerged and is empty.\n\nThe background shows a calm, reflective water body, presumably a sea or lake, under a clear blue sky which adds a serene atmosphere to the scene. The left side features what might be either a distant shoreline or possibly more water, extending the sense of a secluded, aquatic-focused locale.\n\nThe overall composition and objects present suggest the activities might be related to fishing or shellfishing, indicated by the gear in the boat and the environment. The presence of the boats and the attire of the man suggest a utilitarian engagement with the environment, possibly at the end of a workday or during a work-related task.","title":"Members of the black-owned blufton oyster cooperative crabbing is the off-season occupation for these men","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["547020","545077","543465","544214","548304","547566","552298","544260","546301","547554","546885","547016","547559","547033","548278","550297"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","gear","shoreline","submerged","trap","fishe","workday","rubber","cigarette","locale"]}
