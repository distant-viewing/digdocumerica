{"path":"553045.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of environmental pollution: it features a large accumulation of discarded industrial containers and chemical drums, scattered haphazardly in an open, outdoor space. The barrels appear worn and variously stained, suggesting they once held substances that contributed to their deteriorating condition. Many of them are metal and labeled with faded text, indicating their original storage contents ranged from possibly hazardous chemicals to pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn the background, two individuals, both men, are visible. They are standing amidst the clutter, discussing or inspecting the scene. One of them points towards the drums, possibly indicating a specific issue or observation. Both men wear casual clothing; one is notably wearing a light shirt and dark slacks, and the other is similarly casually dressed.\n\nThe setting is nondescript, with a broad daylight and clear skies, suggesting an outdoor location isolated from urban areas. The ground is bare and dusty, emphasizing the desolation and severity of the pollution issue presented. This tableau likely serves to highlight the environmental challenges associated with industrial waste disposal and management.","title":"Empty pesticide cans. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
