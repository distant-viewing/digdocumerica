{"path":"542588.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a weathered, wooden house situated in a barren landscape. The house is single-story with a porch, and appears aged and worn, featuring peeling paint and boarded-up windows that suggest long-term abandonment. It's constructed with horizontal siding and has a pitched roof, with various protrusions suggesting additional rooms or functional spaces like an attic.\n\nDirectly in the foreground, a bush with dense, green leaves and red-tinged flowers occupies the central part of the frame. The ground is arid and covered with scattered, dry vegetation and dirt, indicative of a harsh, possibly drought-affected environment.\n\nThe background reveals a broad, flat landscape with sparse vegetation under a mostly cloudy sky, suggesting a rural or isolated location. There is no visible human activity or presence in the photograph; the focus is entirely on the dilapidated state of the building and the stark surroundings.","title":"Abandoned farm with weed-grown land.
