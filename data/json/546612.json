{"path":"546612.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image presents an aerial view of a busy multi-lane highway stretching towards the horizon. The highway features several lanes in both directions, filled with a variety of vehicles including cars and trucks, suggesting a typical traffic scene. Notably, the traffic appears relatively fluid with no signs of congestion.\n\nOn the right side of the highway, there is a significant grassy area, accompanied by clusters of trees that line the road. Adjacent to this, there are commercial buildings and parking areas densely packed into the frame, illustrating an urban setting.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows a more residential or institutional area with multiple medium-rise buildings, possibly apartments or offices, surrounded by greenery. A distinctive, large spherical structure, which could be a water tower or a similar utility building, stands out due to its size and shape.\n\nBeyond the immediate urban landscape, the back of the image fades into a mixed skyline of trees and buildings, giving a sense of the city's suburbs. The overall scene is typical of many urban environments where infrastructure, commercial, and residential areas coexist closely. The photograph's time appears to be taken during the daytime with overcast weather, adding a muted tone to the colors and atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Evening traffic on the whitehurst freeway","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["552719","547770","547780","546681","546686","546713","546703","546726","546608","546603","546707","546709","553015","557471","547785","546670"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","traffic","suburb","congestion","coexist","building","apartment","accompany","daytime","lane"]}
