{"path":"546038.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph portrays a contrasting scene, primarily focused on an industrial structure juxtaposed with a peaceful cemetery. In the foreground, a cemetery is visible with numerous uniform grave markers laid out in neat rows. These markers are white and rectangular, covering a well-maintained grassy area enclosed by a low red brick wall.\n\nDominating the middle and background of the image is a large industrial chimney emitting a thick plume of white smoke, which stands out starkly against the overcast sky. The chimney, towering and cylindrical, is scorched with signs of weathering and operational use. Adjacent to the chimney are lower industrial buildings that appear functional and nondescript, likely part of the same facility.\n\nIn the cemetery, a person is walking and holds a camera, appearing to capture the scene. They are dressed in a distinct red top and plaid pants, adding a vibrant touch of color to the otherwise muted natural and industrial tones in the photograph.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its combination of industry and repose, evokes a poignant commentary on environmental impact and perhaps the contrasting themes of life and legacy.","title":"Kaiser aluminum plant smokestack belches fumes above the national cemetery where casualties of the battle of New Orleans lie buried","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546379","554825","546168","554791","545363","543013","546196","545247","550997","548194","557299","550998","546048","557411","546031","546047"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["cemetery","chimney","marker","grave","commentary","weathering","combination","lay","plaid","enclose"]}
