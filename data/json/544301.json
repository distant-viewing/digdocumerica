{"path":"544301.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures two hikers in a rugged canyon setting. They are exploring a narrow, rocky area surrounded by large, smooth sandstone walls showing layers and striations that tell of geological history. The canyon walls exhibit a red to brown hue, typical of sedimentary rock formations often found in arid regions.\n\nThe hikers are dressed in shorts and t-shirts suitable for warm weather, and they wear sturdy footwear appropriate for hiking. Each of them is carrying a backpack, which is reasonably sized for a day trip, providing storage for essential supplies like water, food, and perhaps some safety equipment. One of the hikers also carries an additional strapped item that looks like a sleeping pad or small tent.\n\nThe ground they are walking on is strewn with loose stones and gravel, suggesting a dry riverbed or a similarly eroded path. The photo conveys a sense of adventure and exploration, emphasizing the scale and beauty of the natural environment compared to the human figures. Lighting in the canyon is soft and diffuse, possibly indicating a time when the sun is either rising or setting, casting gentle shadows and enriching the colors of the sandstone canyon walls.","title":"Hikers entering the GRand Canyon","placename":"Peach Springs (Ariz.)","location":"Peach Springs, Arizona","nn1":["544928","545758","544305","545704","545751","545772","544903","545768","545781","545693","545700","545697","545762","545782","544906","554503"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["canyon","hiker","wall","appropriate","footwear","striation","pad","sandstone","riverbed","tent"]}
