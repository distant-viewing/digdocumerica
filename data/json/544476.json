{"path":"544476.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph shows an industrial scene featuring a water control structure in a rural setting. It captures a pump station with multiple large pump units, housed partly on a floating platform over a water body. The pump units are identical with orange and white colors and are arranged in a row. Each unit appears to have a cylindrical form factor with numerous circular elements which might be intakes or parts of the machinery for pumping water.\n\nOn the far side of the pumps, there’s a small building or shack painted in orange with a contrasting white-colored door. The structure sports a flat-roof topped with various antenna-like structures, possibly for communications or control operations. This building is connected to the mainland via a narrow walkway with railings.\n\nThe floating platform itself rests on large black cylindrical pontoons, which provide buoyancy. The surrounding water is calm, mirroring the entire setup and the fluffy clouds above.\n\nAdjacent to the pump station flows a road or a narrow pathway that curves gently and extends into the distance, paralleled by utility poles lining one side. The landscape beyond the road consists of expansive flat agricultural fields under a broad sky filled with scattered white clouds, hinting at a spacious countryside location.\n\nThe general condition and cleanliness of the area around the pump station show some signs of neglect, as evidenced by litter and unkempt grass along the water’s edges.\n","title":"Control structure in farmlands","placename":"Okeechobee, Lake (Fla.)","location":"Okeechobee, Lake, Florida","nn1":["547668","545836","547958","546002","543810","551180","544179","543568","545840","552836","545833","549564","554546","543636","549304","551994"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["pump","unit","station","control","platform","factor","shack","cleanliness","water","antenna"]}
