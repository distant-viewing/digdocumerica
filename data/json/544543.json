{"path":"544543.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing scene centered around a bird, likely a heron, wading in shallow waters. The environment around the bird is somewhat dimly lit, accentuating the shiny surface of the water which reflects light and sparkles. The surface of the water is cluttered with a mixture of natural debris, including numerous twigs and possibly some floating leaves or organic materials, creating a textured and slightly chaotic visual layer.\n\nThe heron stands prominently with its long legs visible submerged in the water. Its body slopes forward, possibly in the act of hunting or observing something in the water, displaying typical cautious and investigative bird behavior. Its neck is stretched forward, enhancing its long and streamlined shape, while its feathers display a combination of what looks like dark and possibly lighter shades, adding depth and a natural camouflaged pattern to its appearance.\n\nThe background of the image is dominated by dark water, further highlighting the gleaming water surface and the bird as the focal points. The overall atmosphere in the photograph is tranquil yet lively due to the play of light on water and the active pose of the heron. This scene beautifully captures a natural moment in the bird's life, contributing to an overall feeling of being a quiet observer in a vibrant wildlife habitat.","title":"Little blue heron","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544539","547630","550388","545142","543922","548731","557495","548832","544489","557604","543063","547593","544838","545967","544624","545991"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["bird","heron","water","behavior","sparkle","observer","feather","surface","twig","act"]}
