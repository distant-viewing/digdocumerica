{"path":"552404.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph features a scenic view of a powerful waterfall, possibly Niagara Falls, given the volume and breadth of the water. In the foreground, there is a prominent black sign with white lettering that reads: \"$100 FINE FOR DUMPING RUBBISH IN THE PARK.\" The sign includes the logo \"NPC,\" likely identifying a managing organization. A wooden guardrail is partially visible at the bottom of the frame, suggesting that this photo is taken from an observation or visitor area.\n\nThe waterfalls themselves dominate the background and are divided into several sections by the rocky terrain, creating a dramatic and wide cascade of water that generates considerable mist as it crashes down. Above the falls, the landscape is covered with lush, dense, green foliage, which contrasts with the gray, overcast sky visible at the top of the photograph.\n\nOverall, this image captures the natural beauty and grandeur of a large waterfall, contrasting human-made elements (the sign and guardrail) with the natural world, and possibly serving to remind viewers about environmental responsibility and the fines associated with littering in such a pristine location.","title":"In a good cause but sign partially blots out the american Niagara Falls.
