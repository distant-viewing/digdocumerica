{"path":"558064.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a river surrounded by lush greenery. The river meanders through a dense forest, creating an idyllic natural setting. Visible on the river are several small canoes or kayaks, scattered at various points along the water. Each boat appears diminutive juxtaposed against the expansive backdrop of towering trees. Some boats are clustered near what appears to be a sandy bank or small clearing, possibly used as a launching point. The composition of the image emphasizes the contrast between the tranquil blue of the river and the vibrant green of the surrounding forest, enhancing the sense of serenity and isolation in this natural landscape.","title":"Aerial view of canoeists and kayakers on the Cuyahoga River north of Peninsula, Ohio, near Cleveland. The river is situated within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, located in a 20-mile stretch of largely undeveloped land between Cleveland and Akron. The river in the past was the water source for the Ohio-Erie Canal which served as a link between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi River systems from 1833 to 1913.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["551217","557972","554471","550988","543444","555219","550989","551209","548934","550768","558046","555078","556927","550622","553452","550625"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","kayak","canoe","boat","forest","serenity","point","clearing","bank","isolation"]}
