{"path":"548958.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a relaxed and casual scene set in a barren landscape under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, there is a classic, dark blue Pontiac car parked on a rough, rocky ground. On the roof of the car, there is a woman lying down. She is dressed in a short, possibly denim, outfit with a red top. She is reclining comfortably, propping herself up on one elbow and looking directly towards the camera with a gentle smile. Her blonde hair and light-toned clothing contrast with the deep blue color of the car.\n\nThe setting appears to be quite remote, with no visible structures or vegetation in the immediate surroundings, emphasizing a sense of isolation or an adventurous journey. The sharp focus on the woman and the car against the vast, empty background amplifies the serenity and stillness of the scene. The car's prominent position and style suggest a time setting possibly in the 1960s or 1970s, reflective of the vehicle design and the woman's fashion. The overall composition has a nostalgic feel, capturing a moment of leisure and freedom in a wide-open space.","title":"Visitors sunbathing at lake mead","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["547141","557908","543856","545316","544641","557766","554920","546093","548306","556728","544389","546849","550152","549002","557874","545337"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","woman","elbow","recline","prop","amplify","freedom","serenity","journey","denim"]}
