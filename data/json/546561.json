{"path":"546561.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene indoors, showing a young boy deeply engaged in writing or drawing. The setting has a modern, somewhat academic or institutional feel, suggestive of a library or study area.\n\nThe focus of the image is the boy, who appears concentrated on his work. He is sitting on a rounded burgundy-red bench that harmonizes with the interior's color scheme. The boy is dressed in a casual, dark brown jacket, and his posture and the angle of his head indicate a focused, attentive engagement with his activity.\n\nIn front of him, there's a round table covered with various items including a number of books and what appear to be sheets of paper, likely related to his activity. These materials suggest a learning or creative context, possibly an art project or homework.\n\nThe background features a large brick wall, enhancing the sense of an enclosed, structured space. A large window next to the boy bathes the scene in natural light, softening and adding a reflective quality to the setting. The window also shows a vague reflection and offers a glimpse of the exterior, although it doesn't reveal much about the surroundings outside.\n\nOverall, the composition is neat, characterized by soft ambient lighting and a focus on the solitary figure of the boy in an environment that supports concentration and creativity. The use of color, light, and architecture convey a serene, academic atmosphere.","title":"Rogers Memorial Library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546565","546552","558209","546500","542690","546554","546560","546580","546478","545332","546471","546486","544326","555312","552592","555315"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["boy","library","drawing","burgundy","creativity","writing","round","learning","sheet","art"]}
