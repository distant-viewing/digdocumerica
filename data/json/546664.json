{"path":"546664.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of multiple individuals queueing outside, presumably at a driver's license facility. The image prominently features a sign with the words \"DRIVER LICENSE\" displayed next to an arrow pointing to the right, indicating the direction of the service.\n\nThe queue appears long, stretching back into a parking lot filled with rows of parked cars. The people in line exhibit varied attire, suggesting the photo was taken in cooler weather based on several people wearing coats and scarves. The individuals are of various ages and seem to represent a mix of genders and professional backgrounds, as seen in their diverse clothing stylesâ€”from business attire to more casual looks.\n\nThe foreground highlights a few people in particular: a younger individual with long hair and glasses, wearing a scarf tucked into a coat; another in a smart coat and carrying a briefcase; and one more in a casual jacket holding papers. The expression on their faces conveys a sense of routine and possibly impatient or resigned attitudes, common to waiting in long lines.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a slice of daily life, focusing on the mundane yet necessary task of obtaining or renewing a driver's license. The setting, with its overcast sky and urban environment, amplifies the ordinariness and slightly weary atmosphere of the scenario.","title":"Last day for '73 tags.
