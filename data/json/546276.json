{"path":"546276.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph shows the interior of a scientific laboratory with a focus on one individual and various pieces of equipment. The man, who appears middle-aged and has curly hair and a beard, is sitting attentively in front of a large, complex instrument. He wears a dark green shirt and is operating or adjusting the instrument.\n\nThe instrument prominently displayed is labeled \"Perkin Elmer Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer.\" It features digital readouts and numerous control knobs. There is also other laboratory equipment visible, including beakers and a flask filled with a clear liquid, hinting at chemical analysis or experiments being conducted.\n\nThe setting is cozy with a warm, golden light that suggests the photo was taken under indoor lighting, possibly with incandescent bulbs. The ambiance reflects a serious, professional working environment. The background is softly out of focus, drawing the viewer's attention primarily to the man and the instrument panel he is handling. This scene conveys a moment of scientific inquiry or experimentation within a controlled setting.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory.
