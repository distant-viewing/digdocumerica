{"path":"545035.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph provides a dramatic contrast between natural elements and industrial activity. In the foreground, branches and leaves of a tree are silhouetted, framing the view and creating a natural border. The leaves are densely packed along the upper edges but thin out towards the bottom, allowing a clear view of the background scene.\n\nThe background portrays an industrial landscape under a dramatic sky, which might be near twilight due to the somewhat dimmed lighting. Several large structures, possibly factories or processing plants, dominate the scene, characterized by their rigid, angular architecture. The structures include tall smokestacks from which white and light gray smoke trails into the sky. This emission blends into the clouds, suggesting pollution.\n\nThe overall mood is somewhat somber and contemplative, with the natural elements in the foreground starkly juxtaposed against the man-made industrial backdrop. The scene could be interpreted as a commentary on the impact of industrialization on the natural environment.","title":"Flour mill","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["546363","552156","546113","545989","550999","545239","545993","545053","557225","557220","543013","550821","543813","551026","557299","543009"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["starkly","interpret","industrialization","trails","commentary","leave","dim","emission","silhouet","twilight"]}
