{"path":"546119.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image depicts a close-up of a roughly oval-shaped object with a somewhat jagged and irregular outline. The object has a mottled appearance with a dominant palette of browns, grays, and hints of red and white. Its texture looks highly detailed, showing a mixture of various elements that could be organic or mineral, making it appear somewhat like a compressed or fossilized material. The background is entirely black, which starkly contrasts with the object, highlighting its intricate and varied surface details. The overall impression is that of a scientific or geological sample, perhaps a rock, mineral, or even a slice of some natural substance viewed under magnification.","title":"Foamy white waste material in Mill Creek.
