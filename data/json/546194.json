{"path":"546194.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a playful and surreal scene centered around a large, black inner tube. The inner tube is the dominant foreground object, occupying most of the image space and viewed from its interior perspective, emphasizing its circular shape and textured surface.\n\nWithin this large inner tube, a woman is observed reaching up towards the top of the tube from inside. Her back is facing the camera, and she's wearing a striped, sleeveless top that provides a casual, sporty look appropriate for an outdoor activity.\n\nBehind the tube and the woman, a man can be seen in the background, left side of the frame, walking from left to right. He appears dressed in light casual wear, typical of a warm, sunny day. The environment includes a park or a spacious outdoor area with a row of parked cars along one side, indicating a public or recreational space. The cars, appearing to be models from the late 20th century, help in setting a timeline and give a vintage feel to the scene.\n\nThe backdrop is filled with lush green trees, suggesting a vibrant, natural setting. This combination of elements narrates an informal, possibly spontaneous moment of enjoyment and exploration in an outdoor, community setting. The framing and focus on the inner tube, along with the human interactions, add a touch of whimsy and curiosity to the scene.","title":"Campers in Garner State Park","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["557738","551451","543946","553266","549998","551967","547197","553250","553435","552952","543881","550829","546320","553263","548465","551545"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["tube","narrate","curiosity","framing","woman","space","combination","top","park","car"]}
