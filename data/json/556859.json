{"path":"556859.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a group of workers engaged in railway track maintenance or construction. There are six individuals visible in the image, all focused on their tasks.\n\nThe workers, wearing protective helmets in various colors such as orange and white, are positioned on and beside a railway track. Some of them are bent over, picking or handling what appear to be metal parts or tools scattered on a flatbed railway work car and on the tracks themselves. Their attire suggests manual labor, and they seem dressed for cooler weather, given the appearance of long sleeves and pants.\n\nThe setting of the photo is outdoors, during the daytime under an overcast sky, suggesting a possibly cool or humid environment. The background features muted natural colors with greenery and a few sparse trees. A road runs parallel in the distance, and beyond that lies an open field with sparse vegetation.\n\nThe scene is framed with the railway track running horizontally across the foreground, leading the eye towards the background, creating a sense of depth. The workers are the focal point, surrounded by the tools of their trade, contributing to a narrative of ongoing physical labor in infrastructure maintenance.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a distinctly documentary style, capturing the essence of manual labor in a natural setting, emphasizing the workers' engagement and effort.","title":"Southern Railway track repair crew removes old rails and replaces them with new quarter mile long rails in a regular program to improve the company's 10,531 miles of track. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to halt work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day. The crew numbers 50 to 55 men, and Southern has an average of four working throughout the system.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556897","556871","556881","556012","556869","556895","556884","556898","556883","556899","556860","556886","556878","556894","556877","556862"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Infrastructure Maintenance"],"terms":["railway","worker","track","labor","tool","maintenance","flatbed","trade","daytime","helmet"]}
