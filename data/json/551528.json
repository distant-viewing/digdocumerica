{"path":"551528.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph portrays a vivid outdoor scene featuring an activity related to boating and vehicles. In the foreground, we see the shimmering surface of a body of water reflecting gentle ripples. Just at the edge of this water, a red and white boat mounted on a trailer is being surveyed by a shirtless man, who appears to be preparing the boat either for launching into the water or fitting it onto the trailer after use.\n\nThe boat is attached to a classic car, notably vintage, with distinctive tailfins, suggesting the photo could be from the mid-20th century. The carâ€™s design, particularly the rear, is typical of American autos from the late 1950s or early 1960s. The scene takes place in a parking area, where a dusty, gravelly surface can be seen leading up from the waterside.\n\nIn the background, another vintage car is parked farther along the edge of the water, and beyond it, even further back, the scene includes what looks like a station wagon parked on a more elevated road. The area is surrounded by greenery, indicating a rural or semi-rural setting typical for recreational boating areas. The atmosphere is sunny and clear, suggesting a warm and pleasant day, ideal for outdoor activities. \n\nOverall, the composition and elements suggest a leisurely day out centered around boating, combining the charm of vintage cars with the tranquility of a lakeside setting.","title":"Public launch site at webber park on the Mississippi river","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["552119","547773","548185","554684","554683","551999","554485","550841","544002","551236","544260","552121","546976","546856","551310","544006"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","boating","trailer","car","launch","auto","survey","1950","lakeside","rear"]}
