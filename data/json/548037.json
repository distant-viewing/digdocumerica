{"path":"548037.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling marina filled with various boats moored at the docks on a cloudy day. The foreground prominently features a large, blue and white boat named \"POINT LOMA\" moored at a dock extending into the lower frame of the image. Surrounding this are multiple other vessels, predominantly fishing boats, of varying sizes and colors.\n\nBehind the boats, several wooden buildings, possibly warehouses or boat storage facilities, are situated along the waterâ€™s edge. These buildings are painted in different shades; one notably in red, adding a pop of color to the otherwise muted waterfront scene.\n\nIn the background, numerous boats are docked densely at an extensive marina, illustrating a busy fishing or recreational boating hub. The background also features gently rolling hills across the horizon under a cloud-streaked sky, suggesting a coastal location with a wide-open landscape surrounding the marina. \n\nOverall, the composition and elements of the photograph capture a lively marine environment likely dedicated to both commercial and recreational boating activities.","title":"Washington--ilwaco","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["542871","546877","548075","548078","542912","542902","545155","548547","557450","552027","552028","544130","548543","542650","542911","546853"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","marina","dock","moo","fishe","pop","streak","hub","waterfro","warehouse"]}
