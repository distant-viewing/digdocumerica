{"path":"554908.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an intimate, tranquil moment between two young women outdoors. They are seated by what appears to be a serene body of water, perhaps a river or lake, surrounded by a lush, green landscape. The background includes trees and their reflections in the calm water, enhancing the peaceful and natural setting.\n\nThe woman on the left has long, curly blonde hair and is wearing a blue headband. She seems to be applying lip gloss or some kind of makeup to the other woman using her finger. Her outfit is partially visible and appears to be a light-colored, patterned summer top. The focused expression on her face suggests careful attention to the task.\n\nThe woman on the right, who is receiving the makeup, has her lips slightly parted in a relaxed manner. She has straight, dark brown hair styled in a ponytail and is sporting gold hoop earrings. She wears a pink tank top, and her posture and expression convey trust and relaxation as her friend applies the makeup.\n\nThe setting, coupled with their engaging activity, suggests a moment of friendship and personal care, set against the tranquility of a natural environment.","title":"Two girls smoking pot during an outing in cedar woods near Leakey, Texas.
