{"path":"546762.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures a maritime industrial scene at a port. In the foreground, two workers are actively engaged in the task of loading or unloading goods. One worker, donning a yellow helmet, is raised slightly above ground level and is directing a large, swinging net filled with what appears to be sacks or bags, presumably cargo. The other, in a grey outfit and also wearing a helmet, watches presumably monitoring the safety and efficiency of the operation.\n\nThe cargo is being transferred to or from a blue shipping container prominently marked with \"NIC\" and the number \"542.\" Another similar container is visible in the immediate vicinity. Pallets stacked with goods or materials are neatly arranged to the left side of the foreground, indicating organized activity.\n\nThe surrounding area further underscores the industrial setting with visible ships in the background, one in considerable detail displaying its white and black structure. There are multiple containers, and other machinery and equipment scattered around, typical of port activities.\n\nThe overall ambiance is busy, structured, and focused, giving a strong impression of a typical day at a commercial dockyard where goods are transferred between ship and shore, embodying the essence of maritime commerce.","title":"Longshoremen unload charcoal at dundalk marine terminal","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546881","555261","546917","546910","546914","555283","555260","546841","546828","546796","548125","555797","546901","546918","555271","546016"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["transfer","container","goods","port","cargo","helmet","ship","worker","donn","embody"]}
