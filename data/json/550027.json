The flowers are arranged meticulously in rows and on tiered shelves, creating a visually appealing array.\n\nIn the center of the image, three people are engaged in conversation in the midst of the flower market. The person on the left is dressed in a white shirt and dark pants, partially turning their back to the camera. Next to him, there is a man in a light-colored shirt and dark pants who is facing the camera with a slight smile. Alongside him, a woman in a bright floral shirt and red pants is also part of the conversation, her posture open and directly facing the other two.\n\nIn the background, other people can be observed possibly browsing the market or simply enjoying the day. Behind the trio, there is a woman in a pink outfit walking past more displays of flowers, conveying a sense of movement within the tranquil setting of the market.\n\nThe setting suggests a sunny day given the bright lighting and shadows cast on the ground and people. The overall ambiance is lively yet relaxed, inviting visitors to enjoy the beauty of the flowers and the casual social interactions at the market.","title":"Spring flowers enliven Newbury Street, between Claredon and Dartmouth","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550044","549924","551698","553242","549994","551697","551838","551699","551700","551779","552408","551470","551687","557135","551718","550061"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["market","flower","pant","display","conversation","shirt","people","shelf","midst","camera"]}
