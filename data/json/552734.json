{"path":"552734.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive aerial view of a densely populated urban area. The image captures a network of narrow streets lined tightly with rows of small, mostly two-story residential and commercial buildings. Many of these structures feature flat rooftops, and some have small yards or gardens visible at the back.\n\nA long, straight street runs vertically through the center of the image, neatly dividing the neighborhood and is crowded with parked cars and a few moving vehicles, suggesting typical urban traffic. The architecture and the layout are indicative of an older urban neighborhood, potentially in a large city in the United States based on the building styles.\n\nThe color palette of the buildings varies, ranging from red and brown brick to lighter shades of beige and gray, giving the area a somewhat colorful but predominantly earth-toned appearance. The backdrop of the photograph reveals taller, more modern buildings and a couple of distant high-rises, indicating the proximity to a city's downtown or a busier commercial district.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a glimpse into the everyday life and the residential and commercial dynamics of an urban community, with its bustling streets and closely packed buildings.","title":"Row houses stretching out from Center City (in background)","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552730","552729","548318","548343","548425","546579","548424","553673","556180","553971","551510","553300","548364","555743","547445","545914"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Urban Development"],"terms":["neighborhood","street","building","dynamic","beige","city","downtown","rooftop","district","yard"]}
