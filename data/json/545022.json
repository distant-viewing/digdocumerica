{"path":"545022.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a sunset scene over a large body of water, likely a bay or estuary. The sun is near the horizon, casting a brilliant reflection across the water, which is the central visual element. Surrounding the reflective pathway of the sun are cloud formations with varying tones of gray and white, illuminated from below by the sun's yellow and gold light, which adds a dramatic effect to the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, dark silhouettes of foliage, possibly trees and shrubs, frame the bottom part of the image, adding depth. To the left, the coastline recedes into the distance, layered with more vegetative silhouettes that create a sense of expansive space.\n\nIn the middle distance, there are structures that appear to be related to shipping or industry, including a crane and some small buildings or vehicles, located along a narrow strip of land jutting into the water. A bridge with a distinctive suspension design spans across part of the bay in the background, connecting two land masses.\n\nOverall, the composition uses natural and man-made elements to create a striking contrast between the tranquility of the natural sunset and the activity of human development. The use of lighting and shadow is effective in highlighting the serene yet complex interaction of environment and industry.","title":"Sunset at the mouth of the Columbia River between Astoria Oregon and the state of Washington","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545030","544707","552230","548123","551956","552350","552335","557447","545019","543144","552338","552263","545430","550304","552294","547102"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["bay","sun","sunset","industry","suspension","masse","silhouette","land","gold","jut"]}
