{"path":"548195.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial facility, possibly a factory or a power plant, with various elements of industrial architecture. The facility features multiple large structures including towers, pipes, and tanks. One prominent feature is a tall smokestack emitting a thick plume of white smoke that arcs across the sky. Surrounding this main stack are several other smaller stacks and structures, also releasing steam or smoke.\n\nThe industrial complex is set against a backdrop of a forested hill, suggesting that the facility is located near a natural wooded area. Below the industrial installations, there is a patch of rough terrain with sparse vegetation, indicating recent disturbance or ongoing industrial activity that might be related to the facility's operation.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows a body of water reflecting the blue sky, bordered by grass and small shrubs. This natural setting contrasts with the man-made complexity and activity of the industrial facility. The overall composition highlights the juxtaposition between industry and nature.","title":"Smokestacks of the Crown-Zellerbach papermill in Camas, on the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546141","550329","544495","546005","543011","550716","557306","550339","550672","549215","543733","550694","546087","546808","552138","550876"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["facility","stack","smoke","installation","disturbance","complexity","plume","pipe","steam","smokestack"]}
