{"path":"555534.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"This photograph features a winter scene, capturing a large, vintage farming implement set against an overcast sky. The machine, possibly a hay rake or similar agricultural equipment, is composed of curved metal tines and sits atop a large wheel with spokes. It is positioned on the right side of the frame and casts a stark silhouette on the snow-covered ground.\n\nThe landscape around the equipment is blanketed in snow, enhancing the cold, subdued ambiance of the scene. There are subtle undulations in the terrain, with a gentle slope rising in the background. Sparse trees dot the horizon, contributing to a sense of isolation and tranquility.\n\nThe sky is dramatic and moody with hues of deep blue and grey, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. There's a soft glow that permeates the clouds, possibly from the sun trying to break through, adding a mystical quality to the overall atmosphere of the image.\n\nThe composition uses natural lighting and a low perspective, emphasizing the solitude and the stark contrast between the dark equipment and the white snow. The scene is devoid of any human presence, focusing purely on the interaction between nature and the man-made object within it.","title":"An old-fashioned hay rake, once pulled by powerful horse teams, sits idly in a pasture during the winter.","placename":"Barre (Vt.)","location":"Barre, Vermont","nn1":["554783","557193","554044","553985","547436","557192","557194","554211","554807","557310","555538","552676","543354","557013","552679","557195"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["snow","equipment","hay","undulation","farming","wheel","machine","winter","glow","slope"]}
