{"path":"544102.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph shows a rugged and arid landscape dominated by rocky, red-brown terrain. The setting appears to be in a desert or mining area. On the steep, barren hillside, a prominent feature is an industrial-looking tower or structure, which appears to be a metal tank or storage container. It is multi-tiered, cylindrical, and painted in fading colors with red and white sections. Around the middle of the structure, there seems to be a walkway or platform circling it.\n\nLeading up to this structure, there are worn dirt paths or roads that zigzag across the slope, possibly for vehicles used in mining operations. The hill is dotted with small shrubs or bushes, emphasizing the sparse vegetation typical of arid environments.\n\nUtility poles with visible power lines are also present, creating horizontal lines against the hill's diagonal and vertical lines, adding to the sense of rugged human intervention in a natural setting. The background is a clear sky, which contrasts sharply with the earthy tones of the hill, enhancing the vividness of the landscape.","title":"Phelps Lodge Corp.'s abandoned mine tower at the Lavender Pit Mine","placename":"Bisbee (Ariz.)","location":"Bisbee, Arizona","nn1":["555331","552544","544068","545827","543669","555610","542587","554763","544405","549118","556402","555397","544300","548136","546201","543848"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["mining","hill","line","intervention","vividness","walkway","hillside","platform","desert","container"]}
