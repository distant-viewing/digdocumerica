{"path":"544901.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and dramatic winter landscape. In the foreground, the scene is dotted with patches of snow interspersed with clumps of dark green pine trees. These trees are relatively small, indicating either their youth or a stunted growth pattern possibly due to the harsh climate.\n\nAs the view extends beyond these trees, a vast, flat, snow-covered plain spreads across most of the middle ground. This snowy expanse is open and bleak, adding a sense of isolation and chilly vastness to the scene.\n\nIn the distance, a range of mountains stretches across the horizon. These mountains are capped with snow, enhancing their rugged appeal against the sky. They are set against a backdrop of blue skies, punctuated dramatically by a voluminous white cloud formation directly above them. This cloud is stark white against the blue, billowing upwards with a towering presence that dominates the upper half of the photo.\n\nThe overall composition highlights nature’s quiet beauty in wintertime, demonstrating the stark contrasts between sky, snow, and mountainous terrain. The photograph’s strong horizontal elements—the rows of trees, the flat plain, and the distant mountains—contrast with the vertical lift of the cloud, creating a balanced yet dynamic natural scene.","title":"Thunderclouds over grassy plateau","placename":"South Park (Colo. : Flat)","location":"South Park, Colorado","nn1":["544905","543755","550408","555656","543770","543763","543827","552173","550592","542842","550610","557193","552607","555662","550504","550416"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["snow","mountain","cloud","plain","youth","clump","appeal","demonstrate","half","tree"]}
