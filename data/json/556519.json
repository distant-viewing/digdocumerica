{"path":"556519.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image shows a dark, cave-like setting illuminated partially by light. The photograph features a rugged terrain with uneven surfaces and a ground composed of dirt or mineral elements. Prominently visible in the frame is a rail track that curves gently to the left, suggesting that this could be a mining passage or tunnel. The lighting, coming from above, highlights sections of the rocky surface and parts of the tracks, creating a mood that is both mysterious and industrial. The overall ambience is dim and shadowy, emphasizing the depth and enclosed nature of the space. There are no visible human activities, objects, or people in the photo; the focus is solely on the geological and man-made features within an underground or enclosed natural environment.","title":"This time exposure picture shows what the miners see from the lights of their shuttle car as they are transported into the mine on their way to work. The miners lay on their backs in the cars during the two-mile trip in one of the Tennessee Consolidated Coal Company mines near Jasper and Chattanooga, Tennessee. The progressive non-union mine sells most of its metallurgical (high grade) coal to Japan.","placename":"Tennessee","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556319","556398","544056","556512","556849","555355","556510","556513","556521","556360","551359","556427","544937","556329","543822","543743"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Miner"],"terms":["cave","track","like","tunnel","ambience","mineral","highlight","passage","rail","mining"]}
