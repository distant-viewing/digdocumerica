{"path":"546397.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene at a sunny beach characterized by vibrant colors and aquatic activity. The foreground shows a sandy shore where a few individuals are near a yellow boat with a brown top, parked beside a similarly colored convertible car. One person appears to be engaging in an activity inside the boat, possibly preparing it for departure or managing equipment.\n\nIn the shallow, clear blue water adjacent to the beach, another individual is seen wading near the boat, suggesting they may either be exiting or entering the water. Further away, there are some people on personal watercrafts and another speedboat cruising through the water, indicating recreational activities such as jet skiing or boating taking place off-shore.\n\nThe middle distance shows a calm sea extending to a horizon under a vast sky, scattered with billowing white clouds against a deep blue backdrop, creating a feeling of expansiveness and openness. The horizon is marked by a thin strip of land, hinting at either an island or a distant part of the coastline.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a leisurely, vibrant atmosphere typical of a beachside recreational area, with people enjoying their time in and around the water in a picturesque seaside setting.","title":"Boat launching from luguillo beach","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["546955","553781","548929","548697","553952","549939","544021","550228","553684","546317","553782","548733","552050","544006","550930","555718"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["boat","wading","beachside","beach","speedboat","shore","watercraft","departure","cruise","expansiveness"]}
