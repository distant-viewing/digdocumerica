{"path":"551720.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and busy scene at a playground, possibly from the late 20th century, judging by the style of clothing and overall quality of the image. The setting is an outdoor park, filled with numerous trees that enclose the play areas, providing a lush, green background with hints of sky visible through the canopy.\n\nIn the center of the image, there is a large, circular merry-go-round, bustling with activity. Numerous children, possibly around ten to fifteen in total, are either riding on it or pushing it. They appear energetic and engaged, contributing to the dynamic, fun atmosphere of the playground. The children are dressed in typical casual wear of the period, including jeans and colorful tops.\n\nSurrounding the merry-go-round, the playground is equipped with various other play structures, including what appears to be a complex climbing frame made of wood. This is partially visible in the background, suggesting a well-equipped park that fosters physical activity and play.\n\nThe ground is covered in dirt or sand, typical for playgrounds of this era, adding a natural and somewhat rugged texture to the scene. This setting allows for a glimpse into a moment of joyful childhood play, emphasizing a sense of community and active engagement among the children.","title":"Boys in Washington square park, greenwich village, lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549666","555946","546781","546562","548488","555931","545867","556290","551725","555928","553512","549674","547875","557410","547188","556287"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["playground","play","go","child","foster","climbing","childhood","push","round","park"]}
