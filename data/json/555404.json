{"path":"555404.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up view of a door with various signs. On the left side of the door, there's a vertical sign that reads \"PULL\" in capitalized white letters, set against a black background with white specks. The edges and corners of this pull sign show signs of wear and scratches.\n\nOn the right side, there are two signs atop each other. The top sign has a red border and white background and reads, “OUR NEW HOURS 6am ~ 1am.” Below this text, it elaborates “Due to the Energy Crisis...” and features an illustration of a broken light bulb with a zigzag crack producing a lightning symbol. The illustration uses shades of grey for the bulb and yellow and orange for the crack and bolt.\n\nDirectly below the top sign, there is another sign stating “SHOES & SHIRTS must be worn - STATE LAW.” This sign is simpler, with a white background and straightforward black text.\n\nThe background outside these signs is dark, indicating that the photograph may have been taken during low light or at night. Overall, the composition conveys a direct and informative message with a focus on the entrance and signage of what appears to be a public or commercial establishment, possibly affected by specific state regulations and energy conservation measures.","title":"Sign posted in a doorway entrance to a restaurant explaining shorter hours due to the fall of 1973 energy crisis in Oregon.
