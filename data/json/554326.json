{"path":"554326.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene viewed through the window of a subway train. The focus is on the passengers inside the train, seen through the window frame, which is painted in a weathered teal with visible rivets. The interior of the subway car is crowded with passengers, suggesting it might be during rush hour. Most of the visible passengers appear to be in a standing position, indicating the crowded nature of the car.\n\nIn the foreground, through the window, are two people. A woman to the left, wearing a bright red top and a dark overcoat, is facing towards another passenger, though her gaze is directed outside or towards the viewer. Next to her, a man is seated, wearing glasses and a dark coat, holding onto a pole, likely for stability.\n\nThe lighting inside the train gives off a warm ambiance, contrasting with the cooler tones of the train's exterior. The passengers in the background blend into a somewhat crowded and indistinct scene typical of a busy subway ride. The focus and composition offer a candid and somewhat intimate glimpse into a moment of everyday urban life, emphasizing themes of commute, diversity, and the proximity shared by strangers in public transit environments.","title":"Subway car","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554327","556669","556665","548256","556817","554328","556661","556780","554370","556653","548261","556654","556691","548258","554324","549650"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["passenger","subway","train","crowd","rivet","overcoat","window","stability","teal","commute"]}
