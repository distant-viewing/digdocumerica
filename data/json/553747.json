{"path":"553747.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image features a statue of a figure dressed in traditional or ceremonial attire. The statue is posed standing upright and is captured in a side profile view. The figure wears a textured cape or mantle that covers from the shoulders down, and a distinctive helmet that extends outward at the top, possibly indicating a historical or mythical context. The helmet and cape appear adorned or crafted with a detailed, glittering pattern, suggesting a material like gold or a gold-tone metal.\n\nThe figure holds a long, slender spear vertically with one hand, and the other hand is extended forward, as if in a gesture of proclamation or command. The overall posture of the figure exudes a sense of nobility, authority, or divine rule.\n\nThe background is dark and blurred, with hints of deep green foliage, indicating that the statue could be situated in an outdoor setting, possibly in a park or a wooded area, which emphasizes a serene or commemorative atmosphere around the sculpture. \n\nThe lighting in the photograph is subdued, casting shadows on the figure which accentuate the texture and silhouette, adding to the mystic and venerable aura of the statue.","title":"Statue of King Kamehameha the Great who ruled Hawaii from 1795 to 1819.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["558114","548288","558115","544076","558133","548289","553163","558269","553769","556318","558278","553746","552736","558113","553281","549585"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["statue","figure","gold","helmet","rule","authority","command","aura","sculpture","craft"]}
