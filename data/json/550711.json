{"path":"550711.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting surrounded by a natural landscape. In the foreground, a large heap of wood chips dominates the image, indicative of an industrial process related to wood or paper production. The middle ground features a factory with two large chimneys emitting white smoke, alongside other industrial structures including what appears to be a conveyor belt or loading mechanism, suggesting active industrial operations. The factory is labeled with the words \"Union Paper.\"\n\nThe background presents a contrast to the industrial activity, showcasing a range of mountains under a hazy sky, possibly indicating air pollution or mist. The mountains provide a natural and serene backdrop, which juxtaposes sharply with the industrial foreground. This setting likely raises considerations of environmental impact and industrializationâ€™s role in the landscape. The overall composition underlines themes of industry versus nature, highlighting human industrial activity set against the broader context of the natural environment.","title":"Oxford Paper Company mill at Rumford.
