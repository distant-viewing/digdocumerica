{"path":"553854.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque landscape that features a vibrant, double rainbow arching over a bucolic setting. The focus of the image is a wide-open field covered in short grass and dotted with wildflowers. The field extends into the distance, ending at a gentle, grassy hill. The hillâ€™s base is the landing point of the rainbow; the colors vividly touch down and seem to illuminate that spot with an array of hues from red to violet.\n\nOn the mid-right side of the image, a small rural farmstead can be seen. It consists of several simple, white buildings, likely farmhouses and barns, grouped together. This cluster forms a quaint, human presence in the otherwise natural landscape. The sky above is a muted gradient of blue and gray, suggesting either a clearing storm or the late hours of the day.\n\nOverall, the composition is framed to emphasize the expansive, open quality of the terrain and the striking appearance of the rainbows against this pastoral backdrop. The photograph conveys a sense of tranquility and the simple beauty of rural landscapes. The particular moment captured here, with the rainbows perfectly positioned over the hill and farm, adds a magical and almost surreal quality to the scene.","title":"San luis valley after rain.
