{"path":"551292.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor miniature golf scene at night. The most striking feature is a large, fantasy-style tree with a gaping mouth, acting as an obstacle or theme decoration on the mini golf course. This \"haunted tree\" is intricately designed with facial features: big eyes with blue irises, a wide nose, and an open mouth revealing sharp teeth and a red interior, adding an eerie character to the setting.\n\nTowards the bottom of the photo, two individuals are visible, engaged in the game. The person closest to the camera is a young girl in a sleeveless, plaid shirt and shorts, holding a golf club and watching a golf ball. Another player, partly obscured and facing away, appears to be taking a shot, bending over the miniature golf course. Both players seem focused on the game.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a sign stands prominently displaying \"No. 9 HAUNTED TREE PAR 3,\" indicating this tree-themed obstacle is the 9th hole of the course and has a difficulty of par 3.\n\nThe background is dimly lit, which casts shadows and complements the haunted theme. Partial views of other parts of the golf course are visible in the background, lit by ambient light, likely from streetlamps or specialized lighting for the course. The night setting and artificial lighting contribute to the mysterious and playful atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Pam Wells (5) and brother Brian (9) try the hazards of a miniature golf course in Lake Ozark","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["554149","543633","551288","557512","552608","554492","554167","545249","546959","546513","554148","549069","548821","543262","558098","555112"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["golf","course","obstacle","player","game","mouth","night","no","tooth","club"]}
