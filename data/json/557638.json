{"path":"557638.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts an older, slightly weathered two-story wooden house featuring a prominent front porch with decorative woodwork. The house has a shared architectural style with an adjacent home visible to the left, suggesting a residential neighborhood of similar structures. The photo is captured in a monochrome blue tone, adding a vintage or historical feel.\n\nOn the porch, there are items suggesting domestic life, such as clothing hung out to dry on a line, indicating that this is a lived-in space. In front of the house, a sidewalk runs parallel to the frontage, and a male figure is shown in mid-stride walking past the house. The man appears to be dressed in a coat and hat, typical of earlier 20th-century attire.\n\nThe front yard is small with sparse grass, and there's a curb that separates the yard from what could be a street in front of the house. The overall condition of the house and surrounding setting gives a modest, utilitarian sense of dwelling and everyday life. The image evokes a moment captured in time, reflecting a scene from daily life in a possibly historical context.","title":"Man in front of a house in Galveston, Texas. This is one of a series of 21 black and white photographs. They document the environments remaining from the 19th century in terms of architecture, commerce and lifestyles. The pictures also compare the contemporary city showing displacement of the unique by the ordinary and noting current urban problems. The pictures show a region and its uniqueness in people and architecture in East Texas which is still a part of the South.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557286","557641","550117","557646","558110","546439","552489","557633","550704","555581","551091","550113","545522","557640","550121","547792"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["house","yard","porch","woodwork","walking","life","stride","front","curb","sidewalk"]}
