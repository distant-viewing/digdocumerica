{"path":"552134.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The image depicts a natural outdoor setting featuring a prominent drainpipe which runs through a reddish-brown earthen section that appears to be partially eroded. This pipe, likely made of concrete, discharges into a body of water at the lower part of the frame. The water appears slightly rippled, suggesting either the flow of liquid from the pipe or a breeze.\n\nAbove the pipe, the land is strewn with various sizes of rocks and stones, leading up the slope. Vegetation, consisting of dense brush and trees with golden yellow foliage reminiscent of autumn, crowns the top of this hilly area, spreading horizontally across the upper portion of the frame. \n\nThe overall scene gives an impression of a semi-wild location where the practical elements of human infrastructure intersect with a natural environment, possibly indicating issues related to water drainage or environmental management in rural or semi-rural settings. The weather appears clear due to the brightness and vividness of the colors, particularly the yellow foliage against the deep blue of the sky, which isn't visible but implied by the lighting.","title":"Culvert empties into snohomish river at everett","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["547121","543759","543170","552022","553467","555555","555550","551424","549064","546793","555559","543666","543670","550713","550193","549065"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pipe","crown","discharge","drainage","brush","erode","foliage","liquid","breeze","vividness"]}
