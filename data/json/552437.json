{"path":"552437.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures two young boys in a suburban setting, walking along a barrier of sandbags. The background features small single-story houses, suggesting a residential neighborhood. The sandbags appear to have been strategically placed to contain flooding from a water body, possibly a river or street flooding, which is evident on both sides of the sandbag line. The boys, one wearing a green shirt and light-colored hat, and the other in a red shirt, are walking away from the photographer, navigating atop the uneven surface of the sandbags.\n\nThe surroundings are lush with mature trees and green grass, indicating a serene neighborhood environment. The bright sunny day casts clear shadows and highlights the reflective surface of the floodwater that mirrors the clear sky and trees. The image gives an implied narrative of local impact, possibly due to a natural disaster like heavy rain or river overflow, and shows a makeshift yet common solution of using sandbags for flood control. The general atmosphere, while seemingly calm and sunny, hints at the resilience and adaptation of the community in response to flooding, emphasizing a moment of normalcy and childhood curiosity within a disrupted environment.","title":"The small town in Liverpool is hard hit by spring flooding of the Illinois River.
