{"path":"546495.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures an older man walking by a classical architectural structure, which features a row of ornate columns supporting gothic arches. The setting suggests that this might be part of an old university or an institutional building. The atmosphere is solemn and slightly moody, accentuated by the soft lighting and the shadowy surroundings.\n\nThe man, dressed in a red sweater over a collared shirt, appears thoughtful as he walks, his gaze directed upward, possibly admiring the architecture or lost in thought. His hair is white and he holds a dignified, reflective demeanor as he moves by the scene. The columns are detailed, showing intricate capitals atop each one, and the arches between them add a rhythmic architectural beauty to the composition. \n\nA lantern attached to the column provides a gentle light, which contributes to the overall serene and introspective mood of the photograph. The intricate metal fence in the foreground adds a touch of detail to the base of the image, framing the man walking and providing a contrast to the columnsâ€™ smooth texture. The combination of architectural beauty and a single human element evokes a sense of solitude and contemplation.","title":"Bartholomew County Courthouse.
