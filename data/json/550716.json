{"path":"550716.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a large factory landscape. The image shows multiple tall smokestacks, from which plumes of smoke are emitting into the sky. One stack in particular is releasing a heavy black smoke, while others emit white steam, suggesting different processes or materials being handled within the facility. The background features a hazy, overcast sky which gives the scene a somewhat gloomy appearance.\n\nIn the foreground, there is an expansive open area scattered with piles of wood chips, suggesting the factory may be involved in wood processing or paper production. Various industrial machinery and structures, including conveyor belts and metal frames, are visible, indicating ongoing industrial operations. The ground seems muddy and includes patches of grass and dirt, likely due to industrial activity and outdoor storage.\n\nThe overall composition of the image provides a stark representation of industrial impact, contrasting the natural elements present with the mechanical and pollution aspects of the factory. The presence of vibrant industrial activity is stark against the natural landscape visible in the distance, possibly mountains or hills, further emphasizing the environmental and visual impact of the industry.","title":"International paper company mill at jay on the androscoggin river","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["543005","550875","545244","546908","543011","551060","545925","548195","546141","550329","550981","550869","546808","544735","550998","551056"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["factory","emit","wood","smoke","release","impact","chip","representation","conveyor","production"]}
