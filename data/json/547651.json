{"path":"547651.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban street scene that provides a glimpse into a bygone era, likely around the 1960s or 1970s, judging by the style and model of the vehicles present. The image is shot from a perspective looking down a major roadway lined with numerous electrical wires and traffic signals; the red traffic light in the foreground is particularly prominent.\n\nThe road is filled with a variety of vehicles, including sedans, station wagons, and trucks, indicative of this period. There's a large truck in the immediate foreground with a worn and heavy-duty look, suggesting it is used for construction or industrial purposes. The cars depict a range of colors and are mostly American models, which align with the time period suggested.\n\nTowards the background, the urban landscape features large industrial structures, possibly factories or warehouses, with visible signage that includes a prominent \"Texaco\" sign, indicating the presence of a gas station or a sponsored billboard nearby. The cityscape in the distant background features tall buildings, including what appears to be a few skyscrapers, blending commercial zones with industrial areas.\n\nOverhead, a network of power lines and poles crisscrosses, typical of mid-20th-century American city infrastructure, adding to the cluttered skyline. The atmosphere seems relatively clear but slightly hazy, possibly due to pollution or the photographic film's properties used during this era. \n\nOverall, this photograph provides a rich visual document of industrial and commercial activity in an American city from decades ago, showcasing elements of daily life, transportation, and urban development during that time.","title":"Downtown Providence looking towards the central business district","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547369","545216","549872","556724","550139","545463","556709","551135","545498","549882","554297","555910","548388","546626","556224","549856"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["period","model","station","traffic","truck","era","billboard","shoot","city","wagon"]}
