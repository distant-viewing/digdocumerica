{"path":"552895.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This image showcases a dramatic sunset over a mountainous horizon. The sky is a striking canvas of colors, ranging from deep blue on the upper portion to shades of bright orange, pink, and a golden yellow where the sun has set behind the mountains. The clouds are thin and spread across the sky, highlighted by the sunset colors, creating a sweeping, fiery effect that they appear to be almost brush strokes against the darker sky.\n\nThe mountains silhouette at the bottom forms a dark, unbroken line, providing a strong contrast to the vivid sky. The horizon line is straight, suggesting the landscape is open and vast. The overall mood of the photo is serene yet vibrant, emphasizing natural beauty and the drama of the changing sky during the sunset. There are no human figures or man-made objects visible; the focus is purely on the natural elements. The photograph likely captures a moment of quiet and tranquility while witnessing a spectacular end to the day.","title":"Dawn over the Lake Range, seen from the south tip of Pyramid Lake.
