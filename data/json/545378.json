{"path":"545378.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view of a railway track slicing through a natural landscape. The perspective is from an elevated point, possibly a bridge, looking directly down the straight, narrow track. The railway stretches into the distance, meeting the horizon beneath another overpass or bridge.\n\nThe railway is nestled between two steep, rocky embankments, each covered with dense vegetation, adding a sense of seclusion and envelopment to the corridor-like space. The embankments are overrun with lush greenery, primarily leaves that hint it might be late spring or summer. Little patches of soil and rock that have eroded away are visible, creating a rugged and slightly unkempt appearance on the embankments. A puddle of water can be seen on one side of the track, reflecting the surrounding greenery and adding a tranquil element to the scene.\n\nThe bridge visible in the background spans across the track, built of a material that matches the natural brown and earthy tones of the scene. It provides a strong horizontal line that contrasts with the verticality of the embankments and the linear path of the tracks.\n\nThe soft, natural lighting, possibly of early morning or late afternoon, enhances the serene and somewhat moody atmosphere of the place. There are no people or moving trains visible in the photograph, emphasizing solitude and a stillness that is only broken by the natural sounds one would imagine in such a setting.","title":"Railroad tracks near route 269","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["550790","556769","556856","556837","556009","556759","556851","556841","544706","549131","555887","556854","557958","557975","556873","557962"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["embankment","track","railway","bridge","sound","verticality","corridor","overpass","erode","seclusion"]}
