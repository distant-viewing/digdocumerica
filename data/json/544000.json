{"path":"544000.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures the intense and industrial atmosphere inside a metal foundry or steel mill. The image shows large, open vats filled with molten metal glowing in a vibrant orange-yellow, indicating extreme heat. One of these vats is in the foreground, and its contents emit a fierce light that illuminates parts of the surrounding area.\n\nA worker, visible in the middle distance, wears protective gear including a hard hat and is partially silhouetted against the bright background. He appears to be overseeing the process or operating equipment. His presence conveys the scale and the hazardous environment of the workspace.\n\nThe setting is characterized by a robust industrial framework with metal beams, pipes, and platforms. There are steam and fumes rising in various parts of the frame, adding to the chaotic and hot environment typical of such facilities. The overall lighting is dim, punctuated by the intense glow from the molten metal, casting an eerie light on the complex structures within the mill.\n\nThe photograph effectively conveys the harsh working conditions and the industrial might involved in metal processing, highlighting the blend of human labor and extreme temperatures that define such environments.","title":"Refining operations at the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Company","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["549694","543996","549695","549693","544041","557395","544049","557399","557402","557400","545536","544001","544004","545532","557397","557401"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["metal","mill","fume","temperature","heat","workspace","content","steel","pipe","framework"]}
