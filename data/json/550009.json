{"path":"550009.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene focusing on an industrial brick building under a dramatic sky. The composition primarily includes a towering brick smokestack, which is set against a vivid blue sky scattered with wispy, feather-like clouds. The smokestack, aligned to the right of the frame, has a strong, cylindrical form with a pronounced lip around the top and embossed text near its summit, although the text is not clearly readable. To the left and partially visible, another segment of an expansive brick building can be seen, featuring rows of uniformly spaced windows suggesting it is likely an old factory or mill.\n\nThe perspective is upwards, emphasizing the height of the smokestack compared to the multi-storied building beside it. This angle also enhances the vastness and expressive pattern of the clouds, which seem to radiate outward from behind the structure, filling the sky and adding a dynamic element to the scene. The industrial architecture, combined with the impressive sky, suggests themes of historical industry and nature's overwhelming scale and beauty.","title":"Waltham Watch Company factory.
