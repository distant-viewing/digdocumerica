{"path":"543395.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and wholesome outdoor scene set on a sandy beach at what appears to be late afternoon, based on the warm lighting. The shot is filled with dynamic actions centered around a group of people and a dog interacting near the foamy edge of the ocean.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, a young girl wearing a white shirt and patterned shorts is seen joyfully playing in the water, splashing around the incoming wave with a delighted stance. Her body is angled towards the camera as she appears to be pulling her foot up from the surf.\n\nA bit towards the center, a woman in a white shirt and dark pants is bent over, reaching towards the water. She could be engaging with a smaller unseen object or activity in the sea, possibly accompanied by the young girl standing next to her on the right, who is partially obscured by her body.\n\nMoving to the right, there is a group of three peopleâ€”possibly a family. They are turned away from the camera, watching the ocean intently. The nearest individual to the camera among them is a woman with dark hair, bundled up in a sweater and pants, suggesting the weather might be slightly cool.\n\nA dog, possibly a Golden Retriever or a similar breed, is in motion on the sandy beach, oriented towards the right side of the frame, adding an element of energetic life to the scene.\n\nThe ocean itself is richly textured with white foam and gentle waves, beautifully reflecting the late sunlight. The background is straightforward, emphasizing the broad, open sea which meets a clear sky at the horizon.\n\nOverall, the composition eloquently portrays a moment of leisure and interaction with nature, filled with the simple pleasures of sea, family, and pets.","title":"Southern California -- Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["545218","553072","543390","543463","543072","543396","548695","547009","548697","544191","543500","548292","543070","553951","546982","552341"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["ocean","sea","dog","family","girl","camera","beach","pet","breed","wave"]}
