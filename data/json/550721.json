{"path":"550721.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a river flowing between two concrete structures which seem to be part of an old dam or some sort of water control system. Each of the concrete structures on either side of the river has visible damage and erosion. Some parts of the concrete have crumbled away, exposing the inner steel reinforcements that are somewhat corroded.\n\nThe river itself is calm, with a reflective surface that captures the grey, overcast sky above. The banks of the river near the structures appear eroded, possibly undercut by the flow of the water.\n\nIn the foreground, there is an array of wildflowers, predominantly white, growing along the riverbank, suggesting spring or summer season. These add a natural, softer contrast to the harsh, man-made structures.\n\nThe environment around the river is lush and green, indicating a rich, natural landscape possibly accustomed to regular moisture. The top of the photograph shows the opposite side of the river, which appears to be lined with dense vegetation and trees, reflecting untouched nature as opposed to the developed side in the foreground. \n\nThis scene might capture concepts of decay, the passage of time, and nature reclaiming human-made structures, or could raise environmental or conservation issues regarding water management and infrastructure maintenance.","title":"Point where the heavily polluted Allen Brook flows into the Androscoggin River.
