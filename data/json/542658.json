{"path":"542658.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an action-packed scene focusing on fire training exercises. In the foreground, there is a large metal container with vigorous flames emerging from it. This container is presumably being used for a controlled fire training exercise.\n\nTowards the left of the image, a fireman is partially visible; he appears to be observing or manipulating equipment related to the training. His presence suggests the seriousness and practical element of the training environment.\n\nThe middle ground prominently features a fire truck ladder extended high into the air against a clear sky. At the top of the ladder, a firefighter is undertaking what looks to be a training or rescue simulation. The ladder's considerable height escalates the intensity and realism of the training scenario.\n\nThe background is minimalistic, providing a contrast that highlights the activities in the forefront. The clear blue sky indicates the exercise is conducted on a fair-weather day, ideal for such training.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph combines elements of emergency response training with dynamic visual components such as fire and the significant height of the fire truck ladder, emphasizing the danger and skill involved in firefighting tasks.","title":"Research associate Erv Mateer observes the burning of wheat straw in agricultural burning tower; the purpose is to improve burn methods of agricultural waste disposal, and to reduce contaminants.","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["555482","543904","548854","543900","543908","558311","558309","555481","556596","555156","555160","543933","555917","543002","553598","558308"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["training","ladder","fire","exercise","height","container","realism","seriousness","truck","danger"]}
