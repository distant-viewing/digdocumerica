{"path":"550874.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph features a silhouette of a large industrial crane, prominently set against a dusky or stormy sky. The crane, which seems to be of considerable size and built of heavy metal, features intricate latticework and multiple beams. Attached to the crane are multiple blocky, bucket-like components, likely used for lifting heavy materials such as gravel or ore, indicated by the large mounds of such materials piled beneath the craneâ€™s structure.\n\nThese crane buckets are suspended in various stages of action, some appear to be in motion, while others are stationed. The background behind the crane is a subtly lit sky, providing a dramatic and somewhat moody atmosphere to the scene. The overall composition emphasizes industrial strength and function, focusing on the geometry and mechanical aesthetics of the crane against the more natural forms of piled materials and the shape of the sky behind. This photograph likely illustrates the crane's role in an industrial or construction setting where heavy loads are manipulated and moved.","title":"Coal is unloaded from freighter in canal alongside the Charmin Paper Company.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547615","544127","544109","547223","553027","555269","550907","544157","545655","544378","555273","548559","555593","554545","547113","555285"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","bucket","material","ore","pile","strength","manipulate","suspend","lift","gravel"]}
