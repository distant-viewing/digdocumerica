{"path":"552552.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a cluster of delicate pink flowers illuminated against a stark, dark background. The stem of the flowers rises from the lower left corner of the frame, curving slightly as it ascends to the right side, where it bears multiple small, star-shaped flowers. Each flower has slender petals radiating from its center, creating an elegant and fragile appearance. The background is completely dark, which starkly contrasts with the bright flowers and enhances their vivid pink color. The lighting appears to be focused on the flowers, giving them a glow that makes them the prominent element of the composition. The overall mood of the image is both somber and striking, with the darkness enveloping the luminous beauty of the flowers.","title":"Piceance basin, semi-arid range land","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["553588","554843","554595","543597","555106","557586","553366","545695","557618","550462","542970","554586","544934","557545","545726","554111"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","flowers","strik","ascend","star","petal","envelope","stem","darkness","bear"]}
