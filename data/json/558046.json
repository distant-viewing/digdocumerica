{"path":"558046.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a lush, green landscape, predominantly characterized by dense tree coverage interspersed with bodies of water. The image is dominated by a winding river or canal, enveloped by thick foliage. The river reflects sunlight adding a shimmering effect to the scene. Various shades of green differentiate the types of vegetation and trees. No human activity or structures are prominently visible, suggesting a natural, possibly remote location. The area gives off a tranquil, secluded vibe, offering a snapshot of a serene natural environment. The camera's angle suggests the photo was taken from a significant height, possibly from an aircraft, giving a broad perspective of the winding waterways and surrounding greenery.","title":"Aerial view of the old Ohio-Erie Canal, at the left, and the Cuyahoga River. The Indians gave it the name because it means \"crooked\". Canal Road skirts the canal, south of Cleveland, Ohio. The canal was heavily used for commerce between 1833 and 1913 as a link between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi river systems. The waterway was put out of business by a flood and the railroads. This area is part of the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550569","557107","553452","552838","550601","556964","550559","550622","550576","556931","550570","550625","550616","550571","550621","550527"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["coverage","canal","aircraft","river","waterway","vibe","height","snapshot","angle","type"]}
