{"path":"552763.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a scene on a city street, characterized by a moody and atmospheric ambiance. It features a young girl, seen from behind, walking alone down a sidewalk. The girl is dressed in a light blue short-sleeve shirt and a pleated skirt that appears to be purple or dark blue, complemented by dark socks and black shoes. Her hair, matching in color with her shirt, is short and neatly kept.\n\nThe setting depicts a typical urban environment. The right side of the image shows a stretch of road lined with bricks and a chain fence. The left side is mostly obscured by shadow but includes the top of a parked car. The street itself appears somewhat deserted and littered, with debris scattered on the road and pavement. In the background, a few muted figures can be seen walking or standing, their features indistinct.\n\nThe light in the scene is particularly notableâ€”it seems to be either dawn or dusk, as the shadows are long and the lighting is dim, yet beautifully diffused. This creates a somewhat somber and isolating mood. The girl's figure is highlighted by a soft glow, drawing attention to her amidst the more shadowy surroundings.\n\nAdding to the urban feel, the walls beside the sidewalk have graffiti, visible but not completely readable, contributing to a sense of grit or decay. The overall visual composition uses these elements to capture a moment of solitude and quiet motion, possibly conveying themes of loneliness, introspection, or the everyday life of urban environments.","title":"School girl on street in north Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552758","552747","549916","556763","552756","553539","552742","547695","546563","546494","546498","546504","545372","545415","551723","555934"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["girl","sidewalk","introspection","sock","figure","walk","standing","street","pavement","isolate"]}
