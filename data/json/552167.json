{"path":"552167.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view capturing a coastal area, primarily highlighting a relationship between industrial and natural elements. The image is dominated by deep blue waters that contrast with the rough textures of sandy and rocky shores. \n\nThe upper part of the image shows the ocean with slight white foamy waves breaking near the shore. In the water, close to the edge, there are three small boats or watercraft, spaced out and seemingly stationary, casting subtle shadows on the water surface.\n\nThe middle and lower parts feature a large industrial building adjacent to the shore. This building is dark in color with a flat roof and multiple sections, one of which displays a greenish roof. Connected to this building, there are structures that extend into the water, possibly docks or loading areas. Alongside the edge of the building, multiple piles of what could be shipping containers or industrial materials are neatly arranged in rows. \n\nThe left and bottom sections of the shoreline are more naturally textured with mixes of sand and rocks, and a minimal presence of human activity or additional structures. The contrast between the industrial activity and the natural shoreline shapes the primary visual tension in the photograph.","title":"Pulping waste from ITT Rayonier sulphite pulp mill discolors water","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551574","551607","551606","556912","544527","544976","552000","543298","544650","543405","551953","552245","552215","552244","551566","543364"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["shore","shoreline","watercraft","tension","section","relationship","loading","building","roof","water"]}
