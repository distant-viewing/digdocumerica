{"path":"546297.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of a person engaged in oyster harvesting or examination. The focal point of the image is a metal cage, heavily worn and rusted, filled with clumps of oysters. The person, partially visible from the waist up, is wearing a white short-sleeved t-shirt and blue jeans. They are manipulating the cage, seemingly either lifting it or moving its contents, with their hands which are also visible in the shot.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor aquatic environment, indicated by the glimpse of calm blue water in the background. The person is standing next to a wooden surface, which appears to be a pier or dock, illustrating a typical setting for marine activities. The image is suffused with natural, bright daylight, enhancing the textures and rustic feel of the cage and the rough surfaces of the oysters.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts an active, physical interaction with marine life, suggestive of the labor involved in fishing or marine cultivation industries. The rustic tools and simple attire hint at a practical, hands-on approach typical of such activities.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: personnel aboard the EPA vessel, Dolphin, are taking oysters from nearby waters.
