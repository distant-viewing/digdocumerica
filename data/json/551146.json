{"path":"551146.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a contrast between industrial and residential areas, depicting the intricate relationship between industry and urban living. In the foreground, a residential neighborhood with neat rows of houses, each with pitched roofs, can be seen. These homes have small yards, and the area is densely populated, indicating a typical suburban setting. Some trees are interspersed among the homes, providing a touch of greenery to this urban landscape.\n\nDominating the center and background of the image is a large industrial complex, likely a steel mill or similar facility, characterized by its multiple tall, cylindrical smokestacks from which plumes of dark smoke are billowing into the sky. This suggests ongoing industrial activity and possibly signifies the environmental impact associated with such industries. The complex includes various large structures and storage tanks, and extensive piping can be seen throughout the facility, indicative of a heavily mechanized operation.\n\nEncircling the industrial area are lush green hills, which emphasize the encroachment of industry into the natural landscape. This juxtaposition invites reflection on the balance between industrial development and residential life, as well as environmental considerations.\n\nOverall, the composition clearly delineates the influence of industrial activities on a suburban community, both architecturally and environmentally, set against a naturally beautiful backdrop.","title":"Smokestacks of the Union Carbide plant in South Charleston the residential section is close by.","placename":"Charleston (W.
