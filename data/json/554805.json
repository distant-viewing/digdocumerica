{"path":"554805.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This image depicts a somewhat bleak and rugged outdoor scene. The setting is a curved gravel road bounded on either side by large geological formations. To the left, there is a tall vertical cliff revealing multiple sedimentary rock layers, showing their natural stratification. This rock face appears dark and weathered, suggesting exposure to elements over time. On the right side, the scene is bordered by a large mound composed of what seems to be loose, broken rocks or debris, possibly from mining or natural erosion.\n\nDominating the scene, thereâ€™s an older model car, possibly from the mid to late 20th century, colored in red with a visible bright design or trim on its side. The car is driving along the road, moving away from the viewer, and despite the rough conditions of the road surface, it portrays a sense of adventure or exploration of a remote area.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is slightly desolate and moody, accentuated by an overcast sky that fills the background with muted, cool tones, suggesting cold weather or an impending storm. The road is visibly wet, reflecting recent or ongoing rain, adding to the overall raw and natural aesthetic of the scene. The absence of any human subjects outside the car or buildings gives a sense of isolation and untouched wilderness.","title":"This gravel road is used to haul coal from the shovel.
