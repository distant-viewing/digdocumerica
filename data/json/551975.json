{"path":"551975.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary male figure emerging from a shadowy, industrial setting. The scene is dominated by a large, corroded metal door with vertical slats, painted in a deep blue hue that is substantially worn and flaking, revealing patches of lighter blue and white. The man, positioned slightly off-center and stepping out of the doorway, is wearing work-related attire including a safety helmet, a heavy jacket over a shirt, and dark pants. His expression is not clearly visible, but his stance and the way he holds one arm against the door frame suggest a moment of pause or contemplation.\n\nThe lighting in the scene is dim, casting deep shadows and contributing to an overall mood of mystery and intensity. The weathered texture of the door and its large scale relative to the human figure add a strong element of rough industrial aesthetic. There is a significant contrast between the dark indoor environment and the slightly brighter, yet still gloom-laden outdoor setting where the man stands. The overall composition and the blue-toned color palette lend the photograph a cinematic quality, with an emphasis on solitude and perhaps a hint of foreboding.","title":"Inland steel worker at shed entrance","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["544163","556618","547094","556391","553516","547427","544001","556443","546636","545401","552971","552724","556447","553794","552382","548072"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["door","slat","pause","figure","stance","mystery","doorway","intensity","outdoor","emphasis"]}
