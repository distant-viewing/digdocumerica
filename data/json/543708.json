{"path":"543708.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a young girl in a natural, outdoor setting, seemingly engaged in cleaning up litter. She is holding a black trash bag in her right hand and a plastic or paper cup in her left hand. The ground around her is scattered with various pieces of trash including papers, a blanket, and perhaps some clothing items like socks. The landscape includes tall, thin trees and a backdrop of mountains with patches of snow. The setting appears to be a forest or woodland area during a season that is not fully winter, as indicated by the presence of both snow and unfrozen ground. The overall scene evokes a sense of environmental conservation or a cleanup activity in a natural setting.","title":"Volunteer cleanup work on roadsides of Vail pass","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["552947","551421","550056","551427","543927","542655","544800","548191","550060","554538","548198","544648","551418","542657","552948","544640"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["trash","snow","cleaning","cleanup","sock","plastic","mountains","cup","conservation","hand"]}
