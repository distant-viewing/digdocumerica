{"path":"543172.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of water rushing over what appears to be a moss-covered rock. The scene might be located in a river or a small stream. The water's movement is captured in a smooth, almost silky texture, indicating a slow shutter speed used during shooting, which allows the water to blur into flowing lines.\n\nThe rock's surface is irregular and rugged, colored in shades of green, brown, and hints of yellow, likely due to moss and perhaps some algae. The focus on the central part of the image is sharp, showing detailed textures of the wet rock and moss, while the edges of the picture are more blurred and abstract, giving a sense of movement to the water.\n\nThe lighting appears natural, possibly softened by an overcast sky, enhancing the vividness of the green moss and the translucent quality of the water. There's a dynamic interplay of light and shadows across the surface of the rock, with some areas catching bright highlights that contrast against the deeper, shadowed grooves of the rock.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes nature's textures and the fluidity of water, creating a tranquil yet powerful depiction of a small, intimate natural scene.","title":"California--southern coastline","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["555212","545839","550843","544867","544862","543869","552061","555074","555077","550678","543185","543152","554407","544790","550726","545882"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["moss","rock","fluidity","water","groove","deeper","texture","rush","alga","movement"]}
