{"path":"557474.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a view through a chain-link fence focused on a warning sign. The sign, spray-painted with red lettering on a concrete box, prominently displays the words \"US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS NO TRESPASSING.\" Additional warnings in the same red paint underline that \"TRESPASSERS WILL BE SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.\"\n\nBeyond the fence in the background, we see a busy construction or perhaps a redevelopment scene on a shoreline. Numerous parked cars of various colors suggest the presence of many workers or visitors. We can also observe construction equipment and materials spread across the area. The setting appears to be in a coastal zone given the traces of a large body of water further in the background and the open, bright sky typical of such locations. This combination of elements—fenced-off construction area by the coast with stringent no trespassing warnings—suggests this might be a scene of governmental or significant infrastructural activity possibly involving restricted or controlled access.","title":"Sign on a fence at the camp pendleton marine base warns the public that this portion of the beach is restricted to military personnel.  The base shoreline has retained much of its natural beauty because of limited public access.  There are 1,072 miles of mainland shoreline (excluding San Francisco Bay) in the state.
