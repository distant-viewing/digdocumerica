{"path":"548706.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph displays a serene beachscape, portraying a shimmering, crystal-clear turquoise body of water gently lapping onto a sandy shore. The beach curves gracefully into the distance, edged by a patchy line of thin, sporadic vegetation and what appear to be small rocks or solid formations punctuating the smooth texture of the sand.\n\nIn the distance, the shoreline is bordered by a sparse string of low-lying foliage and trees, perhaps indicating a tropical or subtropical environment. The sky is a deep blue interspersed with scattered fluffy clouds, suggesting a bright, sunny day without the immediate threat of rain.\n\nThe water near the shore is transparent, revealing the sandy bottom, which contributes to the vividness of the seawater's color. On the beach, there are no signs of human activity or structures, giving the scene a natural and untouched appearance. This setting evokes a sense of tranquility and isolation, ideal for nature enthusiasts or those seeking solitude by the sea.","title":"Little duck key, a very small key, which is not developed land development regulations are needed if clear waters and sandy beaches like these are to be preserved in the area","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548757","547612","545280","547596","543287","543089","543425","545106","553782","548754","543303","543299","544989","547607","547608","547697"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","seek","crystal","shore","enthusiast","string","ideal","lap","vividness","punctuate"]}
