{"path":"551985.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"The photograph depicts a dilapidated waterfront area featuring a cluttered and muddy shoreline with debris scattered around. In the foreground, there is a muddy bank with visible dirt, small pieces of wood, shattered glass, and broken objects littering the ground. The water is shallow along this edge, with old wooden pilings sticking out of it, providing an impression of a neglected or abandoned dock or pier.\n\nMoving towards the middle ground, there is a wooden walkway or structure connected to a more intact dock system, which appears weathered and aged but still functional. Further in the background, there are industrial facilities, including large cranes and several moored vessels, suggesting ongoing activities, possibly related to shipping or industrial operations. In the far distance, across the water, industrial buildings and possibly more cranes line the horizon beneath a clear blue sky.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of industrial decline or environmental neglect, highlighting issues such as pollution and waterfront decay. This scene might evoke thoughts regarding environmental protection, industrial history, or urban decay depending on the viewer's perspective.","title":"Low tide on Arthur Kill reveals oil spills on the marsh grass at the Port Reading coal yard","placename":"New Jersey","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547622","547582","551984","548105","547581","547626","547893","547019","547577","547594","549307","549300","551978","547575","549306","546854"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["waterfront","crane","dock","decay","piling","decline","protection","shipping","history","thought"]}
