{"path":"552310.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph shows an atmospheric scene set on a body of water during either sunrise or sunset. The sky and water are imbued with a beautiful warm, rosy hue that suggests the glow of the sun just below the horizon. Dominating the composition is a small, solitary boat moving across the tranquil water surface. In the boat, there is one person visible, sitting towards the rear. The person appears to be either managing the boat or simply enjoying the peaceful environment.\n\nThis scene captures a serene moment, possibly hinting at themes of solitude, reflection, or the beauty of nature. The gentle ripples in the water add texture to the scene, while the overall tone and limited color palette evoke a sense of calm and stillness. The image is framed to focus entirely on the boat and its occupant, set against the vast, softly illuminated water, making the human figure seem small and contemplative amidst the expansive natural surroundings.","title":"Salmon fishermen at sunrise in the strait of juan de fuca","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547230","551214","543143","543888","547234","550914","557564","551215","549417","551313","548118","549374","543411","551222","552038","543880"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","water","imbue","rear","person","sunrise","stillness","manage","amidst","calm"]}
