{"path":"546204.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a curious juxtaposition of a cemetery and oil derricks. The setting is an expansive grassy field that serves as a cemetery, indicated by several large, prominent grave markers and abundant floral arrangements resting on or near the graves. The headstones, some of which are quite sizable and made of polished stone, display names such as \"FOWLER\" and \"PHILLIPS.\"\n\nIn the background, dominating the skyline, are multiple oil derricks constructed of metal frameworks. These towers are tall and thin, and although similar in design, they vary slightly in size and structure. The presence of these industrial elements in the proximity of a serene cemetery creates a striking contrast between the themes of industry and rest.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, indicating a bright, sunny day, which casts shadows around the grave markers and highlights the lush green of the grass. This setting conveys a peaceful yet somewhat incongruous atmosphere, considering the industrial activity represented by the oil derricks looming in the distance.","title":"Oil derricks in cemetery","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["546168","546179","546196","546379","554825","546147","546038","555566","545322","554791","546188","550364","552451","550731","545314","557184"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["cemetery","oil","marker","headstone","grave","proximity","framework","display","name","arrangement"]}
