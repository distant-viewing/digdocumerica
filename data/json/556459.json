{"path":"556459.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image portrays an elderly man lying on a sofa. He is partially covered with a gray blanket, his head rests on a white pillow at one end of the sofa, and he holds a red bandana in one hand. The man wears a red and white striped shirt, and looks directly at the camera with a serene and thoughtful expression.\n\nThe background is rustic and simplistic, featuring wooden paneling that lines the wall behind the sofa. The lighting in the room is soft and natural, suggesting that the photo might have been taken during the daytime. The mood appears quiet and contemplative. There's a small doily placed on the back of the sofa, adding a touch of homeliness to the scene. This photograph captures a moment of rest or repose, possibly in a personal living space or a family home environment.","title":"Ken Hatfield, 74, of Newton, West Virginia, near Charleston, in Mingo County.
