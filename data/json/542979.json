{"path":"542979.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a large circular pool filled with water, which reflects an overcast sky. A sun-like reflection (possibly caused by the sun or artificial lighting) is visible near the center of the waterâ€™s surface, emphasizing a sense of depth and adding luminosity to the scene. The rim of the pool is raised and constructed with a smooth, rounded concrete edge. In the foreground, the ground is dark and appears to be loosely textured, likely soil or a type of gravel common in industrial or construction sites.\n\nIn the background, industrial structures and facilities can be seen under a dusky or cloudy sky, giving an impression of an area surrounded by manufacturing or processing plants. Elements such as large buildings, towers, and scaffold-like structures are vaguely discernible, contributing to the industrial ambiance of the setting.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a person, who appears small due to the perspective, is seen walking away from the pool toward the industrial buildings. This figure, along with their reflection in the pool, conveys a sense of scale, indicating the substantial size of the pool compared to a human.\n\nOverall, the photograph combines elements of industry with a solitary, almost serene shot of a large water feature, set against a subdued and possibly polluted skyline, evoking thoughts on human interaction with industrial environments.","title":"Water treatment plant at sunset","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543524","542982","546899","547568","552984","552717","543568","549635","543573","552040","549636","543572","555891","547665","552012","546195"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pool","luminosity","solitary","scaffold","dusky","reflection","sun","rim","human","pollute"]}
