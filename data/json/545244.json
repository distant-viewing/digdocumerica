{"path":"545244.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a large factory or processing plant. The factory consists of multiple buildings and industrial structures, including silos, chimneys, and various interconnected metallic facilities. Quite prominently, the scene is engulfed in pollutants; several chimneys release thick, colored smoke into the air, ranging in hues from dark grey to lighter white.\n\nIn the foreground, a significant quantity of timber logs is piled, suggesting the site may be related to wood processing or paper manufacturing. There is evident contrast between the natural element represented by the wood logs and the heavy industrial activity in the background, illustrating an impactful human footprint on the environment. \n\nThe setting seems to be on the outskirts of a city or in a heavily industrialized zone, as indicated by other smaller structures and vehicles visible around the facility. The sky is visibly affected by the smoke emissions, lending a slightly hazy and polluted atmosphere to the scene.\n\nOverall, the image powerfully conveys themes of industrialization and environmental impact, emphasizing the scale and potential environmental consequences of such industrial activities.","title":"St. Regis pulp mill","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550716","543005","550875","545260","550340","550862","546908","545256","543749","557218","546141","543011","545236","550176","550981","550866"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","log","factory","processing","consequence","industrialize","engulf","wood","quantity","smoke"]}
