{"path":"549106.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image captures a serene and artistic sunset scene, viewed through a dusty or possibly dirty camera lens or window. The primary feature of this photograph is the large, vivid sun setting behind a hilly or mountainous silhouette. The sun is partially obscured by the ridge, emphasizing its rounded shape, and it bathes the scene in a rich, warm golden-orange glow.\n\nThe foreground and background are not distinct, blending into a uniform glow of color dominated by deep oranges and reds. The silhouette of the terrain is smooth and does not include any vegetation or man-made structures that are discernible, suggesting a barren or remote location. The quality of the sunlight suggests that the image was taken during the 'golden hour,' which is often sought after for its photography-friendly lighting qualities.\n\nAdding a touch of imperfection and texture, there appear to be scratches or residue on the lens or surface in front of the sensor, which are most noticeable in the bottom third of the image. This detail gives the photograph a somewhat aged or raw look, which could add a layer of nostalgia or rough beauty, depending on the viewerâ€™s interpretation.\n\nOverall, the composition is straightforward yet powerfully evocative, focusing on the natural beauty and simplicity of a sunset in a seemingly isolated place. The photograph could evoke feelings of tranquility, solitude, or the passage of time.","title":"Sunset at Topock Marsh, formed by Colorado River","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["542678","542680","553844","557447","557560","543144","552896","549847","543410","542679","548182","555070","557957","553816","554643","550646"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["glow","orange","sunset","imperfection","interpretation","residue","scratch","silhouette","sun","lens"]}
