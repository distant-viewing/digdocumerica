{"path":"551718.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant outdoor scene, likely at a market or public gathering. The central focus is a wooden table on which several large green glass bottles are displayed. Each bottle contains what appears to be plants or mini-terrariums. \n\nA woman with long red hair is seated in front of this table, actively engaged in arranging one of the bottles. She is wearing a green jacket and blue jeans, and has a focused expression as she handles the plants.\n\nStanding to the right, there are two women in conversation. One of them, who is blonde and holding a sheet of paper and a camera, seems to be showing something to the other, who is wearing a sleeveless black top and has dark hair. This interaction suggests they might be discussing the event or the items for sale.\n\nIn the background, various other individuals, including children and adults, can be seen. They are dressed casually, suitable for a day out at a market. There are more wooden tables visible, possibly indicating more stalls or displays in this area.\n\nThe setting is an outdoor space with trees and greenery in the background, hinting at a park-like environment. Overall, the atmosphere conveyed by the photo is one of casual leisure and community engagement, typical of public market days or outdoor fairs.","title":"Antique blown-glass bottles were among the attractions on display at the Spring Festival at Carl Schurz Park, between East End Avenue and the East River in Manhattan's Upper East Side.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551700","553242","551699","551698","551690","551694","551696","551695","550068","557135","551838","549924","550027","557131","551749","551687"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["market","bottle","table","stall","sheet","hair","plant","sale","woman","display"]}
