{"path":"548751.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image depicts an abandoned car found in a dense forest setting. The car, appearing significantly damaged and weathered, is primarily white in color with visible signs of rust and decay. It seems to be an older model, evident from the design of the headlights and the overall structure.\n\nThe car is surrounded by lush greenery, with various trees, shrubs, and plants encroaching on it, suggesting it has been in that spot for an extended period. The foliage is thick, with leaves ranging from bright to dark green, hinting that the photo might have been taken in a moderately sunny environment, given the lighting visible in the picture.\n\nNo people are visible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention mainly on the contrast between the man-made object and the natural environment enveloping it. The scene could evoke thoughts about nature reclaiming human artifacts or the environmental impact of abandoning cars in natural settings.","title":"Abandoned car in north key largo","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["546405","553008","549107","548750","553002","553007","547747","550797","550795","543680","547024","545540","546318","554920","546315","553010"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","abandoned","encroach","artifact","reclaim","bright","headlight","envelope","thought","abandon"]}
