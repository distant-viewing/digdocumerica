{"path":"543357.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph shows a store display window featuring several items and posters aimed at promoting the conservation of Cannery Row. On the left side of the window, there's a prominent black and white poster with a bold headline stating \"HELP US SAVE CANNERY ROW\". The poster features a cartoon-style illustration depicting an idyllic scene of Cannery Row, with buildings, a wharf, and marine life including a large fish and an octopus wearing a hat, sitting by a pile of cans. Below the illustration, the text reads \"THE FRIENDS TO SAVE CANNERY ROW ask that you: SIGN THE PETITION WRITE TO THE CITY OF MONTEREY\".\n\nIn the center of the display, there's an intricate sculpture hanging from the top of the window. This sculpture is made of various colorful knitting yarns or ropes that form a complex, branching structure, possibly representing some form of marine coral or tree.\n\nOn the right side of the window, another poster shows a retro advertisement for a show titled \"CAROL\" featuring illustrations of a woman with a horse, indicating events on Saturdays. Below this poster, there's a small handwritten card stating, \"This sculpture The return of life to a dead area is not through Rest\".\n\nReflections of buildings and sky can be seen in the window glass, suggesting that the photo was taken during the day. The inside part of the window frame is wooden and painted, and the reflections obscure deeper details of the store's interior.","title":"Southern California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["545154","543132","542814","552606","546187","551495","548223","555456","543221","547881","548168","556695","549810","557567","542812","554184"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["poster","illustration","sculpture","window","store","headline","cartoon","state","coral","card"]}
