{"path":"554684.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a lakeside with two individuals involved in launching a boat. The main elements are:\n\n1. **Car**: A vintage, green and tan station wagon stands partially submerged in the water along the lake's edge, its rear doors open. The car appears to be from the 1970s based on its design.\n\n2. **Boat**: A small, white motorboat with a windshield and a single visible seat floats on the water, connected to the shore by a rope. The boat’s registration reads \"NY-2011-AM\" on its side.\n\n3. **People**:\n   - **Person 1**: Wearing an orange jacket and a camouflage cap, this individual stands beside the car, appearing to observe or manage the unloading or securing of the boat.\n   - **Person 2**: This person, visible only partially and from the back, is engaged directly with the boat, standing in the water and holding onto the boat, possibly preparing to either secure it or ensure it is properly launched.\n\n4. **Environment**:\n   - **Water**: The lake’s surface is choppy, suggesting a breezy day, with clear visibility.\n   - **Background**: The lake is surrounded by low hills or mountains, and the sky is overcast, contributing to a serene yet slightly somber mood.\n\n5. **Composition**: The photograph is taken from a viewpoint near the shore, looking outward towards the lake. The positioning of the car and the boat leads the viewer’s eye diagonally from the foreground into the depth of the image, enhancing the perspective of depth and activity in the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a typical outdoor activity of launching a boat with the aid of a vehicle, set against a scenic backdrop that suggests a calm yet cool day, likely in a rural or semi-wilderness area.","title":"Hunters load an outboard motorboat behind their station wagon at the stillwater reservoir and public boat landing in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York state.
