{"path":"543856.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and jovial scene involving a group of people enjoying a ride in a classic blue car. The car appears to be a vintage sedan, evident from its distinct 1960s or 1970s design; it features a shiny chrome bumper and detailed grill, with the Texas license plate \"HHH-435\" visible.\n\nA young man in a light-colored shirt and dark pants is lying across the hood of the car, resting on his side and facing the camera with a relaxed attitude. His expression is obscured, but his posture suggests he is at ease, contributing to the playful mood.\n\nInside the car, through the open windows, four other individuals are visible. Two women and two men, all appearing joyful and possibly in their youthful ages, are raising their hands and flashing peace signs, indicative of their high spirits. The women wear bright, casual clothes; one in a pink top, and the other in a dark, possibly black, garment, while the men appear in more subdued colors with one wearing a plaid shirt.\n\nThe car is parked on a grassy area under an overcast sky, and a vast, flat landscape stretches into the distance, only minimally populated by thin, vertical structures that could be utility poles.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its dynamic range of expressions and casual styles, coupled with the classic automobile and expansive, open landscape, conveys a sense of freedom, joy, and youthful adventure. The image evokes a feeling of a carefree moment shared among friends in a bygone era.","title":"Migrant workers return home at dusk from a day in the sugar beet fields.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["547758","543947","546093","544389","544853","548303","548958","557874","552412","557709","556538","557684","557016","555475","557766","545342"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["car","ease","spirit","grill","bumper","freedom","garment","license","peace","friend"]}
