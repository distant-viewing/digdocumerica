{"path":"544297.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph displays a rustic handmade wooden sign in a rugged outdoor natural setting, likely within a rocky desert landscape. The sign itself is hand-painted with the words \"GOD GAVE US THIS LAND\" followed by \"ENJOY YOUR RECREATION\" in a red, old-fashioned text style, emphasizing a religious or spiritual appreciation of nature.\n\nThe sign is propped up against a backdrop of rocky, uneven terrain characterized by large boulders and stony surfaces showing various shades of brown and beige under bright sunlight. The composition suggests a harsh, arid environment, likely a canyon or a desert park. No human figures are visible in the image, focusing entirely on the sign and the natural surroundings. The overall feel is one of isolation and the untouched aspect of nature, with a message encouraging viewers to appreciate and enjoy these outdoor spaces.","title":"The broken sign is an example of damage by tourists in the remote HavaSupai Indian country.","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["544177","544845","545624","545109","543637","545591","545824","543641","545620","543724","544136","544913","548846","544239","544522","548845"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["sign","desert","appreciation","boulder","recreation","canyon","message","word","aspect","text"]}
