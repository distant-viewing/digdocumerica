{"path":"550783.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph features a serene and detailed image of a wetland area. The diverse vegetation typical of such ecosystems is prominent, with dense clusters of tall grasses and reeds taking the forefront of the image. The foreground is dominated by these reeds, some of which have tawny, feathery plumes at the top.\n\nIntricately interspersed among the reeds are patches of open water, reflecting light and adding a dynamic contrast to the darker, earthy tones of the vegetation. This water is possibly a slow-moving stream or part of a marsh.\n\nGoing further into the middle ground, there are more accumulated bodies of water surrounded by dense green vegetation. The water seems to weave through the terrain, creating natural channels that are bordered by grasses.\n\nIn the background, there is a slightly brighter reflection in the water, suggesting either a clearing in the sky above or a smoother water surface. The general atmosphere is one of quiet lushness, typical for a wetland, suggesting biodiversity and a thriving ecosystem.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes a depth and complexity typical of wetland environments, highlighting both water and plant elements in a natural, unstructured arrangement.","title":"From the confluence of swamps like this, and many lakes, the Wisconsin River rises in the northeastern part of the state.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547488","547532","557498","550786","545033","550670","544593","547589","550785","547500","544541","546205","544786","557445","553856","543561"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["reed","wetland","ecosystem","water","lushness","biodiversity","marsh","vegetation","grass","channel"]}
