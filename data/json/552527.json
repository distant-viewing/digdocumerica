{"path":"552527.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image captures an intriguing visual through an elongated, keyhole-shaped aperture in a surface that appears rough and flecked with specks of white, possibly snow or paint. Through this keyhole, a vibrant outdoor view is visible, showcasing a lush green meadow scattered with wildflowers and daisies. In the distance, a wooden, vertical slatted structure, possibly a fence or a garden shed, is seen partially enveloped by this meadow's greenery. The overall composition plays with depth and perspective, contrasting the immediate, rough texture surrounding the keyhole with the tranquil and inviting natural scene beyond it. The photograph evokes a sense of curiosity and discovery, inviting onlookers to peer through the keyhole into the hidden natural world it frames.","title":"Glendale cemetery in Elmore","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["555605","544281","557627","549154","551343","543660","548653","557782","545283","554562","544997","557099","550465","554982","545041","546463"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["meadow","invite","fleck","daisy","discovery","visual","peer","hide","onlooker","speck"]}
