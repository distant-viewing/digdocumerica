{"path":"558229.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a roller skating rink, where a group of children is actively involved in skating and playing. The central focus is on five children; four are visible in full, and one is partially seen. The children, who appear to be of varying ages from around 6 to 12 years old, are engaging in a playful activity that resembles a game, possibly a form of tag or dancing while skating.\n\nThree of the children, two boys and a girl, form a smaller group on the left side. One boy is attempting to hold or grab another boy's hand, perhaps trying to include him in a dance move or game. The central girl is bending backwards dramatically, her long blonde hair swinging towards the floor, as she either dodges or dances around the boyâ€™s outstretched arms.\n\nOn the right, another pair (a boy and a girl) are holding hands and leaning back against each other's pull, forming a bridge-like shape with their bodies. Both are wearing glasses and have blonde hair. The boy is dressed in a jersey with the number \"10,\" while the girl wears flared denim jeans.\n\nThe background shows the wooden floor of the rink, and out-of-focus figures in the distance suggest that there are many other skaters in the rink, contributing to a sense of a busy, communal atmosphere. The overall mood is joyful and energetic, typical of a youthful gathering in a recreational setting. The lighting in the image gives it a slightly vintage feel, indicating that the picture may have been taken during the late 20th century.","title":"Youngsters roller skating at izzy-dorry's roller rink at New Ulm, Minnesota.
