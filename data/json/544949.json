{"path":"544949.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures the remains of ancient, crumbling brick structures perched on the edge of a cliff. The bricks vary in color from red to orange, reflecting the time-worn nature of these ruins. These structures include partially standing walls that indicate former rooms or enclosures, with some walls taller than others, showcasing rough, uneven tops.\n\nThe location is a desert-type setting under clear blue skies, with gentle clouds scattered in the background. The terrain around and beneath the ruins is rocky and sparse, with very little vegetationâ€”small bushes and dry grasses dot the landscape, suggesting a harsh, arid climate.\n\nThe overall lighting suggests late afternoon with shadows beginning to lengthen, casting part of the ruins into shade, while other sections glow warmly under the sun's rays. This, alongside the deep colors of the ancient bricks, highlights a serene yet haunting atmosphere of desolation and historical decay. The absence of any people or modern structures emphasizes the solitude and untouched aspect of the scene, inviting contemplation on the passage of time and the history encapsulated within these walls.","title":"Ancient Indian dwelling, built between 1100 and 1300 A.D., Hovenweep National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545817","544951","544922","544919","544948","543345","551330","543344","545565","544421","546971","544927","544952","551344","544953","544137"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["ruin","brick","wall","ray","remain","enclosure","time","desolation","history","passage"]}
