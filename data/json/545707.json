{"path":"545707.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up of a small flowering plant. The plant features multiple stems, some bearing purple flowers while others have seed pods and small leaves. Each flower is composed of several small, delicate petals with a subtle gradient of purple shades, appearing to stem from a narrow, vertical spike.\n\nThe leaves of the plant are small, green, and compound with multiple leaflets arranged oppositely along each leaf's axis. Some of the leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs or fuzz, adding texture to the image.\n\nThe background is uniformly dark, providing a stark contrast that highlights the subjects at the forefront. This effect accentuates the colors and details of the plant, making the purple of the flowers and the green of the leaves particularly vivid. The lighting appears to focus on the plant, enhancing the visibility of its colors and textures.\n\nThe soil beneath the plant is visible at the bottom of the image, adding an earthy brown texture and reinforcing the naturalistic theme. It seems dry and loosely packed, containing small clumps and particles. The overall composition emphasizes the beauty and intricacy of the natural subject in a simple yet striking manner.","title":"Locoweed","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["547613","550462","555024","555036","553366","553361","544875","558079","554587","558075","553368","555035","555034","554595","551368","555106"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["stem","plant","flower","leave","compound","subject","seed","intricacy","texture","particle"]}
