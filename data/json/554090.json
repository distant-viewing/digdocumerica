{"path":"554090.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view showcasing a diverse and striking landscape. To the left side of the image is a large body of water, merging seamlessly with a distant horizon under a light blue sky scattered with some wispy clouds. The coastal area features a prominent land mass, characterized by a dormant or extinct volcano whose slopes gently descend towards the sea. The slopes of the volcano are barren or sparsely vegetated, displaying shades of brown and dark volcanic rock.\n\nDirectly adjacent to the base of the volcano, the coastline is dotted with what appears to be a small settlement. This area includes a series of roads or tracks, small isolated buildings, and patches of cultivated land or greenery, indicating human habitation and activity.\n\nMoving towards the right side of the image, the landscape transitions into a large expanse of flat terrain that is much darker in color, suggesting lava fields or volcanic soil. This area is noticeably less developed, with fewer signs of human activity, and is bordered by a dense forest or brush land further inland.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph provides a stunning contrast between the volcanic formations and the adjacent inhabited areas, emphasizing the natural beauty and geographical diversity of the region. This setting communicates a sense of isolation and the ruggedness associated with volcanic landscapes, while also reflecting human adaptation and settlement in such unique environments.","title":"Maalaea Bay area north of Kihei is a combination of agricultural, conservation, and urban sections.
