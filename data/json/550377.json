The horizon is low, underlining the expanse of the landscape, with a faint hint of a watery or reflective surface in the distance, contributing a sense of depth. The colors are subdued, with hints of greys and greens, enhancing the feeling of dusk or an overcast day.\n\nOverall, the scene communicates a natural and undisturbed wildlife habitat, emphasizing the grace and beauty of these animals in their natural setting.","title":"Caribou trot across the tundra, near Prudhoe Bay where the pipeline will start.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550384","550385","550379","550380","550381","543022","542961","544914","549219","550485","550386","544571","542959","546091","550494","542955"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["animal","maturity","antler","grace","stride","communicate","underline","habitat","wildlife","twilight"]}
