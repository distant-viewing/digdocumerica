{"path":"550447.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image captures two mountain goats engaged in foraging by a rocky and stony stream bed. Each animal is depicted with a thick, white coat and prominent, curved horns, typical features that suggest their adaptation to rugged terrain and cold environments. The goats are focused on the ground, likely searching for salts and minerals or small vegetation.\n\nThe setting is a wild, alpine landscape, defined by an array of gray and white rocks varying in size from small pebbles to large boulders. This stony arrangement suggests a river or stream bed. The water in the stream appears dark and reflects the overcast sky, adding a muted blue tone to the scene. The immediate background continues with similar rocky textures, indicating a mountainous or high-altitude location devoid of vegetation.\n\nOverall, the composition gives a sense of the harsh and sparse habitat where these mountain goats live. The animals are centered in the frame, drawing the viewerâ€™s attention directly to their interaction with their environment, highlighting their survival behaviors in such austere conditions.","title":"A pair of young rams, 3-5 years old, at the west salt lick of the Atigun Gorge, four miles from the point where the pipeline will cross the Atigun River","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550444","550454","550455","550456","550453","550452","550445","550450","550451","550446","550449","543269","543690","545901","543029","555137"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["goat","bed","stream","animal","horn","survival","behavior","adaptation","salt","pebble"]}
