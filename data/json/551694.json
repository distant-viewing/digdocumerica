{"path":"551694.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene, likely from a flea market or street fair in an urban environment. The setting is a tree-lined street with tall buildings on either side, imparting a sense of a bustling city atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a bustling vendor's table overflowing with various items, possibly antiques or crafts. Several people are interacting around the table. A man and a woman in the left part of the image are closely examining some items on the table. The man wears a red and blue striped t-shirt and brown trousers, while the woman dons a sleeveless, striped dress. Another woman, positioned at the right edge of the table, is dressed in a plaid jacket and is intently looking at an object she is holding.\n\nThe background of the image is lively, featuring more vendor booths lining the street. Several pedestrians are visible, including a man in a red jacket walking away from the viewer and others browsing nearby stalls. The scene is shaded by leafy green trees, adding a pleasant, natural element to the urban setting. This creates a contrast between the natural elements and the urban architecture, enhancing the communal and lively atmosphere of the market. The overall composition conveys a casual, engaging day out in the city, characterized by curiosity and leisurely exploration.","title":"One of many display booths lining East 35th Street between Lexington and Madison Avenues at a June block party.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551695","551749","557131","551690","551696","551691","551686","551752","556215","557135","547370","557132","547378","551750","551689","550068"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["table","vendor","street","market","woman","flea","item","jacket","stall","booth"]}
