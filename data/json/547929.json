{"path":"547929.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting with a dense array of electrical infrastructure. At the forefront, there is a large utility vehicle, possibly a flatbed truck, with materials tied down by straps marked with red \"X\" symbols. This vehicle is parked on a road that appears to be paved with gravel.\n\nBehind the truck, one can observe an extensive setup of electrical substations and equipment. This includes multiple tall structures with various insulators and transformers mounted on platforms supported by metal frameworks. Some of these frameworks are simple and vertical, while others are more complex with horizontal crossbars, providing support for additional equipment above. The insulators are cylindrical, with some capped with rounded or dome-shaped tops.\n\nThe background is more industrial and minimalistic, featuring clear skies with light cloud coverage and several layers of electrical lines and poles extending into the distance. There are no natural landscapes visible; every aspect of the scene is filled with industrial constructs and electrical equipment.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights an environment dedicated to power transmission and distribution, possibly a part of an electrical power plant or a major substation within a grid.","title":"Electric power station, built on marshland on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557298","544296","552524","548136","546695","549110","544061","544300","550168","555574","544613","550183","544277","544355","557431","545841"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["framework","equipment","power","truck","flatbed","strap","transmission","distribution","coverage","dome"]}
