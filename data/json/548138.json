{"path":"548138.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, outdoor scene focused on a man fishing at the edge of a dock. The man is dressed in casual attire, consisting of a dark t-shirt and lighter-colored pants, and he is handling a fishing rod with his gaze directed towards the water. His posture suggests focus and patience, typical of fishing activities.\n\nTo the left of the image, there's a white pickup truck partially visible, adding a rustic or rural touch to the scene. Near the truck, a metal trash can, topped with some items that are not fully clear, perhaps fishing-related gear, and a white dog sitting beside it, looking attentively in the direction of the man fishing.\n\nThe background features a large body of water that reflects a clear blue sky. Across the water, there is a dense tree line, likely a forested mountain area, providing a tranquil and secluded ambience. The composition utilizes natural lighting that enhances the calm and peaceful mood, emphasizing the leisurely activity of fishing in a scenic, natural environment.","title":"At Cascade Locks on the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["550666","550313","548141","551024","554520","554519","551025","553081","549935","550217","542646","550665","555576","550851","551516","553082"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","fish","truck","pickup","ambience","can","dog","rod","utilize","man"]}
