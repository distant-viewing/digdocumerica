{"path":"548397.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"The photograph captures two people, possibly a couple, standing in front of a jewelry store named \"Schneider Jewelers.\" The store's front is richly decorated with many pieces of jewelry, including necklaces, earrings, and bracelets prominently displayed in the storefront's window, accentuated by warm lighting that makes the gold and jewels glisten. The interior appears inviting and decorated with a traditional style.\n\nThe couple is engaged in looking at the items presented in the window. The woman, facing away from the camera, has long hair and is dressed in a dark, formal coat. The man, also facing away from the camera, is wearing a salmon or pinkish shirt and has black hair styled short.\n\nIn the background, visible through the store's glass entrance, another sales interaction is visible, suggesting the store is actively attended. The general ambiance is that of a shopping evening with focused and possibly serious intent to purchase jewelry. The photograph might be capturing a moment of decision-making or admiration of the beautiful pieces on display.","title":"Window shopping on 6th avenue of 47th street in Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557809","543470","557808","553299","548242","549323","556207","542814","552413","552637","551337","557807","550132","551454","543469","547834"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["jewelry","store","decorate","couple","admiration","decision","bracelet","intent","salmon","making"]}
