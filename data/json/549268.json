{"path":"549268.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban industrial scene, possibly taken during the late 20th century. The setting is an open area dominated by infrastructure such as roads and railway lines. At the forefront, a group of four people—three younger males and an older male—are engaged in some sort of ground work, possibly planting, in a patchy, muddy area that is interspersed with young saplings and steel poles.\n\nA large yellow machinery, resembling a generator or compressor, sits to the right of these individuals, contributing to the industrial feel of the image. Nearby, there is a large open yellow truck parked on the curvy road, which adds a dynamic visual element to the photography.\n\nThe environment around these focal points includes broader elements of urban transportation. There's a multi-lane highway raised above the ground level, with visible moving traffic including buses and cars, suggesting a busy area. Below this highway, there are railway lines partly visible, aligned with the setup indicating proximity to a railway station or a similar transport facility.\n\nThe backdrop reveals a wide-open sky, slightly overcast, with faint outlines of buildings in the distance, possibly a city skyline, blurring into a haze, likely indicating air pollution or foggy weather.\n\nThe power lines overhead and the view of the street from an elevated angle—possibly from a nearby building or bridge—gives a comprehensive view of the industrial and urban setting, showcasing a moment of regular activity within a city's less polished sections.","title":"Massport (Massachusetts Port Authority) workers put up a fence around a lot acquired by Massport on the southwestern side of Neptune Road. Houses on the lot had been torn down. Youngsters scattered leftover gravel, and the area became a danger as well as an eyesore. The fence was requested by Matthew Vieira, long-time Neptune Road resident.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["555866","555561","548437","551073","556893","544169","554936","546933","547979","555542","546212","556506","546055","544048","556852","557224"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["railway","male","highway","line","city","sort","photography","bus","road","steel"]}
