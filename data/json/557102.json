{"path":"557102.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a stick insect, also known as a walking stick, positioned on a cluster of white flowers. The insect is slender, elongated, and colored to blend in effectively with its surroundings, displaying an excellent example of camouflage. Its body mimics the appearance of twigs, making it well-adapted for concealing itself among branches and leaves. The insect is facing left, with its head and antennae extending forward and its thin legs gripping the plant.\n\nThe flowers around the insect are white, with visible green buds and parts of the flowers closed or in bloom. The background is out of focus, creating a soft, bokeh effect that accentuates the details of the stick insect and the flowers, emphasizing the colors and textures in the foreground while the background fades into darker, nondescript colors. The composition skillfully draws attention to the interplay between the intricate details of the insect's form and the delicate petals of the flowers, showcasing the natural beauty and complexity of this ecological interaction.","title":"An insect called a walking stick is seen in a closeup on a plant called snow-on-the-mountain near Troy, Kansas, in Doniphan County in the extreme northeast corner of the state. Both plant and insect are common in tallgrass prairie. The plant also grows in disturbed or overgrazed prairie. This part of the state is unique because it contains the only hardwood forest in Kansas in addition to the tallgrass prairie.","placename":"Troy (Kan.)","location":"Troy, Kansas","nn1":["557585","544520","555196","553872","544479","554842","544514","544619","544896","544553","544618","544517","544518","544930","544603","555062"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["insect","flower","stick","antennae","example","camouflage","bud","twig","petal","bloom"]}
