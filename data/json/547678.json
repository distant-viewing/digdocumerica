{"path":"547678.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a compelling moment where a group of five individuals is observing an airplane as it lands or takes off directly above them. The composition provides a silhouette effect due to the backlighting of the scene. The airplane dominates the upper half of the image, coming directly towards the camera, showcasing its underbelly and extended landing gear.\n\nIn the lower half of the frame, the group, consisting of young adults and possibly teenagers, is clustered together in profile view, facing the approaching airplane. They appear transfixed by the sight, with some pointing upwards and others simply watching. The individuals are casually dressed in styles that suggest the photo could be from the 1970s or 1980s, including bell-bottoms and patterned shirts.\n\nIn the foreground, there are two bicycles, suggesting that the group may have ridden them to this vantage point near the runway. The environment around the group is nondescript, focusing all attention on the interaction between the airplane and the spectators. The overall mood is one of awe and excitement as they witness the power and proximity of the airplane. The image is framed to emphasize both the enormity of the airplane and the captivated audience below.","title":"Bicyclist holds ears as jet aircraft roars off from national airport.
