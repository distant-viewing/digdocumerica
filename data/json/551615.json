{"path":"551615.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This image appears to be a microscopic photograph displaying a cluster of cells stained in pink and purple. The cells vary slightly in size and shape but predominantly feature a round to oval shape, with noticeably prominent, darker-stained nuclei that suggest active cellular functions. The overall image shows tightly packed cells with their visible intricate internal structures, perhaps highlighted by a specific staining technique that emphasizes certain cell components like the nuclei. The background of the image is uniformly light pink, providing a contrast that enhances the visibility of the cellular details. This type of image is typically used in biological or medical research to study cellular anatomy and pathology.","title":"Epithelium (gill covering) of a channel catfish damaged by exposure to methyl mercuric chloride in the water.
