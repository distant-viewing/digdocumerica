{"path":"548527.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures two people enjoying a day of sailing. The scene is set on a calm body of water, under what appears to be sunny weather conditions. The boat is a small sailboat with a white hull and a single mast fitted with a white sail. Various ropes and sailing rigging are visible, indicating it is well-equipped for sailing.\n\nOn the boat, there are two individuals. The person at the back is a woman, sitting on the edge of the boat facing outward. She wears a pink bikini with a floral pattern, and her hair is down, flowing past her shoulders. The other individual, seated more toward the middle of the boat, appears to be a man. He is dressed in a red shirt, denim jeans, and a white hat, possibly a bucket hat, which obscures his face as he leans forward, seemingly adjusting something on the boat.\n\nThe composition of this image focuses on capturing the relaxed and leisurely essence of sailing. The water's surface is tranquil, reflecting a sense of peace and enjoyment derived from the activity. The photographâ€™s perspective offers a close-up view of the boating experience, highlighting both the action involved in maneuvering the boat and the serene environment in which it takes place.","title":"Chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549363","544224","549415","547451","549386","543949","551539","547273","548521","548517","548506","551309","552345","548511","551541","547465"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","boat","rigging","bikini","fitte","hat","shoulders","peace","mast","maneuver"]}
