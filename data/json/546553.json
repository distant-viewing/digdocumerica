{"path":"546553.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of a library with a distinctively modern and architectural atmosphere. The library features a geometrically patterned ceiling composed of numerous square indentations, each divided further into smaller squares, creating a grid-like visual texture. From this ceiling, a few circular light fixtures hang down, emitting a soft glow that accentuates the geometric pattern above.\n\nBeneath the unique ceiling, the focus is on rows of bookshelves made from light-colored wood. These shelves are neatly organized and filled with books, visible across the central and lower portions of the photograph. The shelves are arranged in a way that creates aisles, inviting visitors to browse through the collection.\n\nThe library has exposed brick walls that add a rugged, textural contrast to the orderly and sleek design of the bookshelves and ceiling. A large window or possibly a series of windows along the left side of the frame filters natural light into the space, enhancing the visibility and overall ambiance of the interior.\n\nTwo individuals can be observed within the library. One person, in the foreground, is walking between the rows of shelves, seeming to be either searching for a book or simply passing through. Another person is seated at a table on the far left, appearing to be engaged in studying or reading, adjacent to the natural light source.\n\nOverall, the composition and setting of this photograph exude a serene and intellectually engaging environment typical of modern libraries, characterized by its clean lines, orderly arrangement, and quiet activity.","title":"Open stack area.
