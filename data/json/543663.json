{"path":"543663.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of two ducks swimming in a body of calm water. One duck is closer to the foreground and is distinguished by having a darker head, likely a male, while the other, slightly further away and appearing lighter in color, likely a female, swims in a profile view towards the left side of the frame.\n\nThe waterâ€™s surface is mirror-like, reflecting the silhouettes and subtle details of the ducks. Scattered around the ducks are remnants of aquatic plants, including some broken stems and shoots protruding from the water. These details add a sense of natural environment and habitat typical for waterfowl.\n\nThe background of the photograph is relatively uniform and blurred, mostly a continuation of the water, enhancing the focus on the two ducks and their reflection. The lighting is soft, possibly indicating an overcast day, which contributes to the subdued color palette and the overall tranquil atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Mallard ducks","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["552221","551501","555551","548542","552993","558092","551377","543918","553408","548840","546081","558091","553346","547744","546086","557122"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["duck","swim","distinguished","female","continuation","shoot","protrud","stem","water","remnant"]}
