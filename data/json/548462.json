{"path":"548462.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene centered around an entryway to a building titled \"George Robert White Fund Health Unit\". The building, dated A.D. 1939, exhibits classic architectural design elements such as a pedimented entry framed by pilasters and finished in brickwork.\n\nIn the foreground, a young girl wearing a bright yellow shorts set and white shoes runs energetically towards the building. Her movement conveys a sense of haste and purpose, highlighted by her arms swinging by her sides.\n\nAt the doorway, two adults are entering the building. The adult closest to the viewer has a predominantly white and highly colorful floral shirt, paired with white trousers and dark shoes, visible from the back view. Another figure, partially obscured and located further in the background, is wearing darker tones and also entering the building.\n\nThe surroundings of the building entrance are adorned with modest urban details such as the small no-parking sign in a bright yellow post holder at the curb and the concrete sidewalk which runs parallel to the street, characterized by its tarmac finish showing a few patches and worn areas.\n\nThis scene captures an everyday moment likely centered around some daily activities or errands associated with the health unit, possibly underlining the community-oriented nature of the place.","title":"Entrance to Paris Street clinic","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["546443","546489","551142","546493","547006","558151","558402","556046","552746","546452","550648","557702","546931","558395","546537","557837"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["finish","enter","shoe","building","holder","adult","swinge","tarmac","entryway","brickwork"]}
