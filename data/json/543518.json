{"path":"543518.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a lively beach scene along the shore of a picturesque lake. The setting features a striking backdrop of distant mountains, whose white snow-capped peaks contrast vividly with the deep blue of the sky and the placid lake.\n\nIn the foreground, a portion of a sandy beach is visible, occupied by a group of people engaged in various recreational activities. Two individuals (one man and one woman) are seated on colorful beach towels; they seem absorbed in a conversation, oriented towards each other. Beside them, another woman appears to be adjusting her position while sitting, facing towards the lake.\n\nSlightly away from this group, a woman in a white top and black pants stands near the water's edge, seemingly looking out over the lake. Another figure, a young man or teenager, actively skips stones into the lake, captured in mid-motion with a dynamic, playful posture.\n\nThe beach transitions into a grassy area where sparse green grass is visible. The tranquility of the scene is complemented by the gentle lapping of lake waters against the shore and the serene expanse of water that extends to the wooden dock carrying a small boathouse at the end, further accentuating the recreational tone of the setting.\n\nVisible details such as a floating buoy on the lake add a sense of depth to the scene, with the photograph capturing a moment of peaceful leisure beside a scenic natural landscape.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552978","554476","543536","558233","553447","557772","543998","550827","551543","543532","544006","554499","545162","549368","553440","544377"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["lake","beach","boathouse","woman","shore","teenager","buoy","towel","absorb","group"]}
