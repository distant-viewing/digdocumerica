{"path":"544247.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image captures a peaceful and scenic maritime setting during sunset. The photograph presents a large ship, silhouetted against the backdrop of the setting sun and a colorful sky. Predominantly deep pink to purple hues dominate the sky, with streaks of clouds slightly obscuring the sun. The sun itself appears as a vibrant, nearly perfectly circular disc positioned just above the horizon.\n\nIn the foreground, the calm sea reflects some of the sun's light, creating a shimmer on the water's surface. The ship, likely a commercial or industrial vessel, features a robust build with a visible stern and possibly some machinery or structures on deck, enhancing its silhouette. The vessel has multiple visible lights, suggesting it is active or in operation during this time.\n\nThere are no visible human figures within the frame, focusing the viewer's attention on the interplay of nature with human-made technology in maritime activity. The composition effectively conveys a serene end-of-day scenario, typical of nautical environments.","title":"Dredging Lake Pontchartrain: A clean-up operation","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["544251","544655","545170","547110","543411","544659","550304","548117","553990","543956","544238","552344","545030","543143","551215","544707"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sun","ship","vessel","shimmer","stern","build","streak","maritime","pink","scenario"]}
