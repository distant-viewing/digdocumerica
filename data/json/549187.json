{"path":"549187.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a natural landscape, capturing a serene environment under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, a narrow, meandering stream reflects the sky and is surrounded by lush green grass, enhancing the tranquility of the setting. The stream gently flows through a landscape dominated by gentle rolling hills. On the left side of the stream, the hill slopes upward and is dotted with several small trees or shrubs, contributing to the natural ruggedness of the terrain.\n\nNo people or animals are visible, suggesting a quiet, isolated scene. The lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, evidenced by the softness of the light and long shadows cast across the grass. Overall, the composition uses natural elements and the curvature of the stream to lead the viewerâ€™s eye through the image, from the grassy foreground into the hilly background, creating a sense of depth and openness. Additionally, the vivid colors and clear visibility enhance the image's calm and picturesque quality, typical of an undisturbed natural landscape.","title":"This area of Sarpy Basin is threatened by plans for massive strip-mining and the construction of many huge power plants.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549218","542653","552914","550486","554406","550433","557599","550656","550839","551348","557111","555211","554527","557106","557095","543793"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["stream","curvature","softness","ruggedness","openness","hill","grass","visibility","animal","shrub"]}
