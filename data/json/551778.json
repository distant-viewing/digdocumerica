{"path":"551778.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a charming street scene, likely in an urban setting. The image features a row of elegant buildings with architectural details reminiscent of early to mid-20th-century design. The facade of the building on the left is adorned with flower boxes filled with blooming red flowers and cascading greenery, adding a touch of color and vitality to the scene. Each window on this building is accompanied by a classic lantern-style light fixture.\n\nThe street itself is composed of well-maintained concrete sidewalks and a metal railing lining the edge, possibly indicating either a slight elevation or a terrace. On the right, there's a set of stairs leading up to another building, which features a similarly styled facade and arched doorway.\n\nIn the photograph, a young man wearing a white shirt and dark pants is seen pushing a shopping cart. He appears to be a worker, possibly delivering goods, and is walking away from the camera. His presence adds a human element and a sense of daily life and activity to the otherwise serene architectural view. In the background, mature trees and other urban elements suggest this location is well-integrated into its city environment. The distant signage and street features further convey the urban commercial nature of this neighborhood.","title":"Red geraniums brighten the windows of this house on east 61st street between park and Lexington avenues.
