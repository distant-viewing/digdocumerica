{"path":"548986.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an off-road dune buggy speeding across what appears to be a desert-like sandy terrain. The buggy is painted in a striking gold color, and designed with an open frame, showing clear structural elements like bars and beams, which provide a minimalistic yet functional appearance typical of such vehicles.\n\nIn the buggy, there are two passengers. Both passengers wear casual, summer attire suitable for a warm, dusty environmentâ€”caps, sunglasses, and light-colored clothing that suggests a relaxed and recreational setting. They appear to be engaged in the act of driving and navigating the vehicle, with the driver handling the steering and the other passenger looking ahead, presumably scouting the path or simply enjoying the ride.\n\nA prominent feature on the buggy is a tall flagpole mounted at the rear, fitted with a red flag that flies in the air, serving both as a decorative element and likely a practical measure for visibility in the vast, open landscape.\n\nThe background of the image is quite uniform and featureless, presenting a wide expanse of flat sandy surface that merges with a lighter, possibly hazy sky at the horizon, which emphasizes the isolation and breadth of the environment in which the buggy is operating. There's a sense of motion in the image, accentuated by the angle of the vehicle and the posture of its occupants as they race across the frame. The overall composition conveys a sense of adventurous spirit and the thrill of desert dune buggy riding.","title":"Dune buggy on sand dunes east of Brawley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["553056","544038","543207","545098","543370","543211","543208","545102","545094","551316","551969","545596","550935","545071","553058","547758"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["passenger","dune","desert","riding","thrill","breadth","flagpole","vehicle","spirit","measure"]}
