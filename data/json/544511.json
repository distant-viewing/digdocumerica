{"path":"544511.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of an industrial oil drilling site in a forested area. The key features visible in the image include:\n\n- A large oil drilling rig stands prominently in the center of the image, towering above all other structures around it with its metallic framework.\n- Surrounding the rig is a cleared, flattened area which appears to be primarily gravel-based. Several vehicles and equipment including trucks, possibly storage tanks, and small construction machinery are stationed around the base of the rig.\n- To the right of the drilling rig, there is a rectangular water containment area or pond lined with what looks like a pale material. This pit is filled with water and contrasts against the dense forest backdrop.\n- The majority of the surrounding environment is thick, uninterrupted forest, stretching to the horizon in every direction. The trees appear mainly uniform in height, suggesting a relatively flat terrain.\n- There are dirt paths that lead to the drilling site, indicative of vehicular access used for transportation of equipment and personnel.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo highlights the contrast between the industrial activity and the natural environment surrounding it. The imagery might be used to discuss topics like resource extraction, environmental impact, or the scale of human industrial activities in natural landscapes.","title":"New oil rig, north of Gum Slough, in Big Cypress Swamp","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544512","555634","550563","544272","545834","555862","553453","542513","546064","545838","552686","545827","547225","544438","542515","556913"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["rig","oil","topic","containment","personnel","imagery","site","pit","forest","majority"]}
