{"path":"547832.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image captures an eclectic outdoor setting filled with a variety of statues and objects, likely at a flea market or garden center. The foreground prominently features several life-sized animal statues including two deer, one standing and one lying down, and a white sheep. These statues have a realistic appearance with detail in coloring and textures.\n\nAlso in the scene is a statue of a monk or religious figure standing on a pedestal. This figure is dressed in a brown robe, conveying a serene or sacred appearance, in contrast to the playful or natural theme of the animal statues. Additionally, there is a cartoonish figure of a large-eyed, smiling creature, adding a whimsical element to the assortment.\n\nThe environment is set on a surface covered with mulch, suggesting an outdoor or garden setting. Various other objects such as bird baths, column pedestals, and a wooden cabinet add to the flea-market ambiance, where items are randomly placed yet create an interesting visual assortment.\n\nIn the background, parts of other items and possibly other stalls can be seen, indicating the setting might be a commercial or communal sale area. The visibility of a sign that says \"KEVIN\" and part of another sign can be seen which might suggest names of the stalls or sections. The overall composition is colorful, busy, and varied, reflecting a typical bustling outdoor market scene.","title":"Garden accessories for sale on hylan boulevard in Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557137","557133","549676","545221","550068","553769","557756","552736","551696","555585","551752","558259","551830","557131","554286","551695"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["statue","market","flea","pedestal","stall","assortment","garden","figure","animal","robe"]}
