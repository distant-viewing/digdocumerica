{"path":"544572.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a large, expansive area with various elements that appear to be part of an industrial or treatment facility mixed with a recreational or golf course area. The main features of the image include a combination of several large open ponds or basins, which are likely used for water treatment or storage, as they are commonly seen in such facilities. These ponds are irregular in shape and primarily filled with water.\n\nSurrounding the water basins, there are wide exposed land areas that look sandy or salt-covered, suggesting some kind of mineral extraction or chemical residue, often associated with industrial processing sites. There are also several pathways and roads snaking through the area, connecting different sections of the facility and the recreational spaces.\n\nIn the foreground, there appears to be a golf course integrated into the complex. This section includes neatly trimmed grassy areas with distinct sand traps and small bodies of water, typical characteristics of golf course layouts. The presence of green fairways and putting greens contrasts with the more industrial backdrop.\n\nAlso visible in the image are clusters of buildings, possibly administrative or processing facilities related to the site's operation. These buildings are relatively low-rise and grouped towards the center-left part of the frame.\n\nTowards the right side of the image, there is a developed suburban area with residential housing closely packed together in an organized grid pattern. This residential area sharply contrasts with the sprawling industrial and recreational landscape, highlighting the diverse land use in the vicinity.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph combines elements of industrial, recreational, and residential land use, portraying a complex interplay between different human activities and their spatial organization.","title":"Kendal Lakes housing development","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547670","555752","551611","544569","553969","553450","551174","552009","553837","555859","551612","548640","552991","544059","544471","550549"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["golf","course","basin","facility","treatment","pond","land","processing","trap","residue"]}
