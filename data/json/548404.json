{"path":"548404.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape composed primarily of several tall smokestacks, viewed from a blurry, moving foreground. The foreground likely represents the blurred motion of a vehicle or a speeding object, which creates a sense of movement through its smooth and elongated effect. The background is dominated by the industrial structures, specifically four prominent, cylindrical smokestacks that are distinct against the sky. These smokestacks do not emit visible smoke in the image.\n\nThe color palette is subdued, with muted blues and grays dominating the scene, contributing to an industrial or somewhat desolate atmosphere. The time of day appears to be either dawn or dusk, as suggested by the soft lighting and the gentle sky gradient. Additionally, there are faint lines and smaller structures visible in the background, which might include wires and other industrial apparatus, enhancing the overall industrial theme of the photograph.\n\nThe focus and composition of the image evoke a feel of passing by this industrial site, capturing a fleeting moment of interaction between the observer and the industrial environment.","title":"Smoke stacks of Consolidated Edison plant in Brooklyn seen through car windshield","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545239","550333","555737","557231","550168","542999","547090","544173","551140","545446","552190","550181","557225","551026","550676","557220"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","observer","apparatus","gradient","wire","dawn","gray","dusk","motion","palette"]}
