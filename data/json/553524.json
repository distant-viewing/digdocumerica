{"path":"553524.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph shows a young girl seated on an upholstered chair eating from a small plate. The girl appears deeply engrossed in eating, carefully inspecting her food. She has dark, shoulder-length hair and is wearing a blue-striped dress with white collar details. Her legs are covered by a colorful blanket with a red, black, and white geometric pattern, which adds a cozy element to the setting.\n\nThe chair has a dark floral pattern that blends into the dusky ambiance of the room, suggesting the photo was taken indoors under dim lighting. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of domestic casualness, capturing an ordinary moment of a child eating. The tones are rich and somewhat muted, characteristic of film photography, lending a nostalgic feel to the scene.","title":"Diane watkins, one of nine children of a mulky square family eats on the living room couch.
