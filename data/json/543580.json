{"path":"543580.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene, predominantly featuring architectural and natural elements. The focal point is a large, red, wooden building, possibly a visitor center or park office, noted as the \"State Game Refuge Public Office.\" The architecture of the building is rustic with a prominent gable roof and extended eaves which help emphasize a cozy, alpine aesthetic. The structure is nestled in a well-manicured landscape with lush green grass.\n\nIn the foreground, the calm water of a small pond mirrors the surroundings beautifully, offering a clear reflection of the red building and its surroundings. The pond is edged with round, large stones and boulders, which add a rugged natural element to the otherwise tidy and maintained setting.\n\nBeyond the building, the background reveals a gentle rise of wooded hills that contribute to the sense of peace and seclusion in the environment. These hills are densely forested and suggest that the building is set within a mountainous or hilly region.\n\nAdditionally, on the left side of the image, there's a round-shaped building with a domed roof, which contrasts architecturally with the main red building but complements the scene. To the right of the main building, there appears to be another smaller structure or continuation of the main building that shares the same design and color.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a tranquil, natural setting, designed to blend in with the environment, likely geared towards welcoming visitors in a wildlife or natural reserve. The lighting, which seems to be either during early morning or late afternoon, casts gentle shadows and enriches the colors of the scene, highlighting the natural beauty and architectural charm of the location.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["546463","543587","542593","545137","546530","558109","546480","552987","543543","544503","551263","558056","544561","546464","551265","546460"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["building","pond","visitor","eave","reserve","continuation","surrounding","peace","seclusion","boulder"]}
