{"path":"545181.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In this photograph, a man is actively engaged in unloading what appears to be oysters or clams from a large, suspended metallic container. The setting seems to be an outdoor, possibly maritime, environment given the presence of the large pile of shellfish and the visible body of water in the background.\n\nThe metallic container is hanging from a crane or similar equipment, evident from the chain and cable assembly visible in the frame, which facilitates the lifting and moving of heavy loads. The container itself has sides perforated with holes, likely designed to allow water and debris to escape, preserving only the shellfish inside.\n\nThe man is dressed in practical outdoor workwear, including a dark hat, jacket, and pants that suggest a cold or wet working environment. He is in motion, using both hands to guide the container as its contents spill onto an already substantial pile in front of him.\n\nThe overall quality of light and the hazy background suggest a cloudy or misty day, typical of coastal areas. The photograph captures a moment of physical labor and interaction between man and machine in a rugged natural setting, highlighting an aspect of the shellfish harvesting process.","title":"Harvesting oysters by dredging","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545189","552865","546297","545190","552863","546305","546301","545193","552881","552875","544264","552877","545211","552879","545202","552307"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["shellfish","container","workwear","lifting","oyster","pile","harvesting","spill","escape","hole"]}
