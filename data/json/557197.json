{"path":"557197.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features close-up details of what appears to be a frozen plant. The most prominent element is a cluster of dark, disk-like shapes that could either be seeds or dried-out flowers, set against a translucent and jagged icy encasement that adheres to the stems and other parts of the plant. The overall tone of the image is quite moody, augmented by the blurred and soft-focus background which provides a smooth gradient from light to darker shades. The low depth of field centers the focus tightly on the icy foreground, while the background remains indistinct, emphasizing solitude and the chilly essence of a frosty day. The use of lighting and the choice of color tones create a serene, almost melancholic atmosphere. The composition crafts a balance between fragility (seen in the ice and delicate plant structures) and resilience, as the plant parts are encapsulated in ice yet still standing.","title":"Closeup of daisy fleabane, a tallgrass prairie invader covered with ice and snow on the Konza Prairie, 1,000 acres of virgin tallgrass prairie near Manhattan, Kansas. The land was given to Kansas State University through a gift to The Nature Conservancy and is used primarily for research. Invader grasses of this type shown are controlled by periodic burning of the land because no large grazing animals are allowed on it.","placename":"Manhattan (Kan.)","location":"Manhattan, Kansas","nn1":["557198","543167","557199","557200","557607","557617","543560","543562","555052","555185","543623","557169","543098","543607","554745","557180"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["ice","plant","augment","seed","choice","stem","craft","dry","resilience","gradient"]}
