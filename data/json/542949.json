{"path":"542949.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a large-scale deforestation scene, illustrating a significant environmental impact in a forest. The aerial perspective provides a sweeping view of the area, showing a multitude of fallen trees scattered across the muddy and disrupted ground. The terrain appears heavily excavated, with numerous dirt trails and paths crisscrossing throughout the area, suggesting the movement of heavy machinery.\n\nA winding dirt road runs through the scene, bordered by standing tall trees which contrast sharply with the devastation around them. This road contains patches of red clay and is flanked by occasional patches of green grass, providing some color contrast to the otherwise predominantly brown and earth-toned scenery.\n\nThere are several pieces of heavy equipment visible, likely used for logging and transporting the trees. These machines are interspersed among the fallen tree trunks and stumps. Somewhat centrally in the image, there appears to be a cluster of vehicles and machinery, indicating a temporary worksite or staging area for the logging operation.\n\nThe impact of the logging operation is visually striking, showing a landscape that has been drastically altered. The image invokes themes of environmental degradation and the extensive footprint that human industrial activities can have on natural forests.","title":"Lumber roads and clear-cutting encroach on pine forest","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542948","542827","550354","542828","545272","555221","542947","542850","542851","542852","545138","542833","545143","553468","542823","542839"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["logging","fallen","clay","otherwise","deforestation","dirt","machinery","alte","strik","bordere"]}
