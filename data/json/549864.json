{"path":"549864.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph shows the façade of a large multi-story building, filled extensively with rows of windows. It appears to be an old, industrial-style building with a slightly weathered exterior. The structure features a grid of numerous equal-sized windows, each framed by white mullions and most of them closed. A few of the windows are open, and some show curtains, giving a minute glimpse into the utilitarian interior use of the spaces behind them.\n\nThe building's surface has noticeable wear and discoloration, suggesting age and exposure to elements. There are stains and streaks running down from the windows, marking the white exterior with gray and black lines. The repetition of the windows creates a rhythmic geometric pattern across the image, which is taken from a straight-on perspective, likely from an opposite or nearby building.\n\nThere is no visible activity or any people discernible through the windows, and the exterior does not provide much indication of the building’s current use, leaving a sense of anonymity and uniformity. The daylight and clarity of the image suggest it might be taken during the day under overcast or soft lighting conditions. Overall, the photograph has a stark, somewhat minimalist aesthetic, emphasizing architectural forms and urban decay.","title":"Midtown apartment building","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550123","553220","557643","551586","557139","547894","553478","555952","546506","549880","546491","546542","553255","555902","545881","553479"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["window","exterior","minute","anonymity","repetition","building","discoloration","uniformity","indication","streak"]}
