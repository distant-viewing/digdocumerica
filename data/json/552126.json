{"path":"552126.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph features a body of water in the foreground with gentle ripples making patterns on the surface. Prominently, there is a single crumpled soda can floating in the water, indicating human presence and possible pollution. This object stands out against the dark blue hue of the water.\n\nIn the background, there is a large industrial or commercial building that spans the width of the photo. This building is two-storied, predominantly white with a flat roof, and has several windows and possible loading bays. The architecture is relatively plain and functional.\n\nThe sky is clear with just a few wispy clouds, suggesting a fair weather condition. The overall lighting of the scene indicates it could be either morning or afternoon. The combination of the industrial backdrop and the discarded can gives the photo a slight environmental commentary, possibly highlighting issues of industrial pollution or encroachment into natural water bodies.","title":"Beer can floating on Duwamish River","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["546944","551559","550806","550812","544527","551562","551576","552194","551519","552189","552070","543302","546116","544779","544803","546887"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["pollution","soda","encroachment","commentary","width","loading","water","bay","combination","issue"]}
