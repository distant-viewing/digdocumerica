{"path":"545220.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In this photograph, a solitary black bear is captured while it walks along a curved dirt road within a lush, predominantly green forest. The scene gives an impression of quiet isolation, emphasized by the dense tree line which engulfs much of the frame. The bear is positioned towards the center of the road toward the right side of the image, providing a focal point against the natural backdrop.\n\nThe flora includes a variety of trees, some with thin trunks and others more robust, all bearing dense, leafy canopies that appear typical of a temperate rainforest environment. The textures of the trees and undergrowth suggest a healthy, vibrant forest ecosystem.\n\nThe road curves gently from the foreground on the left, continuing around to the right, where the bear is seen making its way. The roadâ€™s surface looks compact and damp, potentially indicating recent rain. Ambient light diffuses softly through the scene, with no direct sunlight visible, giving the image a somewhat muted, serene tone.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph, with its winding road and casual presence of wildlife, invokes a strong sense of peaceful coexistence with nature, as well as the remoteness and unspoiled quality of the setting.","title":"Bear crosses road flanking Willapa Bay","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542605","544860","553464","556976","554720","550567","545262","542733","555127","547659","557018","555215","555116","550695","542950","552549"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["bear","road","rainforest","engulf","remoteness","undergrowth","invoke","forest","coexistence","flora"]}
