{"path":"543371.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene from a hiking or camping expedition in a mountainous area. The image features three individuals engaged in outdoor activities, set against a background of pine trees and patches of snow.\n\nOn the left side of the image, two people are standing while wearing large backpacks loaded with camping gear. The backpacks are of vibrant colors, one primarily orange and the other green, and they are equipped with various items attached on the outside, such as sleeping bags and water bottles. Both individuals are facing away from the camera, suggesting they are looking at something out of frame or discussing their route.\n\nOn the right side, another individual is lying on the ground, next to a rock and what appears to be a full set of camping gear, including a rolled-up sleeping pad and a backpack. This person is wearing a baseball cap and seems to be either resting or examining a map or a similar object, focused intently on the item in his hands.\n\nThe setting is a grassy area with scattered snow patches, hinting at high altitude or early season conditions. The dense pine forest in the background and the snow give the image a remote, wild feel, emphasizing the outdoor adventure theme. No buildings or other signs of civilization are visible, enhancing the sense of being in the wilderness.","title":"Packing expedition of Explorer Post 397 of Los Angeles area.
