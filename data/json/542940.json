{"path":"542940.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of an industrial logging facility bordered by several bodies of water. The overall scene is captured with thick woods surrounding the industrial site, suggesting a remote or rural setting. On the left side of the image, several buildings and open areas are visible where logs appear to be processed and stored. There are smoke plumes arising from a few spots in the industrial zone, indicating active operations and possible burning or manufacturing processes.\n\nTo the right side of the image, the facility is bordered by water with logs floating, creating organized rows within these water bodies. These logs are possibly being prepped for transport or processing. The water bodies appear calm, reflecting some elements of the overhanging sky and clouds.\n\nThe landscape beyond the logging area includes more thick forest patches and open grassy areas, highlighting a mix of dense tree cover and cleared land. There are roads or dirt tracks running around the periphery of the site, into the wooded areas, showing how the facility might be accessed. There is no visible presence of people in the image, which focuses more on the environmental and industrial components. The scene also extends further into hilly terrains in the background, under a partly clouded sky adding both depth and breadth to the view.","title":"Lumbermill","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542944","542921","542942","542941","552163","552140","550330","545011","542945","552162","552199","555165","552198","542943","542515","542933"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","logging","facility","breadth","periphery","site","body","water","manufacturing","cover"]}
