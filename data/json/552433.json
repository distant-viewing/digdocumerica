{"path":"552433.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up view of a barren landscape, dominated by a dry, textured black surface, possibly volcanic ash or barren soil. Prominently featured in the foreground is a dead branch or small shrub. It has a pale color and appears brittle, with multiple thin twigs branching off from the main stem. The branch is lying against the stark black ground, which is rough and uneven, suggesting a desolate, uninhabited environment. The lighting in the image appears natural, likely outdoor lighting that casts some shadows from the branch on the ground, enhancing the texture of the surface. The photograph has a somber, isolated tone, emphasizing themes of desolation and the absence of life. There is no visible sky or horizon line, focusing all attention on the branch and the ground.","title":"The Chicago Sanitary Liner ships much of its waste (sludge) by barge down the Illinois River to the small town of Liverpool. From there it is piped 12 miles inland to a large tract of land: called the Weir Farm. The sludge is then pumped into huge holding basins and later used to spray experimental corn fields. Holding basin with devices for circulating sludge.","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["543722","543718","545747","552551","546157","546121","545879","552058","546124","544019","544886","555885","555886","544751","546065","552059"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["branch","ash","twig","stem","ground","desolation","absence","surface","shrub","soil"]}
