{"path":"544306.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, outdoor scene by a body of water at twilight or early evening. Two young men are featured, each engaging in an activity along a rugged, wooden pier or jetty that extends into calm waters. The pier is constructed from wooden planks and beams.\n\nThe young man on the right, wearing a blue shirt and trousers, is seated on a wooden stump or block, focused on repairing or handling a fishing rod or some similar object. His attention is directed downwards towards his hands as he works.\n\nThe other young man, dressed in a white t-shirt and lighter-colored trousers, is squatting near the pier's edge, and appears to be handling something near the water, possibly tying a boat, working with fishing equipment, or engaging with the water directly.\n\nThe background reveals a tranquil water surface that mirrors the colors of the sky, suggesting sunset hues of blues and purples. On the left side of the image, there is a shoreline populated with various rocks, disarrayed logs, and sparse vegetation. A tree with a lean toward the water can also be observed, contributing to the natural, slightly untamed character of the setting.\n\nThe overall composition, with its mix of man-made structures and natural elements, together with the calm water and dimming light, creates a peaceful yet slightly melancholic atmosphere, capturing a moment of quiet activity and reflection amidst a rustic waterfront setting.","title":"Children of shrimp fishermen","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["543465","545911","552123","549933","552291","545928","552311","549935","547555","552124","546998","552116","543885","546077","545149","552225"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["pier","water","trouser","fishing","man","jetty","stump","rod","block","plank"]}
