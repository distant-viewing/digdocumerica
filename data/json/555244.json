{"path":"555244.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a warehouse, where a man is engaged in the task of inspecting or packing chemical products. The man, who is wearing a light yellow hard hat and a pale short-sleeved shirt, is focused on a large plastic bottle with a label, which he is holding in his hands while extracting it from a cardboard box. He appears to be either checking the product or preparing it for shipment.\n\nThe background is densely packed with stacks of cardboard boxes, which are neatly arranged in rows reaching up to a considerable height. The boxes are labeled with different texts indicating they contain various chemical products, including specifics like \"Colorant. MSMA\" and \"Surfactant\". These storage boxes dominate the background and provide a context of industrial or chemical storage.\n\nThe setting is illuminated by overhead industrial lighting, which casts a practical yet stark light on the scene. His workstation includes an open cardboard box and another plastic container is visible in the foreground, partly out of focus.\n\nOverall, the photograph documents a moment of warehouse operations, focusing on industrial safety and material handling within a chemical product environment.","title":"An Environmental Protection Agency inspector examines a container of pesticide that he just has pulled from a crate during a routine inspection of the Valley Chemical Company, Greenville, Mississippi.","placename":"Mississippi","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555243","555237","555246","555245","555242","555236","548994","551588","543706","555263","555253","555816","546032","546278","555254","546918"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["box","product","chemical","cardboard","warehouse","workstation","specific","storage","label","handling"]}
