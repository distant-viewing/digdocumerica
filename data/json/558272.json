{"path":"558272.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an individual dressed in historical or ceremonial attire standing beside a cannon. The person is wearing a dark jacket with red detailing and gold buttons, a white shirt visible at the collar area, and a black tricorne hat. They are holding a long black pole with a brush or sponge attached to one end, suggesting the role of an artillery crew member preparing or maintaining the cannon. The cannon itself is mounted on a wheeled carriage and pointed off to the right side of the frame.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors, during daytime with clear blue skies. The ground is covered with sparse, dry grass, indicating it might be late in the season. The sunlight casts shadows on the ground, consistent with late afternoon. The background is minimal, focusing primarily on the subject and the artillery piece. There is a hint of another cannon and person in the far left background, which, along with the attire of the individual, suggests a historical reenactment or a ceremonial display.","title":"A member of the New Ulm battery, one of the major historical heritages of New Ulm, Minnesota.
