{"path":"555093.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a dense and varied assortment of plant life characteristic of a lush, moist environment, possibly a tropical or subtropical forest. There is an abundance of detail capturing different types and stages of foliage, making the scene rich in texture and color.\n\nStarting from the foreground, the image features a cluster of delicate, thin green grass or similar small plants, stretching up and filling the lower part. Above and intermingled with these are several ferns with long, slender fronds that exhibit a range of colors from vibrant green to rusty brown, indicative of new growth and aging or dying leaves.\n\nDominating the central portion of the frame is a collection of larger ferns with broader, more robust fronds that have a darker, more saturated green color. Twisted and dried fronds can also be seen, adding a touch of decay and natural cycle to the scene. Among these ferns, there are other plants with broader, flatter leaves, some of which show varying degrees of yellow and red, suggesting either a seasonal change or natural senescence.\n\nPeeking through this dense vegetation, one can notice young plants (possibly saplings) with soft, needle-like leaves arrayed in a symmetrical fashion around their stems, introducing a soft texture contrast against the rougher, mature foliage surrounding them.\n\nOverall, the composition is a vibrant and detailed showcase of a natural, densely vegetated area, illustrating both the lush growth and the natural decay in such environments. The colors range widely across the green spectrum, punctuated by specks of yellow, brown, and red, creating a dynamic and visually rich tableau. No human activity or artificial objects disturb the natural setting, presenting a serene glimpse into a thriving ecosystem.","title":"Sitka spruce trees with ground cover of salal, deer fern bead ruby, equisetum and grasses in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554993","555192","555019","555050","555183","555043","555049","555054","555368","545285","554957","555040","554996","555191","554992","554743"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["frond","fern","plant","leave","growth","showcase","decay","spectrum","cycle","degree"]}
