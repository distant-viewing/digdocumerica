{"path":"553226.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic silhouette created in a low-light setting, possibly during dusk or dawn. At the top of the image, there are three figures positioned on a bridge or walkway, characterized by a railing that spans the width of the frame. The figures are depicted in a variety of dynamic poses: one seems to be stretching arms out wide to either side, another has arms raised jubilantly, and the third is slightly bent forward with arms extended downward.\n\nThe lower part of the image shows a structure with rectangular windows emitting light. The patterns made by these windows, but partially obscured, suggest an interior space lit within an otherwise dark exterior environment. The light coming through these windows appears in elongated white and somewhat uneven shapes, indicating the rooms might be partially visible from the exterior.\n\nThe composition of the photograph divides it primarily into two horizontal sectionsâ€”the top dominated by the silhouetted figures and the dark sky, and the bottom showcasing the lit interior of a building through its windows. This creates a visual contrast between the serene, open space above and the enclosed, active space below. The use of silhouette and light effectively plays with themes of visibility and obscurity, adding depth and a touch of mystery to the scene.","title":"The \"celebrations group\" of Marilyn Woods rehearses dance on the roof of the Fifth Third Bank building overlooking Fountain Square.
