{"path":"554678.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image features an older man outdoors, dressed warmly in a plaid, flannel shirt and a matching plaid hunting cap. The man, who appears to be of middle or older age, has graying hair and a friendly expression. He is smoking a cigarette, evident from the smoke drifting in front of him. The man also carries a shotgun resting on his arm, suggesting he might be engaged in hunting or outdoor activities.\n\nBehind the man, the backdrop includes a natural, woodland setting during what appears to be the early days of fall or late autumn. The trees bear sparse leaves, indicating cooler or transitional weather. The focus on the man and the visible elements of his attire and the shotgun, mixed with his relaxed posture and environment, convey a sense of leisurely outdoor activity, possibly within a rural or undeveloped area.","title":"Hunter on opening day of the big game season in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at moose river plains.
