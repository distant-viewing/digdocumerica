{"path":"543784.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a tender and playful moment between a young child and a horse. The child, dressed in a pink one-piece outfit with light-colored shoes, is bending down to presumably look at something on the ground, while the horse, a reddish-brown color with a dark mane, leans its head down towards the child. The horse is wearing a bridle. The setting appears to be outdoors in a natural environment, possibly a trail or a rural area, as indicated by the presence of dirt and small plants on the ground.\n\nThe focus is on the interaction between the child and the horse, highlighting a sense of curiosity and connection between the young human and the animal. The image is suffused with natural light, enhancing the warmth of the scene. The composition emphasizes the closeness between the figures, suggesting a moment of companionship and mutual interest.","title":"Small girl and horse on a farm","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543678","553064","549108","543043","556562","545894","554689","542972","543783","543788","553116","542619","544358","545890","543780","544362"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["horse","child","bridle","mane","closeness","companionship","warmth","curiosity","trail","shoe"]}
