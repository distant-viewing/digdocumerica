{"path":"544580.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures an environmental scene focusing primarily on a polluted area. It shows a body of standing water, possibly oil or a contaminated puddle, reflecting a deep blue color amidst a muddy and gritty terrain. The edges of the water are irregular and jagged, blending into the surrounding earthy textures. The ground around the water pools is brown and muddy, with patches of brighter, almost silvery mud that suggest moisture or a kind of slick, possibly oily surface. Small rocks and natural debris are scattered sparingly over the mud, which looks sun-baked and cracked in places, indicating that the location might be exposed to significant sunlight. The overall impression is one of environmental degradation or pollution, highlighting a stark contrast between the natural earth colors and the unnatural dark blue of the water. No people or animals are visible in the image, directing the viewerâ€™s undistracted attention to the environmental aspects shown.","title":"Flood damage","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["551560","547614","544175","547665","544804","547617","550812","548090","546920","547493","555867","555784","545014","551561","551559","551077"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["mud","puddle","crack","moisture","kind","degradation","oil","water","pool","direct"]}
