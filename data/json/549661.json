{"path":"549661.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph features an ornate, grand building with classical architectural elements, possibly a theater or opera house, captured in what appears to be an urban setting. The building is embellished with statues, columns, and decorative friezes adding to its opulent facade. The roof of this impressive building is topped with sculptures standing against the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, the image shows a large sign for a parking garage (labeled \"Garage\" and \"Rathauspark Garage\"), indicating a city environment where infrastructure and historical architecture coexist. The sign has a restriction notice saying \"5km\" hinting at some form of speed limit within the parking area.\n\nSurrounding the area are vintage vehicles, likely from the mid-20th century, alongside modern street elements like lamp posts, possibly signaling this photo was taken in the mid-1900s. The setting includes roads bustling with traffic suggesting a busy urban scene.\n\nPart of the environment includes trees and a clear blue sky, contrasting with the dense architectural and vehicular components. This juxtaposition may imply a blend of the natural environment with urban development.","title":"Entrance to the underground parking facilities beneath Vienna's town hall plaza","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["549648","549991","556020","556046","549660","546488","549646","549681","555908","546745","556790","556722","555450","549662","551870","549676"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["parking","theater","embellish","restriction","notice","limit","sculpture","say","statue","coexist"]}
