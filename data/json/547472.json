{"path":"547472.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph shows a scene of coastal pollution and neglect, vividly highlighting environmental issues. In the foreground, amidst assorted debris, a lone, worn-out red armchair stands prominently, suggesting abandonment. The chair is surrounded by a scattered array of garbage that includes bits of wood, scraps of paper, plastic items, and other unidentifiable refuse. This foreground scene of pollution forms a stark contrast against the natural beauty of the ocean and the clear sky in the background.\n\nThe ocean itself is visible in the middle distance, its surface shimmering under the sunlight, and extends to the horizon. The blue of the water, under a partly cloudy yet bright sky, would ordinarily suggest a serene setting but is overshadowed by the presence of litter shown in the foreground. On the far left, the coastline curves away, showing buildings at a distance, which gives a sense of scale and the proximity of human development to this area of environmental degradation.\n\nThe photo's composition uses the juxtaposition of the neglected chair and litter against the natural landscape to possibly convey messages about pollution, neglect, and the impact of human activities on natural environments.","title":"Narragansett bay shore at fields point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["550352","548741","551500","550687","543056","547525","551440","546374","552158","550280","550197","551247","549820","547524","547897","552089"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["pollution","litter","chair","ocean","armchair","neglect","overshadow","assort","refuse","scrap"]}
