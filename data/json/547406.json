{"path":"547406.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image depicts a scene inside a chicken coop. A person, dressed in work clothes which include a grey hooded sweater, jeans, and boots, is actively engaged in agricultural work. The person is bent over, peering into a nesting box that's part of a tiered wooden structure meant for chickens to lay eggs. To the side, there's a basket filled with eggs, indicating that the person is likely collecting eggs from the nesting boxes.\n\nAround the person, several chickens fill the scene, with the majority of them being white and a few having red accents on their heads and necks. These chickens are wandering freely inside the coop, and some are gathered near the windows reflecting sunlight into the relatively dim interior. The look of the coop is rustic, with visible wooden beams and dirt-covered floor suggesting a very functional and utilitarian space commonly seen in rural farm settings. The atmosphere conveys a busy but routine aspect of farm life focused on poultry husbandry.","title":"Farmer john dolezal in hen-house of his farm near bee Nebraska.
