{"path":"546770.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene on a busy street, likely in a coastal tourist town, based on the presence of a harbor with boats in the background. In the foreground, there is a large trash receptacle surrounded by some litter, including a discarded cardboard box and other paper items. The trash can is very full, suggesting a bustling area with many visitors or an ongoing event.\n\nAdjacent to the trash can, there is a parking meter showing a time and parking rate. On the streets, vintage cars are parked along the curb, hinting that the photo might be from the 1970s or 1980s, based on the design and color of the vehicles.\n\nIn the middle ground and background, various groups of people are engaged in different activities. Most of them are walking or interacting with each other. Men and women, clad in typical casual summer attire from the period, such as shorts, T-shirts, and summer dresses, are visible. This clothing suggests warm weather, likely summer.\n\nThe architectural style of the buildings in the background, with their colorful facades and signs, adds charm and character to the scene, indicative of many seaside towns that cater to tourists with shops, food vendors, and services designed to appeal to visitors.\n\nOverall, the image captures the bustling activity of a popular location during peak tourist season, with a focus on the experiences and casual daily life of visitors and locals alike.","title":"Accumulated weekend trash at Annapolis port area","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549329","551324","549872","545154","557705","551913","556224","545216","542586","548388","551135","557655","552411","547026","557684","554615"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["tourist","trash","visitor","summer","parking","town","rate","cater","local","meter"]}
