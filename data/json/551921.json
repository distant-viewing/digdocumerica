{"path":"551921.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a railway loading area, filled with an industrial air and a sense of daily routine. In the image, four men are visible, engrossed in different activities that suggest a busy work environment.\n\nTo the left, thereâ€™s a red freight train on tracks, which sets the industrial tone of the photograph. One man, dressed in a dark uniform with a cap, walks away from the camera, heading towards the train. He carries a blue bag, suggesting he might be handling cargo or performing maintenance duties.\n\nIn the foreground, three men engage in conversation. One of them, who appears to be a railway worker due to his cap and dark uniform, stands slightly elevated on a wooden ramp. He talks to the other two men who are dressed in casual civilian clothes. The second man, standing directly across, wears a tan jacket and dark pants, and appears attentive. The third man listens while looking slightly sideways, dressed in similar but darker tones.\n\nThe wooden ramp where they stand looks worn, indicating heavy use. It bears signs that read \"WATCH OUT FOR SIDE CLEARANCE\" and \"DANGER\", alerting to the operational hazards of the area. A yellow cylindrical bin labeled \"Use Lid On All Containers\" is also visible by the ramp, emphasizing the importance of safety and organization in the workspace.\n\nThe setting itself is rugged and utilitarian, with a gravel floor scattered around the wooden ramp and a mixture of utility and cargo containers partially visible. The overall mood is one of attentive work and conversation, set against the backdrop of a busy railroad scene.","title":"Ferry boat (bound for Wisconsin across lake Michigan) onleading freight cars.
