{"path":"544735.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of an industrial factory with significant emissions. Several tall smokestacks dominate the composition, emitting large plumes of white and gray smoke against a clear sky. The central structures of the factory are complex with various interconnected parts, including cylindrical tanks and a network of pipes and conveyors.\n\nIn the foreground, additional buildings and infrastructure hint at the expansive nature of this industrial operation. These structures are primarily metallic, featuring a utilitarian design typical of heavy industry facilities.\n\nThe backdrop provides a stark contrast to the industrial foreground; a range of mountains is visible, suggesting that the factory is situated in a valley or a similarly enclosed natural space. The mountains appear serene and are bathed in a soft light, which juxtaposes the industrial activity in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively highlights the environmental impact of industrial operations, contrasting technological and natural elements within the same frame.","title":"Prompt action prevented an oil leak from polluting this stream (in foreground).","placename":"Alta (Utah)","location":"Alta, Utah","nn1":["544736","551060","551053","551051","551026","550672","552246","550716","544039","550998","551054","543159","551059","545013","546141","550329"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["factory","operation","mountain","conveyor","emission","plume","pipe","network","smokestack","valley"]}
