{"path":"545148.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a forested landscape intersected by a river. The river winds through dense clusters of dark green trees, creating a serpentine path that is loosely visible across the frame. Notably, the river appears obstructed by large accumulations of logs at several places, forming natural dams that disrupt the flow of water. These logjams are concentrated particularly in the center and lower parts of the image, where they have gathered in substantial mounds, surrounded by water that appears darker due to shadowing or depth.\n\nThe riverbanks are uneven and irregularly shaped, largely covered with thick greenery, leaving only a few areas of exposed earth that have a lighter tan color. These patches add a visual contrast to the otherwise lush, dark environment.\n\nAbove and beyond this natural scene, the sky is overcast, enveloping the area in a soft, diffused light that enhances the somber mood of the densely wooded area. The overall composition of the image, with the river gracefully meandering through the forest and constrained by log barriers, evokes a sense of serene isolation interlaced with the raw, untamed dynamics of nature.","title":"Log jam on the quinault river left by bureau of indian affairs logging operation","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550527","550559","550717","550620","550621","550625","550622","550321","550571","542880","550531","557002","542822","550593","542881","550580"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","log","obstruct","disrupt","dynamic","concentrate","dam","forest","accumulation","meander"]}
