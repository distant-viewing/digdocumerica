{"path":"554230.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between two people and a dog in front of a snow-covered outdoor setting. The man, who is wearing sunglasses and a shirt with a sheriffâ€™s badge on the chest, is engaging in a conversation with a woman who is facing him. The woman is clad in a winter jacket and is petting a large, brown-haired dog that stands between them. Behind the characters, there is a large framed picture hanging on a building, depicting a mountain landscape. The setting suggests a cold, snowy environment as evidenced by snow on the ground and also piles of shoveled snow. The sun appears bright, casting sharp shadows and contributing to the overall vivid yet serene winter atmosphere.","title":"Sheriff of Vail talks with a visitor.","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554229","554126","543261","554537","553089","554271","556171","543506","543040","552676","557181","554532","549928","548029","547106","547413"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["snow","dog","winter","chest","badge","woman","character","sunglass","picture","pile"]}
