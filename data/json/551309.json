{"path":"551309.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures two young adults enjoying a boat ride under a cloud-streaked sky. The left side of the image is dominated by one individual wearing a grey tank top, who is visibly relaxed, looking off to the side with a slight smile, hair tousled by the wind. Situated beside them, another person in a striped tank top is focused on navigating the boat, seated with hands either on the steering wheel or close to it. Both are seated in a red-seated boat, their casual attire and windswept hair contributing to the overall feel of a leisurely day on the water. The background features an expansive sky with large clouds that suggest the potential for variable weather. The composition of the photo, with its candid and natural expressions along with the soft focus, enhances the sense of a spontaneous moment captured amidst a scenic, open-water environment.","title":"Two youths from GRandview, Missouri, cruise in an inboard runabout.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["548527","546356","553800","553411","544270","548553","546352","551308","550835","546348","546976","554196","548554","552123","551255","546317"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","seat","potential","tousle","tank","steering","hair","streak","cloud","top"]}
