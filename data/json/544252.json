{"path":"544252.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a rural agricultural setting, depicting two people engaged in the task of drying or processing a large amount of what appears to be shrimp, spread out on a surface under the open sky. The person on the left, a man, is using a large rake to possibly turn over or spread out the shrimp. He is dressed casually in long, light-colored pants, a short-sleeved shirt, and a bucket hat. The person on the right, appearing to be a woman, is also involved in similar activity, using a shovel-like tool. She wears darker, loose-fitting trousers, a light-colored blouse, and her hair is tied back.\n\nThe environment around them features a large, predominantly white building with elements of industrial or farm-type construction, including an open doorway and noticeable framework supports. A smaller roofed structure adjoining the main building is partially visible. Utilities such as wooden poles and power lines are evident in the background, which also shows a clear, lightly clouded sky.\n\nThe foreground is almost entirely covered with shrimp, implying that the image is taken during a significant harvesting or processing period. This setting suggests a shrimp farm or a similar operation dedicated to seafood processing. The overall scene conveys a sense of manual labor in an agricultural or aquacultural industry, set in a spacious, open-air environment.","title":"Drying shrimp","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552875","545202","545189","543916","545181","550316","545951","545211","554936","552865","546305","545193","552877","549050","551412","552863"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["farm","processing","seafood","harvesting","shovel","doorway","person","support","bucket","amount"]}
