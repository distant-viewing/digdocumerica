{"path":"543660.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a rural, mountainous landscape. In the foreground, there is a rustic, wooden fence running diagonally from the lower left to the mid-right of the photo, creating a visual pathway leading the eye deeper into the scene. The fence is made of uneven wooden posts, some leaning haphazardly, and is situated alongside a dirt path or road with visible grass and weeds growing through it.\n\nThe middle ground of the image shows a broad, flat meadow, lush and green, bordered by more dense shrubbery or undergrowth on the right side. Scattered yellow wildflowers can be seen blooming near the front of the image, adding a dash of color to the predominantly green and brown tones.\n\nThe background reveals towering mountains, draped with patches of snow. The mountains partially fade into a hazy or misty sky, creating a sense of depth and altitude. The weather seems clear as the details of the mountain are quite discernible despite the haze.\n\nOverall, the scene is serene and somewhat untouched, evoking a sense of wilderness and tranquil rural life. The setting appears to be remote, surrounded by natural beauty, and devoid of any immediate signs of modern human activity.","title":"This area will be developed into a resort for skiing and vacation housing.","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["543654","543763","553073","554722","549156","549142","550667","554562","544857","557087","549236","549154","554453","545040","557212","543569"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","dash","fence","weed","meadow","undergrowth","shrubbery","wildflower","drape","grow"]}
