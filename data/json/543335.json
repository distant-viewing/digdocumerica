{"path":"543335.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial complex, likely a mining facility, situated in a dry, barren landscape. The complex is extensive, consisting of multiple interconnected buildings with sloped metal roofs, typically painted in a pale shade that could be gray or light blue. Notable features include various chimneys and ventilation pipes protruding from the roofs, suggesting the presence of furnaces or heavy machinery inside the buildings.\n\nIn the foreground is a headframe, which is an essential structure in mining operations, used for lowering and raising equipment and ore to and from the mine. This particular headframe has a noticeably simple, metal construction. There's no visible activity or people in the picture, which may indicate the facilities are not in operation, abandoned, or simply captured during a non-working moment.\n\nThe terrain around the buildings is rocky and devoid of vegetation, underlining the harsh conditions typical of many mining environments. The stark contrast between the industrial complex and the natural surroundings emphasizes the isolation of such facilities.","title":"Southern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544068","543848","543669","554764","544037","542513","543836","546208","544044","554763","554625","549168","555634","552004","544781","552686"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","complex","facility","lower","ore","furnace","interconnect","ventilation","mine","operation"]}
