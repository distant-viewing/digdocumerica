{"path":"551418.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a rural outdoor scene, marked by signs of human activity and littering in an expansive, grassy terrain. The ground is littered with numerous empty cans and some cardboard boxes; notably, prominent among the litter is a Busch beer cardboard box. In the forefront, a person with long, red hair is seen throwing something into a black trash can labeled “Pitch In!” suggesting an effort to clean up the area.\n\nThe backdrop reveals a row of parked vehicles, including cars, vans, and RVs, suggesting this location might be a site for temporary habitation or a gathering, possibly related to a festival or some public event. The presence of these vehicles and another individual reclining on the ground further supports this notion.\n\nThe environment appears slightly barren with few trees and brown grass, depicting either a late fall or early spring scene, and the overcast sky contributes to the somber mood of the setting. This photo seems to emphasize environmental concerns relating to human recreational activities and their impacts on natural surroundings.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
