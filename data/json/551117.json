{"path":"551117.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a small-town street scene, set in a valley surrounded by lush, forested hills. The street is lined with a variety of buildings, including storefronts and possibly residential structures. On the right, a building prominently displays a large \"S\" sign, suggesting a business, and next to it, another structure has a striped design. Visible signs include \"BANK\" and \"CENTER\" adding a commercial vibe to the setting.\n\nIn the middle of the street, a child is seen riding a bike, heading away from the camera and adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. Parked cars along the curb suggest the era might be mid to late 20th century, as indicated by their vintage styles.\n\nOverhead, multiple utility lines crisscross the view, typical of many American towns during this period. In the background, the street leads the eye towards a bridge that spans the valley, further emphasizing the nestled nature of this mountain town. The overall atmosphere is quiet and quaint, typical of a small American town captured in a moment of daily life.","title":"Evening in the kanawha valley town of smithers","placename":"Charleston (W.
