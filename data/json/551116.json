{"path":"551116.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and lively roadside scene in a mountainous area. Several people are present, engaging in various activities near a small building with a sloping roof. The building appears to be a shop or a small house, characterized by its rustic wooden facade and multiple windows. There is a weathered porch area on which a woman is standing, looking towards a large group of individuals gathered around.\n\nIn front of the building, there is a group of people, possibly either a family or friends. They appear engaged in casual conversation or observing something off-camera. The individuals vary in age, from children to adults. Among this group, there is a noticeable presence of youth, including a couple of young women, a few young men, and children. One child is seen riding a tricycle.\n\nA partial view of an aging, reddish vehicle is visible on the left side of the frame. This contributes to the sense of a casual, community-gathering spot by the roadside.\n\nIn the background, lush green trees dominate the landscape, reinforcing the rural or semi-rural nature of the setting. In the distance, a tall water tower stands on a hill, providing a contrast to the dense foliage with its industrial appearance and height.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a slice of life from this community, set against a backdrop of natural beauty and simple architectural forms. The image evokes a sense of calmness and community spirit amongst the people present.","title":"Housing on Route 61 at Eagle in the Kanawha Valley region","placename":"Charleston (W.
