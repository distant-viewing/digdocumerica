{"path":"548119.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a young child, perhaps around three to five years old, deeply engaged in playing outdoors. The child, who appears to be a girl based on the hairstyle, is dressed in a thick, cable-knit sweater in a vibrant shade of turquoise. Her hair is light brown and is partly tied up with a small yellow band, with wisps falling around her face.\n\nShe is sitting at what seems to be a heavy wooden sandbox, with the intricate grain and pattern of the wood prominently visible. Inside the sandbox, the content looks to be a mixture of sand and small leaves, suggesting it might be an outdoor play area, possibly in a park or a backyard setting.\n\nThe childâ€™s focus is entirely on a small object that she holds in her hands, examining it intently. The specific nature of the object isn't clear from the image, but her curiosity and concentration are evident in her facial expression and body language.\n\nThe background is softly focused, showing an indistinct area that could be a sandy or dirt ground, blending in with the natural, outdoor environment. The light in the photograph gives a bright yet soft appearance, suggesting it might be a sunny day. Overall, the scene is peaceful, capturing a moment of simple childhood curiosity and exploration.","title":"At the confluence of the Columbia and willamette rivers","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555398","544143","544380","549254","543496","549674","549105","542768","550244","544424","547727","543740","556139","550241","544200","553507"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["curiosity","child","wisp","turquoise","play","backyard","language","knit","childhood","hairstyle"]}
