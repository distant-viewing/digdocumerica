{"path":"556608.jpg","date":"December 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"In the photograph, we have an outdoor rural scene featuring a young boy interacting with a group of pigs beside a body of water. The boy, seen on the right, is leaning against a tree and tipping a yellow bucket, presumably to feed or attract the pigs. The pigs, four of them, vary in color from black to white and are gathered around the boy, eagerly approaching the bucket.\n\nThe setting is a muddy, open area by a pond, with the water reflecting gently the blue sky and trees. The tree in the foreground, beside which the boy stands, serves as a prominent structure in the scene, adding to the rustic, natural feel. In the background, beyond the pond, trees with sparse foliage suggest it might be late fall or early winter. The overall lighting suggests it is either dawn or dusk, casting a warm glow and long shadows in the scene.\n\nThis image captures a moment of rural life, likely focusing on farm activities and the simple interaction between the boy and the animals in a peaceful, natural setting.","title":"Darrell gipson, 13, son of mr.
