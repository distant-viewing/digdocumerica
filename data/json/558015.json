{"path":"558015.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph displays a rustic outdoor scene dominated by natural elements. Central to the image is a simple, roughly constructed wooden bridge crossing over a narrow body of water, likely a stream or canal. The water appears calm, reflecting the blue of the sky and the greenery around it. On both sides of the waterway, the ground is lush and verdant, indicating it is probably spring or summer.\n\nThe bridge is made of planks laid horizontally, supported by vertical posts, and lacks guardrails, suggesting it is meant for functional, local use rather than heavy or tourist traffic. Around the bridge, there's an abundance of green vegetation, including tall grasses, bushes, and a variety of other plants, indicating a rich, moist environment.\n\nIn the background, the landscape includes densely packed trees with mature, full foliage in shades of green. The environment suggests a serene, possibly rural setting away from urban areas. There's a hint of a field or cleared land beyond the immediate flora, possibly for agriculture or pasturage.\n\nThe overall composition and lighting of the photograph, combined with the natural elements it captures, evoke a sense of tranquility and the simple beauty of an unspoiled pastoral locale. The image seems to have been taken during the daytime under natural light that accentuates the freshness of the landscape.","title":"Eleven Mile Lock flanked by a towpath and cornfield at Valley View, Ohio, near Cleveland. The Ohio-Erie Canal was built from Cleveland to Akron between 1825 and 1827, and flourished from 1833 to 1913 as a link between the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi River systems. The waterway was put out of business by a flood and competition from the railroads. The canal is now a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557024","557996","558005","553756","553355","543087","542555","558051","544542","551527","557969","545008","548064","553752","557096","552598"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["bridge","freshness","guardrail","mean","crossing","abundance","locale","canal","tourist","agriculture"]}
