The sun appears large and luminous, filling the right side of the frame with a warm, glowing orb of light which bathes the scene in amber tones. The left side of the image prominently features the windmill, its structure intricately detailed and set in sharp contrast against the lighter sky. The windmill's blades and tail are distinctly outlined, creating a compelling visual pattern. The background is a gradient of reddish-pink to orange hues, suggesting that the photo was taken at dusk. The overall mood of the image is serene yet powerful, emphasizing the simple beauty of rural technology against the vastness of the natural environment.","title":"Windmill in the sunset at Sealy","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["547283","545852","545856","547345","547347","549212","549216","545832","549210","547293","549213","545418","555291","549211","558140","548886"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["windmill","orb","blade","tail","technology","gradient","bathe","orange","sunset","vastness"]}
