{"path":"551066.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph provides a serene view of a riverside community. The scene captures a peaceful river in the foreground, with several small boats moored at the edge of the water. A lush green lawn slopes gently down to the riverbank, lined at its edge with a protective boundary of stones. \n\nThe midground consists of a neatly maintained park-like area, featuring manicured grass and trees dotted around. This area seems to be a communal space, possibly serving as a recreational spot for the residents. There are a few individuals visible in this section, leisurely enjoying the tranquility of the environment. \n\nIn the background, there is a dense assembly of houses nestled into the rolling hills that rise steeply from the river. The architecture is varied, showing different styles and periods, suggesting a community that has developed over a considerable time. The homes are interspersed with more trees, adding to the greenery and bucolic feel of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph utilizes natural light to enhance the lushness of the environment and convey a calming, idyllic atmosphere typical of a quiet, residential riverside town.","title":"Smithers, a town on the Kanawha River","placename":"Charleston (W.
