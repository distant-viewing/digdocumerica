{"path":"557254.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil natural scene. It depicts lush greenery gently hanging over a body of water. The flora, primarily comprising leafy branches with a multitude of small, oval leaves dipping towards the water, creates an overhanging appearance at the top of the frame. The leaves are tinged white at the edges, suggesting either a specific variety or a play of light.\n\nThe body of water reflects these hanging branches, creating a serene and slightly distorted mirror image that adds to the depth of the composition. The water, filled with gentle ripples, has a rich, dark hue that contrasts with the vibrant green of the leaves. This color contrast emphasizes the calmness of the scene, with the dark water magnifying the intensity of the green foliage.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or any other evident objects that would indicate human presence, making this image a pure depiction of nature's quiet beauty. The composition focuses mainly on the interaction between the water and the foliage, presenting a secluded spot that evokes a sense of peace and solitude. Overall, the photograph showcases a simple yet evocative natural landscape, where the interplay of reflections, colors, and natural elements come together harmoniously.","title":"Pollutants which are emptied into the Ohio river and its tributaries have affected riverbank vegetation near Pittsburgh Pennsylvania","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["546963","553410","551352","554623","550845","554527","554603","545008","551349","550844","543561","550750","555637","554526","543611","547011"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["leave","magnify","water","distort","hang","dip","branch","multitude","tinge","peace"]}
