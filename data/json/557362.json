{"path":"557362.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a relaxed, sunny day scene on a residential porch, likely in a mid-20th century American setting. The image features three adults engaged in a casual interaction.\n\nOn the left, a swing bench is partially visible with a middle-aged woman seated on it. She is wearing a sleeveless blue and white checkered blouse and her dark hair is styled back. Next to her, a younger woman with shoulder-length dark hair and a red tank top is visible. Both are seated in a manner suggesting leisure and comfort.\n\nThe focus of the interaction is a man standing on the right side of the frame, facing the two women on the swing bench. Heâ€™s an elderly man dressed in light-colored pants and a short-sleeved white shirt, accessorized with a belt and glasses. He holds what appears to be a deck of cards, extending it towards the seated woman who seems to be either giving or receiving a card.\n\nThe setting includes a porch bounded by partial views of railings and chains from a porch swing. A stone-clad exterior wall of the house provides a textured background. In the background, beyond the porch, cars and a verdant environment suggest a suburban area.\n\nThis tranquil scene appears to capture a moment of familial or friendly bonding, likely over a card game, evoking a sense of leisure and togetherness typical of intimate, informal gatherings.","title":"Mrs.  May watkins and son, billy, talk to a local minister who has stopped by their new house.
