{"path":"548230.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, dusky landscape, likely taken in the evening given the low light and rich, deep color tones. The scene is set in a sandy area that resembles dunes, with uneven ground and a slightly hilly terrain. The sand's surface appears rough and slightly textured, suggesting recent wind activity or a lack of heavy footfall.\n\nIn the foreground, the area is more shadowed, contributing to a somewhat mysterious or subdued ambience. There are several wooden fences positioned diagonally and vertically throughout the area, perhaps meant to control sand movement or denote pathways. Scattered sporadically across the sand are some bare, thin posts, possibly remains of old fencing or markers for some boundary.\n\nThe middle ground shows a gently rising slope, leading up to a cluster of bare trees situated on a small hill. These trees, leafless and silhouetted against the sky, add a stark, almost skeletal contrast to the smoother lines of the sand and sky.\n\nIn the background, the sky displays dramatic cloud formations, tinged with blues and pinks, hinting at the setting or rising of the sun. There is one visible figure in the distance, small and solitary, walking near the ridge of the hill, emphasizing a sense of isolation or peaceful solitude.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is contemplative and calm, with a touch of melancholy, accentuated by the cool color palette and the solitary human figure. The setting could be a coastal region where sand dunes play a significant part of the landscape, and the evening light suggests a quiet, reflective moment in nature.","title":"Crane's Beach, a federally-protected dune preserve, between Essex and Ipswich","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["545203","545199","545207","550490","544415","557182","552897","545200","543097","548222","547015","553820","548673","548672","545895","547705"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["sand","dune","evening","fencing","figure","marker","ambience","pink","hill","ridge"]}
