{"path":"554769.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast, sprawling landscape dominated by a strip mining operation. The setting is expansive, featuring open, terraced earth with various levels where soil and vegetation have been removed, exposing raw earth tones ranging from dark browns to lighter tans. Toward the right, a large mechanical apparatus, likely a dragline excavator, is visible and stands out prominently against the flatter areas around it. This piece of heavy machinery is used for removing overburden in strip mining operations.\n\nThe terrain is uneven and marked by various ridges and depressions, characteristic of an area subjected to extensive excavation activities. Patches of residual scrub vegetation and a few leafless trees frame the edges of the image, providing a stark contrast to the largely barren, man-altered landscape in the middle ground.\n\nThe sky above is a muted pink, suggesting either a setting or rising sun, adding a somewhat surreal quality to the scene. Such lighting imbues the scene with a subdued tone, emphasizing the solitude and quiet disruption evident in the mined area. There are no visible human figures, reinforcing the sense of abandonment after significant extraction activities. Overall, the photograph captures the stark transformation of a natural landscape into an industrial zone through mining.","title":"An Ohio power company coal shovel in the distance looms over a landscape of stripped land.
