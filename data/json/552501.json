{"path":"552501.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph presents a serene rural landscape, likely taken on a sunny day given the vivid colors and pronounced shadows. The scene is set in a broad pasture with several horses scattered across the frame. Five horses appear, varied in color from light tans to browns; some are standing while one grazes the ground. The foreground shows patches of lush green grass interspersed with visible trails or areas of dirt, emphasizing a natural, somewhat rugged terrain.\n\nIn the background, the boundary of the pasture is lined with dense, mature trees, mainly deciduous, full of rich green leaves suggesting this photo was taken in spring or summer. Some fallen logs and undergrowth near the edge of the forest add to the rustic feel of the landscape. The sunlight filtering through the leaves casts patterns of light and shadow across the scene, enhancing the tranquil and bucolic mood of the photograph.\n\nThere are no man-made structures or any signs of human presence in the immediate visible area, providing a sense of isolation and peaceful coexistence with nature. The composition's simplicity focuses attention on the tranquility of rural life and the natural beauty of the environment.","title":"Along interstate 74","placename":"Brimfield (Ill.)","location":"Brimfield, Illinois","nn1":["542622","551229","543726","556958","557186","551327","552562","554161","543366","556957","542972","542956","542619","549198","546102","554885"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["pasture","horse","mature","pronounce","vari","trails","undergrowth","graze","tan","casts"]}
