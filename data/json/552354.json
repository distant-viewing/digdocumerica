{"path":"552354.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view capturing a serene scene on a vast water body, possibly a lake or calm sea, bathed in a delicate orange-tinted light typical of early morning or sunset times. This ambiance gives the image a tranquil and almost ethereal glow.\n\nIn the water, there are numerous windsurfers scattered across the frame. Each windsurfer has a small, streamlined board and a sail, which varies slightly in color and shape but generally blends with the subtle colors of the surroundings. The sails are tilted at various angles, suggesting a gentle but active maneuvering across the water.\n\nThe light, reflecting off the water, creates shimmery textures on the surface, enhancing the overall peaceful yet dynamic nature of the scene. It seems like a moment captured in time where all elements converge in a display of harmony and motion, emphasizing the beauty of water sports in a natural setting. The simplicity of the composition—water, light, and the windsurfers—allows the viewer to feel a sense of vastness and freedom.","title":"Sailboats at sunset on spinnaker run in race on commencement bay, puget sound","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543059","552293","552345","548118","552355","544667","544021","551540","552351","547781","550303","548247","544669","552039","543888","552038"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sail","water","harmony","freedom","converge","time","tilt","tint","board","simplicity"]}
