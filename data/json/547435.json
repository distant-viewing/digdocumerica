{"path":"547435.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of a suburban area. The layout foregrounds several curving residential streets packed with single-family homes, many of which appear to have large front and back yards. In the bottom part of the image, there is a notable circular street arrangement surrounded by houses. The middle section of the image features two structures with bright red and white roofs, which contrast distinctively with the surrounding green and residential grey tones. These could possibly be public or community buildings given their size and prominent roofing.\n\nTo the far left, a field, likely agricultural, borders the residential area, marking a transition from developed land to open green space. On the right of the image, more residential areas can be seen, suggesting this is a well-established suburban community. The roads within the community are connected to main roads that line the outer edge, facilitating access to adjoining areas.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the structured and orderly development typical of suburban planning, with homes neatly arrayed along quiet streets, and interspersed with areas of greenery, enhancing the neighborhood's appeal.","title":"Residential subdivision on the western edge of Lincoln","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["553699","549071","553937","553700","547211","547769","556974","544604","546399","544510","548824","545914","558057","553934","551198","553705"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["community","street","home","roofing","establish","planning","appeal","facilitate","open","road"]}
