{"path":"551155.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features a view of a large industrial scene dominated by three cooling towers and an additional tall smokestack at a power plant. The cooling towers, which are large, cone-shaped structures, taper towards the top and emit white steam into the sky. These towers are typically associated with nuclear or coal-fired power plants, using their hyperboloid structure to efficiently cool the steam that drives the turbines.\n\nCentered in the composition and positioned against a partly cloudy sky, the plant's facilities also include various buildings and infrastructure partially visible between the cooling towers. On the far left, a smaller structure or building can be seen, possibly part of the plant's operational facilities.\n\nIn the foreground, a calm body of water reflects the towers and the cloudy sky above. This setting suggests that the plant might be situated near a lake or a river, utilizing the water source for its cooling processes. The photograph has a slightly overcast, moody tone with muted colors, enhancing the industrial feel of the scene.","title":"Clouds of steam rise from the water cooling towers of the John Amos power plant on the Kanawha River.","placename":"Nitro (W.
