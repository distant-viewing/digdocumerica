{"path":"549584.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a vintage car parade in a city setting. The image features several classic cars, likely from around the 1920s to 1930s, driving down a street lined with viewers. The cars are in excellent condition, each showcasing unique design features typical of the era, like prominent grilles, spoke wheels, and glossy finishes.\n\nLeading the parade, there is a dark-colored convertible, followed by at least three other vintage vehicles. The occupants of these cars appear to be participating joyfully; for instance, one individual is seen waving enthusiastically to the crowd. Each car bears a number on its windshield, suggesting they are part of a competition or organized showcase, and they all have visible old-fashioned license plates.\n\nObservers are standing on the side of the road, and some are visible near a building in the background. Thereâ€™s also a fire truck ladder extended towards a fireman or camera operator at a considerable height above the street, suggesting the event is being photographed or filmed.\n\nBuildings in the background are partially shadowed, typical of urban architecture of the era captured in the photograph. The sunlight illuminates the scene brightly, rendering deep contrasts and highlighting the glossy surfaces of the cars and the festive mood of the event.","title":"Venerable autos form part of \"Old Milwaukee Days\" annual parade.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546991","549572","557052","552412","552660","555475","547797","557712","556724","556709","546665","554297","557230","556718","549566","556713"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","parade","competition","instance","era","event","operator","grille","render","observer"]}
