{"path":"552005.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural setting showcasing a \"DEAD END\" road sign on the left side of the frame. This yellow diamond-shaped sign is mounted on a black pole alongside a smaller sign below it warning of a \"Petroleum Pipeline.\" Just underneath, there is a protective black bollard.\n\nThe setting includes a lush green space with well-maintained grass. Adjacent to the sign pole, there is a small, leafy tree. To the right, part of a gray house with white trim is visible, its side facing the camera featuring two windows on its upper story.\n\nThe scene extends behind the sign, showing a paved road that leads towards what looks like another green area, slightly obscured by the home and foliage. In the distance on the right, partially visible vehicles suggest the presence of a driveway or parking area adjacent to the house.\n\nThe overall atmosphere appears serene and somewhat secluded, typical of a quiet, rural residential area. The photograph captures a moment of clear, bright daylight, enhancing the colors of the grass and surrounding vegetation.","title":"Sign on pipe set in lawn reads: \"Warning.
