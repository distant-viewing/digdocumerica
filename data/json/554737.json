{"path":"554737.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene autumn scene focused on the richly colored foliage reflecting in a still body of water, likely a pond or lake. The upper two-thirds of the image is dominated by trees displaying vibrant yellow and amber leaves, highlighted by the sunlight, amid patches of darker green. There is a notable variety in the density and height of the trees, indicating a natural, untamed forest environment.\n\nThe lower third of the image features a detailed and textured reflection of the trees in the water. The reflection is crisp and almost mirror-like, showing the intricate shapes of the leaves and branches. The waterâ€™s surface is smooth, undisturbed by ripples or wind, which enhances the clarity of the reflection.\n\nDarker areas at the bottom of the image, possibly shadows or deeper parts of the forest, provide a contrast that further accentuates the brightness of the autumn leaves. The composition of the photograph, with its vivid colors and tranquil natural setting, suggests a peaceful, secluded spot, ideal for contemplation or nature observation. The overall atmosphere conveyed is one of quiet beauty and seasonal change.","title":"Double reflection of yellow birch in Twitchell Lake","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554751","554758","554738","554649","554757","554750","554749","554648","554711","554753","554735","554748","554727","554730","554715","552599"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["third","reflection","autumn","leave","like","forest","observation","brightness","clarity","density"]}
