{"path":"554801.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape. The scene is dominated by rolling grassy hills across which a few distinct land features can be noted. At the center peak of one hill, there is a small red-roofed building, likely a barn or a storage shed, which is the most prominent structure in the area.\n\nThe colors in the image are muted, with the sky displaying an overcast blend of purple and soft pink hues that cast a dim light onto the landscape. The grass and hills show various shades of darker green and brown, showing no signs of recent cultivation or agricultural activity.\n\nPredominantly bare trees dot the landscape around the hilltops, adding a sense of solitude and winter or late fall to the scene. In particular, a leafless tree near the mid-left of the frame stands out against the sky.\n\nThe foreground of the photograph reveals an undulating field, intersected by simple fencing which likely serves to contain livestock, though none are visible in the photo. This foreground area slopes down into a darker, shadow-filled depression or small valley, hinting at more varied terrain.\n\nOverall, the photograph emits a peaceful, albeit somber, mood typical of rural landscapes in colder seasons, inviting contemplation on the quiet and less inhabited parts of the countryside.","title":"Farmland stripped twenty years ago and partially reclaimed off route 9","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["555537","554767","549256","553809","549142","557749","555603","545040","557023","549261","549182","554819","543763","557087","555577","557748"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["hill","depression","hilltop","fencing","countryside","cultivation","livestock","note","undulate","barn"]}
