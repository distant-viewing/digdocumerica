{"path":"543408.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image captures a large, dilapidated wooden pier or waterfront structure bathed in warm, golden light, likely during sunrise or sunset. The structure is densely constructed, primarily of aged and weathered wood. It features multiple levels and sections, with some parts covered by roofs made of corrugated metal and wooden shingles. \n\nEach segment of the structure varies in condition and architectural detail, showcasing areas heavily supported by wooden beams and others more open. The pier appears to be functioning minimally or abandoned, suggested by the general state of decay and the absence of active human presence.\n\nSeagulls are prominently featured, perching in large numbers on different parts of the roofs and flying around the vicinity. Their presence adds a dynamic element of wildlife interaction with human-made environments.\n\nThe background hints at a wider coastal or bay area, with hints of land and possibly a cityscape in the distant haze, contributing to a serene yet somewhat melancholic maritime scene. The light illuminating the pier highlights the textures and contours of the wood and the rustic charm of this marine structure.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["550310","545005","551978","546871","547585","547572","550293","547575","548105","547068","543320","547847","543242","547594","549300","547143"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["pier","wood","seagull","shingle","perch","fly","roof","sunrise","segment","structure"]}
