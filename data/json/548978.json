{"path":"548978.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and slightly abstract scene, predominantly showcasing a water body at sunset or sunrise. The upper portion of the image is enveloped in shadow, presenting a dark expanse that contrasts sharply with the glowing hues below. A key feature in this shadowed area is a faint outline of what appears to be a bridge with subtle lights, traversing the frame from one side to the other. Just below this bridge, on the left side, a boat with a bright spot, likely due to a light, floats on the water.\n\nThe lower section of the image is where the most striking elements are concentrated. Reflective water ripples gently and catches the light in a way that creates a vibrant interplay of orange, pink, and golden colors. This layer of color adds a warmth and tranquility to the scene. The transitions between the colors are smooth, suggesting a calm atmosphere with soft, diffused light. The reflective nature of the water creates patterns that are both organic and visually compelling.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is divided into two distinct halves by the play of shadow and light, with the bottom half drawing the viewer's eye through its luminous palette and reflective quality. The scene conveys a peaceful evening or morning by the water, highlighted by minimal human activity and the quiet presence of natural or artificial light.","title":"Lake mead","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["543143","543880","557447","544711","547230","552237","551215","542994","545145","551214","545149","552230","552263","557572","552294","552310"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["half","light","bridge","traverse","water","shadow","concentrate","warmth","sunrise","envelop"]}
