{"path":"554739.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene forest scene focused on a collection of evergreen trees, with one particularly striking tree standing out due to its golden-yellow foliage, which suggests it may be autumn. This tree is taller and fuller compared to the surrounding darker green conifers, and its unique color makes it the central subject of the image.\n\nThe scene is set against a backdrop of mixed coniferous trees, which are mainly dark green, creating a contrast with the bright yellow of the central tree. The underbrush is sparse, allowing a clear view of the forest floor, which is covered with brown fallen leaves and possibly some early morning dew or frost, suggesting the season could be late autumn.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is natural, further enhancing the vibrant autumn colors and giving a tranquil and somewhat ethereal quality to the forest scene. The sky is not visible, focusing all attention on the forest and trees. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and reflective, inviting the viewer to admire the natural beauty and perhaps the fleeting nature of autumn.","title":"Full grown tamarack tree at twitchell lake","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["550603","554735","554718","554715","557821","554728","554738","554668","542849","557822","554737","554394","554730","542615","555116","554736"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["autumn","forest","tree","frost","underbrush","dew","fallen","yellow","conifer","strike"]}
