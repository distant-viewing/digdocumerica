{"path":"543678.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a tender and pastoral scene set outdoors, featuring a child and a horse. The horse, a large white animal with a saddle and bridle, stands facing forward, though it turns its head slightly toward the child. The child, whose back is to the camera, is positioned close to the horse, appearing to be either caressing its nose or adjusting part of the bridle. Both are bathed in diffuse, natural lighting that suggests a time of day when the sun is not too high, likely morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe background indicates a rustic setting, possibly on a farm or in a rural area, with hints of trees and a wooden barn structure with a dark roof visible. The ground is unpaved, strewn with rocks and patches of grass, which gives an authentic feel of an outdoor, country environment.\n\nThis scene, rich in serene pastoral beauty, evokes themes of companionship and care between humans and animals. The childâ€™s interaction with the horse, along with the peaceful backdrop, contributes to a sense of tranquility and connection with nature.","title":"Ranch scene","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553064","543784","542972","557186","543783","554689","545894","545890","543043","542622","553116","542619","556548","556562","552562","543726"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["horse","bridle","child","animal","saddle","tender","country","nose","companionship","facing"]}
