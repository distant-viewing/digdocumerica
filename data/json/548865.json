{"path":"548865.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close view of a contamination warning setup, possibly in a laboratory or an industrial facility handling dangerous materials. The focal point of the image is a small window within a door or wall. The window has a metal frame and reveals a view of a blurry outdoor scene dominated by green vegetation, indicating the interior perspective.\n\nDirectly in front of the window, a bright yellow warning tape runs horizontally, prominently bearing the text \"CONTAMINATED MATERIAL\" along with symbols for radiation (radioactive trefoils) in purple. This tape also has multiple sections that resemble placeholders for additional information such as “Isotope,” “Activity,” “Date,” etc., suggesting it is used for marking areas or items with specific radioactive materials.\n\nThe composition of the photograph and the elements within it emphasize safety protocols associated with handling hazardous materials, underlining the seriousness and regulated nature of the environment. The contrast between the sterile, controlled indoor setting and the natural, lush outdoors visible through the window creates a juxtaposition of human-made hazards against nature.","title":"Laboratory at epa's Las Vegas national research center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548859","543645","546303","555259","546240","548951","549357","555254","553905","555238","545312","555240","546936","543797","550272","546009"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["tape","warning","window","material","protocol","seriousness","regulate","hazard","contamination","laboratory"]}
