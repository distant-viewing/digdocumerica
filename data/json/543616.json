{"path":"543616.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts three crumpled, discarded soda cans lying on the ground amidst pine needles, twigs, and dirt. The cans are pale yellow with a logo partially visible on each, featuring swirls or curls which appear to be part of a classic decorative script commonly found on some beverage cans. The surrounding pine needles and twigs are densely scattered, indicating the location might be a forested or wooded area. The overall setting is messy and suggests neglect, highlighting an environmental concern related to littering. The natural light and shadow suggest that the photograph might have been taken outdoors during the daytime.","title":"'Litter'","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["544640","555257","544644","550805","544652","551246","550806","544651","542978","544648","547506","552937","548755","548758","555149","542809"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["can","twig","needle","script","soda","swirl","beverage","pine","concern","daytime"]}
