{"path":"546448.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, modern architecture building with distinct geometric elements. The structure features several slanted and flat roofs of varying heights and is predominantly clad in white panels, with glass windows interspersed. In front of the building is a row of parked cars from an era that suggests the photo was taken in the late 20th century. The cars exhibit a variety of colors and models, indicative of typical mid-to-late 20th-century automotive design.\n\nIn the foreground, there are young trees, possibly recently planted, adding a touch of greenery to the scene. The background shows a sky with a mixture of clouds, some fluffy and white, others more spread out and thinner, suggesting a possibly breezy day.\n\nThe overall scene is calm and devoid of visible human activity, focusing more on the architecture and its surroundings. A flag pole is visible near the center of the building, but no flag is discernible in the image. The setting appears to be a professional or institutional environment, likely on the outskirts of a town or in a suburban setting, considering the ample parking and open space around the building.","title":"Columbus east senior high school, built in 1972","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["548866","546447","546702","546464","546481","546473","546456","546543","546531","546329","546415","546542","546539","546506","555449","549626"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["flag","century","consider","architecture","building","outskirt","car","mixture","panel","clothe"]}
