{"path":"543880.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph presents a serene sunset scene, observed from a shaded vantage point. The focal point of the image is the golden reflection of the setting sun on the water, which glows brightly in the midst of darker surroundings. Silhouetted against this vivid backdrop is a small boat containing one or more individuals, placed almost centrally in the portion of the water visible through an organic frame of tree branches and leaves.\n\nThe top and bottom of the photograph are framed by out-of-focus leaves and branches from nearby trees, which create a natural border around the sunset view, emphasizing the contrast between the dark foreground and the bright, shimmering water. The branches are dense and darken the edges of the photograph, leading the viewer's eye towards the glowing water, where the small, silhouetted boat provides a sense of scale and human presence within the vastness of nature.\n\nThe setting sun has cast a warm, orange hue across the water, which reflects and scatters the light, creating a texture that is both sparkling and smooth. The sense of tranquility is palpable, with the simplicity of the scene and the isolation of the boat suggesting a moment of solitude or peaceful contemplation. The overall composition uses natural elements to frame and draw focus to the interplay of light and shadow, creating a beautiful and contemplative scene typical of a sunset over water.","title":"The Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["551215","543143","552038","557447","547230","552039","543411","550296","552294","550303","544711","548978","543144","551206","551214","552293"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sunset","branch","boat","water","sun","leave","point","midst","border","contemplation"]}
