{"path":"548535.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and busy scene at a fishing marina. In the foreground, two prominent fishing boats named \"Maroni Belle\" and \"Red Witch\" are docked side by side, their bows pointing toward the viewer. The boats are large, with sturdy builds, and are painted mostly white. The names of the boats are clearly marked on their hulls in black letters against a contrasting background color.\n\nThe \"Maroni Belle\" has sandy and black detailing around its nameplate, while the \"Red Witch\" features blue detailing. Both vessels are equipped with visible rigging, masts, and booms suggesting they are trawlers or similar types of fishing vessels. Behind these two boats, numerous other similar vessels are moored, creating a dense cluster of masts and rigging lines that dominate the middle part of the photograph.\n\nThe water is calm, reflecting part of the boats and masts. No people are visible in the image, suggesting a focus purely on the boats and their arrangement. The sky is clear and blue, indicating a bright, sunny day which enhances the visibility of the colors and details in the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition centers on the maritime activity, with the alignment of the boats leading the viewer's eye deeper into the scene, conveying the essence of the busy fishing marina. The clarity and color saturation give the photograph a lively and detailed appearance, emphasizing the maritime theme.","title":"Shrimp boats lie at anchor at the commercial fishing dock","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["542911","542902","548546","542912","548547","542871","552028","548543","546877","548078","552027","546388","548539","546939","542904","542873"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","mast","fishing","vessel","rigging","marina","detailing","name","alignment","boom"]}
