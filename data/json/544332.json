{"path":"544332.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph features a dense forest setting in which the primary focus is on a birch tree trunk occupying a significant portion of the frame, from the center to the right side. The trunk is marked with numerous carved inscriptions, presumably names and messages, which have disrupted the tree's smooth white bark. Some of the visible names and words suggest a variety of languages or origins. This tree stands out starkly against a blurred background of similar tall, slender trees which extend throughout the capture.\n\nThe environment surrounding the trees is filled with lush undergrowth, featuring small plants and shrubs, implying a healthy, natural forest habitat. The lighting in the photo appears natural, possibly filtered through the canopy of the forest, which gives the scene an ambient, serene quality. The mood is somewhat contemplative, highlighting human interaction with nature through the carved messages on the tree. Overall, the composition of the photograph directs the viewer's attention to the human marks on the natural surface, suggesting themes of memory, presence, or possibly the impact of humans on nature.","title":"Scarred trees","placename":"Flagstaff (Ariz.)","location":"Flagstaff, Arizona","nn1":["542723","542715","543488","542791","550792","550703","554989","542749","553574","557622","543446","557616","545288","543445","554967","557621"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["message","forest","trunk","tree","name","birch","tall","origin","memory","inscription"]}
