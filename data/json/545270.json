{"path":"545270.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts the bow of a large boat looming above a polluted waterway. The boat has a sturdy build with a curved bow painted in layers of blue, white, and a red stripe near the waterline. Below the railing, the name \"MEREDITH B\" is visible in chipped white paint on the blue hull.\n\nThe water below the boat is heavily contaminated, filled with a dense tangle of dark, slick substances that could be oil or other pollutants, entwined with bits of debris including fragments of wood and plastic items like a crushed bottle. A large, waterlogged wooden plank crosses the frame in the foreground, illustrating the interface between human-made objects and the environmental degradation showcased in this scene.\n\nOverall, the composition uses a direct sunlight that highlights the textures and vivid contrast between the saturated colors of the boat and the dark, muddied colors of the polluted water, conveying a strong visual message about environmental neglect.","title":"Bow of fishing boat in polluted harbor","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553897","546887","546836","552127","547623","552158","545123","547626","555784","549306","547618","546944","547493","551560","551179","550812"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["boat","bow","pollute","waterlog","bits","waterline","contaminate","interface","saturate","tangle"]}
