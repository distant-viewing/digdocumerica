{"path":"554729.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image captures a close-up of a fern leaf in a dimly lit setting, illuminated subtly on its edges likely by a natural light source, possibly the sun. The fern is detailed, showing off the intricate pattern of its leaves, which are bathed in soft green and highlighted gently by the light. The lighting creates a dramatic contrast, emphasizing the texture and delicate structure of the fern.\n\nThe background is mostly obscured by darkness, but there is a hint of soft, glowing light on the right side, possibly from a sunbeam or small light, which helps to silhouette the fern against a very dark, indiscernible backdrop. The light and shadows play across the plant, creating a moody and somewhat mysterious atmosphere. The focus is sharply placed on the fern, making it the clear subject of the photograph, while the rest of the scene fades into shadow, emphasizing the isolation and delicate beauty of the plant in its environment.","title":"Balsams and ferns in the early morning in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["553590","555190","553589","555191","557593","554996","553358","543620","555049","558077","558080","555192","555053","545285","554998","554743"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fern","light","leaf","plant","darkness","close","source","up","bathe","help"]}
