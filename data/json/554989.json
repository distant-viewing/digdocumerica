{"path":"554989.jpg","date":"January 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking view of a large tree trunk observed from a bottom-up perspective in a snowy forest environment. The tree, which is the central focus of the image, has a robust and textured bark that appears wet or icy, suggesting recent snowfall or icy conditions. The tree rises from the foreground directly upward, splitting slightly into what appears to be multiple branches or perhaps another trunk, aligned with the viewerâ€™s line of sight.\n\nSurrounding the tree, the environment is densely populated with other trees whose branches and leaves intermingle, creating a thick canopy that partially obscures the sky. The foliage is dusted with snow, indicating a wintry setting. The photo captures the essence of a cold, serene forest, with natural light filtering through the branches, adding a contrasty and mystic quality to the scene.\n\nThe composition uses the natural lines of the tree trunk to lead the viewer's eye straight up, giving a sense of height and grandeur. The overall mood is quiet and contemplative, evoking the stillness and beauty found in winter forests.","title":"Douglas fir trees approximately 100 years old on Bainbridge Island, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553577","543607","555071","553574","553576","557608","550792","557613","557621","545292","554967","557616","543488","544332","543610","548687"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trunk","branch","forest","tree","snowfall","sight","filtering","viewer","bark","stillness"]}
