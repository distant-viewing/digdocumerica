{"path":"543478.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rural, agricultural setting and centers on a person sitting at the forefront, presumably a young worker, resting within a large metal container commonly used for harvesting. The individual is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, pants, and boots, facing towards the camera with a somewhat weary or contemplative expression.\n\nIn the background, an old red pickup truck, possibly from the mid-20th century, is parked on dirt soil, adding a nostalgic element to the scene. The truck appears aged, with noticeable wear and peeling paint, emphasizing a history of robust use, likely in farm work. The environment around the vehicle and person consists of a field with visible crops, including clusters of vegetables strewn about the ground, suggesting recent harvesting activity.\n\nThe setting embodies a sense of rustic simplicity and the hard work associated with agricultural labor. The combination of the vintage truck and the relaxed posture of the person, amidst the backdrop of an open field under a clear sky, conveys both a moment of rest and the enduring demands of farm life.","title":"Child of radish pickers","placename":"Moss Landing (Calif.)","location":"Moss Landing, California","nn1":["555619","552087","546092","549036","549259","544349","549042","552673","554025","553607","546176","542533","547734","546380","552570","555528"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["harvesting","truck","farm","person","demand","rest","embody","vegetable","endure","pickup"]}
