Several cranes and other construction equipment are visible, used for heavy lifting and building. The environment is vast and open, with a clear sky and flat, arid terrain enhancing the industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe image captures both the scale of the industrial project and the emphasis on safety in such environments, underlined by the multilingual safety sign in the forefront.","title":"Navajo generating plant under construction.
