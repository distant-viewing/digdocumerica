{"path":"550031.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures a quaint, picturesque street scene under a vivid blue sky. In the foreground, a prominent feature is an ornate black street lamp adorned with a hanging basket filled with vibrant red and pink flowers, adding a burst of color against the blue backdrop. The street lamp contributes to a sense of old-world charm.\n\nThe background features a row of traditional brick buildings with varying architectural styles and colors, including shades of red, beige, and brown. The buildings are narrow, with detailed facade work, and some have visible chimney stacks protruding from their roofs, typical of historic urban structures. There are multiple windows visible, some partially covered by curtains, suggesting residential use.\n\nTo the right side of the frame, a sign reading \"Fireside Stores\" is noticeable, indicating the presence of a local shop which likely caters to the needs of the community, enhancing the residential appeal of the area.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of urban life with a touch of nature through the inclusion of floral decorations, suggesting a well-maintained and cherished neighborhood. This harmonious blend gives off a serene and inviting atmosphere.","title":"Charles street","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550115","550107","551864","551722","557656","543360","556448","558030","550035","557156","550111","551778","551629","545372","548245","543132"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["lamp","cater","burst","stroot","inclusion","basket","protrud","need","quaint","street"]}
