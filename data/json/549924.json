{"path":"549924.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photo captures a vibrant street scene that appears to be taken from an elevated perspective, looking down on a group of people engaged in social interaction amidst a flower market.\n\nThe composition includes four individuals, all women, positioned around a central flower stall. The woman nearest the camera is seated, with vivid pink attire and a blue scarf around her neck, laughing or smiling while holding something in her right hand that resembles a small bag or clutch. She is looking towards a standing woman to her left, who is dressed in a long-sleeve pink top. This woman, in turn, is closely engaged in conversation with a third woman who stands out with a sleeveless white and blue striped dress and is carrying a shoulder bag. This third woman looks slightly away from the camera with a somewhat concerned or maybe uncomfortable expression.\n\nTo the left in the photograph, the back of a man is visible, wearing a pink shirt and attending to the flowers. The variety of flowers adds a colorful and vibrant element to the scene. They range in color from white and pink to deep red, arranged in numerous buckets and vases.\n\nThe background is somewhat obscured, but it seems to be an urban setting given the hints of a street or road just behind the participants. The light and shadows suggest a sunny day, adding to the lively and busy atmosphere encapsulated in the photo.","title":"Flower sellers at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550027","551698","549994","553242","550044","551699","551697","551470","551700","551833","551838","551687","553709","551694","551695","558249"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["woman","flower","bag","vase","turn","stall","scarf","street","camera","market"]}
