{"path":"550305.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of numerous fishing net floats. The floats are predominantly cylindrical and spherical in shape, and are mostly crafted in shades of cream and yellow, with a singular red float standing out amidst them. Many of these floats bear markings or signs of wear, indicating usage. They are tightly packed, some encased in netting and all connected by strands of rope, demonstrating their functional integration into fishing apparatus. The dense, textured arrangement of the floats provides a visually intriguing pattern, highlighting a practical aspect of maritime equipment. The focus on such a specific part of the fishing gear emphasizes the essential yet often overlooked components at work in marine industries.","title":"Fishing net at Malloch's Beach, Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["548767","548788","542892","545075","550306","546943","548766","552298","547937","542911","546319","546214","548789","547552","547551","552302"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["float","fishing","netting","strand","integration","cream","usage","apparatus","marking","rope"]}
