{"path":"547065.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a scene at a dockside or industrial area. On the right side of the photograph, there is a worker wearing dark clothing, bent over as they seem to be pulling or working with ropes or cables on the ground. The environment around them includes a water body with light waves splashing against the area, and a section of the dock or pier made of concrete and steel. The ground is mostly gravelly, and multiple train tracks can be seen running parallel to each other, suggesting that this might be a loading or unloading area adjacent to water.\n\nOn the left side, the dominant object is a large, rusted maroon structure, possibly a part of the dock or machinery related to the loading processes. There are heavy-duty ropes visible and what appears to be a splash of water against the structure, indicating some activity or movement in the water.\n\nIn the background, various goods or materials are piled or stacked neatly, likely awaiting transport or having just been offloaded. These include wrapped bales or pallets covered with tarps and crates. The scene is enveloped in a somewhat murky, overcast light, giving a slightly dimmed, industrial feel to the setting. Overall, the picture depicts an active working area, likely part of a cargo handling or industrial operation near a waterway.","title":"Tying up a barge at the Inland Steel dock","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547164","546841","547474","546917","552148","551040","551046","551039","551925","546016","546876","547903","546881","552015","548346","547056"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["loading","rope","dock","pallet","maroon","bale","tarp","crate","unloading","handling"]}
