{"path":"546983.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene featuring an intricate, sprawling oak tree with a network of gnarled and twisted branches, which dominate the upper portion of the image. Beneath this large tree, there is a clearing where a teal-colored sedan and a red U-Haul trailer are parked on a dirt area among patches of grass and groundcover.\n\nNearby, there is a simple, makeshift campsite setup which includes a yellow tarp shelter, seemingly supported by poles and possibly tied to the trailer or a nearby structure, under which a table and possibly other camping gear can be seen. The area is surrounded by other trees and shrubs, indicating a wooded or forested area.\n\nThe setting looks tranquil and somewhat secluded, suggesting an outdoor adventure or a temporary stop during a travel journey. The presence of the car and trailer implies mobility and a sense of temporary residence, possibly for recreation or during a moving process. The mature trees and dense vegetation provide a lush backdrop, expressing a natural and serene environment.","title":"A public campground on Isle of Palms, a popular ocean resort","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543599","548668","542732","551328","545500","557514","543198","542747","542853","554480","548748","554863","548756","548796","544942","554681"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["trailer","oak","teal","tarp","campsite","mobility","residence","stop","camping","shelter"]}
