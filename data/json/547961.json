{"path":"547961.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a somewhat dilapidated small blue and white boat with the registration number \"NY 177 BN\" on its hull. The boat is partially submerged and rests at an angle in shallow, murky water, possibly suggesting neglect or disuse. The scene appears to be in an urban waterfront area with some industrial or commercial decay visible.\n\nIn the foreground, the water surrounds debris and large discarded pieces, including rustic wooden pillars and scattered stones. Directly behind the boat, there's a building with a red roof and shingled walls. A single window with a metal grid is visible on this building, hinting at security concerns or a utilitarian purpose.\n\nIn the background across the street, there’s more of a bustling urban scene. Visible are a few commercial establishments with signage like “General Discount” and possibly “Marie’s” indicating small businesses. An old-fashioned red truck and a couple of cars from the mid-twentieth century hint at the era possibly being around the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nOverall, the image combines elements of urban life with maritime decay, suggesting a district where commercial, residential, and industrial activities intertwine near the water's edge. The slightly overcast sky and the gritty texture of the scene give it a raw, authentic urban feel.","title":"Dilapidated house overlooks debris filled creek at Hunter's Point.
