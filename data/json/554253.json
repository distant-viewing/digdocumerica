{"path":"554253.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph is set in a snowy mountain scene, presumably at a ski resort. The foreground features a groomed slope where several skiers are positioned at various distances. Nearby, tall pine trees, heavily laden with snow, dot the landscape, enhancing the wintery feel of the scene.\n\nIn the middle ground of the shot, more skiers can be seen descending the slope. They appear as small figures in comparison to the grand scale of the surrounding environment.\n\nThe background is dominated by a breathtaking panoramic view of a mountain range. The mountains extend into the distance, showcasing layers of snow-covered peaks under a pale blue sky scattered with light clouds.\n\nThe scenery suggests a crisp, clear day, ideal for skiing, with excellent visibility allowing one to enjoy the expansive view of the mountainous terrain that extends far beyond the immediate vicinity of the skiing area. The expanse and untouched nature of the mountain scene emphasize both the adventure of skiing and the serene beauty of the snow-enveloped landscape.","title":"On the big burn trail from the top of snowmass mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554236","554257","554251","554249","554254","550017","554235","554292","550004","543507","554252","554234","554247","554242","543384","554255"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["skier","snow","mountain","slope","skiing","groome","laden","comparison","snowy","det"]}
