{"path":"545866.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph captures a riverside landscape, viewed from a shady spot under a tree. The river, appearing broad and calm with a muddy brown color, dominates the foreground. The water is gently rippling, indicating a light breeze or current. The riverbank on the opposite side can be seen, featuring eroded edges and a background of sparse vegetation, with some greenery and a dirt ground.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a branch from a tree with wispy, fine leaves overhangs into the frame, providing a frame-within-the-frame effect. This adds a sense of depth and natural beauty to the scene.\n\nOn the right side of the opposite riverbank, there is a large accumulation of what looks like white debris or garbage, consisting of various items that are indistinguishable but cluttered in appearance, suggesting environmental pollution.\n\nThe sky above is partially visible, showing clouds that hint at overcast weather, contributing to the somewhat somber and muted tones of the colors in the photograph.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene yet slightly disturbed natural environment, with the peacefulness of the riverside contrasted against the hint of human impact visible on the other shore.","title":"Brazos river - receiver of abandoned cars","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["553003","550947","553419","552953","553427","557239","550682","551423","550845","557106","542653","550717","547526","550782","550367","542557"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["riverside","riverbank","rippl","disturb","breeze","peacefulness","frame","current","accumulation","garbage"]}
