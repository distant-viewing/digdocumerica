{"path":"553443.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals engaging in recreational summer activities near a body of water. The scene captures a moment of youthful audacity and leisure, predominantly centered around a concrete bridge.\n\nThe bridge, the focal architectural feature, appears sturdy and utilitarian, with a significant underside clearance above the water. Itâ€™s constructed from concrete and metal, evident from the beams and rivets visible on its face. The bridge is gray, showing signs of wear and aging such as slight discoloration and rust.\n\nIn the foreground, one individual is in the midst of diving into the water, captured in a dynamic pose with their legs still in the air and their hands leading the dive. This person wears a patterned swimwear. Another individual stands tentatively on the ledge of the bridge, onlooker or perhaps contemplating a jump. This person is clad in blue swim trunks and appears more reserved, contrasting dynamically with the diving figure.\n\nThe water below is dark and reflective, shimmering with ripples that suggest slight movement, possibly from the dive or a gentle current.\n\nThis image captures a common summertime activity, particularly popular among the youth seeking reprieve from the heat. It conveys themes of freedom, excitement, and a carefree spirit, common to moments of leisure and play.","title":"Here at Clinton, in the first quarter mile from its origin below the Wachusett Reservoir, the Nashua River is still safe for swimming.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["551165","552227","548834","550829","548083","544339","551160","557737","553439","544204","553436","551530","553444","550838","553435","551499"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["dive","bridge","diving","clearance","rivet","underside","summertime","leisure","swimwear","discoloration"]}
