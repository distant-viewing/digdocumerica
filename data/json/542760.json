{"path":"542760.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a highway, likely taken during the 1970s based on the style of the vehicles and overall quality of the image. On the left side of the image, prominently featured is a Los Angeles County patrol car, labeled \"AIR POLLUTION CONTROL VEHICLE PATROL\". The car is a classic American model with a distinctive black and white color scheme, typical of police vehicles from that era. The driver, a man wearing a short-sleeved shirt, is partially visible through the open driverâ€™s side window, looking toward the right side of the frame.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple lanes of a busy freeway. Traffic includes a variety of vehicles from the period, including sedans, a large tanker truck, and other passenger vehicles. They are traveling under large freeway signs that indicate directions to places like Pasadena, Santa Monica, and San Diego via the 405 San Diego Freeway.\n\nThe environment is sunny with a clear blue sky and appears to be set in a suburban or urban area given the freeway infrastructure and manicured roadside greenery. The scene seems peaceful despite the busy traffic, likely due to the stillness captured in the single photographic moment. It's a snapshot of routine traffic surveillance or monitoring by a dedicated air pollution control vehicle, emphasizing environmental concern by monitoring emissions or other pollutants from vehicles.","title":"Air pollution control department officers checking for violators on highway","placename":"Long Beach (Calif.)","location":"Long Beach, California","nn1":["542754","542755","542761","545455","542758","553018","550191","555461","544723","550089","549894","555447","548084","542764","550182","545463"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["freeway","vehicle","traffic","driver","surveillance","tanker","pollutant","police","monitoring","scheme"]}
