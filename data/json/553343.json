{"path":"553343.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river scene with three canoes gently moving along the water. In the foreground, a canoe is occupied by a person with long hair, wearing a white shirt and denim pants, paddling with a wooden oar. This canoe is blue with a white interior.\n\nIn the middle distance, a second canoe appears, carrying two individuals. One, wearing a bright red jacket, is at the back and the other, in dark clothing, is at the front. They seem to be coordinated in their paddling efforts.\n\nA third canoe in the background also contains two individuals, though details about their appearance are less visible due to the distance. Unlike the first two canoes, this one is guided by a person in the rear with a paddle visibly navigating the water.\n\nAll around, the river is bordered by a landscape of leafless trees and overcast skies, suggesting an early spring or late autumn setting. The mood is peaceful and the river surface reflects a gentle ripple, indicating a light breeze or the movement of the canoes. The muted colors and soft lighting enhance the tranquil, natural ambiance of this outdoor excursion.","title":"The Nashua River watershed group is on a canoe outing to study changing conditions in the river around the Route 119 bridge in Groton. There is no \"pleasure canoeing\" here because of the foul odor of the polluted water.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550767","550768","553806","553345","554469","554468","547213","553409","558072","550659","554471","550774","550309","552982","550822","554609"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","river","excursion","oar","paddle","breeze","rear","person","denim","one"]}
