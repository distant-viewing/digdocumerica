{"path":"550106.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a slice of urban American life during what appears to be the 1970s or early 1980s. It features an urban street lined with a row of attached two-story brick buildings on the right-hand side, each featuring business signage. The ground floors are adorned with white wooden facades, typical of small-town commercial architectures from that period.\n\nThe most prominent signs include names of various businesses like \"Ralph & Dorothy's JanFlowers\" and \"Ann McCann's beauty salon\", suggesting a variety of services available in this location, from a flower shop to a beauty salon. The upper floors of the buildings are straightforward brickwork without much decorative detailing, punctuated regularly by windowsâ€”some of which are adorned with shades or blinds.\n\nOn the sunlit sidewalk, a young man and a young woman are walking away from the viewpoint. The man is dressed in a patterned shirt and blue jeans, typical casual wear of the time. The woman, whose long hair reaches her mid-back, wears a crop top and high-waisted black pants, also reflective of the era's style. Notably, she is carrying a large American flag over her right shoulder, which suggests a period of national significance, possibly around a patriotic holiday or during a political period where displaying the American flag held particular resonance.\n\nThe street seems quiet, devoid of vehicular traffic, enhancing the focus on the two pedestrians. The image encapsulates a specific cultural and historical moment, likely capturing themes of youth culture, civic pride, and everyday life in a small American town. The photograph's warm tones and the clear sky suggest a summer day, adding a nostalgic and almost idyllic atmosphere to the scene.","title":"Coordinated store fronts, signs and lighting fixtures are aids in the revitalization of a decaying business section of suburban Rocky River.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550114","551124","552411","551820","556221","546428","549324","545231","548399","555905","551936","551835","548504","550107","550130","552526"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["period","flag","business","town","blind","floor","brickwork","holiday","pride","youth"]}
