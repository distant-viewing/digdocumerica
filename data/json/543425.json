{"path":"543425.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image provides an aerial view of a coastal area with a clear, detailed depiction of a beach and its surroundings. At the edge of the image, the ocean displays varying shades of blue, transitioning from deep turquoise farther from shore to a lighter pale blue closer to the beach. This gradient is punctuated by white waves crashing onto the shoreline.\n\nThe beach itself features wide stretches of sand interspersed with rocky areas, particularly closer to the forested region on the left side of the image. A winding road snakes along the coastline, partially bordered by this dense green forest, suggesting a remote or less urbanized setting. The road appears mostly empty, hinting at either a tranquil locale or a non-peak time.\n\nOn the left side of the image, nestled in the forest area, a few structures are visible. They are presumably residential or perhaps small-scale commercial properties, subtly integrated into the landscape without significant disturbance to the natural scenery.\n\nMoreover, the overall composition and the quality of light suggest late afternoon or early evening, casting soft shadows and enriching the colors of the natural landscape. The photograph conveys a sense of tranquility and undeveloped beauty, focusing on the interaction between the natural elements of the coastline and minimal human activity.","title":"Coastline showing siltage from river","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["554156","557529","543088","554023","553982","554170","557466","543085","553983","545106","543427","543287","543328","548757","548785","545280"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["beach","coastline","turquoise","snake","blue","forest","locale","stretch","disturbance","depiction"]}
