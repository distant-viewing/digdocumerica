{"path":"550435.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary white wolf walking across a barren, muddy landscape. The scene is tinted with earthy tones, predominantly dark browns and hints of yellowish-green from sparse vegetation. The ground appears wet and trodden, suggesting either recent rain or a waterlogged area. Small patches of grass and low shrubs dot the otherwise muddy and slick surface.\n\nThe landscape is uneven with small undulations and ridges. Several meandering paths created by water runoff carve through the mud, indicating erosion processes at work. The time of day is unclear, but the overall light suggests either dawn or dusk, which adds a somber tone to the setting. The wolf's fur contrasts sharply with the dark, muddy ground, making it a prominent figure in the photograph despite its small size relative to the expansive ground it covers. The wolf is captured mid-stride, portraying a sense of purpose and solitude in its journey across this stark terrain.","title":"Silver-white wolf in the atigun valley.
