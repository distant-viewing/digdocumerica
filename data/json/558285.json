{"path":"558285.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a festive and lively moment inside a crowded venue. The focus is on two central figures engaged in a dance. On the left is a woman dressed in a colorful and elaborate costume, featuring a sparkling, sequined dress with patriotic red, white, and blue colors and a variety of decorative ribbons and medals. Her outfit is completed with white boots and her hair is styled upwards dramatically, adorned with a decoration that extends above her head. She radiates joy and energy as she dances.\n\nThe man dancing with her wears glasses and is dressed in a more conservative fashion, sporting a light buttoned shirt and dark trousers. His expression shows he is enjoying the moment, looking at his dance partner with a smile. \n\nAround them, other patrons of the venue can be seen either engaged in their own conversations or watching the dancing pair. The background is dimly lit, reinforcing the focus on the brightly dressed woman and her partner. The environment suggests a social or possibly festive gathering, possibly in a dance hall or similar setting. People in the background are dressed in a blend of casual and semi-formal clothing, adding to the relaxed yet special atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Polka dancing at the Gibbon ballroom at Gibbon, Minnesota 20 miles north of New Ulm.
