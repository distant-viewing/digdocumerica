{"path":"556762.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a moment around a public bus, symbolized by the logo of SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority) visible on its side. A young adult male, holding books and a binder, stands just outside the bus, engaged in conversation with an elderly woman who is partially visible as she enters the bus. He sports a casual, collared pink shirt and black pants, and appears to be listening attentively or about to speak.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes other individuals in the periphery who seem to be passengers or pedestrians. One person in a white cardigan and carrying a shoulder bag stands looking towards the bus, and part of another individual is barely visible on the other side of the frame. On the bus, through its open door, a third person is partly seen, though details about their appearance or activity are not clear.\n\nThe setting appears to be a typical urban or suburban street with a paved road, emphasizing the everyday nature of public transport in a community setting. The overall ambiance suggests a casual, perhaps routine interaction involving public transportation in what might be a morning or afternoon setting, based on the daylight and shadows visible in the photo.","title":"Passengers leave a southeastern Pennsylvania transportation authority (septa) bus to connect with a septa commuter train which will take them into Philadelphia","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["556739","556747","556809","556804","556789","556793","546735","553796","546655","556797","556743","546650","556745","556795","556746","546605"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","casual","urban","periphery","cardigan","paved","symbolize","collar","enter","listen"]}
