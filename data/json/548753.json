{"path":"548753.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a chaotic pile of discarded metallic objects. The composition primarily consists of twisted and bent aluminum pieces, which appear to be parts of window frames and possibly some furniture such as chairs. The metal pieces are intermingled and overlap each other, creating a sense of disorder. Many of the pieces have a matte finish with some elements reflecting light, giving a slight sheen to parts of the metal. Dominating colors are shades of grey and silver, contributing to the industrial feel of the image.\n\nThe environment is filled with sharp edges and angular forms due to the broken and dismantled state of the objects. No people or natural elements are visible in the image, which emphasizes the theme of waste or industrial discard. The perspective is somewhat overhead but at a slight angle, providing a view that emphasizes the depth of the pile and the volume of material waste present. This kind of imagery might evoke thoughts about recycling, environmental concerns, or the lifespan of everyday products.","title":"Pile of scrap metal collected for recycling by Girl Scouts at Islamorada, in the central Florida Keys","placename":"Florida Keys (Fla.)","location":"Florida Keys, Florida","nn1":["554301","554300","554318","554346","548109","557308","554317","554357","542585","544831","548147","547611","550265","554358","547625","549307"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["piece","waste","pile","disorder","aluminum","imagery","finish","recycling","volume","sheen"]}
