{"path":"544570.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph features a striking view of a natural landscape dominated by a large, expansive cloud formation in the sky. The cloud appears voluminous and fluffy, predominantly white but with a hint of grey, suggesting it's possibly a cumulonimbus cloud which could be capable of precipitation. This majestic cloud is backlit by the sun, casting some areas into shadow while highlighting others, creating a dramatic contrast with the sky around it.\n\nBeneath this impressive cloud, the scene transitions to a calm body of water that stretches across the foreground of the image. The water surface is moderately ruffled, indicating a gentle wind. Reflecting the sky, the water exhibits various shades of blue and grey.\n\nOn the horizon line, segments of land are visible. These appear to be small, densely vegetated islands or possibly a distant shoreline with thick, shrubby trees and vegetation that are typical of a wetland or coastal area. The vegetation is lush and green, suggesting a healthy, natural environment. The far right side of the photograph shows another small patch of land, enhancing the composition by balancing the visual elements of the image.\n\nOverall, this image captures a serene moment in a possibly tropical or subtropical environment, emphasizing the beauty and power of natural cloud formations above a tranquil water landscape.","title":"Jewell Island off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547047","550391","547352","552229","548705","545907","550604","545375","552483","552894","554399","548704","553825","555692","544530","556928"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["cloud","grey","formation","land","segment","island","water","wetland","wind","vegetation"]}
