{"path":"548837.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a serene rural or possibly semi-arid landscape, where a young boy is seen engaging in an activity by the water's edge. The boy is dressed in a striped shirt and dark pants, squatting and leaning forward to touch or play in the shallow water.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, is a structure that appears to be a simple wooden cabin with a reasonably flat roof and a dark-colored curtain or cloth hung at the entrance, substituting as a door. The cabin is situated on a slightly elevated mound with sparse grass and a few scrubs, underlining the dryness of the area. There is a window visible on one side of the cabin with no visible glass.\n\nThe surrounding landscape features sandy ground and small bushes, indicating a dry or desert-like environment. The overall feel of the image is quite peaceful, focusing on everyday rural life and the simplicity of childhood play.","title":"Colorado River on the Mexican side of the border","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["545539","548116","547727","552940","544380","544196","557409","543677","550241","553431","549105","544221","551392","544398","544207","543657"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["cabin","boy","scrub","cloth","childhood","curtain","mound","simplicity","entrance","play"]}
