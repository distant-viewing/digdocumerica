{"path":"544258.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a moment at a public water filling station, likely in a rural or suburban area. In the foreground, there is a large, circular well-like structure made of stone, filled with water. Atop this structure, several large clear plastic containers, some already filled with water, are arranged. A young man in a white tank top and green shorts is actively engaged in filling one of these containers, emphasizing the communal and utilitarian nature of the setting.\n\nTo the right, a young woman in a black tank top and red shorts is walking towards the water station, possibly waiting her turn to collect water. Her appearance adds a sense of daily life and routine to the scene.\n\nBehind these individuals, a small truck is parked with its rear doors open, revealing more empty containers that suggest this water collection is a significant and possibly routine activity for community members. A vintage red car parked alongside the truck contributes to the setting's temporal context, hinting at a time period likely in the mid to late 20th century.\n\nThe background features a row of trees and a low-rise building, possibly a commercial or residential structure, which frames the scene as taking place in a developed area where public water access points are necessary. The bright, clear sky suggests a warm, sunny day, making the task of water collection a potentially strenuous yet essential activity. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on community interaction and the essential nature of water, portrays a vivid scene of everyday life and the communal efforts in resource management.","title":"Artesian water pump","placename":"Abita Springs (La.)","location":"Abita Springs, Louisiana","nn1":["547408","549093","542535","548151","548137","546338","549841","549064","543573","544411","546380","545634","542988","543792","552703","548212"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["container","water","collection","station","short","tank","truck","turn","community","routine"]}
