{"path":"547553.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene presumably during early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the soft light and the shimmering reflections on the surface of the water. The main focus of the image is on two boats. The larger one is a fishing trawler, positioned in the middle left of the frame, equipped with tall masts and fishing nets suspended from its sides. This boat is slightly silhouetted and backlit by the sunlight, highlighting its features against the brighter light. A few crew members can be seen onboard, attending to their duties.\n\nTo the foreground and right, there's a smaller rowboat with two individuals visible inside. The rowboat appears to be in motion as suggested by the wake in the water around it. The people in this smaller boat seem to be engaged in a conversation or perhaps monitoring their activities related to the trawler.\n\nIn the background, the calm sea extends towards the horizon line, where a lighthouse is faintly visible on the left side. Further back, the outline of a landmass or island stretches along the right side of the horizon. The sea is richly textured with light playing off the undulating water surface, enhancing the overall tranquil and picturesque setting of the scene.","title":"Fishermen pull out trap nets at the end of the april-may season.
