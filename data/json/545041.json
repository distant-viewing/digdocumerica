{"path":"545041.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a quaint, picturesque house surrounded by lush greenery, in what appears to be a residential area. The composition is framed by shadows and foliage, creating a somewhat obscured view that enhances the mysterious allure of the scene.\n\nThe house itself has a rustic charm, featuring a steeply pitched roof with weathered shingles and a tall brick chimney. The front facade of the house is partially visible, hinting at a cozy, inviting porch beneath a sloping roof. Windows with small panes reflect the sun, contributing to the calm, serene atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, a garden with various plants and shrubs is partially illuminated by natural light, suggesting it is either dawn or dusk. A central pathway flanked by patches of grass leads up to a series of shallow stone steps arriving at the porch. The right edge of the frame shows a hint of a wooden fence, giving boundaries to the property.\n\nThe overall mood evoked by the image is tranquil and nostalgic, potentially capturing a moment of quiet domesticity or solitude amidst natural beauty. The interaction of light and shadow, the organic shapes of the trees and plants, and the charming architecture all combine to give the scene a timeless quality.","title":"Near the Columbia River on svenson isle","placename":"Svensen (Or.)","location":"Svensen, Oregon","nn1":["548664","558153","555632","558110","557094","553458","557068","549195","557326","550311","546439","558036","558156","557669","556426","548295"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","house","allure","arrive","sloping","shapes","charming","shingles","pane","shrubs"]}
