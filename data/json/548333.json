{"path":"548333.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This image captures a complex overhead view of a multilevel system of freeways, interchanging and weaving through one another. The scene is heavily populated with a variety of vehicles including cars, trucks, and buses, indicative of busy traffic conditions. The roadways are supported by multiple concrete pillars, creating an intricate network of elevated and ground level paths. Adjacent to the freeway system, there are several railroad tracks parallel to each other, displaying some industrial elements nearby.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, there are residential or possibly commercial buildings closely packed together, giving a hint of urban development near the freeway system. Some green areas are visible around the roads, providing a slight contrast to the predominantly grey and asphalt-dominated scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo emphasizes the complexity and density of transportation systems in urban settings, showcasing the blend of vehicular and rail traffic. The aerial perspective offers a comprehensive view of the infrastructure's scope and layout, highlighting the engineering feats involved in creating such a network.","title":"Traffic interchange system on the cross Bronx expressway","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548332","546709","544642","544634","550282","547770","553015","548358","547780","548363","546670","546726","555745","552719","551205","553838"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["freeway","system","network","traffic","scope","interchange","asphalt","pillar","weave","railroad"]}
