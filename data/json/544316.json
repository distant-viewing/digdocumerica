{"path":"544316.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic industrial scene centered around a worker, who is observed from behind. The worker is wearing a hard hat and appears to be engaged in a task that generates a large number of bright, fiery sparks. These sparks spread dramatically towards the right side of the frame, suggesting the use of a tool like a grinder or a welder.\n\nThe worker is clothed in typical industrial workwear, which includes a dark blue jacket. The environment suggests a manufacturing or construction setting, given the presence of robust machinery and metal structures that partially frame the photo. The area is dimly lit except for the light emitted by the sparks and some natural light coming from the left, highlighting the harsh and gritty nature of the setting.\n\nThe surrounding area is predominantly dark, which emphasizes and contrasts with the vividness of the sparks. The composition effectively captures a moment of intense and energetic activity within a work environment characterized by heavy industry.","title":"Navajo workmen at Salt River Project plant","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544331","554918","558304","556269","555955","544171","554931","544004","544001","556391","549694","558303","549695","549693","554864","556863"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["spark","worker","workwear","vividness","manufacturing","tool","industry","number","task","machinery"]}
