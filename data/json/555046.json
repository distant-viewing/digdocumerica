{"path":"555046.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a small plant, likely a type of sundew, which is a carnivorous plant characterized by its sticky, glandular tentacles that trap and digest insects. The central focus of the image is a single sundew trap with numerous hair-like tentacles tipped with red, glistening droplets that serve to attract and ensnare prey.\n\nThe backdrop of the photo is softly blurred, with hues of green and flecks of red adding depth and context to the natural environment of the plant. A radiant sun flare at the upper right corner of the frame delivers a burst of light, creating a luminous and almost ethereal effect that illuminates part of the plant and several trapped insects, possibly small flies, visible on the tentacles.\n\nThe overall composition creates a vivid, dynamic, and intimate snapshot of nature's intricate balance and fierce survival mechanisms. The image beautifully captures the allure and lethal efficiency of the carnivorous plant in its natural habitat, highlighted by the dramatic lighting and close-up perspective.","title":"Carnivorous sundew plants in a private forest preserve at Green Mountain, Kitsap County, Washington.
