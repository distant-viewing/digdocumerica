{"path":"544617.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene on a beachfront where modern developments meet the natural environment. In the foreground, the beach is shown with its sandy shorepartially covered with debris and the remnants of a damaged wooden structure, possibly a pier or boardwalk, leading into the water. The beach is not pristine and shows signs of wear or neglect.\n\nA single person, a woman in a yellow dress, walks along the beach. Her presence adds a human element to the scene, providing a sense of scale and life amidst the otherwise still and somewhat rundown environment.\n\nIn the background, several high-rise buildings dominate the view. These buildings are typical of coastal urban development, characterized by their white facades and multiple balconies offering views of the sea. The sky is overcast, casting a diffuse light that mutes the colors of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the contrast between the urban development and the natural seaside environment, possibly conveying themes of environmental impact or urban encroachment. The mood is somewhat somber, given the cloudy sky and the apparent disrepair of the beach facilities.","title":"Open drain erodes beach outside Fontainebleu Hotel","placename":"Miami Beach (Fla.)","location":"Miami Beach, Florida","nn1":["544621","545108","545052","546393","548051","550197","547607","546408","547034","547869","543244","551587","544989","543293","555756","553671"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","development","boardwalk","beachfront","seaside","encroachment","balcony","disrepair","remnant","pier"]}
