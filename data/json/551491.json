{"path":"551491.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph features a man seated on the pavement next to large, round planters filled with lush flowers. He is situated in an urban setting, with the backdrop showing a street lined with tall buildings and a sidewalk bustling with pedestrians.\n\nThe man is of medium build, sporting a mustache, and dressed in a striped, short-sleeve shirt and dark trousers. He is holding a hose and appears to be watering the flowers, which include a vibrant mixture of pink and white blooms nestled among green leaves. The planter closest to him sits on a concrete base, bordering the pedestrian path.\n\nThe background captures several other pedestrians, including a woman carrying what appears to be artwork and others walking past what looks like bollards and additional planters. The ambiance suggests a busy, possibly downtown, area during daylight hours, emphasising a city's effort to beautify its public spaces with greenery. The light and shadows suggest it's either morning or late afternoon, contributing to the urban yet serene setting of the scene.","title":"The city of Minneapolis Dept. of Public Works has a maintenance crew who work exclusively on Nicollet Mall.
