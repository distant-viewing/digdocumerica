{"path":"552987.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a serene lakeside setting with a sequence of lodge-style buildings nestled among dense tree cover, likely characteristic of a mountainous or forested area. The buildings are multi-storied, exhibiting rustic architecture with dark wooden siding, large exposed beams, and extended balconies or decks facing the lake. Each balcony is fitted with railings, and the roofs are gabled, suggesting a design intended to manage substantial amounts of precipitation, likely snow.\n\nIn the foreground, a simple yet meticulously arranged wooden dock stretches into the calm, reflective waters of the lake. The dock is outfitted with several empty boat slips suggesting readiness for visitors or residents with boats. On the shores adjacent to the dock, there is a blend of sandy areas and large rocks, potentially serving as a natural breakwater. Miscellaneous items like small benches and a red buoy add functional details to the area, enhancing the utilitarian yet scenic nature of the setting.\n\nThe background is dominated by tall, lush, green trees which provide a rich, secluded backdrop to the buildings, indicating the location's privacy and integration with the natural landscape. The overall composition of the photo, coupled with the clear blue sky, conveys a peaceful, idyllic retreat ideal for relaxation or vacation.","title":"Condominiums along Lake Tahoe.
