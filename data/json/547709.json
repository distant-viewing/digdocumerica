The person is smiling broadly and is dressed in what appears to be a light-colored, possibly beige, collared shirt with details on the shoulders that suggest it could be a sheriff or ranger uniform. The image is taken from below, capturing the subject's face and the underside of the brim of the hat, emphasizing their facial features against a clear sky background. The sky appears slightly overexposed, emphasizing the outline of the hat and the person's face. The overall mood conveys a cheerful and proud demeanor.","title":"At the \"junior rodeo,\" sponsored by the Parker Indian Rodeo Association and held on the Colorado River Indian Reservation","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["549045","552561","553091","549120","549122","549199","554923","557042","547759","547344","551300","547679","553710","549019","553115","549051"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["hat","ranger","person","underside","brim","face","demeanor","up","shoulder","uniform"]}
