{"path":"548235.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This image captures a serene scene at a harbor or dock. The atmosphere is slightly hazy, suggesting a misty or foggy day. In the water, there are several boats, each distinct in design and purpose. One of the boats near the center is covered with what appears to be a canopy or tarp, possibly to protect from the elements or to house goods. There is a small motorboat to its right and another rowboat in the foreground, partially cropped out of the frame. \n\nIn the middle distance, a man stands in a small boat, seemingly preparing or tidying the vessel. The background features an industrial-looking building with a peaked roof beside the harbor, adding to the working waterfront vibe of the scene. The water is calm, reflecting the boats and silhouettes subtly.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a quiet, working moment on the water, with a focus on maritime activities against a backdrop of harbor infrastructure and misty air that adds a sense of calmness and isolation.","title":"Rockport harbor under fog","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["542872","543035","543246","542905","542877","547565","548078","548247","548249","542907","542903","550293","542904","547549","546998","546939"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","harbor","tarp","rowboat","motorboat","calmness","good","vibe","waterfront","vessel"]}
