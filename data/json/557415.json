{"path":"557415.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a scenic, suburban setting with several elements composing a serene view. In the foreground is a vibrant flower bed filled with densely packed yellow daisies, adding a burst of color. The flowers are bordered by a white, low concrete wall that has a pattern resembling mosaic tiles and bears the name \"Promontory Point\" in repeated, unembellished black font.\n\nBeside the flower bed, part of the pedestrian walkway is visible, which is likely used for both walking and biking, indicated by a cycle lane and pedestrian road markings. The landscaping around the walkway is well-maintained and includes mixed foliage and rows of neatly trimmed bushes.\n\nIn the middle ground, multi-story residential buildings arch from the left side of the frame towards the center, each featuring numerous balconies, sloped roofs, and a pale exterior that blends comfortably with the laid-back environment.\n\nThe background offers a vast, open sky with few clouds and hints of a wide, open park space marked by patches of green grass and additional residential or possibly commercial buildings in the far distance. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful and orderly, reflecting a well-planned suburban community optimized for comfortable living.","title":"One of only a few construction projects completed along a section of California coastline in orange county during 1975.
