{"path":"544663.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sailing scene, prominently featuring a small sailboat on a shimmering body of water. The body of the sailboat is mostly obscured by the reflection of sunlight on the water, creating a dramatic interplay of light and shadow. The sailboat has one main sail, which is sharply outlined against a shimmering water surface that looks to be agitated either by a breeze or the movement of the boat. \n\nThe sail is distinctly marked with the number \"28\" and some text below, indicating specific identifiers or registrations, but the details are not fully clear. The sail's texture and the ropes can be seen in good detail, showing its practical rigging and structure.\n\nOverall, the water takes a dominant role in this image, sparkling with myriad shades of dark greens and blacks, contrasted heavily against the lighter and reflective areas where the sunlight hits. The entire scene is bathed in a silhouetted light, possibly indicating late afternoon or early evening, adding a sense of calmness and isolation. The background is largely uniform, focusing viewers' attention on the sailboat and the textured water surface.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["552346","544669","548118","553991","552345","544667","551539","552343","551540","545900","543941","552039","548521","547273","548117","547757"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","sail","shimmering","sparkl","myriad","rigging","black","hit","water","obscured"]}
