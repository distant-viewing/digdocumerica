{"path":"543429.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view capturing a dramatic landscape scene. The foreground primarily features a dark blue ocean with white wave caps breaking near the coastline. The middle ground showcases a narrow strip of coastal land with a clear delineation of a sandy beach and some light vegetation. A road or pathway appears to run parallel to the coast. \n\nTowards the back, the photo displays expansive fields, probably used for agriculture, presented in a rich, vibrant green that contrasts sharply with the coastal areas. Beyond these fields, the scenery transitions into rugged, undulating hills and mountains that dominate the background. These mountains are textured with various shades of brown, orange, and green, suggesting different types of vegetation or perhaps different times in their seasonal cycle. \n\nThe entire scene is under a partly cloudy sky, highlighting the natural sunlight and shadows which play across the mountainous terrain, enhancing the depth and texture of the landscape. The overall composition of the image, with its rich colors and diverse terrain, offers a powerful view of a dynamic natural environment, likely associated with a volcanic island or a similarly geologically active region.","title":"California -- Monterey","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543430","543328","554052","543434","553778","554170","543432","554171","554090","553983","553995","543435","557532","545934","543424","554020"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["delineation","cycle","coast","mountain","field","agriculture","island","strip","terrain","coastline"]}
