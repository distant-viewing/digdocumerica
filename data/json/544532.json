{"path":"544532.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image captures a serene scene set in a wetland environment, likely a marsh or swamp. The primary focus is on a small, round boat in the center of the picture, carrying two individuals who are actively engaged in some type of activity, possibly fishing or navigating through the water. The person at the stern is employing a pole to propel and steer the boat, a traditional method often used in shallow waters. The person at the bow is seated and appears to be either observing the water or handling some equipment, possibly fishing gear.\n\nThe boat appears in calm, reflective water that beautifully mirrors the vast expanse of blue sky above. The sky is filled with sporadic fluffy, white cumulus clouds suggesting a pleasant, clear day. The waterâ€™s surface is slightly rippled around the boat, indicating movement.\n\nThe surroundings are lush with dense aquatic vegetation and grasses that extend to the horizon, confirming the wetland setting. The greenery is interspersed with isolated patches of shrubs and small trees. This landscape suggests a rich biodiversity, typical of wetland ecosystems, which may support a variety of wildlife.\n\nThe far background displays a flat horizon hinting that the water body may be expansive. A visible peace and solitude evoke the remote nature of the location, away from urban noise and tumult. This image not only showcases the interaction of humans with their natural environment but also emphasizes the vastness and beauty of untouched land and water bodies.","title":"Fishing in TaMiami Canal","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553411","550000","550835","547017","546976","549417","550208","544260","546356","550988","552317","551350","554169","545969","544770","550780"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["wetland","boat","water","noise","swamp","cumulus","stern","biodiversity","method","marsh"]}
