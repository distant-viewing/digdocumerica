{"path":"550431.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and detailed image of a red fox standing on a gravel surface. The fox, prominently featured in the center of the frame, has a striking orange-red coat, with thick, lush fur. Its eyes are alert and focused, exuding a sense of attentiveness. The foxâ€™s bushy tail, with a blend of dark and light fur, trails behind it. Notably, the fox is holding onto a dark-colored carcass with its teeth, indicating that it is feeding. The muscles and pose of the fox suggest movement and tension as it tugs at the carcass.\n\nThe background of the photo is blurred with a smoky gray overtone, highlighting the fox as the clear focal point. There are no distinct features or objects in the background, just the subtle texture of the ground which consists of small, scattered stones and gravel. This setting appears natural and wild, contributing to the feeling of an intimate glimpse into the life of a fox. The lighting in the image suggests either dawn or dusk, with soft light enhancing the richness of the fox's fur color.","title":"Young female fox near Galbraith Lake camp wrestling with a turkey neck--a handout from the camp cook.
