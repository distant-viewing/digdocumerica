{"path":"548804.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic roadside setting which infuses elements of leisure and transportation. In the foreground, a coconut palm leans gracefully over the scene, and to its left, two individuals stand by the water's edge, appearing to observe the serene landscape or perhaps engaged in quiet conversation. Their attire suggests a warm climate, with one wearing shorts and the other in a swimwear and cover-up.\n\nA little to the right, a small, open shelter equipped with a picnic table is evident. A single person is seen standing in the shade provided by the shelter, seemingly looking out towards the water. Parked directly in front of this shelter is a classic Volkswagen Type 2 van, with its distinctive two-tone color scheme and rounded design, characteristic of the model's design during the 1960s and 70s.\n\nIn a parallel line to the shore and shelter, two older automobiles are parked, which add a retro vibe to the scene, dating the photo to possibly the mid-20th century. Their presence, along with the van, speaks to the popularity of road trips or leisure drives during this period.\n\nDominating the middle ground of the photo is a substantial concrete bridge spanning a body of water. Its sturdy pillars submerge into the water, leading the bridge across to a distant point out of the frame. This infrastructure likely supports vehicular traffic, connecting islands or different coastal regions, and is an integral part of the landscape indicating human intervention and connectivity.\n\nThe vast body of water reflects the bright sky, speckled with clouds, indicating a sunny day. This setting is serene, primarily featuring elements that suggest a leisurely day out near the water, possibly in a warm, tropical location given the presence of the palm tree and the design choices in the local infrastructure. The composition of the photograph, with its focus on leisure, transport, and natural beauty, presents a tranquil snapshot of life in this coastal region.","title":"At Bahia Honda State Park, on Bahia Honda Key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["546417","544554","542918","551236","557475","548743","544389","547828","548746","545849","548668","548803","548698","546412","552121","546408"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Waterfront Development"],"terms":["shelter","van","palm","leisure","popularity","water","design","drive","bridge","70"]}
