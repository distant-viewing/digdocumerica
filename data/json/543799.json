{"path":"543799.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, a human hand is shown holding a clear measuring beaker filled with water. This beaker has volume markings indicating measurements in milliliters, up to 1000 ml. The scene is taken during daytime, visible from the bright lighting and shadows cast.\n\nThe background features an outdoor setting with what appears to be a water treatment facility. There's a substantial concrete structure, likely part of the facility, with a large, rectangular water basin shown in the immediate background, filled with dark water reflecting sunlight. The environment suggests a utility or municipal water processing area, tailored for water management or testing.\n\nThe focus is primarily on the action of the hand holding the beaker, emphasizing the study or sampling of the water quality. The overall composition suggests a theme aligned with environmental science, water quality monitoring, or chemical analysis, taking place in an industrial or semi-industrial outdoor setting.","title":"Clear water at outlet of sewage treatment plant is cleaner than the water of the stream it will be dumped into.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["543812","543803","543808","549052","543811","549061","545634","549628","546275","546283","548862","546358","549611","546904","555250","543834"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["water","outdoor","sampling","science","analysis","measurement","basin","testing","volume","facility"]}
