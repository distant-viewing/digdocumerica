{"path":"547087.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a stormy scene by a body of water, likely a lake or sea. The foreground consists of large, gray rocks strewn along a narrow, worn pathway, suggesting a coastal protection or breakwater structure. The splashing waves on the left indicate rough weather conditions or high winds.\n\nThe middle ground features four individuals walking along this path. They appear to be three men and one woman, with the woman pointing off into the distance towards the left, possibly indicating something of interest in the water or on the horizon. They are dressed in winter attire including long coats and hats, suitable for the apparent cold, blustery weather.\n\nIn the background, directly aligned with the path, there is a substantial red brick building resembling an apartment or old hotel. The building’s relatively stark, utilitarian design has features like evenly spaced windows and a flat roof.\n\nIn the distant background towards the left, barely visible through the atmospheric mist, are a lighthouse and another tall, thin structure — possibly navigational aids or markers. The overcast sky and the overall muted color palette of the image enhance the feeling of a cold, windy day by the water.\n","title":"Along lake Michigan in evanston--rocks and clutter in foreground are result of recent storm","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547118","552955","551957","543242","547040","543048","553772","549338","547150","546378","543288","547180","547119","549375","549559","551963"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["breakwater","path","lighthouse","hotel","marker","protection","aid","apartment","woman","weather"]}
