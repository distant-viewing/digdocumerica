{"path":"547316.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene with a straight dirt road extending into the distance, flanked by fields and a small settlement. The image appears to be taken from an elevated perspective, possibly from a hill or a low-flying aircraft, looking directly down the road. The road itself is a prominent vertical line in the composition, splitting the landscape into symmetrical halves.\n\nOn either side of the road, various plots of farmland display different states of cultivation, with some appearing freshly plowed or planted, while others show rows of crops. The differing shades of brown, green, and tan suggest a diversity of agricultural activities. Sparse vegetation and a few trees are scattered throughout the farmland areas.\n\nTo the left of the road, there is a small collection of farm buildings, including a few houses and larger agricultural structures like barns or silos. This cluster gives a sense of human habitation and farming operation. Utility poles line one side of the road, their shadows stretching across the dirt track, adding a graphic element to the otherwise natural landscape.\n\nThe background extends into a flat horizon, showcasing the open, expansive nature of the rural environment. The lighting and shadows suggest that the photograph was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon when the sun was low in the sky, casting long shadows and enriching the colors of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a peaceful and productive rural setting, emphasizing agricultural life and the expansive landscapes associated with it.","title":"Looking south along country road east of Seward","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547354","547300","549257","549235","547350","555818","549182","549222","549261","555635","554819","556960","547321","554800","556971","548908"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","farmland","dirt","shadow","cultivation","plot","aircraft","half","settlement","silo"]}
