{"path":"556392.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a group of miners preparing to exit a mine. The scene is quite industrial, highlighted by the aged, metallic structure of the mine entrance adorned with multiple weathered safety signs. These signs cover a range of topics from cautioning against smoking and carrying open lights, to promoting cleanliness and good housekeeping as key safety measures.\n\nThe miners are dressed in work attire typical for their profession, which includes hard hats with headlamps, dust-covered clothing, and some are even wearing goggles. They stand behind a metal barricade, apparently waiting their turn to leave or perhaps just having finished their shift.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of a rugged, labor-intensive environment. The faded and rusty appearance of the metal infrastructure combined with the miners' dusty and weary expressions conveys a sense of hard work and the gritty reality of mining life. The background shows part of the mine infrastructure and tools, adding to the industrial feel of the photograph.","title":"Miners just surfacing on the mine elevator at the Virginia-Pocahontas Mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia. They will make way for the 4 p.m. to midnight shift. The mines have to work shifts and a midnight to morning or \"hoot-owl\" shift for cleanup operations. Note the variety of safety signs on the elevator gate and the prohibition of carrying matches, cigarettes or an open light into the mines. Most of the men who smoke chew tobacco while on the job.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556375","556393","556372","556340","556338","556376","556377","556337","556348","556336","556359","556374","556366","556363","556329","556365"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["miner","mine","safety","topic","goggle","profession","smoking","barricade","cleanliness","headlamp"]}
