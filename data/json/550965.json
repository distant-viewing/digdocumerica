{"path":"550965.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features a river scene with multiple layers of man-made structures. At the forefront, there's a large, dark green metal bridge spanning horizontally across the picture plane. The bridge, designed with a truss structure, dominates the upper third of the photograph, creating a framed view beneath it.\n\nBeneath the bridge, in the midground, a river flows from the foreground to the distance. On this river, a barge being pushed by a tugboat moves towards the viewer. The tugboat is dark and compact, with noticeable white water churn at its bow, indicating movement.\n\nIn the background, behind the barge and further down the river, another bridge is visible. This bridge appears to be a lift bridge with elevated sections on either side, underscoring the industrial nature of this river as a transportation corridor.\n\nFurther contributing to the industrial vibes, the riverbanks are lined with a variety of buildings, cranes, and other structures, hinting at industrial or commercial use. These structures have a muted color palette, blending into the overcast sky which casts a soft, diffused light over the entire scene, possibly suggesting early morning or late afternoon.\n","title":"Empty coal barges on the Kanawha River pass beneath the railroad bridge.","placename":"Charleston (W.
