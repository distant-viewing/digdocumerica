{"path":"554762.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river scene during what appears to be either sunset or sunrise. The river is wide and flowing, its surface shimmering with ripples and highlighted by the light of the sun. There are a few large rocks emerging from the water, which disturb the flow and create small patterns in the water around them.\n\nThe banks of the river are thickly lined with dense forests, predominantly consisting of trees which are lush and possibly in early autumnal color shift, given the hint of yellow among the mostly green leaves. The background features a range of mountains, rolling gently under a somewhat cloudy sky. The sky above is a blend of light blues and soft grays, with the clouds softly diffused by the sunlight.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is tranquil and picturesque, emphasizing the beauty of a natural landscape during a calm and quiet moment. There's a sense of stillness across the scene, typical of remote natural settings away from urban noise and disturbance.","title":"Late afternoon sun in the fall on the upper Hudson River.
