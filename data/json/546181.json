{"path":"546181.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and evocative swamp scene likely taken in a Southern U.S. wetland, such as those found in Louisiana or Florida. The image is dominated by multiple bald cypress trees, which are distinctive for their flared trunks and knobby root growths known as \"knees.\" These trees are draped with copious amounts of Spanish moss that hang down from the branches, creating a ghostly or veiled effect.\n\nThe swamp water is mostly covered with a layer of green duckweed, and other aquatic vegetation is visible at spots. Several broken tree stumps and fallen logs are partially submerged in the water, suggesting old or changing landscapes within the swamp. \n\nIn terms of wildlife, a large bird, possibly a heron, stands solemnly in the water in the mid-ground, adding a sense of life and movement to the otherwise still and quiet swamp. The background shows a denser collection of trees, which fade slightly into a mist or light atmospheric haze, emphasizing the depth and vastness of the swamp.\n\nThis setting is tranquil yet full of the intricate details of swamp ecology, highlighting the beauty and complexity of these unique ecosystems. The photograph is well-composed, with the trees leading the viewer’s eyes deeper into the scene, and the wildlife providing a focal point that underscores the swamp’s role as a habitat for various species.","title":"Cypress swamp between La Place and New Orleans","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544549","544595","546059","544585","544593","544589","544241","544545","550789","544602","554717","550788","546057","550786","546066","550219"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["swamp","wildlife","heron","tree","root","stump","knee","specie","term","moss"]}
