{"path":"552274.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a person engaged in fishing, likely in a coastal or river environment given the backdrop and type of activity visible. The individual, who is smiling, is partially obscured by a large pile of silver, sleek fish which have been freshly caught and are piled in the foreground of the image. The person is holding up a fishing net, which too contains several fish, indicating a successful catch.\n\nThe setting includes a body of water in the background which appears calm, with several boats anchored or slowly moving. The surroundings suggest a rich natural environment with trees and a relatively clear sky, hinting at pleasant weather.\n\nThe quality and colors of the photograph suggest it might be a bit dated, capturing a moment of joy and accomplishment in an outdoor, aquatic setting. The composition of the photo, focusing prominently on the catch and the happy fisher, evokes a sense of productivity and success in the activity being performed.","title":"Terry bigford removes fresh-killed salmon from chill tank at the domsea aquacultural site, manchester","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552323","545180","552321","552322","552271","551393","544256","543076","550297","552273","548190","553332","552329","543232","552118","544714"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["catch","fish","fishing","productivity","pile","sleek","date","silver","net","joy"]}
