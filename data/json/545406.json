{"path":"545406.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features a cityscape at dusk or dawn, under a warm, reddish-orange sky suggesting either early morning or late evening light. The setting is an urban center with several high-rise buildings of varied styles dominating the view. The tallest buildings are primarily modern, with rectangular silhouettes and predominantly flat roofs. One prominent building, situated to the left side of the image, exhibits a more unique design with alternate bands of windows and solid walls, and a noticeably flat roof. Right-center features a taller, shadowy building with a broad, plain facade. \n\nIn the background, a soft haze partly obscures the outlines of the buildings and a distant landscape, indicating either mist, smog, or the glow of the city lights reflecting atmospheric conditions. The lower part of the image gradually fades into darker tones, making most of the streets or smaller buildings obscured by darkness or shadow. The overall ambiance is somewhat mysterious, accentuating the dramatic lighting and the urban skyline's silhouette against the glowing sky. The quality of the photograph, including visible grain and slight blur, indicates it might have been taken with a high ISO setting or on film, adding a textural quality to the scene that enhances the mood of twilight tranquility. No human figures or specific activities are discernible, focusing primarily on the architectural and atmospheric elements of the urban environment.","title":"'Steel plants' red-orange smoke obscures Birmingham's skyline'","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["548383","555736","545499","544090","550011","548337","549970","552264","548328","544082","549620","548339","550194","550007","548384","545428"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["building","silhouette","smog","grain","blur","quality","band","roof","darkness","film"]}
