{"path":"553290.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of three men engaged in a game involving small, colorful figurines, possibly a board game, on an outdoor countertop. The setting seems to be in a cityscape, as we can observe vehicles and outdoor signs typical of a bustling urban environment in the soft-focused background.\n\nThe three men are sitting around the rectangular stone-like countertop where the game is set up. On the right, a man with long brown hair and a beard is wearing a blue shirt and has a contemplative expression, resting his forehead on his hand as he looks at the game pieces. On the left, another man with dark hair wearing a white and orange plaid shirt is actively engaged in the game, his gaze directed towards the board as one of his hands is poised over the figurines. The third man, seen only partially and sitting between the other two players, wears glasses and a white coat, and seems focused on the game as well.\n\nAdditionally, there is a McDonaldâ€™s cup with a straw on the table which adds a casual, everyday life feel to the scene. The overall vibe is casual and absorbed, with the participants deeply engaged in their strategic contemplation. The urban setting with passing cars and pedestrians hints at this being a common, possibly relaxing break from the fast-paced city life surrounding them.","title":"One of the three marble chess tables that are permanent fixtures at fountain square.
