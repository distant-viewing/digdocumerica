{"path":"547862.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image captures a bustling scene at an A&W drive-in restaurant, likely dating back to the mid-20th century, based on the design and state of the vehicles. Dominating the foreground is a large, vivid advertisement sign featuring the A&W Root Beer logoâ€”a frosty mug of root beer with a foamy head, against a burgundy background. This sign is mounted on a tall pole, firmly anchored in a modern-looking stone enclosure. \n\nIn front of this advertisement is a parking lot with several vintage automobiles parked. One has a sleek, silver-grey color; another is the prominent taxi-yellow color. The cars have design features typical of the era, such as rounded bodies and pronounced fenders, indicative of American automotive design during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe A&W restaurant itself is visible in the background, designed with characteristic mid-century architectural elements. It has a flat roof, extended out as a canopy over a service area where customers could be served directly in their cars by restaurant staff. The restaurant's facade is adorned with multiple signs and a cheerful, red and white color scheme, with large windows allowing a view inside. Staff can be glimpsed within, and there seem to be customers at a service window.\n\nThe overall setting suggests a sunny day, with light clouds in a bright blue sky. The atmosphere is vibrant and evokes a nostalgic feel of mid-20th century American life, centered around car culture and popular drive-in diners.","title":"Roadside eating on Hylan Boulevard in Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547855","551085","550093","554188","552614","555422","555438","546184","554617","546183","549113","550135","548544","554482","547866","545618"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["restaurant","drive","staff","customer","advertisement","century","service","fender","mug","design"]}
