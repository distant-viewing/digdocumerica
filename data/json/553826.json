{"path":"553826.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene juxtaposed with river transportation. In the upper portion of the image, there is an industrial complex likely a steel mill or similar heavy industry facility. The complex is characterized by multiple large structures, including tall smokestacks, which emit thick smoke and steam that billow into the air, contributing to a haze that partially obscures the buildings.\n\nIn stark contrast to the industrial setting, the lower part of the image features a large body of water that sparkles under the sunlight. On this waterway, a long barge is visible, moving towards the right side of the frame. The barge appears to be heavily loaded and is being pushed by a tugboat attached at its rear end. The interaction of light with the water surface creates numerous bright reflections, adding a dynamic texture to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition is a stark representation of industrial activity adjacent to natural or modified landscapes, highlighting themes of commerce, industry, and environmental interaction. The color tones are predominantly dark and moody, suggesting either the time of day being either early morning or late evening, or an atmospheric condition influenced by the emissions from the smokestacks.","title":"Coke plant on the Monongahela River.
