{"path":"545084.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a middle-aged woman standing in the foreground. She has short, light-colored hair and is wearing cat-eye glasses and a dark blue t-shirt with a small white or light-colored pin on her left chest. Her expression is neutral as she faces the camera, though her focus does not appear to be directly on the lens.\n\nBehind her, there's an industrial scene. A large factory structure with multiple levels and metal frameworks is visible. It's an overcast day, and from one of the smokestacks of this factory, a plume of white smoke is being emitted into the sky. The sky is bright but clouded, suggesting an overcast or hazy day. Chain-link fences are partially visible, hinting at restricted or delineated areas within the industrial setting.\n\nThe overall composition places the woman centrally in the frame, juxtaposed against the large, impersonal backdrop of industry, which might suggest themes of human impact, environment, or the intersection of daily life with industrial environments.","title":"Corinne Seel, leader of local environmental group, in front of Weyerhauser pulp mill","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556541","545442","553025","544105","557373","545447","550868","545401","545992","550328","550166","544691","551033","557215","557374","552190"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["factory","pin","link","chest","intersection","chain","woman","plume","framework","smokestack"]}
