{"path":"549449.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic landscape at dusk or dawn. The view is centered towards a valley bordered by steep mountain slopes on either side. The foreground features a field of tall, dried grass, bending slightly, suggesting a gentle breeze. The sun is setting (or rising) directly at the end of the valley, partially obscured by the tips of the mountains, casting a soft light that illuminates the sky and the upper parts of the mountains with a warm glow.\n\nThe color palette of the scene includes muted earth tones of the grass and darker tones of the mountain slopes. A hint of violet and blue in the sky may indicate the low light conditions of the time of day. There is a peaceful, almost serene quality to the setting, with no visible human activity or artificial structures, emphasizing a natural and untouched landscape. This scene seems to evoke a feeling of tranquility and solitude, capturing the quiet beauty of a remote area.","title":"Sunrise over campsite on the snake river in hells canyon","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["557519","552927","557095","557182","557575","555131","542681","556587","554634","544047","543023","550646","546749","557560","553976","557000"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","valley","violet","slope","tip","breeze","grass","dry","dawn","end"]}
