{"path":"555328.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial outdoor setting featuring a large mechanical structure, which appears to be a part of a utility or processing facility. The structure is mostly metallic, with large sections covered in what seems to be soundproofing or protective panels, possibly made of metal gratings or other similar materials. The structure has multiple levels with visible stairs and railings leading to various platforms, which house distinct mechanical components or units.\n\nA significant feature of the structure is an open ventilation system visible through the exposed sections of the grating, suggesting that the facility might deal with air, gas, or temperature regulation. The unit is raised off the ground and supported by heavy-duty metal beams, with access provided by a network of stairs and landings.\n\nOn the ground, there are scattered gravel and patches of bare earth, indicating an arid or semi-arid environment. The area looks sparsely populated or industrial based on the lack of vegetation and the presence of other utility poles and infrastructure in the surrounding area. There are minimal shadows cast, and the bright sunlight suggests it is either midday or located in a region with strong sunlight.\n\nThe sky is clear, enhancing the industrial starkness of the scene. This setting hints at a specialized facility possibly related to energy, manufacturing, or research, where the large structure is a primary component designed for specific technical or industrial processes.","title":"This is the solar furnace apparatus operated for the u.s army at white sands missile range, Alamogordo, New Mexico.
