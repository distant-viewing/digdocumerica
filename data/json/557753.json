{"path":"557753.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a rural, agricultural scene featuring two tractors at work in a field. The primary focus is on the foreground where a man is operating a red tractor pulling a red hay baler branded \"New Holland.\" This baler is actively processing hay, with a freshly baled square bale of hay exiting the rear of the machine. The tractor operator is an older male wearing a green shirt and a cap, concentrating on his task.\n\nBehind this main tractor, there is a second, similar tractor further back in the field. This second tractor is attached to a flatbed wagon that is partially loaded with hay bales. Another individual, not clearly visible, is operating this second tractor.\n\nThe setting is a lush, green field bordered by dense trees, suggesting it is either late spring or summer due to the fullness of the vegetation. The sky is overcast, casting soft, natural light over the scene, which enhances the vivid greenery of the grass and trees surrounding the field. The overall composition gives a clear sense of active agricultural work, typical of rural farming environments.","title":"Hay baling machine operated on the joseph kimsey farm at robertstown, Georgia, which is a mile northeast of helen on state highways 17/75.
