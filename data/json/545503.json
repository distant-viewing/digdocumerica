{"path":"545503.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph features an industrial scene dominated by a series of railway tracks extending towards the horizon, filled with coal loaded in several hopper cars. Toward the right, multiple rail tracks converge, while the left includes a sequence of buildings that seem to serve industrial purposes, possibly as warehouses or administrative buildings related to the railway or adjacent industries.\n\nIn the background, the main focal point is a large industrial facility featuring tall, imposing smokestacks from which thick, orange-hued smoke is billowing into the sky, heavily contrasting with the mostly cloudy sky. The smoke's color suggests the burning of materials that produce a significant amount of pollution.\n\nThe general atmosphere delivered by the image is somewhat dim and overcast, possibly indicating an early morning or late afternoon time. The overall tone and mood are somewhat somber, highlighting themes of industrial activity and its environmental impact. The scene is devoid of visible human activity, focusing entirely on the industrial elements and their operation within the landscape.","title":"Red-orange smoke pours out of steel plant chimneys","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545445","545507","550983","545434","554632","557373","550181","557375","550982","542999","557214","550168","555564","544035","556382","550176"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["railway","hopper","sequence","track","burning","deliver","smoke","converge","produce","coal"]}
