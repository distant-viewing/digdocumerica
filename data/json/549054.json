{"path":"549054.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up portrait of an older man, presenting a rugged and weathered appearance. He is wearing a work-worn baseball cap that features a faded patch which seems to bear agricultural or possibly patriotic symbols. Additionally, he is clad in a red and white plaid shirt that suggests a common attire for manual or outdoor labor.\n\nThe man's facial expression is stern and tough, highlighted by deep lines and creases that hint at years of physical labor under harsh conditions. A lit cigarette hangs from the corner of his mouth, adding to his gritty demeanor. The photograph's focus on his face and upper torso against a blurred background lends an intimate yet stark quality to the image.\n\nIn the background, there appears to be a vague, undefined field under an open sky, suggesting that the photograph was likely taken outdoors, possibly on a farm or similar rural setting. The light and color saturation bring a warmth to the image, contrasting with the toughness of the manâ€™s expression and attire.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a vivid character study, emphasizing themes of hard work, endurance, and the rugged individualism often associated with rural life.","title":"Fisherman near El Centro","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["554846","547028","547679","555529","547313","547007","554858","547282","552103","542613","547179","553091","556563","548251","549120","554926"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["labor","torso","cigarette","baseball","portrait","symbol","saturation","expression","bring","warmth"]}
