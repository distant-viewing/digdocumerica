{"path":"551244.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a large pile of refuse and scrap, primarily consisting of rusted and twisted metal objects. Among the debris, we can see parts of automobiles such as sections of chassis, rusted car doors, and indistinct mechanical components. There is also visible signage, partially legible, including a yellow element with the text \"THE JOE,\" suggesting it might have been a part of a larger sign. The background reveals a densely wooded area, with a lush, dense canopy of trees filling the landscape, suggesting that the dumpsite is located near a forested region, highlighting the contrast between the natural environment and the accumulated waste. The overall scene speaks to themes of environmental impact and the intersection of human activity with nature.","title":"This dump at sunrise beach is scheduled to be covered over","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["552740","554300","557307","554335","554318","542585","554536","545059","554320","553006","552102","554357","558084","551247","543589","543165"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["chassis","dumpsite","accumulate","refuse","scrap","automobile","intersection","speak","woode","component"]}
