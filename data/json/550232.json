{"path":"550232.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a leisurely scene on a sunny day at a riverbank. The setting consists of flat, large rocks beside the river where several people are enjoying various activities. From the foreground to the background:\n\n1. There are multiple people lying down on towels or sunbathing mats on the rocks, seemingly relaxing or sunbathing. Some appear to be reading, while others are lying back and possibly taking in the sun. The individuals vary in age.\n\n2. To the right and further into the river, there are several people wading or standing in the water. They are spaced apart, and the water comes up to about their waists or shoulders.\n\n3. One man stands on the rock close to the water; he seems to be conversing or interacting with another person sitting on the rocks closer to the foreground.\n\n4. The surrounding environment features clear blue skies with a few branches hanging into the frame from above. A large fallen tree trunk lies across the lower foreground, adding a natural element to the rock-strewn riverbank.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere of the photograph is calm and relaxed, depicting a typical leisure scene by the riverside with individuals engaged in sunbathing, reading, and cooling off in the water on a warm day.","title":"Huntington beach on lake erie.
