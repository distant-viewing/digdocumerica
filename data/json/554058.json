{"path":"554058.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a coastal area. It shows a town set against a backdrop of agricultural fields and a hilly, possibly mountainous region in the distance. The town appears densely packed with low-rise buildings, some of them residential houses and others likely commercial structures or facilities. There is a marina located at the bottom left part of the town, with numerous boats moored in neatly aligned slips, hinting at the townâ€™s perhaps prominent boating or fishing culture.\n\nAdjacent to the marina, there are several larger buildings which could be warehouses or industrial complexes. The fields surrounding the town are segmented into various sizes and shapes, indicating different crops or farming stages, with a predominantly green color suggesting lush vegetation.\n\nThe terrain gradually rises away from the coastal area, with the elevation increasing towards the top of the photograph, where the ground is less cultivated and more barren. This might suggest a transition into less arable land or possibly a natural reserve area. The overall scene is bathed in natural light which casts a glow across the landscape, enhancing the natural and man-made colors.","title":"Town of Lahina, site of sugar mill and a fast growing tourist area.
