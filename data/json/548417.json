{"path":"548417.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph offers a panoramic aerial view of a large, dense cityscape, likely captured during the late afternoon given the warm hues and soft lighting. The city is densely packed with numerous high-rise buildings, stretching far into the horizon where a slightly hazy sky meets the skyline, suggesting either distance or slight air pollution.\n\nIn the foreground, we see a mixture of medium-sized apartment and commercial buildings. Some rooftops are visible, and the overall density suggests this is a highly urbanized area. The focus then extends to the middle ground, where the buildings progressively become taller and more dense, indicating the central business district of the city.\n\nDominating the middle of the horizon line are a variety of skyscrapers with varying architecture. No specific buildings are prominent enough to serve as clear landmarks without further context, but their clustering and height suggest a major metropolitan area.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph casts gentle shadows and highlights the architectural textures of the buildings, adding depth and dimension to the urban landscape. The entire scene is framed with hints of natural light fading into the dusk, rendering the overall perspective both grand and slightly enigmatic, typical of vast urban environments seen from above.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the scale, density, and architectural diversity of a major city, providing a viewpoint that encompasses both the organization and complexity of urban life.","title":"Midtown Manhattan and Central Park","placename":"Manhattan (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Manhattan, New York","nn1":["552394","548392","549979","549971","548384","548424","555743","547429","551509","551510","553300","549477","545429","545499","548364","553673"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["density","city","building","dimension","render","encompass","become","organization","rooftop","apartment"]}
