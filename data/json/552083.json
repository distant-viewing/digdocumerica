{"path":"552083.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures a rural roadside scene in which a severely damaged and overturned car lies in a ditch beside the road. The vehicle, predominantly red with a white roof, shows substantial deformation, with its doors missing or flung open and significant dents and crush damage visible on the body. The windows appear shattered or completely gone, indicating a violent impact.\n\nThe backdrop features a serene rural environment with tall, lush green trees and dense foliage lining the road. A telephone pole and related lines run parallel to the road, emphasizing a calm yet somewhat secluded setting. The road itself is a two-lane paved route, curving gently into the distance and bordered by grass and weeds. The lighting suggests it's a bright, sunny day without any visible signs of recent adverse weather conditions, which might have contributed to the car's state.\n\nNo people are visible in the image, placing the entire focus on the wrecked car and the peaceful yet incongruent natural surroundings. The contrast between the man-made damaged vehicle and the undisturbed natural beauty around it is quite striking, adding an eerie or thought-provoking element to the scene.","title":"Trash dumped by the side of a road in Lawrence a few blocks away from the Kansas River.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["544472","549107","554302","550020","547484","553007","554303","545304","554295","552996","550016","553863","543680","547597","548751","554321"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["road","damage","ditch","shatter","dent","car","overturn","provoke","telephone","weed"]}
