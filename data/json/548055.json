{"path":"548055.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive beach scene strewn with a significant amount of driftwood and debris. In the foreground, there is an older woman clad in a bright red coat, which stands out vividly against the more muted tones of the beach. She wears a light-colored hat and carries a small object in her hands. Her expression is not clearly visible, but she appears to be strolling along the beach, perhaps examining the surrounding debris or simply enjoying the outdoors.\n\nBehind her, the beach is covered with logs, branches, and assorted wood fragments, suggesting recent storm activity or the natural accumulation of ocean-borne debris. This cluttered woodscape extends deep into the midground of the photograph, creating a chaotic texture.\n\nThe background features a slightly blurred view of the ocean, with white waves breaking near the shore. Above the ocean, the sky appears to be clear though slightly hazy, indicating possibly windy conditions typical of coastal areas.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the vibrant red of the womanâ€™s coat against the earthy browns and grays of the driftwood and the pale blues of the sky and sea, creates a stark and interesting visual contrast. The scene conveys a sense of isolation and the vastness of nature, juxtaposed with a single human figure in the landscape.","title":"Collecting driftwood in the jetty near the mouth of the Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555468","548051","555469","543069","542889","545111","545108","543075","542973","542888","542886","544989","543052","542887","543078","542890"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","driftwood","ocean","debris","coat","fragment","storm","accumulation","woman","outdoor"]}
