{"path":"548762.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a brightly illuminated day with a clear blue sky scattered with fluffy white clouds. In the foreground, there is a large signboard for 'Falnaway Bay Trailer Park' which announces that it is now leasing. The signboard, prominently displayed on wooden posts, highlights details such as \"Mobile Homes,\" \"West Side Canal Travel-Trailers,\" and a contact phone number. Behind the sign, the ground appears rugged and uneven, possibly sandy or gravely, indicative of a barren or undeveloped land area.\n\nIn the middle ground, there are several mobile homes neatly aligned, suggesting an organized trailer park setup. These homes vary slightly in design and color but generally feature flat roofs and are modest in size. This setup provides a glimpse into a community living space, likely offering basic residential amenities.\n\nThe background, beyond the mobile homes, shows no significant vegetation or trees, emphasizing the open expanse of the area. The sky, taking up a considerable portion of the image at the top, adds a sense of openness and calmness to the scene. This contrasts expressively with the man-made structures and the somewhat stark, lifeless ground, presenting a typical trailer park environment under a vast sky.","title":"Trailer park under construction at Marathon in the central Florida Keys.
