{"path":"558070.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image captures a dynamic scene of outdoor water sports, specifically kayaking on a lively river. In the foreground, a person is actively paddling a white kayak, vigorously navigating through the rough river waters which are swirling with white foam indicating rapids. This individual is equipped with a white helmet and appears intensely focused on maneuvering the kayak. To the right side of the photo, there's another person in a red kayak, further away and slightly downstream, using a single-bladed paddle. This kayaker, also wearing a helmet, seems to be steadying or adjusting their direction as they face more tranquil waters. Both individuals are clad in life vests for safety.\n\nThe background is filled with dense, lush greenery from trees lining the river bank, suggesting a remote or natural setting away from urban areas. Overall, the photograph conveys a sense of adventure and the exhilarating challenge of white-water kayaking, set against a serene natural backdrop. The lighting in the photograph hints at an overcast day, which adds a moody tone to the scene.","title":"Members of the keel haulers club kayak through white water on the cuyahoga river north of Peninsula, Ohio, near Cleveland.  The river is a favorite for paddlers because it is largely unspoiled.  It still meanders and lives up to its indian name which means \"crooked\".  The cuyahoga lies within the newly created cuyahoga valley national recreation area, a 20-mile stretch of land located between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["550657","558071","553333","554465","558069","550661","558068","549439","550653","550659","553336","553335","550663","553334","545733","549440"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["kayak","paddle","helmet","steady","river","rapid","maneuver","vest","foam","person"]}
