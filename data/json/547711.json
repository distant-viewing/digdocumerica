{"path":"547711.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a strikingly atmospheric scene at dusk, where the sun hangs low in the sky emitting a blinding, almost ethereal glow. The sky is drenched in deep shades of orange and yellow, transitioning into darker colors as it nears the horizon. The main subjects of the image are a series of electrical poles aligned neatly on both sides of a railroad track that stretches into the distance. The poles are densely populated with multiple cross arms and an intricate web of electrical wires.\n\nIn the middle part of the image, a train is approaching towards the camera. The headlamp of the locomotive is bright, creating a focal point amidst the silhouette created by the backlighting of the sunset. The light reflects slightly off the metal surfaces of the train, hinting at its powerful motion.\n\nThe foreground is relatively dark and indistinguishable, directing the viewer's focus towards the train and the electrical infrastructure against the dramatic backdrop of the sunset. The overall composition skillfully blends industrial elements with the natural beauty of the sunset, creating a scene filled with depth and mood.","title":"Transmission lines and railroad near Salton Sea.
