{"path":"553356.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph appears to depict an adult male with a striking expression, visible in partial profile and seemingly struggling or moving through thick, lush greenery. The man has a full, dark beard and mustache, and his hair is similarly dark and moderately long. He is wearing a dark-colored shirt or jacket. The expression on his face suggests he might be exerting himself or reacting to his immediate environment, possibly pushing through or being entangled in the dense foliage of vibrant green leaves that surround him. The sunlight highlights some areas of the greenery while throwing other parts into deeper shadow, adding a dynamic contrast to the scene. The overall setting suggests a location that is outdoors and quite verdant, possibly a forest, garden, or densely planted area.","title":"\"fern freaks\" follow the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["552113","544240","545493","553418","544236","542784","554846","542613","554797","552109","557032","557173","553638","557112","544632","553367"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["entangle","react","struggle","throw","mustache","push","beard","expression","greenery","plan"]}
