{"path":"545666.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of activity in a rugged and scenic outdoor setting. The key components of the image include:\n\n1. **People**: There are two individuals wearing hats, one standing and one seated, in a small boat. They appear to be engaged in some kind of task or inspection, with the person standing handling a pole or tool extended into the water.\n\n2. **Boat**: The metal boat is moored in a watery, muddy area that borders a larger body of water. The boat looks to be sturdy and utilitarian, possibly used for work purposes rather than recreation.\n\n3. **Environment**: The background is dominated by a vast expanse of water, possibly a lake or river, flanked by substantial red-rock cliffs or mesas typical of arid landscapes. Overcast skies suggest a dreary or overcast day, adding a somber tone to the scene.\n\n4. **Foreground and Surroundings**: Mud leads down to the water's edge, indicating a low water level or recent changes in water volume. Rocks and sparse vegetation are visible in the muddy area, suggesting a natural setting with minimal human modification.\n\n5. **Overall Scene**: The combination of the landscape, the weather, and the rugged work scene suggests this photograph might capture environmental research, water quality testing, or a similar activity focusing on natural resource management.\n\nOverall, the photograph documents a moment of human activity within a vast, natural landscape that conveys a sense of solitude and remote wilderness exploration.","title":"Upper end of log boom on San Juan River in Monument Valley, Utah. Boom was the site of clean-up operations following massive oil spill from burst pipeline 200 miles upstream near Shiprock, New Mexico. Officials inspect oil in waters near canyon. Two months after this photo was taken, reports said that most of the oil was off the rocks but some could still be seen on vegetation. There have been varying reports on damage to wildlife, especially the beavers.","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["544770","544260","545643","544763","547557","551538","545658","545654","545932","552283","554200","551282","544758","554661","552862","551221"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["water","boat","mesa","modification","testing","volume","inspection","rock","standing","work"]}
