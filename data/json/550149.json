{"path":"550149.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures an urban scene featuring a mix of residential and commercial buildings. In the foreground, several cars, likely from the 1960s or 1970s given their design, are parked. These are partially obstructed from view by a wall, over which only the tops of the cars are visible. \n\nCentrally located in the image is a two-story brick building marked with a sign that reads \"Prestige Printing DupliSystems.\" The style of the building and the block letter sign suggests the photograph may be from the mid-20th century. Flanking this commercial building are two American-style houses. The houses feature pointed gable roofs, covered front porches, and light-colored siding. \n\nBeyond the buildings, at the rear of the composition, a towering hill or mountain range looms large. The hillside's texture and lack of significant vegetation give a stark, imposing feel to the background, contrasting with the developed area in the foreground. The overall atmosphere evokes a sense of typical American town life set against a dramatic natural backdrop. The setting appears to be overcast, imbuing the scene with a muted color palette.\n","title":"Slag from the steel mills pushes up against homes and businesses on Interstate 77.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551071","552601","557340","550053","556333","552526","557155","554709","545618","557655","545610","550994","556766","556438","545333","550138"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["building","gable","house","rear","hillside","block","siding","car","style","1960"]}
