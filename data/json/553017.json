{"path":"553017.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image captures a busy street lined with a dense assortment of commercial signage, predominantly advertising motels, gas stations, and other services that cater to travelers. Located in a desert-like landscape with distant mountains forming the backdrop, the scene likely depicts a popular route in an area frequented by tourists or long-distance drivers.\n\nThe photograph features numerous tall, colorful signs jostling for attention; each boasts bright colors and bold lettering. Prominent among the signs are those for motels offering various amenities like kitchens and pools, as well as logos for well-known gas station brands such as Chevron and Texaco. The signs appear slightly weathered, hinting at the outdoor environment and possibly the age of the establishments.\n\nOn the street, several vintage cars indicative of the period (likely mid-20th century) can be seen. These cars, along with the retro design of the signage, suggest a bustling, mid-century American highway scene. The overall composition is dense and visually busy, offering a glimpse into the commercial landscape designed to captivate passing motorists.\n\nTraffic lights are visible towards the top right, with a green signal indicating movement is allowed, adding to the sense of activity and transit inherent in the image. The overall ambiance is a vibrant tableau of mid-20th century American road culture, characterized by a proliferation of roadside advertisements and automotive traffic.","title":"(from the documerica-1 exhibition.
