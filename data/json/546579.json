{"path":"546579.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an urban area captured during daytime. The view includes a mixture of residential and commercial buildings densely packed into a small area. \n\nIn the center of the image, there is a large parking lot filled with numerous cars, indicating a possibly busy district. Surrounding the parking lot, we see a variety of multi-storied buildings, some of which look like they could be office buildings or apartment complexes. The architecture is mainly modern with flat roofs.\n\nThe image shows several roads intersecting and surrounding the buildings, busy with cars suggesting active traffic flow typical of city centers. The streets are lined with patches of green, possibly small parks or planted areas, adding a touch of nature to the urban environment.\n\nIn the background, the area transitions into a more residential or possibly less dense commercial zone with more greenery visible, including larger tree-covered areas that signify the outskirts of the city or a suburban area.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes the density and bustling nature of an urban environment, juxtaposed with the quieter, greener areas that frame the photograph, suggesting a balance between urbanity and nature in this locale.","title":"Wisconsin Avenue and Battery Lane in Bethesda, busy Washington suburb","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["549476","546723","548364","555743","553673","551506","551509","549477","546715","546617","551510","548318","546671","546624","546616","547764"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["lot","parking","area","locale","city","nature","building","apartment","outskirt","district"]}
