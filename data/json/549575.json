{"path":"549575.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene where several clowns are resting and interacting in a public, urban setting. These clowns, dressed in vibrant and colorful outfits, are sitting on wooden planks and barrels. One clown is in the foreground wearing a purple and yellow costume, while the other visible clowns sport a variety of patterns including polka dots and stripes in multicolored attire. There's a large, red clown drum lying on the ground, featuring an emblem with a clown face, further emphasizing the theme of a performance or parade.\n\nIn the background, there's an ongoing construction with visible steel frameworks of a building, suggesting an area under development or renovation. A few bystanders, including one possibly in police uniform and another riding a bicycle, are also seen nearby, indicating a somewhat busy or communal space.\n\nThe overall composition seems to juxtapose the playful, whimsical figures of the clowns against the more industrial, gritty backdrop of the construction site, creating a contrast that captures a moment of leisure or break amidst the urban environment.","title":"Waiting for the start of the \"old milwaukee days\" annual circus parade, a group of clowns relax with a freeway construction crew near the parade Marshalling area","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["549582","549569","553282","553714","553266","556230","550076","554615","553254","546445","553240","549567","553239","553294","545454","551656"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["renovation","costume","polka","drum","construction","police","emblem","parade","barrel","performance"]}
