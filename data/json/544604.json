{"path":"544604.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a suburban area characterized by its neat, organized layout. On the left side of the image, there is a residential development with uniformly spaced houses, mostly single-story with similar roofing structures. The homes are arranged along curved streets within a neighborhood that borders a large body of water, possibly a lake or a retention pond, which appears greenish in color.\n\nAdjacent to the residential area, on the right, there are undeveloped plots of land that have been partitioned into various sections, showing stages of development. These sections resemble empty lots with different sizes and are possibly marked for future construction. The land here has a pale sandy color with visible tire tracks and sparse vegetation.\n\nThe overall landscape beyond the immediate foreground is somewhat barren with few trees or greenery. Near the top and right edges of the image, there are what appear to be construction or industrial areas with several large buildings and parking lots, indicating an ongoing expansion or development in the area. Streets and access roads are interconnecting these various zones, facilitating movement and presumably designed to support both current and future infrastructure needs.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a blend of established residential life and ongoing suburban development.","title":"Kendale Lakes housing development is constructed near the boundaries of the Everglades National Park.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544568","544600","551198","547435","549071","553934","553700","558057","553693","548825","553061","548824","556974","553937","546399","553062"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["development","lot","section","construction","expansion","roofing","land","need","plot","street"]}
