{"path":"545143.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a heavily logged area. In the center and spread across the frame is a vast expanse of cut-down trees and leftover debris, creating a braided pattern of grey and light brown on the ground. This pattern starkly contrasts with the dark green patches of uncut forests that still stand in the distance, encircling the cleared area. A noticeable dirt road cuts through the terrain, winding its way around the logged site and disappearing into the forested regions.\n\nDistinctive features of the terrain include rugged, uneven surfaces that look barren and desolate, a result likely of the logging activity. The topography of the area surrounding the clearing is lush with rich, dense foliage, indicating the original state of the now devastated logged area. The background features a hazy skyline, suggesting either the onset of dusk or dust in the air, likely from the forest clearing activities.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph underscores the environmental impact of logging with a stark visual dichotomy between the natural, dense woodlands and the grim expanse of logged land.","title":"A large area of slash remains following logging operations by the u.s.
