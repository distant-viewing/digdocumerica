{"path":"544276.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a cheerful, elderly man standing in the foreground. He dons a textured straw hat and is dressed in a light-colored, buttoned-up shirt. His face is expressive, characterized by deep laugh lines and wrinkles, highlighting a broad, genuine smile. His skin appears weathered, suggesting a life spent outdoors. The background features an old, seemingly rustic building with faded paint reading \"BAIT, TACKLE, BEER AND DRINKS\" on its facade, indicating it might be a store catering to fishing activities.\n\nThe structure behind the man has two visible windows and a door, all appearing somewhat aged and utilitarian. The building's color is a muted mix of grey and beige, with the text painted in white. The overall setting gives off a casual, laid-back vibe, possibly situated in a small fishing community. The photo captures a moment filled with warmth and joy, emphasizing a sense of contentment and simplicity.","title":"Professional fisherman","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549019","549122","548224","554845","543484","554926","547179","549120","547351","548302","552523","542613","554857","552103","550297","544409"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","bait","contentment","wrinkle","drink","straw","skin","warmth","joy","store"]}
