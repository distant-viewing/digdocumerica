{"path":"553623.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a silhouette of a person at the controls of what appears to be a large piece of machinery, likely some type of heavy equipment or vehicle. The person is wearing a helmet, indicating that they are in a setting that requires protective gear, possibly a construction or industrial site. \n\nThe background is dominated by dark, billowing smoke that melds into a dusky, blurred skyline, suggesting an atmosphere filled with dust or pollution. This heavy smoke obscures much of the background detail, creating a dramatic and somewhat foreboding scene. The shades of the smoke transition from dark grays at the top to lighter pinks and purples, possibly due to the lighting conditions or the nature of the emissions.\n\nOverall, the composition utilizes strong silhouettes and contrasting colors to convey a scene of industrial activity with an intense and possibly hazardous environment. The focus on the silhouette against the vivid background emphasizes the person's role within this challenging setting.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora, California.
