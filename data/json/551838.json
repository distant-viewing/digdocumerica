{"path":"551838.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor market scene. In the foreground, there's a prominent display of red flowers, possibly begonias, clustered together and offering a bright burst of color. Just beyond the flowers, there's a wooden market stall with a blue and white striped awning. This stall is selling various greens and vegetables, as evident from the boxes labeled with their contents and prices. \n\nOn a chalkboard next to the stall, there's a menu of sorts written in white chalk that lists prices for different vegetables, like \"Radici,\" perhaps indicating radishes, and other unfamiliar terms, indicating variety. The board is adorned with a Coca-Cola logo, adding a touch of recognizable branding to the mix.\n\nThere are several people engaged in activity around the stall. In the middle distance, a man stands at the stall examining the produce. He is dressed in dark clothing, obscuring any detailed identification. In front of the stall, a conversation seems to be happening between a woman looking directly at the man, featured in a light pink scarf, and the man himself. \n\nIn the background, directly behind this display, a storefront can be seen labeled “DOM-DROGERIE.” Some more people are visible here; one man in a gray suit appears to be entering or exiting the store.\n\nThe environment suggests a rather cloudy or overcast day, given the overall soft lighting and lack of harsh shadows. This market scene is lively and carries a very local, perhaps European feel, inviting the sense of a community-engaged in routine shopping activities.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
