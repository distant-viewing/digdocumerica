{"path":"547763.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a dimly-lit indoor scene featuring several silhouetted figures in front of a vibrantly illuminated display. The central focus is a large rectangular panel that emits a bright blue light from the edges and channels through horizontal blinds, creating a striking visual blockage except for a brilliant white star prominently centered. This star stands out vividly against the darker backdrop of the blinds.\n\nThe figures are depicted as dark silhouettes due to the backlighting effect from the bright panel, making it impossible to discern their features or expressions. They appear to be engaged in viewing or interacting with the display, possibly indicating a museum or exhibition setting. There are at least four individuals, standing and walking, spread across the frame.\n\nThe surrounding environment suggests this could be part of a themed exhibit or public installation, given the subdued ambiance and minimalistic approach to color outside the bright display.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, there is another round object on the wall, resembling a clock or another informational piece, contributing to the interpretative or educational atmosphere of the setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its use of silhouettes, bright light contrast, and simple color scheme, evokes a mood of curiosity and intrigue, drawing attention directly to the illuminated star and leaving much of the context to the viewer's imagination.","title":"Inside the \"institute of Texas cultures\" at the hemisfair grounds.
