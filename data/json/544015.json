{"path":"544015.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This image captures an industrial scene in a rugged, mountainous landscape. In the foreground, a large mound of what appears to be black slag dominates the left side, while on the right, bright molten metal flows from a tilted furnace or ladle into a containment area, emitting a plume of smoke and steam. The bright orange-red color of the molten metal contrasts vividly against the dark slag and the grey infrastructure surrounding it.\n\nIn the background, mountains rise under a hazy blue sky. The overall scenery suggests a harsh, dry environment possibly typical of a mining or heavy industrial area. A small building can be seen at the bottom left of the image, possibly a facility related to the industrial operations. The landscape is sparsely vegetated, indicative of arid conditions.\n\nThe image has an overall gritty and industrial feel, capturing a moment of intense activity involving the handling and processing of molten metal. The presence of smoke and the stark industrial setting convey a sense of the heavy industrial processes and their impact on the environment.","title":"Slag pours from Phelps Dodge Corporation copper mine.
