{"path":"544664.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling railyard under a cloudy sky. The viewpoint is elevated, perhaps from a bridge or platform, looking down the length of the tracks. In the foreground, a series of freight trains occupy multiple tracks, juxtaposed neatly and packed with various cargoes. The closest train features several reddish-orange locomotives linked together, followed by a series of boxcars, some with ribbed metal sides.\n\nThe central tracks are lined with additional freight cars including tankers and covered hoppers, and further in the background, more trains are visible, hinting at the extensive operations of this railyard. The train designs suggest this image might be historical or at least a few decades old based on the style and condition of the locomotives and railcars.\n\nThe environment around the tracks appears industrial, with patches of gravel and dirt, sparse vegetation, and utility poles running parallel to the railways. In the distant background, beyond the railyard, a body of water is visible, possibly a river or bay, with hills faintly outlined against the cloudy sky. Additionally, the silhouette of a bridge spanning the water can be discerned, adding a sense of scale and location to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the vastness and industrial function of the railyard, set against a broad, somewhat bleak landscape that conveys a sense of isolation and hard industry.","title":"Oakland-Alameda rail yards","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["556692","552063","547140","556382","556464","547265","547050","546719","545541","556783","556411","548167","551007","556852","547999","556900"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Transportation Hubs"],"terms":["train","track","locomotive","freight","railcar","hopper","bridge","tanker","series","bay"]}
