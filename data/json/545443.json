{"path":"545443.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene dominated by a large factory or plant. The factory has multiple large structures including storage facilities and smokestacks emitting thick, dark smoke into the sky. This smoke contributes to a dramatic, cloud-filled sky which appears to blend with the pollution.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a large parking lot filled with numerous cars typical of the 1970s era, suggesting this photo was taken around that time. The cars are tightly packed, indicating either a workplace setting or an event that has attracted many visitors. Toward the bottom right of the image, there is a booth, possibly for parking or security, located at the lot's entrance.\n\nThe overall setting seems to be on the outskirts of a city or in an industrial section of a town, as hinted by the distant residential areas or buildings visible on the horizon beneath the clouds of smoke. The composition and the lighting create a somewhat dark and moody atmosphere, emphasizing the environmental impact of industrial activity.","title":"U.S. steel plant - in operation 24 hours a day","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["554433","551033","550328","557218","546908","546884","546808","551057","550875","545447","549967","547531","551054","548377","550868","550716"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["smoke","lot","factory","parking","workplace","security","booth","outskirt","cloud","car"]}
