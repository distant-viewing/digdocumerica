{"path":"544186.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features a detailed, serene scene at a riverside. In the foreground, a large white fishing trawler named \"Joyce Ann\" appears prominently. The trawler is equipped with wide side booms featuring nets that are partially raised above the water, suggesting that it might be in the process of fishing or concluding its activities.\n\nThe boat lies gently on calm waters, reflecting a sense of peace and stillness. The environment around the water is lush and green, indicating a possible marshy terrain typical of a coastal or estuarine area.\n\nIn the background, a stark contrast is presented by a row of large, circular storage tanks, which are likely for oil or chemicals. These tanks are plain, with some bearing visible logos. This industrial backdrop juxtaposed against the natural and traditional elements of fishing creates a dynamic visual composition. The sky above is clear and blue, suggesting a calm, pleasant day.\n\nThe photograph is captured from a mid-range distance, allowing for a holistic view of the interactions between the natural landscape, the active fishing trawler, and the industrial setting nearby.","title":"Shrimp boat, with petroleum installation in background","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546939","544249","552806","544190","550941","547549","547553","547555","546079","547552","550942","543156","547561","544976","546998","544260"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","tank","boom","peace","net","riverside","oil","chemical","stillness","logo"]}
