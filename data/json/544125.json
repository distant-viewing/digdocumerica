{"path":"544125.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The image captures a vivid desert landscape with a large body of water prominently featured in the foreground. A white boat is the main object on the water, trailing a wake as it moves from left to right across the frame, suggesting speed and direction. The boat appears modern and is sizable, possibly used for tours or transport.\n\nThe background is dominated by terracotta-colored desert terrain, with layered rock formations and a flat topology that extends far into the distance. The textures on the rocks are rough and wind-eroded, showing variations in color from light beige to deep rusty reds. There are noticeable stratifications in the rocks, indicating geological changes over time.\n\nIn the far background, large, mesa-like rock formations rise distinctly against a hazy blue sky, enhancing the sense of vast, open space typical of a desert environment. The sky itself is a pale blue with a few wispy clouds, suggesting a hot, dry climate. The overall scene is intensely illuminated by sunlight, indicating that the photo was taken on a bright, clear day.\n\nThis setting could be characteristic of regions like the Southwestern United States, known for such arid landscapes and water bodies possibly used for recreational or navigational purposes. The composition of the photograph uses the natural lines of the rock formations and the direction of the boat's movement to draw the viewerâ€™s eye across the scene, emphasizing both the scale and the serene isolation of this rugged environment.","title":"Lake Powell","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544142","544383","544393","545636","544749","543865","552889","545740","552921","548919","545329","552902","547685","545640","544758","544453"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["rock","desert","formation","boat","direction","stratification","tour","beige","wake","speed"]}
