{"path":"552279.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene coastal scene where a young child is actively exploring a rocky beach. The child, dressed warmly in a white jacket and wearing a patterned knitted hat, is bending down, closely examining something on the wet rocks, seemingly intrigued by the marine elements or creatures found there.\n\nThe beach itself is strewn with dark, seaweed-covered rocks, reflecting the natural, rugged coastline. The water appears calm with gentle ripples, suggesting a quiet tide. The background features a distant mountain range with peaks that are lightly dusted with snow, suggesting cooler weather or a high-altitude region. The sky is partly cloudy, allowing for moments of sunlight that bathe the landscape in natural light, highlighting the blues of the water and the subtle color variations in the mountains.\n\nThis scene is tranquil and intimate, focusing on the child's interaction with nature, invoking a sense of curiosity and wonder. The vastness of the water and the distant mountains contrast with the small, focused figure of the child, emphasizing the scale and the beauty of the natural world surrounding the young explorer.","title":"Alki beach on puget sound, a favorite resort for residents of Seattle.
