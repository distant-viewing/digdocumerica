{"path":"554641.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic autumn landscape featuring steep rocky cliffs and a dense mix of trees in the midst of changing colors. The cliffs are predominantly bare with jagged textures, and sparse vegetation growing directly out of them in some areas. Surrounding these rocky formations are forests showing a variety of colors, including deep greens, rust oranges, and golden yellows indicative of fall foliage. The trees include varieties that appear to be deciduous, based on the color changes, as well as darker evergreen conifers which add contrast to the composition.\n\nThe image is shot during the day under clear skies, indicated by the bright light and shadows, enhancing the vividness of the colors. The upper part of the photograph shows the clear blue sky. The right side of the image has a partial view of a large coniferous tree, creating a natural frame for the composition. The overall mood conveyed is peaceful and natural, showcasing the rugged beauty of an autumnal forested cliff landscape.","title":"Red pine and sugar maple frame granite cliffs above route 73","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["546090","554636","554639","554642","552692","550478","554637","554638","557127","550603","554715","554640","558074","554761","554712","554719"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cliff","change","variety","shoot","conifer","forest","midst","vividness","grow","yellow"]}
