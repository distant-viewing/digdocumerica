{"path":"544283.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a view from an old, weathered concrete pier overlooking a body of water, most likely a river or lake. The foreground prominently displays large, rough concrete slabs that make up the pier. These slabs are stacked and some are in disrepair with visible steel reinforcement bars and loops of rusted metal, possibly for securing boats.\n\nIn the mid-ground, a small motorized boat carrying several people is moving away from the pier along the river. The boat creates a wake in the water, suggesting movement. The passengers are not individually distinguishable, but they appear to be engaging in a leisure activity, possibly touring or traveling on the water.\n\nThe background shows a coastline with sparse vegetation, perhaps indicative of a semi-arid region. The sky is bright and partly cloudy, suggesting it's a sunny day. The overall setting appears somewhat remote and tranquil, emphasizing a natural, rustic environment with minimal human-built structures visible other than the pier from which the photograph is taken.","title":"Lake pontchartrain","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["544266","550240","546976","543885","544770","545005","551236","545654","545658","550221","544260","549458","545057","548078","549417","545969"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["pier","slab","reinforcement","loops","concrete","boat","bar","wake","overlook","river"]}
