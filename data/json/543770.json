{"path":"543770.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph presents a striking winter landscape, dominated by a scene of thick snow and ice formations. In the foreground, there is a textured layer of snow that has a rugged, uneven appearance, including clumps of snow that look compact and slightly icy. The snow gradually stretches out towards a captivating central feature: a large ice formation that resembles a frozen waterfall or a glacier spillway. This ice formation has intricate patterns, likely formed by the water cascading down before freezing, creating long, dangling icicles and bulging ice masses.\n\nThe backdrop, partially obscured by shadow, shows a rugged, mountainous terrain with sharp peaks which enhances the dramatic and remote feel of the scene. The sky, visible at the top, is a clear, deep blue, indicating that the photograph was possibly taken on a sunny day, despite the snowy and icy landscape.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a cold and serene natural environment, showcasing the profound and quiet beauty of a snow-covered wilderness.","title":"Rainbow Falls -- the source of the San Miguel River in the San Juan Mountains","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["543656","543766","543755","544901","550420","543619","550419","550416","550408","550504","552907","543550","550413","550410","550415","542842"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["ice","snow","formation","spillway","glacier","masse","clump","waterfall","winter","peak"]}
