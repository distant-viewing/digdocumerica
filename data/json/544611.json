{"path":"544611.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph showcases a dynamic wildlife scene over water. The key focal point is a large, dark-feathered pelican in mid-action, captured just as it is either about to land or has just taken off from a gnarled, exposed root system of a tree. The pelican's wings are spread wide, and its legs are hanging with webbed feet visible, conveying motion.\n\nThe tree from which the pelican is launching is striking, with dark and textured roots heavily intertwined and extended above the water surface, showing characteristics typical of mangrove roots. These roots are submerged in shallow water.\n\nIn the background, dense greenery is visible, providing a lush backdrop of assorted foliage, presumably a mangrove forest. This suggests a coastal or estuarine environment where such ecosystems thrive. The lighting in the photograph appears natural and highlights the textures and natural colors of the scene. The overall composition effectively captures a moment of natural activity within a serene yet wild setting.","title":"Pelican in Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["544500","548728","552911","544493","544624","547593","545187","544620","544563","544559","555554","545302","548729","552909","544838","552913"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["root","launch","thrive","assort","wing","foot","strike","wildlife","leg","ecosystem"]}
