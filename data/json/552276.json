{"path":"552276.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a group of three divers readying themselves for a dive, floating on a dark blue, choppy sea. They are situated on an orange, inflated rubber raft. Two of the divers are seated on the rim of the raft, facing the camera, clad in black wetsuits and equipped with SCUBA diving gear, including tanks, regulators in their mouths, and fins, which are visible in the water. The third diver, facing away from the camera, is also in full gear and appears to be adjusting something on the raft or his equipment.\n\nThe background is an expansive view of the deep blue sea that stretches to the horizon under a clear sky. The photo highlights a moment of preparation or possibly a brief rest in the midst of a diving session. The calmness in the expressions of the visible divers contrasts with the slightly rough sea surface, emphasizing a serene yet adventurous atmosphere.","title":"Scuba divers at underwater park at Edmonds","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["549369","549347","544388","554614","544129","554613","555834","555830","555833","543065","549265","549359","547134","548675","548727","555831"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["diver","raft","diving","sea","gear","dive","wetsuit","session","rim","rubber"]}
