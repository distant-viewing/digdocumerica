{"path":"550304.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and atmospheric scene at sunset or sunrise over a body of water. The sun appears as a large, vivid, and nearly spherical glowing orb situated in the sky, slightly to the right of the center, casting a reddish-orange hue across the scene. The sky around the sun is tinged with shades of deep red and orange, creating a misty atmosphere.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a large ship with multiple visible structures, possibly cranes or masts, is silhouetted against the bright background. It is likely a cargo or industrial ship given the number of structures onboard, and it appears to be moving or stationed in the water.\n\nTowards the right, closer to the alignment of the sun, there are multiple vertical structures which are likely chimneys or stacks emitting smoke or steam. These features suggest an industrial setting, possibly a factory or plant situated near the shore.\n\nThe water reflects the colors of the sky, transitioning from a golden strip illuminated by the sun to darker tones away from the sun's reflection. The overall ambience of the photograph is serene yet striking, with the juxtaposition of natural beauty and industrial activity. The scene conveys a potent message about the environment and the impact of human activities on natural landscapes.","title":"The sun rises over Cleveland's smog-obscured skyline.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550300","551956","544707","544655","545418","548123","544247","544659","545022","548851","545438","545430","547102","548886","546114","544708"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["sun","ship","orb","alignment","mast","ambience","sunrise","strip","message","cargo"]}
