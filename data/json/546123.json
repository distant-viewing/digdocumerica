{"path":"546123.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene with a group of bison grazing in a field. The animals, varying in size and likely indicating a mix of ages within the herd, are spread out across the grassy landscape. The terrain is dotted with patches of green and brown grass, small bushes, and a few scattered trees, which provides a semi-woodland backdrop.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a pile of logs or branches, which adds a rustic element to the scene. In the background, beyond the grazing bison, there are fenced areas and what appears to be small structures or equipment, possibly related to the maintenance of this area or agricultural activity.\n\nThe overall setting is serene, with no visible signs of modern urban life, which suggests this location is quite remote or reserved for wildlife. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be taken during the early or late hours of the day, adding a soft glow to the scene. The natural and peaceful setting emphasizes a tranquil coexistence between wildlife and the minimally intrusive human presence.","title":"Buffalo herd on Bell Ranch","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["546099","552559","552558","546091","546095","546102","542626","546129","550833","542599","542628","545153","557022","554560","550380","542627"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["wildlife","herd","coexistence","hour","log","glow","animal","bush","maintenance","pile"]}
