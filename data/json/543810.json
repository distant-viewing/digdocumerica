{"path":"543810.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene, likely taken within a water treatment or processing facility. The primary focus is on a large, open water basin filled with flowing, somewhat murky water. In the foreground, a hefty white pipe, weathered and somewhat corroded, extends outwards before curving downwards, discharging water into the basin. The gentle turbulence created by the pouring water disturbs the surface, creating ripples and frothy bubbles.\n\nCentral in the image is a robust cylindrical, concrete column supporting the structure above. Attached to this column and partially submerged in the water is a mechanical apparatus, possibly a sensor or a part of a pump system, featuring a slanted metal rod and platform extending into the water.\n\nTo the right side of the photo, a man is standing on a narrow walkway bordered by a metal guardrail. He appears to be performing a task or inspection relating to the facility's operation. The man is dressed in a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, dark trousers, and wears a hard hat, suggesting that safety protocols are being followed. He is attentively using a long pole, possibly for sampling, measuring, or interacting with the water or machinery.\n\nAbove the scene, a simple industrial structure can be seen, including beams and a roof that provide partial shelter over the basin. The overall setting suggests functionality and the continuous maintenance and monitoring essential in such an environment, emphasizing utility and industrial activity. The lighting in the image is natural, indicating daytime, and casts sharp shadows, enhancing the textures of the concrete and the reflective surface of the water.","title":"First settling pond in secondary sewage treatment plant","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["547568","542982","548212","542990","549564","546904","543795","550720","545836","543653","553901","543572","543649","543804","543573","542988"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["basin","water","column","protocol","sampling","turbulence","bubble","discharge","guardrail","disturb"]}
