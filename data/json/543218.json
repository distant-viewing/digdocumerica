{"path":"543218.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, a young girl is enjoying a ride in an amusement park. She is seated in a ride shaped like a whimsical, oversized pink fish, complete with fins and a smiling face painted near the front. She is wearing a bright red sweater and her hair is styled in a way that suggests movement, perhaps blown by the wind.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoors during daytime, under clear blue skies. Surrounding the focal fish ride, there are several other similar rides in view, each shaped like different creatures or objects and painted in vibrant colors like orange, yellow, and pink. These rides are organized in a circular fashion around what seems to be a central pivot point, likely the mechanism that spins them.\n\nIn the background, other children and adults can be observed enjoying the park. The adults are standing or walking near the rides, watching the children. The ground is a solid, untextured surface, which complements the simple yet colorful setup of the child's ride area.\n\nThe scene captures a moment of joy and amusement, typical of a child's experience in a funfair setting. The light, colors, and composition emphasize a cheerful, lively atmosphere.","title":"California--Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["549711","551299","546781","547192","551295","543213","545458","552950","554455","547278","543212","549717","551297","551298","549108","551720"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["ride","amusement","child","fish","adult","blow","enjoy","fin","creature","shape"]}
