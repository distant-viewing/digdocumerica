{"path":"558368.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Truman, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene in a deciduous forest during what appears to be late autumn. The ground is covered with a thick layer of dry, crinkled leaves in shades of brown and tan, indicating that the trees have shed most of their foliage. Prominent in the foreground is a dark-colored deer standing alert and facing the camera. It has large, expressive eyes and ears that are perked up, possibly indicating it's cautiously aware of the photographer's presence.\n\nBehind this deer, slightly out of focus and blending into the darker shades of the forest, another deer can be seen. This suggests that the deer may be part of a small group.\n\nThe trees in the image have rugged, textured bark, and their leafless branches create a dense, intertwining pattern against the sky, giving a slightly somber tone to the setting. The lighting is subtle, with no harsh shadows, suggesting an overcast day or a setting where the canopy diffuses the sunlight.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo—with the deer centered and framed by the massive trunks and a complex network of branches—along with the soft, natural lighting, evokes a quiet, introspective atmosphere in a wilderness setting.","title":"Deer which are the symbol of schell's beer are seen in a deer park adjacent to the brewery, germans like their beer and their descendants in this town are no exception.
