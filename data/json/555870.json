{"path":"555870.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a devastated landscape littered with numerous abandoned and destroyed vehicles and miscellaneous debris. The setting appears to be a vast, muddy field strewn with remnants of cars, buses, and other pieces of twisted, unidentifiable metal and machinery. Various parts of the vehicles are submerged under mud, and some are overturned or severely damaged, hinting at a violent disturbance or disaster.\n\nThe ground is muddy and filled with puddles of water, reflecting a slick, wet surface. The overall tone is grim, with the dull colors of the discarded vehicles and debris contrasting with the brighter blue sky above.\n\nIn the background, there is a railway with freight train cars visible. These cars seem unaffected, providing a stark contrast to the chaos in the foreground. The landscape is largely barren, with no visible vegetation, amplifying the sense of desolation in the scene. The scene is likely an aftermath of an extreme event, possibly a flood or other natural disaster, given the muddy conditions and the randomness of the discarded items' placement.","title":"Cleanup operations on this five acre pond were half finished when this picture was taken. Dikes had been placed to separate the acid water and oil for removal. As the liquid was removed the junked cars and other debris were piled for disposal. EPA personnel supervised the cleanup which was done to prevent possible contamination of the area.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["552829","550247","555869","555871","552073","544060","555851","546173","547868","547527","553863","555544","554302","544433","555872","547888"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["disaster","car","vehicle","chaos","flood","freight","puddle","debris","placement","disturbance"]}
