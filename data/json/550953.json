{"path":"550953.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a river scene featuring a towboat actively pushing a barge. The boat, named \"Winnie Mae,\" is at the center of the frame, producing a noticeable wake as it maneuvers the barge through the water. The barge is equipped with what appears to be a crane or lifting equipment, suggesting it may be used for cargo or construction-related tasks.\n\nThe background shows a hilly, wooded landscape typical of a riverside setting, transitioning upwards from the water's edge. Residential and possibly small commercial buildings can be observed scattered along the hillside. These buildings vary in architectural style and color, providing a glimpse of a small, possibly rural community's infrastructure.\n\nThe overall tone of the photograph is slightly faded, indicative of an older film photograph, which adds a vintage feel to the scene. The lighting and clarity suggest the photo was taken during the daytime under overcast skies, which softens the colors and details. The composition focuses on the interaction between the industrial activity on the river and the serene, natural backdrop, illustrating the juxtaposition of human activity and nature.","title":"Boat passes barge on the Kanawha River","placename":"Charleston (W.
