{"path":"542841.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a deforested area amidst a dense forest. The central focus of the image is a large, cleared patch of land with visible remnants of felled trees scattered across the barren section. This clearing is irregular in shape, with some snow patches still visible in the cleared area, indicating the season could be late winter or early spring. Surrounding this deforested zone are lush, dark green coniferous trees, densely packed and extending to the edges of the image. The greenery encircles the cleared land, creating a stark contrast between the natural forest density and the disrupted space. The perspective suggests the photo was taken from a high vantage point, such as an aircraft, overlooking the forest landscape.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555145","542833","555148","542839","557001","555146","545289","556922","555085","545143","542834","542823","542828","542832","542825","553565"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["deforest","clear","forest","fell","encircle","disrupt","land","aircraft","overlook","clearing"]}
