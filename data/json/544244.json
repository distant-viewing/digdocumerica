{"path":"544244.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene at a marina filled with moored sailboats. The focus is on three white boats prominently displayed in the foreground, tied to the dock with various ropes and lines. On the closest boat, a man is seen preparing or organizing something inside the boatâ€™s cockpit. He wears a light-colored shirt and dark pants.\n\nTo his right, on another boat, a man dressed in a striped shirt and light-colored pants is also working on deck. He seems to be handling or adjusting some of the boat's rigging or equipment. Behind him, on a third boat, another person wearing a striped shirt and dark pants is engaged in similar activities. \n\nThese boats appear well-equipped for sailing, featuring clean, white hulls and decks, as well as multiple masts with furled sails. The surrounding area is densely packed with other sailboats, suggesting a popular or busy marina environment. The background shows a collection of masts rising against a clear sky, alluding to a fine weather day, ideal for boating activities. There is a general atmosphere of preparation or maintenance work among the boat owners or crew, getting ready for a day out on the water or tending to their vessels after a journey.","title":"Boat slips","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["552028","542912","546877","542871","542902","542875","544248","556191","548528","543035","552027","548078","548547","546388","556192","546853"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","marina","mast","sailboat","boats","pants","deck","owner","cockpit","ten"]}
