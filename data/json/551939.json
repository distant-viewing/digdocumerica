{"path":"551939.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street protest, featuring a diverse group of demonstrators, likely associated with the United Farm Workers (UFW) as indicated by the signage. The image shows a street scene filled with protestors carrying signs.\n\nIn the foreground, a central figure, a young woman, prominently holds up a large sign stating, \"UNITED FARM WORKERS AFL-CIO,\" with text below that reads \"BOYCOTT of JEWEL LETTUCE & GRAPES UNION PICKET LINE DON'T CROSS.\" The sign is written in bold, straightforward text.\n\nBehind her, there are other protestors, possibly of various ages including younger individuals, and from diverse ethnic backgrounds. They carry multiple other signs, some of which are partially visible with words like \"BOYCOTT\" alongside \"Jewel\" (a grocery store chain) and mentions of boycotting other products. The context and messages on the signs suggest issues related to labor and union activities, focusing on boycotting specific agricultural products to support farm worker's rights.\n\nThe demonstrators are on a city street lined with cars typical of a model style possibly from the 1970s or 1980s. The setting and vivacity of the scene emphasize the passionate involvement of community in social and labor movements during that time. The photograph captures a moment of active civic engagement, characterized by a direct approach to protest and advocacy.","title":"Union pickets the jewel food store","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551968","551938","556256","556544","553237","556255","553307","553140","556257","553321","553143","545253","543032","550077","544235","553302"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["protest","sign","product","labor","street","text","grocery","carry","mention","involvement"]}
