{"path":"548443.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph features a man holding a large aerial photograph in an outdoor setting. The man is partially visible and is wearing glasses and a suit with a pinkish-brown striped pattern. He appears to be showing or studying the large aerial map, which depicts a detailed view of what looks like a coastline with jetties, buildings, and various other infrastructure. One of his fingers is pointing to a specific area on the map, indicating a focus or highlight.\n\nThe background reveals a suburban setting viewed from an elevated perspective, with a variety of cars parked along curved roads surrounding a small central grassy island with a signpost. The road junction is modest and features typical suburban landscaping. The image feels somewhat dated, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s based on the styles of the cars and the man's attire.\n\nThe setting includes a balcony or a similar raised platform with metal railings, giving a clear view over the neighborhood. The overall composition of the photo effectively juxtaposes the detailed, expansive world within the map against the immediate and tangible surroundings in which the man stands.","title":"John vitagliano, manager of the East Boston little city hall and chairman of the winthrop noise abatement committee, points out on aerial photograph the section of neptune road and Logan airport runway 15r-33l that he is facing, looking southeast down neptune road","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["546280","556755","551898","552390","552388","556383","553945","553745","544441","555684","552366","551505","546690","543015","546696","544073"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["map","signpost","pinkish","junction","man","finger","jetty","curved","landscaping","island"]}
