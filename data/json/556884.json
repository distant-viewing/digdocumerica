{"path":"556884.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of manual labor on a railroad track. In the foreground, there are two workers dressed in dark blue coveralls and orange safety helmets. The worker on the left is bending over, swinging a sledgehammer down towards a spike on the railroad tie. His action conveys a sense of dynamic motion and physical effort. The second worker is slightly behind and appears to be holding a tool or supporting the operation in some way, with his actions less clearly visible.\n\nFurther along the track, another worker is visible, also engaged in maintenance or repair work near a small, red piece of machinery, which possibly aids in track efforts. The background stretches out into a flat, rural landscape with sparse vegetation. Notably, in the far background, there is a distinct white and red tower, likely a communications or broadcast tower, which contrasts with the hazy blue sky.\n\nThe image is tinged with the colors and granular quality characteristic of film photography, which suggests it might be an older photograph. Overall, the composition captures a moment of industry and teamwork, focused on maintenance or construction on a vital transportation route.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, position a portion of a quarter mile long section of new rail to replace the old track at the right. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556898","556871","556881","556012","556859","556899","556897","556883","556869","556862","556895","555561","556901","556872","556894","556896"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["worker","track","railroad","effort","action","maintenance","swinge","tower","tinge","teamwork"]}
