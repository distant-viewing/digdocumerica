{"path":"543130.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph illustrates a dramatic and scenic view of a landscape under a twilight or stormy sky. The setting is a mix of natural and human-made elements. In the foreground, a series of tall utility poles line the edge of a road, equipped with street lamps that are angled diagonally towards the ground, suggesting their purpose to illuminate the area. The utility poles have multiple wires attached that stretch across the sky, blending into the horizon.\n\nTo the right, the image captures a vibrant double rainbow emerging from the clouds, adding a splash of color against the darker sky tones. This rainbow becomes a focal point, drawing the eye across the image.\n\nThe middle ground features an open field with sparse vegetation and a few small structures, possibly related to road or utility maintenance. Beyond this, the background is dominated by a mountain range with visible snow patches, highlighting the rugged terrain and the cold climate of the region.\n\nThe sky itself appears tumultuous, with a mixture of dark and brightly illuminated clouds, possibly illuminated by a setting or rising sun. This play of light creates a dramatic and moody atmosphere, contrasting sharply with the vivid colors of the rainbow.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of natural beauty juxtaposed with the structured elements of human infrastructure, portraying a sense of both desolation and awe in the face of nature's grandeur.","title":"Rainbow above power lines near Mono Lake","placename":"Lee Vining (Calif.)","location":"Lee Vining, California","nn1":["543129","543123","543124","550438","545050","544836","543128","550390","553854","544119","552483","544944","543728","545375","550618","544123"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["rainbow","utility","pole","awe","cloud","desolation","splash","road","lamp","grandeur"]}
