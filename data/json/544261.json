{"path":"544261.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic outdoor scene, likely at a roadside produce stand or a similar rural market setting. It features a young girl standing in front of an open wooden structure, which appears to be a small hut or market stall.\n\nThe girl is wearing a light-colored, sleeveless dress with a detailed lace or embroidered collar. She stands barefoot on a ground covered with white stones, smiling slightly as she faces the camera.\n\nTo her right, a variety of fresh produce is displayed in boxes, prominently featuring red apples and yellow onions contained within wooden Coca-Cola-branded crates. A large, green watermelon is visible on a wooden crate directly in front of her, along with what appears to be other melons or large fruits.\n\nThe structure itself is constructed of rough, unpainted wood with some vertical planks making up the walls. It has a simple, slightly sloping roof, and there is an open doorway behind the girl, showing a dark interior and another exit on the opposite side, suggesting that the structure is small and booth-like.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with the natural textures of wood and produce, along with the informal and relaxed setting, evokes a sense of rural life and the simplicity of country markets. The photograph has a slice-of-life quality, capturing an everyday moment in a charming, picturesque setting.","title":"Vegetable stand","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544257","544192","556546","544265","553813","557757","552961","552957","551838","555377","550041","556454","544207","557843","555650","554036"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["produce","market","girl","crate","hut","fruit","wood","lace","country","booth"]}
