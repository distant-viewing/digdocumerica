{"path":"554417.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene focused on logging operations within a forest. The main subject is a large, yellow John Deere skidder or logging tractor that appears somewhat muddy, particularly on its heavy-duty tires which are equipped with chains to improve traction on rough, uneven terrain. The skidder is in the middle of dragging or moving a large log, which is evident from the position of the equipment and the disturbed earth around it.\n\nSeated inside the open cabin of the skidder is a man wearing a white sleeveless shirt and protective gear that includes a hard hat and hearing protection. He is actively operating the vehicle; his posture and gaze suggest he is looking forward where the action is taking place or concentrating on the task at hand.\n\nThe background is predominantly filled with dense green trees and foliage, denoting a lush, forested environment. There are additional logs on the ground around the skidder, indicating ongoing logging activities in the area. The setting implies a mix of natural beauty and industrial activity, highlighting the interaction between human enterprise and the natural environment.","title":"Moving logs on land owned by the Litchfield Paper Company at Tupper Lake","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554418","554419","554416","553608","542617","552201","542790","542616","542856","542624","542623","555472","553614","542769","552583","545046"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["log","enterprise","tractor","protection","logging","duty","gaze","chain","cabin","tire"]}
