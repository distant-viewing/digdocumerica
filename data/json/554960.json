{"path":"554960.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph displays a dense forest with a rich diversity of trees, prominently featuring a variety of conifers which dominate the composition. The image is filled with lush green foliage, providing a textured and vibrant look through multiple layers of leaves and branches.\n\nIn particular, there are towering trees with needle-like leaves typical of coniferous species, such as pines or firs. In the lower parts of the image, some smaller bushes or younger trees are also visible, contributing to the scene's depth and complexity.\n\nThe light appears to be natural, possibly filtered through a canopy as there are speckles of brightness highlighting parts of the trees and foliage. This suggests that the photo was taken on a sunny day, with the sun positioned in such a way that it illuminates patches of the forest floor and tree crowns, adding a dynamic contrast between light and shadow in the image.\n\nNo human activity or man-made objects are visible, reinforcing the natural and undisturbed essence of the scene. The backdrop and the focus on the forest suggest a remote or wild location, conveying a sense of tranquility and the untouched beauty of a dense woodland area.","title":"Cottonwood, western red cedar and alder along the north fork of the Quinault River in the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555114","555120","554425","542725","555115","554957","555108","543542","554589","555118","549226","546947","555116","555675","549234","542745"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["forest","fir","speckle","tree","foliage","conifer","needle","pine","diversity","specie"]}
