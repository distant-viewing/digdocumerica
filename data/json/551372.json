{"path":"551372.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph showcases a striking close-up view of overlapping leaves, highlighting their textures and intricate details. A vivid green, fresh leaf lies on top, featuring sharp, jagged edges typical of oak leaves. The green leaf has a prominent vein structure that spreads from the stem to the edges, and it appears relatively robust and healthy.\n\nBeneath the green leaf, there is a contrasting dry, brown leaf that appears to be older and in a state of decay. This brown leaf has cracks and some small holes suggesting it has been decomposing or possibly consumed by insects. The leaf's veins are still somewhat discernible, providing a delicate framework against its now brittle and textured surface.\n\nThe composition cleverly uses the layering of the fresh green leaf over the decaying brown one to possibly convey a message of life cycles in nature, highlighting the stark contrast between growth and decay. The overall image is a study in the beauty of natural textures and might also suggest themes of renewal and the passage of time. The background is dark, which enhances the focus on the leaves and their detailed textures.","title":"Oak leaves in Lake of the Ozarks State Park","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["555030","544731","543620","555178","542686","557539","551356","554744","546096","557168","557593","551357","551355","555041","546197","555183"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leaf","vein","leave","decay","oak","renewal","insect","layering","texture","cycle"]}
