{"path":"551179.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a river scene where a large tugboat is prominently displayed. The boat is moving through dark water, leaving a frothy wake behind, showing its path. The river is bordered by natural landscapes, with shrubs and trees visible along the curving riverbank to the left side of the image.\n\nDistinctive in the image is a man-made structure where water is being discharged into the river, creating a turbulent white foamy area that contrasts sharply with the darker water of the river. This effluent appears to be released from a pipe or some sort of outflow infrastructure, hinted by the presence of industrial or structural elements partially visible at the top of the picture. \n\nA barrier of connected floating devices, likely a boom to contain or control the spread of the discharged water, curves elegantly through the scene, encircling the area where the water from the discharge mixes with the river.\n\nThe sky above is not visible as the focus is entirely on the river and the surrounding areas. The overall mood conveyed by this image mixes industrial activity with natural elements, capturing a moment of dynamic movement both by the man-made vessel and the force of the water.","title":"A small tugboat on its way down the Kanawha River passes an outlet for effluent from the Union Carbide plant at Institute.","placename":"Charleston (W.
