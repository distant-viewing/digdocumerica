{"path":"549032.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an irrigation or drainage canal running straight through the image, surrounded by graded banks overgrown with grass. The water in the canal reflects the light, creating a pattern of sparkling dots along its surface due to sunlight. The canal is long and narrows into the distance, with a series of small bridges or crossings visible further along its length, creating a vanishing point perspective.\n\nOn the left side, a truck is driving on a road parallel to the canal, suggesting this area is used for agricultural or industrial purposes. In the far background, the atmosphere is slightly hazy, possibly indicating dust, smog, or early morning mist, adding to the rural and somewhat subdued aesthetic of the scene.\n\nThe vegetation is sparse and typical of a temperate or semi-arid environment, hinting at a utilitarian landscape with a focus more on functionality than on aesthetics. The overall tone of the image is somewhat muted, with a dominant palette of greens, grays, and the shimmering silver of the water. This indicates it might be either early in the morning or just before sunset, given the soft natural light and long shadows.","title":"Irrigation canal in the Imperial Valley--area of Holtville","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548896","552733","542510","558016","544658","549076","548192","558002","553083","547948","545927","542631","558011","544678","557998","553428"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["canal","aesthetic","narrow","vanish","drainage","irrigation","smog","crossing","morning","silver"]}
