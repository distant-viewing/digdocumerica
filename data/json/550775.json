{"path":"550775.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, atmospheric scene likely taken at dawn or dusk. The image shows a body of water, possibly a lake or pond, covered with patches of lily pads. The water is enveloped in a dense fog that obscures much of the distant landscape, lending a mysterious and ethereal quality to the scene.\n\nThe colors in the image are rich and moody, with tones of deep blue and purple dominating the composition. These hues suggest the photo was taken during the \"blue hour,\" that period just before sunrise or just after sunset when indirect sunlight is evenly diffused and softly illuminates the sky with deep blues and purples.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or animals, enhancing the sense of tranquility and isolation. The top portion of the image vaguely reveals the silhouette of tree lines or distant vegetation, barely distinguishable through the heavy mist.\n\nOverall, the composition, lighting, and mood contribute to a feeling of calm and stillness, inviting the viewer to experience a moment of quiet contemplation. The photograph's focus on natural beauty and minimalistic elements emphasizes the serene and almost otherworldly atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Early morning on Thunder Lake--one of the many connected lakes of the 11,815 square mile Wisconsin River drainage basin.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557572","550389","550735","552336","543611","546963","550784","551352","557569","542994","557000","554608","558095","554623","549446","555080"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["lily","pad","fog","sunrise","calm","purple","stillness","hour","pond","contemplation"]}
