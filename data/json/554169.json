{"path":"554169.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a serene tropical river scene, with key features contributing to its quaint and laid-back vibe. Primarily, a boat equipped with machinery, possibly for either dredging or fishing, is at the center of the frame floating on the placid water. This boat is staffed with at least one visible person operating or supervising the equipment. The river appears calm and broad, hinting at a slow-flowing body, potentially a river or estuary in a tropical location.\n\nThe surroundings are lush with dense palms and other tropical foliage forming a dense fringe along the riverbank, conveying a sense of seclusion and natural beauty. Above, the sky is shown in a pale, soft blue, adorned with streaks of thin, wispy clouds, reinforcing the tranquil tone of the setting.\n\nAn intriguing aspect of the composition is the inclusion of dynamic foreground elements that frame one side of the image. These elements provide an observational perspective, as if viewing from behind and partially under the shelter of a larger structure, possibly another part of a boat or a stationary dock. The silhouette of a rope or cable leads towards the upper frame, creating a diagonal line that adds depth to the scene and directs the viewer's eye across the picture towards the boat and beyond.\n\nThis positioning and natural framing technique subtly encapsulates the viewer in the setting, enhancing the immersive quality of the photograph. The scene as a whole typifies a peaceful day by or on the water in a tropical climate, highlighted by human interaction with the environment via the boat.","title":"Most recent and most controversial land speculation in Hawaii centers on this area near Kamuela.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["550989","550769","552806","557972","550000","551350","551148","550773","551221","551281","551313","551209","550831","545043","544532","551208"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","dredging","fringe","river","inclusion","technique","streak","positioning","seclusion","shelter"]}
