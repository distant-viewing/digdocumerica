{"path":"546188.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with a striking juxtaposition. In the foreground, there is a religious building identified as \"Kilgore Baptist Church.\" The church has a classic architectural design with brick walls and large white framed windows. An entrance staircase leads to double doors flanked by signs welcoming visitors to 'Miami Bible Schoolâ€™ and detailing church service times and contact information.\n\nInterestingly, directly adjacent to the church there is an industrial setting with an oil derrick visible. The oil derrick is a large mechanical structure used for drilling deep into the earth to extract oil, a highly industrial and somewhat gritty contrast to the sanctity and calm usually associated with a religious institution. \n\nIn the background, there are more industrial elements such as additional derricks and storage tanks, emphasizing the mix of church life and industrial activity in this community. The area around appears somewhat rural or semi-developed, with a broad dirt area in front of the church and a sparse landscape beyond the immediate vicinity.\n\nThe composition of the photo, placing the church and the oil derrick in close proximity, highlights the coexistence of faith and industrial enterprise in this particular community.","title":"Oil derrick in churchyard","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["545250","546204","546168","546179","546196","544272","546047","546192","546048","546031","542632","546245","545873","544512","555513","550001"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["church","oil","enterprise","institution","contact","community","staircase","information","coexistence","vicinity"]}
