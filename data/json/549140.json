{"path":"549140.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a serene natural landscape at dusk. The image is dominated by a winding dirt road that traces its way through the scene from the foreground into the distance, slightly off-center to the right. The road is flanked by dense forests, primarily composed of dark conifer trees that create a deep contrast against other elements in the image.\n\nIn the middle and upper sections of the photograph, the background consists of distant hills or low mountains, which catch the last light of the sun. These hills are lit up with a gentle, golden illumination that highlights their rounded contours and rugged texture. Above the landscape, the sky presents a beautiful gradation of colors, transitioning from soft purple and pink tones near the horizon to deeper shades of blue as the eye moves upward. The clouds in the sky are fluffy and sparse, tinted with hues of pink and purple that reflect the setting sun.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a quiet and reflective mood, capturing the tranquility of a remote natural area at the end of the day. The lighting suggests that the sun has just set, or is very close to setting, casting the landscape into shadow while leaving a glowing reminder of its presence on the distant hills.","title":"Hills and forest of Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation coal companies are seeking strip mine rights here from the Indian tribes.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["550646","545347","543024","557558","545349","556960","549449","554731","552596","557560","554403","557575","556587","544860","545402","544123"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","hill","reminder","gradation","set","trace","pink","illumination","tint","purple"]}
