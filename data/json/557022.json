{"path":"557022.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene, featuring a group of cattle grazing in a misty, rural setting. The image has a muted palette due to the heavy fog, which adds a sense of quietude and isolation to the scene.\n\nThere are four cattle in the foreground: one black cow, one black and white cow, and two lighter, possibly beige cows. They are gathered around what appears to be a pile of hay or straw, which serves as their feed. The cattle are variously engaged in eating or looking around, suggesting a calm, everyday moment in their natural environment.\n\nThe ground is covered with grass, some of which looks trampled, indicating regular usage by the cattle. In the background, the visibility is greatly reduced by the fog, yet you can faintly make out what seems to be a couple of trees and a hint of a fence or a structure — details that suggest this scene takes place in a managed farming field rather than a wild setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—complemented by the diffuse light and limited visibility due to the fog—evokes a serene, ethereal atmosphere that contrasts with the physical presence and groundedness of the grazing cattle.","title":"Farm pasturage near stottlemyer road at Lincoln road in northern Kitsap County.
