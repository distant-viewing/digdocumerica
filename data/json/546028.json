{"path":"546028.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up of a man wearing a gas mask and a helmet. The gas mask is equipped with two large filters and covers the man's nose and mouth, revealing only his eyes, which are behind a pair of glasses with thick rims. The helmet he wears appears to be old and worn, possibly a military or industrial type, with visible paint chips and scratches.\n\nThe man is also wearing a dark, heavy jacket that looks splattered with small stains, suggesting work in a dirty or grimy environment. The background of the photograph is out of focus but appears uniformly soft and indistinct, ensuring the focus remains on the manâ€™s face and protective gear.\n\nThe colors in the photograph are slightly subdued with a slight pinkish tone to the light, hinting at either the time of day being either dawn or dusk, or perhaps a result of the photographic process used at the time. The overall feeling is somewhat somber and serious, emphasizing the man's protective wear suggesting a hazardous or noxious environment.","title":"A spray painter at the Avondale shipyard wears a respiratory protection mask.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["555264","554953","555263","546032","553610","554043","556428","556867","546041","547163","544171","558312","555245","556343","556391","544128"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["mask","gas","helmet","man","stain","scratch","rim","chip","result","nose"]}
