{"path":"549730.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a detailed portrait of a young man wearing a distinctive black hat adorned with a badge featuring a decorative \"C\" and a gold anchor, symbolizing some form of ceremonial or naval affiliation. The hat also sports a symbolic blue and gold feather. The young man’s expression is stern, and he has reddish-brown hair. He wears a dark blazer over a plaid shirt, and on the blazer is pinned a large, ornate medal with an embossed design, possibly indicating an award or rank.\n\nIn the background, a variety of people can be seen in a somewhat blurred state due to the depth of field used in the photograph. These individuals appear to be part of a public gathering or event; some are dressed in casual attire while others are in different forms of uniform, hinting at a formal or celebratory occasion. One man, partially visible, wears a white naval cap.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its focus on the young man against a bustling yet indistinct crowd, emphasizes his role or importance in the event possibly being celebrated or commemorated in the photograph. The ambient lighting suggests this picture might have been taken outdoors during the day under overcast conditions, which provides a natural, soft light on the subject’s face.","title":"Old time Rifleman's meet, June 24, 1973, is held on the Greenfield Village green adjoining the Henry Ford Museum of Dearborn. \"Soldiers\" wait for the shooting match to begin.","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["558280","558270","556528","558278","556285","553710","551935","556247","558279","547437","558271","548226","548236","553176","551300","556246"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Religious Imagery"],"terms":["blazer","anchor","affiliation","form","event","man","feather","occasion","hat","gold"]}
