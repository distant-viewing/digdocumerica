{"path":"549713.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"The photograph presents an industrial setting, most likely a refinery or chemical plant. The image focuses on various components of the plant with a multitude of pipes, tanks, and towers. Dominantly visible are two large structures, possibly distillation columns, centrally positioned in the image. These columns are dark metallic and are surrounded by a network of pipes and smaller equipment, suggesting a complex process layout.\n\nProminent in the foreground is a tall chimney releasing a visible plume of dark smoke into the air, contributing to the industrial ambiance of the scene. Various other smokestacks and parts of the infrastructure emit steam or smoke, creating layers in the visual presentation of industrial activity.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate confines of the plant, there are trees and greenery, suggesting the outskirts of an urban area or a zone where industrial and natural environments interface. The skyline features additional industrial structures, hinting that this plant is part of a larger industrial district or complex.\n\nThe colors in the photo, largely industrial grays and metallic tones, are broken by the greenery in the background, and the sky appears to be slightly overcast, lending a muted tone to the scene. This image encapsulates a typical industrial landscape, depicting the operational and perhaps environmental impacts of industrial activities.","title":"View of Detroit from lasher and i-75","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["546107","551082","550329","550917","546143","545837","550996","544691","549960","550958","542705","543011","548376","546122","544700","557225"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plant","column","pipe","distillation","confines","refinery","interface","smoke","presentation","multitude"]}
