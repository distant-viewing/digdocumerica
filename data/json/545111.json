{"path":"545111.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing coastal scene. The image shows a rugged beach scattered with large driftwood logs. The logs are haphazardly dispersed across the sand, some partially buried, creating a natural, wild appearance. The beach stretches out in a arc, flanked on one side by a grassy ledge which recedes into the distant background along the coast.\n\nIn the middle and further back of the beach, there are several groups of people. Some of them appear to be exploring or walking among the logs and rocky outcrops. The ocean is visible beyond the rocks, restless with white waves crashing onto the shore.\n\nThe topography of the beach features dark, jagged rocks that seem to rise from the sand and extend into the water, contrasting sharply against the frothy white surf. The sea extends towards the horizon under a clear blue sky, scattered with a few wisps of white clouds.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes a sense of exploration and natural beauty, as human figures are dwarfed by the vast scale of the ocean and the wide expanse of the rugged beach landscape.","title":"Logs are strewn on landfill on Newport estuary.","placename":"Newport (Or.)","location":"Newport, Oregon","nn1":["543069","542889","543054","544989","543052","542890","545108","543075","543089","543287","542888","542886","551554","546961","542887","547697"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","log","sand","wisp","ocean","bury","surf","arc","driftwood","ledge"]}
