{"path":"555501.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This is an image of a young person riding a red and white road bicycle on a paved road. The cyclist wears a black jacket, blue jeans, and a blue beanie, along with dark brown or black boots. The rider appears to be in motion, slightly bent forward, focusing intently forward with a serious expression on the face. The bicycle is equipped with a black rear pannier bag, suggesting that the rider might be on an extended trip or carrying supplies for a long ride.\n\nThe background features a subdued, overcast sky with a blurred horizon that hints at a rural or semi-rural landscape. The faded and soft colors of the sky contrast with the bright red of the bicycle, drawing attention to the cyclist. The road takes up the bottom portion of the frame, enhancing the sense of movement and travel in the image, making the cyclist appear as if they are journeying towards an unseen destination.","title":"School children were forced to use their bicycles on field trips during the fuel crisis in the winter of 1974. There was not enough gasoline for school buses to be used for extra-curricular activities, even during the dark and rainy weather.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555433","551303","553515","543497","547032","553908","547389","555499","557535","550073","552340","544967","543719","547199","546465","557990"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["cyclist","bicycle","rider","beanie","road","destination","ride","supply","trip","boot"]}
