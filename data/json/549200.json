{"path":"549200.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene where two children are interacting with a young calf in a lush, outdoor setting. The rural landscape is expansive, characterized by rolling hills, wide open fields, and a cloudy sky that dominates the background, suggesting an early morning or cloudy day atmosphere.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a young child, appearing to be a boy, is dressed in a dark blue jacket with a hat, watching intently as the other child, in the center, feeds the calf. This child, also appearing to be a boy, wears a light brown cowboy hat and a brown jacket, giving an impression of rural life and possibly farming activities. He is holding a large bottle with a teat, feeding the black and white calf that eagerly drinks from it.\n\nThe calf, which is predominantly black with a distinctive white pattern on its face and front, is securely tethered, looking up while it feeds. The lush green grass around them is dotted with patches of other vegetation, indicating a healthy, natural environment. In the background, a wooden post, possibly part of a fence, subtly suggests the boundaries of a farm.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on the interaction between the children and the calf amidst a serene landscape, evokes themes of nurturing, rural lifestyle, and the simplicity of country life.","title":"Calf-feeding time at the bud redding ranch.
