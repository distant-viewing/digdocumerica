{"path":"543170.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph features a large, dark, cylindrical pipe running diagonally across the frame from the bottom left corner to the upper right corner. The pipe is situated in a rocky natural setting that appears wet or moss-covered, suggesting it might be close to a water source or in a damp environment. The sunlight illuminates part of the rocks and the top of the pipe, highlighting their textures and creating a contrast with the shadows in the scene. The background contains more rocks, and the overall environment gives the impression of a rugged and possibly coastal area. There's no visible activity or people in the image, focusing entirely on the interaction between the man-made object and the natural surroundings. The atmosphere is calm but stark, emphasizing the intrusion of industrial elements into natural spaces.","title":"Pipe leading out to pacific ocean","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543759","549000","547121","545615","553902","553467","552134","543154","552254","548932","549118","545167","542528","546002","554041","543257"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pipe","corner","intrusion","rock","moss","source","contain","bottom","impression","situate"]}
