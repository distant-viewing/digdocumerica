{"path":"545605.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic outdoor setting juxtaposing human activity with natural landscapes. In the forefront, a paved area hosts several recreational vehicles (RVs) and a pickup truck, suggesting a camping ground or RV park. This area is interspersed with young trees and shrubs, highlighting human habitation within a natural environment.\n\nDominating the middle ground are unique geological formationsâ€”large red rock formations that are round and bulbous, typical of erosion patterns found in arid regions. These formations are characteristic of the American Southwest, giving the scene a distinctive and rugged appeal.\n\nIn the background, contrasting sharply with the red rocks, are distant mountains capped with snow, suggesting this photograph was taken during a period when higher elevations still retain winter's remnants. The sky is clear and bright, indicating a sunny day and adding vividness to the overall landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph blends elements of nature with hints of human presence, showcasing the beauty and recreational use of such natural settings.","title":"Devil's Garden Campground","placename":"Arches National Park (Utah)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545601","544429","545797","545791","545804","543838","544745","544392","544341","544950","545754","545596","545761","545696","544453","545805"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["formation","pickup","rock","camping","appeal","vividness","elevation","habitation","outdoor","remnant"]}
