{"path":"543353.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from a historic, seemingly abandoned town. The central focus is an old wooden church with a distinct steeple and bell tower, showing signs of wear and neglect but still standing prominently. The architecture of the church includes a large central window and a double-door entrance. Surrounding the church are several rustic wooden buildings in various states of decay, likely once homes or businesses related to the town's heyday.\n\nThe landscape around these structures is covered with patches of grass and wild shrubs, indicative of a dry or semi-arid climate. A dirt path winds through the foreground leading towards the church and beyond, suggesting this was once a main thoroughfare. The backdrop is dominated by a hill, sparse with vegetation, giving a sense of isolation and emphasizing the desolate charm of the scene.\n\nAdditionally, there is a solitary figure walking near the church, providing a sense of scale and a hint at the human element despite the overall scene of abandonment. His presence adds a narrative element to the image, perhaps suggesting a visitor or a former resident reminiscing. The entirety of the photograph has a nostalgic and serene quality, frozen in time and encapsulating a slice of history.","title":"\"Ghost\" town","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543349","545813","554000","553999","543367","543351","556480","554035","545366","553327","543342","547440","558034","558023","558024","546455"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["church","town","entirety","thoroughfare","steeple","bell","resident","history","slice","charm"]}
