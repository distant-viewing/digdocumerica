{"path":"542559.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a man engaged in the activity of fly fishing at night. He is standing in an upright position, facing away from the camera, enabling a view from behind. The man is dressed in casual outdoor attire, which includes a long-sleeve shirt and pants. He is holding a fishing rod, and one can observe the line extending into a smooth arc above and in front of him, illuminated against the dark background.\n\nThe background is uniformly dark, enhancing the contrast with the glowing fishing line and emphasizing the silhouette of the fisherman. This setup suggests that the photo was taken under low light conditions, possibly using a long exposure to capture the line's movement through the air.\n\nThere is minimal visible detail in the environment around the man, due to the darkness enveloping the scene. This simplicity in composition draws attention primarily to the curve of the fishing line and the fisherman's interaction with his equipment. The photograph captures a peaceful yet dynamic moment, focusing on the graceful motion of fly fishing.","title":"Fly fisherman","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["554519","550313","552314","550666","550317","550665","543659","544714","552122","542529","543753","553339","547723","554520","553337","553338"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["fishing","fly","fisherman","line","arc","darkness","rod","night","man","simplicity"]}
