{"path":"554282.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This image captures a snowy scene filled with people engaged in winter sports activities, centered around a red and blue ski bus. The bus, located on the left side of the image, features a sleek design with large windows and its door open, suggesting it has just arrived or is ready for departure.\n\nThe scene is bustling with activity as a group of people, mostly dressed in vibrant, colorful ski wear typical of past decades, are either exiting the bus or preparing for ski activities. There are both male and female adults visible, all clad in typical skiing attire such as padded jackets, ski pants, and some with ski poles in hand. Their outfits are diverse in color, ranging from bright reds and blues to more muted greens and yellows, which adds a lively and cheerful element to the snowy environment.\n\nIn the background, modernist architecture is visible, likely a ski resort or related facilities characterized by flat roofs and clean lines, which are partially obscured by falling snow. The overall atmosphere is lively and indicative of a busy ski resort bustling with enthusiasts eager to engage in winter sports.\n\nThe photo has a nostalgic quality, likely due to its era-specific clothing and ski equipment style, as well as the photographic quality and color saturation typical of film from several decades ago. The snowy setting contributes to a sense of winter adventure and recreational enjoyment.","title":"Free shuttle bus takes skiers the two miles from Lionshead Mountain to Vail Village.","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554240","554263","554238","554262","554279","554244","554243","554235","554275","554245","554221","554276","554261","554267","554236","554237"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["ski","bus","winter","resort","decade","sport","departure","skiing","enthusiast","quality"]}
