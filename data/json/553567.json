{"path":"553567.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a densely forested landscape. The terrain is heavily covered with trees, predominately coniferous, with varying hues of green and some hints of brown, suggesting either seasonal changes or variations in vegetation types. The landscape is diverse, featuring rolling hills with different elevations that give the forest texture and depth.\n\nThere are no apparent structures, roads, or human activities visible in the image, emphasizing the untouched and natural state of the area. The lighting in the photograph hints at either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft and diffuse light that casts gentle shadows and slightly mutes the colors of the forest. The horizon visible in the distance under a clear sky adds to the sense of vast, open wilderness stretching beyond the frame. This photo conveys a sense of serene isolation and the expansive beauty of a natural forest ecosystem.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora burn area \"granite fire\" seen from the air.
