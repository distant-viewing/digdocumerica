{"path":"551535.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor scene involving water activities. At the focal point of the image, two people in a red canoe are visible on a body of water, likely a river. One person, positioned at the stern, is engaging in paddling, while the other one, sitting at the bow, seems to be observing the surroundings or taking a break.\n\nThey appear to be nearing or moving away from a large, dark, circular tunnel structure that is jutting out into the water from a metal or wooden retaining wall. The tunnel is large enough to potentially accommodate the canoe if they chose to paddle through it.\n\nThe surrounding environment is lush and green, indicating a vibrant, natural setting. On one side of the tunnel, dense greenery and bushes speckled with white flowers are evident. This adds a touch of scenic beauty and tranquility to the apparent adventure or exploration theme captured in the photo.\n\nOverall, the composition is a mixture of human activity, the stark presence of human-made infrastructure merging with natural elements, and scenic beauty, creating a narrative of exploration and interaction with nature.","title":"Huge culvert discharges an acrid smelling liquid into the Mississippi River.","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["550659","553806","549996","550663","558065","550772","558072","553345","555219","544759","550822","553409","551518","550980","550309","550767"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["tunnel","canoe","exploration","near","choose","accommodate","retain","speckle","jut","paddle"]}
