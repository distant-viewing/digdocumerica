{"path":"542682.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on an urban expressway during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the warm, muted tones pervading the atmosphere. The image is slightly grainy, possibly denoting older photographic technology or the effect of air pollution or haze.\n\nIn the foreground, we observe multiple lanes of a curving road filled with cars. There are several vehicles in motion, predominantly cars identifiable by their varied designs and sizes typical of consumer automobiles from perhaps the 1970s to 1980s.\n\nA prominent concrete overpass crosses the highway in the middle ground, adding a structural element to the scene. Beyond the overpass, two high-rise buildings with construction scaffolding around them suggest ongoing urban development. These skyscrapers are somewhat obscured by the atmospheric conditions, perhaps smog or mist, which adds a layer of depth and a sense of distance to the view.\n\nOverall, this image illustrates a busy urban environment with elements of construction and transportation highlighting growth and daily activity. The quality of the air and the subdued lighting contribute to a slightly melancholic or nostalgic tone.","title":"'Low-hanging smog'","placename":"San Gabriel (Calif.)","location":"San Gabriel, California","nn1":["545451","553721","545432","553020","545467","553021","550175","553475","556194","549857","545463","549890","547811","546670","550182","557230"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["overpass","air","consumer","scaffolding","construction","automobile","sunrise","technology","skyscraper","lane"]}
