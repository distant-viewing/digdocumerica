{"path":"551916.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor scene focused on a male individual seated at a control panel. The setting appears to be a command or control room, characterized by advanced technological equipment.\n\nThe man, who is seated at the left side of the frame, is interacting with a control panel laid out before him filled with various buttons and switches, which suggests that he might be monitoring or controlling something. He appears focused on his task, radiating an air of concentration and professionalism.\n\nBehind the man is a large, brightly lit wall map that dominates the background. This map features various geometric shapes in different colors, representing different regions, with lines connecting these areas. There are illuminated points on the map, possibly indicating locations or statuses in real-time, adding a dynamic element to the scene.\n\nTo the right side of the photograph, a bank of monochrome monitors is installed into the wall. Each monitor displays different visual content, likely live feeds from cameras or other input sources relevant to the map's depicted locations. This arrangement suggests a comprehensive surveillance or monitoring system.\n\nThe ambiance of the room is dimly lit, focused mainly on the map and the control panel, which highlights the importance of these elements in the man's activities. The overall composition emphasizes a theme of surveillance, control, and communication, typical of a strategic command center environment.","title":"Police officer on duty in the electronic traffic control room","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551896","551904","551902","557394","551905","551903","551898","556384","551901","547720","551900","542668","549378","545943","555334","542765"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["map","control","monitor","surveillance","command","panel","room","professionalism","status","switch"]}
