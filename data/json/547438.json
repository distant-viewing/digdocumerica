{"path":"547438.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of people gathered together, possibly in an audience at an event, such as a sports game or concert. The focus is on a middle-aged man wearing a light-colored bucket hat and sunglasses, looking upwards with a slightly concerned or contemplative expression. In front of him is an older woman, seen from behind, with wavy grey hair. \n\nIn the slightly blurred background, multiple other individuals can be spotted, suggesting a crowded setting. Visible individuals include a young man and a child, both with light hair and glasses, situated towards the right side of the frame. Another man sporting a red hat and a red shirt appears towards the left of the frame. The lighting in the scene is soft, contributing to the somewhat somber mood conveyed by the expressions and dimly lit ambiance of the setting. The range of ages and casual attire of the audience suggest the event is informal and intended for general public enjoyment.","title":"At the annual intra-mural football game of the University of Nebraska, one of the biggest sports events of the year","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["558291","558393","551808","553275","543482","547437","547285","551814","557054","553757","551011","547441","548557","547442","558295","547434"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["audience","sport","concert","event","hat","hair","intend","game","expression","bucket"]}
