{"path":"551070.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling street scene in a small town framed by a mountainous backdrop, likely captured in the mid to late 20th century based on the style of vehicles and advertisements. The street is lined with various commercial signs from recognizable petroleum companies such as Gulf and Texaco, indicating a prevalence of gas stations and automotive services.\n\nOn the left, a series of storefronts with prominent signs can be seen, though the exact nature of the businesses is not clear due to the distance. The roadway is busy with vehicle traffic including cars and trucks typical of the era, highlighting a mixture of sedans and pick-up trucks.\n\nA notable feature in the image is the long train of tanker railcars parked on tracks parallel to the road on the right, suggesting the town's proximity to industrial or freight transportation routes.\n\nThe foreground shows pedestrians interacting near the roadside, with one man walking towards the street and another perhaps engaging with a parked vehicle, possibly in conversation or exchanging items.\n\nThe photograph captures a sense of everyday life in this community, emphasizing both the industrial and commercial aspects intertwined with local transportation and pedestrian activity. The overall environment is slightly hazy, perhaps due to weather conditions or air quality, contributing to a nostalgic feel.","title":"Dupont Avenue in downtown West Belle","placename":"Charleston (W.
