{"path":"551890.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling scene inside what appears to be an urban subway or train station. The picture is taken from a perspective that shows the entrance or exit with automated turnstiles aligned in rows. Each turnstile has a letter sign attachedâ€”visible signs read \"E\".\n\nPeople are shown in various modes of transit through the station. In the foreground, a woman dressed in a white coat and black shoes is seen entering a turnstile, holding a black bag in one hand. To the left and right, other commuters are either approaching or moving away from the turnstiles. The individuals are diverse in terms of ages and attire, suggesting a wide range of destinations and purposes for their travel. Some carry bags or briefcases, likely indicating they are either starting or finishing their workday.\n\nThe station itself has a modern look for its time, with clean lines, minimalistic structures, and functional design. The flooring is tiled, and the ceiling features strip lighting that runs parallel to the turnstiles, illuminating the area brightly. Beyond the turnstiles, the station extends into a larger, open area where other passengers are scattered, some walking and some standing.\n\nOverall, the setting is one of daily routine and the photograph captures a typical moment of urban life, emphasizing movement and the flow of people in public transportation settings.","title":"At this station trains are entered from one side, while departures are made from the opposite side.
