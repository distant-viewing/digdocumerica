{"path":"548630.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a coastal landscape, probably of an island or a group of islands. The islands are characterized by patches of green vegetation, possibly shrubbery or low trees, and are surrounded by sandy beaches that appear light in color. The water around the islands varies in color from a dark blue indicative of deeper water, to lighter turquoise shades that typically represent shallower areas near the shore or sandbanks.\n\nOther islands are visible in the distance, adding to the sense of this location being part of a larger archipelago. There are no visible structures or human activity in the immediate area covered by the photograph, giving it an untouched, natural appearance. The overall atmosphere is serene, dominated by natural elements of land and water.","title":"Long Key State Park, midway between Key Largo and Key West","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["550358","548785","548605","548604","548786","554171","550359","554023","544596","554170","552887","548787","557466","551573","544554","553983"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["island","sandbank","shrubbery","represent","water","beach","shore","offer","land","appearance"]}
