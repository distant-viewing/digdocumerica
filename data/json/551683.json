{"path":"551683.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a whimsical bronze sculpture depicting characters from Alice in Wonderland, located in a park setting. The sculpture features several distinct figures: Alice, who sits atop a large mushroom, observes the scene; the Mad Hatter, identifiable by his oversized top hat and distinctive attire, stands prominently; and the March Hare appears in mid-motion. These main characters are surrounded by other smaller, fantastical elements and creatures that add to the enchanting theme of the sculpture.\n\nIn the background, a lush, green environment with trees and a well-maintained lawn hints at a well-visited public park. The city skyline, with modern high-rise buildings, contrasts starkly with the natural and playful elements of the sculpture, suggesting a setting in an urban park. \n\nSome visitors to the park are also visible; for instance, a child interacts closely with the sculpture, climbing near Alice's figure, indicating the interactive and appealing nature of the artwork for all ages. There's also a baby stroller parked to the side, suggesting that this is a family-friendly location.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its blend of urban and bucolic elements, alongside the interactive nature of the sculpture, makes it a vibrant snapshot of urban life intersecting with artistic and recreational spaces.","title":"Alice-in-wonderland statue overlooking \"the pond,\" in the southeast corner of central park","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557263","550075","553266","552736","550071","557257","550052","553254","551767","550074","553769","544808","551651","551772","551646","550046"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["sculpture","park","character","stroller","instance","bronze","baby","visit","creature","artwork"]}
