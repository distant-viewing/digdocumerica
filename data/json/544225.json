{"path":"544225.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features an old, rusted tractor with large iron wheels, prominently positioned in a natural setting. The nearest wheel, filling much of the left half of the image, displays an intricate pattern due to its metal spokes and a heavily rusted surface, indicating significant aging and exposure to the elements. The body of the tractor, partially visible behind this wheel, includes details like a rusted exhaust pipe, metal seat, and steering mechanism, all contributing to the impression of a long-abandoned machine gradually being reclaimed by nature.\n\nThe tractor is surrounded by lush green grass and a scattering of bright yellow flowers, suggesting a season of either late spring or early summer. The background softly blurs into a mix of green hues from the surrounding trees and vegetation, indicating a secluded, perhaps wooded area. This blend of nature and machine captures a poignant juxtaposition of human enterprise and natural reclamation. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on texture, color contrasts between the rust and the greenery, and the interplay of natural light, evokes a sense of past rural life and the relentless passage of time.","title":"Abandoned tractor near Mississippi riverbank","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["553985","553986","557701","543354","547690","552673","550795","554561","547436","550797","543120","553984","554211","544323","555528","554783"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["tractor","wheel","machine","reclamation","enterprise","scattering","exhaust","reclaim","steering","iron"]}
