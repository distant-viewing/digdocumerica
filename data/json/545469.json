{"path":"545469.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures an image focused on the rear section of a dusty, white vintage car (possibly from the 1960s or 1970s) that prominently features a \"Valiant\" logo, indicating its make. The dust on the car has been creatively disturbed, with someone having drawn abstract and scrawl-like markings, which adds a playful or neglected aspect to the image. The artwork on the dust includes what looks like cartoonish figures and scribbles.\n\nIn the background, you can observe a suburban setting with well-kept lawns and typical one-story houses, likely depicting a quiet residential area. Interestingly, the sky above features a noticeable column of dark smoke, which stands in stark contrast to the otherwise serene neighborhood scenery. This could imply an incidence of fire nearby or some industrial activity not visible in the frame. The color tone throughout the image leans towards a slightly faded, retro aesthetic, possibly suggesting that the photograph itself is from an earlier era. The framing and focus are such that they draw the viewer's attention from the foreground with the car, diagonally towards the enigmatic smoke in the upper right, adding a narrative element to the composition.","title":"Smoke from the neighboring steel plant settles on everything.
