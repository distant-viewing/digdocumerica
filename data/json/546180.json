{"path":"546180.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image depicts a picturesque natural setting featuring a waterfall in a lush forest environment. The waterfall is small, with water cascading down over a rock face, surrounded by patches of green moss and plants, falling into a tranquil pond below. The surface of the water is mostly calm, reflecting the surrounding trees and the sky.\n\nThe backdrop consists of densely packed trees and foliage, predominantly in varying shades of green, indicating a vibrant, healthy forest. Sunlight filters through the canopy, creating areas of light and shadow, adding depth and texture to the scene. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is serene and idyllic, typical of a secluded natural habitat, possibly in a forest or nature reserve. There are no visible human figures or man-made structures, highlighting the untouched beauty of the natural landscape.","title":"A natural spring photographed at its source","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["554408","551349","555220","555210","557820","545878","554409","555073","555074","542594","558087","550979","543869","545839","544456","553410"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","forest","cascad","reserve","pond","moss","habitat","varying","canopy","fall"]}
