{"path":"548081.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a busy and industrial river scene. The river is moderately wide, filled with choppy water reflecting a mixture of blue sky and industrial elements. There are several boats on the river; prominently in the foreground, one speed boat is creating a wide wake as it moves swiftly down the river, accompanied by a smaller boat to its right.\n\nThe banks of the river are heavily developed with industrial infrastructure. There are multiple large buildings, including factories or plants, with visible smokestacks emitting white smoke, adding a layer of industrial haze to the scene. The landscape around the buildings appears moderately populated with trees and some greenery. \n\nIn terms of weather and atmosphere, the sky is partly cloudy with significant cloud formations, suggesting a dynamic and slightly overcast day. The overall feel is lively yet dominated by the presence of an industrial environment, portraying an intersection between natural waterways and human industrial activities.","title":"Salmon fishing and paper mills flourish side by side on the willamette river at Oregon city.
