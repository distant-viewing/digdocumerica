{"path":"556082.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scene inside the cabin of a moving train. A man, possibly the train driver, is seated to the right of the frame, his back and profile visible. He wears glasses, a light-colored cap, and a dark jacket. He is focused ahead, handling the train controls which are positioned directly in front of him. His hand is on a lever or throttle, suggesting he is actively operating the train.\n\nThe interior of the cabin includes a well-equipped dashboard with various gauges, levers, and controls, indicating the complex operation involved in driving the train. There's a black device, possibly a communication radio, attached near the center of the dashboard with a coiled black cable. On the left side of the dashboard is a larger meter or gauge.\n\nThrough the window beside the man, the outside view shows a blurred landscape typical of a view seen from a moving train, emphasizing speed and movement. The window frames a view of the train tracks stretching into the distance, surrounded by greenery. The image overall conveys a sense of motion and the everyday duties of a train driver attentively managing his route.","title":"Engineer on the Empire Builder passenger train mans the engine's controls as it travels enroute from Chicago to East Glacier Park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington.
