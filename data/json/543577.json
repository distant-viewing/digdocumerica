{"path":"543577.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a peaceful, twilight scene overlooking a large, serene lake. The composition is predominantly horizontal, capturing an expansive view of the natural landscape during the late hours of the day. In the foreground, a dense cluster of tall pine trees in silhouette forms a dark frame around the lower and left edges of the image, hinting at a forested area. The lake itself stretches across the middle of the frame, its surface smooth and reflecting the graduated hues of the sky above.\n\nThe lake is surrounded by rolling hills or low mountains, which are visible in the distance and also appear as silhouettes against the sky. These landforms contribute to the layering of the scene and provide a sense of depth. The sky is rendered in a gradient of colors, shifting from a rich, deep blue at the top to soft shades of pink and purple where it meets the horizon. This color transition suggests the time is either just after sunset or during the blue hour, adding a tranquil and slightly melancholic mood to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a still, almost ethereal natural landscape, emphasizing tranquility, natural beauty, and the calming effect of dusk.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["543604","554397","554405","543590","554752","554760","554403","551280","552319","552142","557570","554404","543618","550746","542994","550735"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["lake","hour","layering","silhouette","landform","pink","purple","gradient","twilight","transition"]}
