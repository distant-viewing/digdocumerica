{"path":"546389.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic silhouette of an industrial structure against a dimly lit sky during either dawn or dusk. The primary subject of the image is a dense array of what appears to be electrical transmission towers and accompanying scaffolding, heavily intertwined and complex, creating an intricate network of lines and shapes.\n\nThe towers and structures are metallic with numerous bars, girders, and wires, creating a mesh-like appearance throughout the photo. The silhouette of the industrial setup suggests a large-scale operation, possibly a power station or substation. There are no visible moving or active elements, suggesting the image captures a still, quiet moment, possibly before the bustle of daily operations begins or as it ends.\n\nThe background features a sky that transitions from a dark navy at the top to an orange and peach hue near the horizon, indicating early sunrise or late sunset, which contributes to the atmospheric mood of the photograph. The light from the sky filters subtly through various gaps in the lattice of metalwork, while the lower part of the image looks slightly underexposed, enhancing the contrast between the dark ground and sky.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the interplay of light and shadow and the grandeur of human-made industrial structures imposed against the natural colors of the sky.","title":"Petrochemical plant in coastal area","placename":"Ponce (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553830","546384","549011","553028","547090","543903","544355","545418","545446","544684","545430","557231","548851","557380","544613","544020"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["metalwork","tower","girder","navy","silhouette","lattice","transmission","bustle","scaffolding","mesh"]}
