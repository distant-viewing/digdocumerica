{"path":"553655.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene focused on wildlife conservation activities. In the foreground, there's a large truck labeled \"U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service — Hagerman, Idaho,\" which suggests this activity is part of a fish stocking or similar conservation operation.\n\nThe truck is parked near a body of water, and its rear is equipped with a large tank from which water and possibly fish are being discharged into the water via a white, frothy stream. There’s a metal ramp leading from the tank into the water, facilitating the transfer.\n\nTwo men are involved in the operation. One, clad in a shirt, vest, and cowboy hat, is standing on top of the tank. He appears to be operating or adjusting something on the top hatch of the tank. The second man is at ground level near the back of the truck, observing or managing the flow of water and fish from the tank to the water.\n\nThe background features a rural landscape with rolling hills and some sparse vegetation under a broad sky, hinting at a remote or isolated location. There's another vehicle visible in the distant background, suggesting a coordinated effort involving multiple staff or teams. The overall environment and the activities illustrated convey a sense of active wildlife management and environmental stewardship.","title":"Officials of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service release cutthroat trout into Pyramid Lake from Sutcliffe's landing on the western shore.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["542535","546357","542527","552588","546331","546362","542609","544767","548310","548133","553650","555876","552587","551396","552586","545211"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["tank","fish","truck","conservation","wildlife","hatch","water","transfer","staff","discharge"]}
