{"path":"554237.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene at a ski resort during the daytime. In the foreground, several pairs of skis and ski poles are stuck upright in the snow, forming a makeshift barrier or decorative display. The skis and poles are of various colors and styles, suggesting a diversity of skiers.\n\nIn the middle ground, people are gathered around an outdoor bar named \"Outdoor Bar,\" as indicated by the signage. The architecture of the bar is rustic with a wooden facade and a flat roof, typical of mountain resort structures. There are several patrons at the bar, dressed in colorful ski jackets and winter gear, which reflects the fashion of the time the photo was taken.\n\nThe background shows a snowy mountain landscape with clear skies, indicating good weather conditions for skiing. A few evergreen trees are visible, partially covered with snow, adding to the winter ambiance.\n\nPeople appear to be enjoying leisure time after skiing, some drinking and engaging in conversations, creating a lively and relaxed atmosphere typical of ski resorts. The overall mood is cheerful and vibrant, with a sense of community among the skiers.","title":"Timber line bar & restaurant on snowmass mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554235","554276","554269","554221","554277","554238","554242","554267","554243","554292","554278","550017","554275","554279","554218","554244"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["bar","skis","skier","resort","winter","snow","skiing","patron","pole","upright"]}
