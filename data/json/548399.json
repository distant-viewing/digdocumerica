{"path":"548399.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant street scene, presumably from the 1970s or 1980s, in what appears to be a bustling city, likely New York City given the street signs that read \"W 33 St\" and one indicating \"ONE WAY\". The scene is set on a sunny day with clear blue skies.\n\nThe view looks down a busy street flanked by high-rise buildings that create a canyon-like effect typical of many city centers. The architecture varies, featuring both modern high-rise buildings and older structures with ornate detailing, illustrating the architectural diversity of an urban environment.\n\nIn the foreground, a variety of people can be seen walking along the sidewalk, capturing a moment in their day-to-day urban life. The fashion is markedly retro, with men and women dressed in styles typical of the mid-20th centuryâ€”men in suits and ties, and women in trousers and blouses. One man prominently in the foreground walks towards the camera carrying a briefcase, dressed in a light-colored jacket and dark trousers, suggesting he might be on his work commute.\n\nStreet signs, including traffic and parking restriction signs, hang from metal poles, adding to the urban atmosphere. In the distance, vehicles typical of the era, including sedans and delivery trucks, navigate the street, contributing to a sense of busy city life.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the dynamic flow of life on a typical city street, highlighting the fashion, architecture, and rhythm of urban America during this period.","title":"Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548369","548388","551125","546626","550142","551135","549882","548410","556225","553276","550127","554297","549872","555782","554314","556199"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","city","fashion","trouser","restriction","briefcase","rhythm","delivery","commute","sign"]}
