{"path":"554785.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph features an abandoned two-story building with reddish-brown brick walls. The building appears old and dilapidated, with numerous windows missing, leaving dark, empty openings. The architecture includes a slightly arched first-floor window and a chimney visible on the roof. In front of the building stands a large, leafless tree with sprawling branches that dominate the upper part of the frame.\n\nThe building is situated in a rural, grassy area, with overgrown weeds and grass surrounding it, hinting at neglect and disuse. The sky is overcast, giving the whole scene a gloomy and desolate atmosphere. There are no visible figures or movements, enhancing the sense of abandonment. In the foreground, thereâ€™s a small sign attached to the building, though its content is not legible in the image. The background features a line of barren trees and shrubs, blending into a gray sky.","title":"An abandoned farmhouse surrounded by stripped land, in southeast Ohio near Steubenville.
