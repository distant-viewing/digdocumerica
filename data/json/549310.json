{"path":"549310.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph captures a scene from an urban environment, likely the streets of a city. The foreground prominently features an array of parked cars aligned in a diagonal formation. These cars, which appear to be models from the 1970s or 1980s, exhibit a variety of colors, including blue, grey, brown, and red. Their shiny, metal bodies and large, rectangular designs are indicative of the automotive style of that era. \n\nIn the background, towering above the parked cars, stand several high-rise buildings, including very tall twin towers with a reflective glass façade. These are the most prominent structures in the photo, suggesting their importance or prominence within the city's skyline. Surrounding the twin towers are other buildings of varying heights and designs, contributing to the dense architectural landscape typical of a bustling city center.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy, offering a dynamic contrast between light and shadow over the scene, while suggestive of typical varied weather conditions in an urban setting. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—combining elements of urban transportation and architectural majesty—creates a snapshot of city life, capturing both the ground-level perspective of personal vehicles and the imposing urban structures that define the cityscape.","title":"The newly constructed towers of the world trade center seen from the south side on west street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553845","556193","543961","546715","555782","549476","556681","555743","556709","549856","546716","556790","548364","546723","553893","549875"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["twin","city","towers","suggestive","majesty","prominence","designs","towere","importance","shiny"]}
