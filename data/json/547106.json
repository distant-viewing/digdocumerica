{"path":"547106.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between a young girl and a dog in an outdoor setting, likely in a garden or rural yard. The girl, appearing to be of elementary school age, is dressed warmly in a red hooded jacket, a red hat adorned with patterns (possibly knit), and patterned pants in blue, red, and white. She is also wearing black boots and appears to be engaged in playful activity with the dog.\n\nThe dog, a large breed that looks like a German Shepherd, is playfully interacting with the girl, possibly playing tug with a stick she holds. The dogâ€™s attention is focused on the stick, and its body posture suggests movement and playfulness.\n\nThe background of the photograph features bare trees and a garden-like setting with patches of dirt and grass. There appears to be a hint of early spring as there are budding flowers on some of the branches and a flowering plant seen in a pot. The setting includes part of a building or shed to the right, constructed from bricks or blocks, suggesting a rustic or rural setting.\n\nThe overall scene is lively and depicts a moment of joy and simplicity, highlighting the interaction between the child and her pet in a natural, outdoor environment.","title":"Helping to clean up after severe lake storm in Zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["543780","554497","554532","543040","557637","554559","554126","543327","553526","551123","558189","556139","545972","552674","558190","553481"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["dog","girl","stick","garden","pet","breed","playfulness","pot","school","joy"]}
