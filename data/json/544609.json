{"path":"544609.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic moment with a group of birds in flight against a sunset backdrop. The image features numerous silhouetted birds, possibly seagulls or similar species, spread across the frame. They appear in various stages of flight, showcasing different wing positions and angles, which adds a dynamic feel to the scene.\n\nThe background is dominated by a rich gradient of colors in the sky, transitioning from a deep reddish-orange near the horizon to a darker hue approaching the top of the frame, indicating the late stages of sunset. Below, just above the horizon line, there's a faint silhouette of a treeline or distant landscape, providing a sense of depth and location.\n\nThe composition of the image is well balanced between the open sky and the activity of the birds, with the lower third subtly grounded by the darkened landscape. This setting evokes a sense of freedom and natural beauty, capturing a tranquil yet vibrant moment in nature.","title":"Chokoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553875","544597","544605","544601","550382","554646","550888","552238","553776","544612","549772","544834","550887","553347","543283","557209"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","flight","stage","sunset","seagull","treeline","freedom","darken","wing","approach"]}
