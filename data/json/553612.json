{"path":"553612.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a logging scene with a strong outdoor, labor-intensive theme. A shirtless man, possibly a logger, is in the midst of physical labor. He is bent over while standing on a stack of substantial logs that have dark, rugged surfaces and are bound together with ropes. The logs display a rough texture, hinting at their recent removal from their natural environment. The background is composed of a barren, muddy terrain with additional logs and debris scattered around, emphasizing a cleared or deforested area.\n\nThe setting appears overcast with low light, which adds a somber, hardworking tone to the image. There's a sense of solitude in the atmosphere surrounding the man and his task, highlighting the tough conditions typically associated with such labor-intensive industries. The emphasis on natural materials and the evident physical effort speak to themes of nature, human activity, and the environmental impact of logging.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora. A \"cat skinner\" works in post-fire salvage operations. Caterpillar tractors are used to haul logs to \"landing area\" (seen here), where they are loaded onto trucks.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["553648","553614","546916","553647","553641","553643","545060","553631","553642","555472","554419","554416","542771","553613","545046","553644"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","labor","bind","deforest","removal","theme","logging","midst","clear","outdoor"]}
