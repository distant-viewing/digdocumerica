{"path":"553679.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal urban area during the time of day when the sunlight casts long shadows, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. The image captures a dense cluster of high-rise buildings varying in height, featuring primarily neutral and white colors that contrast with the darker surroundings.\n\nIn the foreground, there are two prominent curved high-rise buildings near the coastline, which seems to be a sandy beach. These buildings are noticeably close to the beach, separated only by a narrow tree-lined road. The architecture here is modern, with curved facades that set these structures apart from the more rectangular designs typical of the other buildings.\n\nThe central and background areas are filled with an array of other high-rise structures which form the city's skyline. These buildings are interspersed with patches of green spaces, suggesting parks or trees lining the streets. The city stretches towards a backdrop of rolling hills, indicating that the urban area is nestled in a valley-like setting. The hills are covered with dense vegetation and appear darker, possibly due to the shadows cast by clouds.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its foreground beach and curvy buildings leading into the denser cityscape and hills, creates a dynamic scene that highlights the interface between natural landforms and urban development. The lighting adds drama and depth, emphasizing the contour and density of the urban environment.","title":"Popular Waikiki Beach area seen from helicopter","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["555756","553678","553680","553790","553672","553677","544638","555757","553745","553671","553676","547173","553675","553931","549480","553674"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["rise","beach","building","hill","drama","interface","landform","city","density","coastline"]}
