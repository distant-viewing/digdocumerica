{"path":"552173.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures a breathtaking view of a mountain range, presumably during a clear day. The composition predominantly features a series of majestic mountains covered in snow, suggesting a high-altitude environment possibly during a colder season or in a region where snow persists year-round. The mountains dominate the upper two-thirds of the frame with their rugged, white peaks contrasting sharply against a deep blue sky.\n\nIn the foreground, the image portrays dark, densely forested ridges that have a deep navy to black tone, resulting in a dramatic gradient from the dark foreground to the brightly lit snow-capped mountains. This creates a stark visual contrast that emphasizes the majesty and height of the mountains.\n\nThe central range shown in the image has a particularly pronounced silhouette, indicating its higher elevation compared to surrounding peaks. A small body of water, visible as a reflective surface nestled among the closer, darker ridges, adds a peaceful and almost serene element to the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph showcases the natural beauty and tranquility of a mountainous landscape, captured in a way that highlights the dramatic differences in elevation, texture, and color from the dark wooded foothills to the bright, snowy peaks. The mood is serene and awe-inspiring, likely intended to emphasize the grandeur and untouched nature of the setting.","title":"Olympic mountains near Port Angeles","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550413","550415","550416","552144","554402","542842","550516","550423","542830","550515","550504","555681","550421","555662","554398","552172"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","peak","snow","elevation","ridge","difference","navy","inspire","majesty","range"]}
