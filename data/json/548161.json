{"path":"548161.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph presents a tranquil yet vibrant scene capturing both the agricultural and transportation aspects of a riverside landscape.\n\nIn the foreground, there are rows of lush vineyards, meticulously arranged and verdant, stretching gently up a sloping terrain. Various types of trees sporadically punctuate these rows, providing texture and contrast to the neatly organized vineyards.\n\nBeyond the vineyards, the river emerges as a principal feature of the landscape. On the river, a large barge marked \"TIDEWATER\" is being pushed by a small tugboat, signifying commercial or industrial activity. The barge and tugboat are centered in the photograph, moving left to right and creating slight ripples and waves in the water, which catch the light and highlight their motion.\n\nThe river is broad and appears to be a significant waterway, with calm blue waters reflecting the light. On the opposite bank, you can see a similarly arid landscape that rises into a gentle hill, largely barren compared to the cultivated foreground.\n\nThe background is completed by a clear sky with soft, ambient light suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. This lighting casts soft shadows and enriches the colors within the scene, enhancing the tranquility and beauty of the landscape. Overall, the composition balances elements of human activity with the natural environment, showcasing a moment of peaceful coexistence.","title":"Columbia River barge near the John Day Dam","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["551148","547995","551210","548187","544271","548050","557091","555575","557239","555401","551208","549081","556481","551332","550989","551221"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tugboat","barge","river","row","complete","push","signify","cultivate","enrich","riverside"]}
