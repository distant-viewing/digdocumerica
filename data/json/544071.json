{"path":"544071.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, atmospheric scene featuring a twilight desert landscape dominated by shades of dark blue. The silhouettes of several saguaro cacti are identifiable, standing prominently against a dusk sky that's interspersed with faint, lighter blue and gray hues, suggesting some residual light from the setting sun or emerging night sky. The horizon showcases the softly undulating outlines of distant hills or low mountains, adding depth to the scene. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of tranquility and the quiet end of day, typical of a desert environment transitioning from day to night. The low light conditions contribute to the image's mystical and somewhat somber ambiance.","title":"Sunset","placename":"Pleasant, Lake (Ariz.)","location":"Pleasant, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["552897","555346","545752","544359","557627","545748","548230","545903","545203","545207","547717","545771","545895","554644","550646","557560"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["night","desert","cactus","twilight","outline","end","dusk","day","silhouette","sun"]}
