{"path":"544689.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial water treatment or processing facility characterized by extensive foam and wastewater. In the foreground, vivid white foam bubbles heavily, covering much of the area and swirling into dark, purplish-red polluted water, creating a stark contrast with abstract, swirling patterns. Beyond the foamy water, structured rectangular salt evaporation ponds add an organized, geometric dimension to the scene. These ponds exhibit varying colors, from bright pinks to deeper reds, suggesting different mineral concentrations or stages of evaporation.\n\nIn the background, the environment is barren and industrial. A series of power lines and transmission towers stretch across the horizon, underlining the human impact on this landscape. The sky is clear, enhancing the sharpness and vividness of the colors in the industrial setting. The overall composition highlights environmental impact, juxtaposing natural water processes with man-made industrial efforts in resource extraction or pollution management.","title":"Industry has heavily polluted the San Francisco Bay area","placename":"Fremont (Calif.)","location":"Fremont, California","nn1":["549624","544775","551556","552989","544779","548196","546904","545164","546895","550708","545168","547568","543568","550193","553901","553456"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["foam","swirl","pond","wastewater","bubble","sharpness","dimension","transmission","salt","impact"]}
