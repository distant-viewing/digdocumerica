{"path":"550951.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph presents a river scene dominated by a large barge being pushed by a tugboat. The barge consists of multiple connected sections with a flat surface that appears to be made of steel. The tugboat, visible at the back center of the barge setup, has two levels visible, including what seems to be the wheelhouse from which the boat is operated. There are at least three people seen on the barge: one person is sitting, and two others are standing, likely crew members.\n\nIn the background, a densely wooded hillside can be seen, with some bare trees indicating that the season could be either late fall or early spring. Electrical towers run along the hilltop, suggesting the presence of infrastructure. Additionally, on the hillside, a few buildings are partially visible, possibly residential or small industrial structures.\n\nThe water beneath the barge appears calm, and the overall atmosphere of the photograph is slightly overcast and cold, judging by the grayish tone and the attire of the people on the barge. This scene captures a moment of industrial river transport, emphasizing functionality and the working aspect of river navigation. The composition focuses on the magnitude of the barge and the role of the tugboat, set against a natural yet inhabited backdrop.","title":"Barges on the Kanawha River near South Charleston","placename":"Charleston (W.
