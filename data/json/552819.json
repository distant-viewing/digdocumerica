{"path":"552819.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat industrial or rural scene, featuring a variety of elements. In the foreground, the image is prominently marked by a green road sign reading \"RACELAND,\" which is slightly out of focus and stands on a simple post. The background shows a large mound of black material, possibly coal, dominating the upper half of the frame. This mound is serviced by a large industrial conveyor belt structure, which stands on a framework and extends diagonally across the scene from the right, emitting a noticeable cloud of dust.\n\nBelow and beyond the sign, there's a road populated with vehicles typical of older models, suggesting a possible timeframe from the mid-20th century. Visible cars include a white car moving towards the viewer, a red pickup truck (marked \"EWING\"), and a boat being towed by another vehicle. There are also stationary white tanks, possibly for storing chemicals or fuel, on the left side of the road.\n\nPower lines run parallel to the road, reinforcing the functional, utilitarian feel of the area. The overall impression is of a working landscape, with transportation and industry closely intertwined. The setting does not appear in pristine condition; rather, it shows signs of wear and heavy use. The lighting and color tones suggest the photo was taken during daylight with overcast skies, adding a muted, slightly gloomy atmosphere to the scene.","title":"Stockpiles of sugar cane at south coast mill, in raceland","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["547979","544681","557431","546076","554835","548850","543173","555858","556520","551073","551033","556313","545988","544169","552014","550199"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["mound","road","timeframe","tow","sign","storing","mark","pristine","fuel","chemical"]}
