{"path":"557685.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a vintage-style gas station. The main focus is on a classic convertible car, possibly from the 1920s or 1930s, being serviced. The car has a cream body with black fenders and is adorned with chrome details. It features spoked wheels and has an old-fashioned crank handle at the front.\n\nThe setting is \"Barlow's Standard Station And Grocery,\" as indicated by a wooden sign hanging under the roof, which has a red scalloped metal awning. This quaint station also dispenses Chevron gasoline, evidenced by the visible gas pumps that display the Chevron logo.\n\nTwo individuals are interacting with the car. The first, a man in a light blue shirt and jeans, is bending over the passenger side of the car, perhaps checking something inside or speaking with the seated driver. Another person, presumably the driver, is seated inside the car but isn't distinctly visible.\n\nIn the background, behind the roof of the station, a clear sky and what appears to be a distant antenna can be seen. The overall ambiance suggests a sunny day, ideal for a drive in such an eye-catching vintage automobile.","title":"Warren brown, owner of the service station and grocery on main street in helen, Georgia, sits in a 1929 ford while his son gasses the car, one of many he has collected over the years","placename":"Georgia","location":"Georgia","nn1":["550096","557766","555467","557893","557834","557905","557906","555498","555497","557927","557885","555484","555465","555490","555457","557919"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["car","station","driver","gas","fender","gasoline","awning","antenna","pump","cream"]}
