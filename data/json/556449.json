{"path":"556449.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of an elderly man with a pleasant expression, looking slightly to his left. The man, likely in his 60s or 70s, has distinct facial features including a wrinkle-lined face suggesting a life of experience, and he is wearing round, dark-framed glasses. He has a fairly short, roughly styled haircut and a light moustache.\n\nHis attire includes a denim jacket over a reddish, button-up shirt that has a slightly protruding blue collar, likely from another layer underneath. On the left side of his chest, there is a noticeable pin badge featuring a design that reads \"Stop Whales\" with a depiction of a whale. This suggests his involvement or support for environmental or marine life conservation efforts.\n\nThe dark background of the photograph is nondescript, providing a strong contrast to the brightly lit subject, focusing the viewer's attention directly on the manâ€™s engaging expression and attire details. The lighting on the man's face and the overall tonality of the picture give it a moody and somewhat introspective feel.","title":"George a hughs, a miner for 17 years, wears a black lung button while attending a meeting of the Beckley (West Virginia) black lung association, one of the most militant of the groups concerned with that aspect of the miners' health.
