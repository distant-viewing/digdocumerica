{"path":"546227.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a recreational scene by a large body of water, likely a lake or river. In the foreground, several people are enjoying the water. One person, wearing a green cap, appears to be pulling a small child on a green float. To the right, another individual is lying partially submerged on a red, white, and blue striped float, while others float nearby using inflatable rafts.\n\nIn the background, the environment has a semi-industrial feel. On the left side, there is a prominent water tower and a building that resembles a processing facility or plant. To the right, larger industrial structures, possibly grain silos, dominate the view. They are connected by what seems to be a conveyor structure. The sky looks hazy, suggesting humid or polluted air, which might be associated with the industrial activity visible. The photograph has a slight vintage quality, indicated by the color palette and framing.","title":"Chemical plants near swimming area","placename":"Lake Charles (La. : Lake)","location":"Lake Charles, Louisiana","nn1":["546228","546145","544278","546219","550937","550221","543881","550227","544006","544712","545933","550854","545941","551525","544442","551959"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["float","raft","grain","conveyor","silo","framing","vintage","right","processing","cap"]}
