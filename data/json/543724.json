{"path":"543724.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image captures a mountainous landscape under a cloudy sky. In the foreground, two prominent signs are erected on posts, presumably beside a road though the road itself is not visible. Both signs are brown with yellow lettering and bear the symbol of the U.S. Forest Service—a pine tree enclosed in a shield shape.\n\nThe sign on the left reads “EXIT 1/2 MI. TURN RIGHT,” indicating directions to an exit half a mile away where one should turn right. The sign on the right encourages viewers to \"LOOK 1 TO 12 ACRES CHOICE SITES,” suggesting that there are land parcels ranging from 1 to 12 acres available for something—possibly sale or lease.\n\nThe background features a range of mountains covered partially in snow, suggesting the photo was taken in a season when snow still caps the higher elevations but lower regions are bare. The middle ground shows a sparse wooded area and brush, typical of a high-altitude or sub-alpine environment. The overall environment suggests a setting that could be appealing for outdoor activities or scenic living.","title":"Land development advertising","placename":"Rocky Mountains","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553669","543115","555659","543814","543637","544780","544913","543772","555385","543641","547648","543569","544136","542604","543599","542843"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["sign","parcel","snow","shield","exit","brush","choice","symbol","pine","sale"]}
