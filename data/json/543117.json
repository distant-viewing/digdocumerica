{"path":"543117.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene filled with natural light and agricultural activity. In the foreground, a young man is seen walking and holding the handle of a red tractor or tiller, which is situated on a freshly tilled soil path. He is wearing casual attire: jeans and a plaid jacket with a white shirt underneath. His attention seems focused on the path ahead as he walks.\n\nSurrounding him are several white chickens, pecking at the ground, possibly searching for food amongst the soil. The early morning or late afternoon sunlight highlights the scene, creating a warm glow and long shadows cast by the subjects and trees.\n\nIn the background, another person is visible; they appear to be standing still, observing or waiting. This figure is dressed in a dark jacket and pants, adding a sense of depth and layers to the composition. The environment is lush and green with young trees lining the path, and a wooden fence defines the boundary of this agricultural area. Beyond the fence, the land continues with dense greenery, suggesting a rich, natural landscape that might be part of a larger farm or rural setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of peaceful coexistence with nature and the daily routines of farm life, enhanced by the beautiful, natural lighting and the quiet activities of the individuals and animals present.","title":"Tony owen organic farm; seeding machine","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543017","552562","552581","544888","547304","547297","546986","557696","547326","551333","555528","543667","544323","551332","549257","555822"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["path","farm","fence","soil","search","till","jacket","walk","tractor","routine"]}
