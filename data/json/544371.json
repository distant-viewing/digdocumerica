{"path":"544371.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of agricultural activity in a field. It features a person, likely a farmer, standing slightly bent over with a shovel in hand, seemingly engaged in a task. The person is wearing a light shirt, dark pants, and a straw hat, which suggests an attempt to stay cool under sunny weather conditions.\n\nThe terrain is particularly noteworthy, consisting of rich, dark brown soil. Half of the ground in the image appears saturated with water, creating a reflective surface along which neat rows suggest recent irrigation or water management efforts. The muddy water contrasts with the drier, piled soil areas, indicative of either preparation for planting or maintenance of already-planted crops.\n\nThe surrounding environment is not distinctly visible, focusing the viewer's attention on the immediate activities. The lighting and color saturation give the photograph a warm, earth-toned ambiance fostering a sense of hard work under the sun in a rural setting. The composition of the photograph leads the eye along the lines of the water, intersected occasionally by the standing figure and his tool, combining human endeavor with nature's elements.","title":"Arizona--Navaho Nation","placename":"Navajo Indian Reservation (Ariz.)","location":"Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona","nn1":["557696","552574","554047","544246","553659","543781","554108","549036","548997","549259","544250","546383","543777","553093","544154","543792"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["soil","farmer","attempt","planting","irrigation","shovel","straw","standing","endeavor","saturation"]}
