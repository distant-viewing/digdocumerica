{"path":"548715.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an underwater seascape featuring marine life. Prominently, a large, round-bodied gray fish with white and black edges and spots, possibly an angelfish, is seen in the center of the image. This fish has vibrant yellow around the eyes and fins, adding contrast to its darker body.\n\nThe background displays a marine environment with a sandy ocean floor, dotted with various small seaweed clusters and patches of coral. Some coral formations appear more robust in structure, providing texture to the environment. The water displays a greenish-blue hue, typical of underwater settings, suggesting depth and perhaps a touch of murkiness, which resembles natural oceanic conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the natural light seems to be filtering through the water, illuminating parts of the seabed and highlighting the textures of the sand and coral. Overall, the scene encapsulates a tranquil moment under the sea, illustrating the peaceful yet vibrant life existing within our oceans.","title":"A grey angle fish swims in the protected waters of John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548716","548717","548719","548718","548713","548677","548682","557496","548712","548679","548722","548721","543567","548678","548711","548676"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["coral","fish","ocean","exist","seaweed","fin","seascape","encapsulate","display","texture"]}
