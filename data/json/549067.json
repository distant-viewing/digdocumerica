{"path":"549067.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view showcasing a blend of urban and arid desert landscape. In the foreground, a significant, well-structured layout attracts attention, featuring what appears to be a large building surrounded by a neatly maintained rectangular lawn. This central structure is flanked by rows of parked cars forming a semi-circular pattern around it.\n\nThe scene is bordered by a wide road to the left, while more vehicles are lined up along this road, suggesting a busy locale. To the right and left sides of the central establishment, there are extensive barren fields with traces of pathways or demarcations that cut through the dusty terrain, hinting at undeveloped land or possibly unused agricultural fields.\n\nBeyond this central hub, the urban development extends into the background where a residential area with orderly arranged homes can be seen. These homes are smaller and are nestled closely together, typical of suburban planning. The background further stretches into a vast desert landscape, marked by flat terrain and distant mountains, providing a stark contrast to the developed areas.\n\nThis composition effectively captures the intersection of human habitation and the natural environment, illustrating the spread of urbanization into the less hospitable landscapes of a desert region. The overall tone is sunlit and clear, suggesting a hot and dry climate.","title":"Funeral home at henderson","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["553130","546756","544400","554165","553935","544024","545625","553059","546624","553938","553125","553936","554166","557518","548825","546765"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["desert","urbanization","demarcation","developed","fields","trace","attract","locale","planning","hub"]}
