{"path":"555241.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a person's hand holding a clipboard with a document. The document on top of the clipboard appears to be a standard form or list, with check-off boxes and text that is not fully legible due to the blur. The hand holding the clipboard shows only the fingers with the thumbnail visible, suggesting a focus on the action of holding or reading the document.\n\nThe clipboard itself has a metallic clip at the top, prominently in focus. The clip is silver and sturdy-looking, with visible details like a rivet and the metal loop used to hang the clipboard.\n\nThe background is softly blurred, but you can discern a dark, obscured setting possibly suggestive of an industrial or warehouse environment. Distinct circular shapes, which may be objects like barrels or machinery parts, are stacked in the background, providing a contrast to the sharply focused clipboard in the foreground.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on the person's interaction with the document, implying a scene of inspection, inventory, or some form of administrative work. The lighting is subdued with a focus on the clipboard, highlighting it as the main subject of the image.","title":"An environmental protection agency pesticides inspector simulates writing up a \"stop sale\" sticker before placing it on a container of prohibited chemical.
