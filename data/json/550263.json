{"path":"550263.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of urban decay featuring a dilapidated residential structure under bright daylight. The building appears severely damaged and neglected, with worn, chipped paint on the wooden siding and parts of its structure exposed. The roof and upper sections of the building are particularly ravaged, possibly by fire or long-term abandonment.\n\nThe foreground of the photo is strewn with debris and household items indicating a state of abandonment or the aftermath of a disaster. Items visible include two major appliances that resemble a washing machine and a stove, both of which are old and rusted. Other debris includes broken pieces of wood, miscellaneous trash, and fragments of the building's material spread across the ground.\n\nProminently in the foreground is a discarded doll lying on the grass. The doll, which has human-like features, adds a poignant contrast to the surrounding decay, emphasizing themes of lost childhood or abandonment.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, focusing on the stark contrast between the decaying man-made structures and the doll in the natural grassy foreground, evokes a strong sense of neglect and desolation. The bright lighting conditions do not alleviate the somber mood suggested by the scene's content.","title":"Abandoned inner city home at 10212 wilbur avenue attracts vandals and litterbugs","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["553869","557345","549786","553555","551330","556164","553476","550144","553548","547130","543171","543344","547921","547988","551115","553552"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["abandonment","decay","chipp","neglect","stove","appliance","item","household","disaster","content"]}
