{"path":"553526.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a candid and lively scene involving two young boys and a dog in what appears to be a backyard setting. The young boy on the left is standing and facing the boy on the right, who is seated on a red tricycle. The standing boy is wearing a patterned short-sleeved shirt and jeans, while the seated boy is shirtless, wearing black pants and sneakers.\n\nThe boy on the tricycle is holding a slice of bread or sandwich in one hand and pointing with the other, possibly in conversation with the other boy. Surrounding them on the ground are various objects such as a large white bucket with yellow labeling, a red plastic toy, and debris including pieces of broken tiles or bricks.\n\nIn the foreground, a black-and-white dog is sitting, looking attentively towards the boys, adding a sense of companionable life to the scene. The background is rather nondescript, featuring dirt and gravel on the ground with some sparse vegetation and parts of trees visible.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of everyday outdoor play and interaction, characterized by the rustic and somewhat disheveled setting which suggests an uninhibited, carefree environment typical of childhood.","title":"Children play in mulky square, a low-income area soon to be torn up to make way for a new interstate highway","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["545972","553510","554497","543780","546873","551032","552674","550249","551123","548488","549275","543991","543677","555950","544354","558189"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","tricycle","dog","dishevel","bread","sandwich","tiles","toy","backyard","sneaker"]}
