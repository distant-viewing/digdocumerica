{"path":"555593.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene likely at a mining or excavation site. The central focus is on a large mechanical crane equipped with multiple steel cables and a bucket that is actively digging into a huge pile of earth or ore. The craneâ€™s boom and cables are stretched out prominently against the sky.\n\nThe heap of material that the crane is digging into is composed of various-sized pieces, suggesting it might be a mix of rocks and soil. There is a noticeable lack of vegetation on the heap, indicating an actively used industrial site. To the right, a similarly constructed pile is visible but is not in the immediate focus of the crane's operations.\n\nIn the background, you can see a part of another crane-like structure, suggesting that this is a large-scale operation with multiple pieces of heavy equipment in use. Additionally, the backdrop of the scene shows a clear sky and some vegetation distant from the immediate industrial activity, indicating that this site is possibly on the outskirts of a more natural area.\n\nOverall, the photograph presents a typical day at a heavy industrial excavation or mining site, emphasizing the scale and equipment used in such operations.","title":"The \"silver spade\" shovel, owned by the hanna coal company at work near Cadiz, Ohio","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["545887","544134","554545","545888","554770","555586","544157","545883","555644","545831","545655","548775","545846","547181","545648","557729"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","site","dig","heap","cable","excavation","operation","mining","ore","pile"]}
