{"path":"547934.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a suburban scene likely from around the 1960s or 1970s, portraying a clear and sunny day. In the foreground, two young children, a boy and a girl, are walking on a sidewalk. The girl, who is closest to the camera, has blonde hair and is wearing a light blue sweater with dark pants. The boy next to her has brown hair and wears a brown jacket and darker pants. Both children are carrying what appear to be school bags and are closely walking together, possibly returning from school.\n\nDirectly behind them is a classic yellow school bus, indicating a school day scene. The bus is parked on the street adjacent to where the children are walking. This part of the street hosts multiple parked vehicles, including a prominent 1960s era car in the foreground, likely a Chevrolet, featuring a sleek design with a beige color.\n\nThe background of the image shows residential homes with distinct architectural styles typical of mid-20th-century suburban America. The houses are two-storied with contrasting window designs and external stairs leading to the upper floors. Each house has a small front yard, some of which have young, leaf-bearing trees and modest landscaping.\n\nThe overall ambiance suggests a regular day in a quiet, orderly neighborhood with very little traffic and a peaceful setting, commonly found in American suburbs during this era.","title":"School children on their way home in Great Kills, on Staten Island.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557428","557365","557699","557840","547433","547859","557290","548441","544452","552743","551021","553493","558208","558215","551084","558039"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["school","child","bus","1960","girl","boy","suburb","era","house","pant"]}
