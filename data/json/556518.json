{"path":"556518.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene likely at a mining or heavy industrial facility. The primary focus is on a man standing next to a yellow mining or railway vehicle. The man, appearing in profile, is wearing a white hard hat, a dark jacket, and dark pants, suggesting a work uniform.\n\nHe stands beside a sturdy-looking yellow vehicle, which is equipped with a large front panel marked with \"V.A.P.\" and symbols reminiscent of headlights. This vehicle is possibly used for transport inside a mining facility or for similar industrial purposes. The terrain on which the vehicle and man stand looks rough and is composed of dirt strewn with pieces of wood and metal, typical of industrial or construction sites.\n\nTo the left and right of the scene are green and grey metal structures, likely shipping containers or mobile units used for storage or as makeshift offices. The left container has its door open, showing darkness inside, while both structures reflect an unkept, weathered appearance that fits the industrial setting. The photograph conveys a sense of active work in a rugged environment, highlighting elements of manual labor and industrial operation.","title":"The general mine foreman at one of the Tennessee consolidated coal company mines near jasper and Chattanooga stands beside the shuttle cars used to transport the miners to work.
