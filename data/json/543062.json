{"path":"543062.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a serene and picturesque sunset scene. The image is taken in silhouette against a twilight sky that fades from a deep violet at the top to a warm orange glow near the horizon. The setting suggests an aquatic environment, likely a lake or calm river.\n\nIn the foreground, the dark outlines of trees and vegetation are visible. There is a central piece of land or small islet with sparse, bushy trees, giving it a slightly ragged appearance. The water perfectly mirrors the sky and the landscape, creating almost symmetrical reflections which enhance the tranquility of the scene.\n\nVisible in the sky and reflected in the water are the outlines of flying birds, which add a dynamic and peaceful element to the tableau. There are also visible artefacts in the photograph, such as light streaks and minor damage spots, which contribute to the vintage feel of the image.\n\nAdditionally, on the lower part of the image, one can discern some human-made structures that appear as blurred reflections in the water near the bottom edge, indicating human presence or activity in this otherwise natural scene.","title":"Great blue heron fish.
