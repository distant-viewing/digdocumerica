{"path":"556036.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image shows a close-up view of an open menu held by hands, which is the primary focus of the composition. The menu includes various food categories like \"may we suggest cocktails?\", \"soup and sandwich\", \"entr√©es to heighten your trip\", \"the main fare\", and \"desserts\". The typography and structure of the menu suggest a public dining service or restaurant, possibly on a train given the window style and visible seat layout in the background.\n\nTo the left of the menu, placed on a ledge, is a small blue vase containing a few white flowers, positioned by a window with a view partially obscured by the angle of the shot but indicating motion, like from a moving train. The reflective glass shows a blurred reflection of the interior, hinting at more seating.\n\nThe scene captures a tranquil moment, enhancing the leisurely experience of dining or reading a menu while traveling. This description is based on the immediate visible elements and the environment suggested by the context of the image.","title":"Menu in the dining car of the Lone Star offers a variety of fare in different price ranges as well as children's favorites for persons traveling between Chicago and Houston, Texas.
