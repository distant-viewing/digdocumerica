{"path":"543247.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph showcases a serene marina scene, under what appears to be overcast weather conditions, adding a slightly moody atmosphere to the setting. The image features several boats moored at a dock. The focal boat, prominently displayed and named \"ANNIE MARIE,\" is a large, white fishing vessel featuring details such as a dark trim and deck structures including a cabin and masts. It's moored alongside smaller boats, including a sloped-roof cabin cruiser and a diminutive blue sailboat.\n\nThe water is calm, reflecting the boats along with their masts and rigging in its glassy surface, creating soft, wavy distortions in the reflection. The backdrop features muted, indistinct structures and faint silhouettes of additional masts in the foggy distance, suggesting a dense marina or a busy port area. The overall subdued color palette of blues, whites, and grays adds to the tranquil and somewhat nostalgic quality of the scene. The condition of the photograph, indicated by visible scratches and signs of age, infuses the image with a sense of history and time passed.","title":"'Fishing fleet'","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543246","546388","542902","548235","546877","543545","542904","548546","544672","546939","548247","542873","542871","542905","552296","542903"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["mast","boat","marina","cabin","cruiser","scratch","rigging","trim","port","history"]}
