{"path":"543319.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a scene set in a natural, outdoor environment. A woman is depicted engaging in an activity with plants. She is bending over, her head turned away from the camera, as she appears to be either picking or inspecting bright yellow flowers, which are possibly wildflowers growing abundantly around her. She is wearing a long-sleeve light pink top, adding a soft contrast to the vibrant greens and yellows of the vegetation.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there is a rustic wooden post with a sign reading \"KEEP OUT NO HUNTING NO TRESPASSING\" suggesting this area is either private property or a protected area. Nearby, there is a clump of thin, bare, and twiggy branches, providing a textural contrast to the lush, leafy plants around the woman.\n\nThe background shows a hilly landscape with thick vegetation, indicating that this location might be in a hilly or mountainous region. The sky is clear and brightly lit, suggesting it is a sunny day, casting sharp, clear shadows and contributing to the rich color saturation visible in the foliage and flowers. The overall composition conveys a strong sense of connection between human and nature, emphasized further by the natural, undisturbed setting around the individual.","title":"Flowers along Swanton Road","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["545616","554424","551748","557098","552688","556492","551705","545723","555186","546316","543452","544938","543835","549230","544443","544574"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["trespassing","hunting","flower","clump","pick","pink","saturation","plant","wildflower","inspect"]}
