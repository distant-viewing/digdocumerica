{"path":"543657.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat serene suburban scene with notable elements that contribute to a narrative of daily life and natural elements amid human habitation. In the foreground, the image is dominated by a shallow, muddy waterway flanked by overgrown, lush grasses which meander through the frame. This waterway winds its way through the middle of the composition, leading the viewer’s eye towards the central focus of the photo—a group of three people sitting by the bank. The individuals, two of whom appear to be children, are casually dressed and seem to be engaged in a leisurely activity by the water, possibly playing or observing the environment.\n\nIn the background, two residential structures, painted white, with gray roofs establish the neighborhood setting. These homes have an elevated design, suggestive of a location prone to flooding or wet conditions. Noteworthy is a line of laundry visibly hung out to dry on a wire fence, vividly colored clothing providing a contrast against the mainly subdued tones of the houses and surrounding nature.\n\nThe environment and position of objects suggest a close-knit community setting where the outdoors plays a significant role in the residents' daily routines. Furthermore, the overall lighting, likely captured during early morning or late afternoon, bathes the scene in soft hues, enhancing the tranquil and somewhat nostalgic quality of the photograph.","title":"Colorado--Fort Collins","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["545372","551066","546126","551067","547256","545008","557755","546922","543164","551538","543892","557736","549716","549089","550947","550240"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["waterway","laundry","flooding","resident","routine","habitation","outdoor","role","position","wire"]}
