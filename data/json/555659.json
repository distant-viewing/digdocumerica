{"path":"555659.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic landscape likely taken in a mountainous region. To the right, thereâ€™s an asphalt road that curves gently into the distance where a lone red car is visible. The roadside is marked by a wooden stake with bright pink ribbons and the letters \"ARDC\" written in black. This stake likely denotes a point of interest or boundary within a research, development or conservation area.\n\nTo the left of the road, the terrain is covered with a mix of small rocks and sparse green vegetation, which includes bushes and small trees. The landscape smoothly transitions into vast green hills that undulate towards higher mountain peaks in the background. These mountains exhibit patches of snow and are dotted with darker vegetated areas, creating a diverse and rich palette of natural colors.\n\nThe sky is clear blue and devoid of clouds, adding to the serenity and openness of the environment. This scene might be capturing a moment of environmental survey or research, suggested by the marked stake, within a region that showcases significant natural beauty and possibly challenging terrain.","title":"Pipeline crossing of the tsina river and the richardson highway, looking south.
