{"path":"556263.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures an African American young man deeply engrossed in reading a book titled \"Great Rulers of the African Past\" by Lavinia Dobler and William A. Brown. The focus is on the person and the book; his face partially visible as he looks down at the opened book. He is holding the book up with both hands, showcasing its colorful front cover which features an illustration of an African ruler, possibly in traditional attire, seated and holding a staff, with three other individuals and a drum in the background.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph enhances the subject matter, directing the viewer's attention to both the reader and the book cover. The backdrop appears to be a simple indoor setting, softly blurred out to ensure the focus remains on the subject. The reader's engagement with the material is evident from his concentrated expression and the manner in which heâ€™s immersed in the book, suggesting a moment of learning or discovery. The setting around him seems faintly academic and informal, perhaps in a room at home or a school environment conducive to study and reflection.","title":"Black student in a black studies class in a west side Chicago classroom reading a book about great rulers in africa's past recent years have seen a resurgence by various minorities of their histories.
