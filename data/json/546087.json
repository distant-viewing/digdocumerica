{"path":"546087.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a large industrial complex situated along a body of water bordered by reeds. There are several large buildings in the complex, which are primarily industrial in design, characterized by flat roofs and numerous windows and vents. Most buildings are either white or light gray, indicating whether they are possibly made of metal or painted concrete.\n\nSeveral chimneys and smokestacks project from the buildings, releasing plumes of white smoke into the air, suggesting ongoing industrial operations. There are also other structural elements visible, such as tall cylindrical tanks and some smaller structures, all part of the complex.\n\nA clear broadcast-tower with red and white bands stands prominently to the left in the photo, adding a contrast in structure compared to the large factory buildings. In front of this, a series of utility poles stretches across part of the landscape, hinting at the presence of an established electrical infrastructure.\n\nThe sky dominates the upper part of the photograph, filled with clouds that range from puffy, white formations close to the horizon to denser, gray clouds above, which might suggest an overcast day. There are no visible human activities in the scene; the focus is entirely on the industrial setup and its impact on the surrounding environment. The body of water and the reedy shore provide a natural foreground to the industrial backdrop, creating a juxtaposition between the natural and the man-made.","title":"Freeport sulphur co.
