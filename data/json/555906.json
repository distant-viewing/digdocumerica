{"path":"555906.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant, candid street scene presumably from the 1970s, evident from the fashion and hairstyle of the people featured. Seven individuals, appearing to be young adults, are gathered casually around concrete steps in what looks to be an urban environment.\n\nFour women and three men are included in the photo. On the left side, two women are seated directly on the steps; one is smoking a cigarette while listening intently to the other. Standing next to them is a man in a white shirt, seemingly in conversation with another man seated a step higher, who is turned to speak with someone out of frame.\n\nOn the right, the group consists of one standing woman actively gesturing as if she is in the middle of an animated discussion, and two other women who are seated next to another seated man. One of the seated women is smoking a cigarette, contributing to the relaxed, social atmosphere.\n\nThe background shows a row of red brick buildings with visible fire escapes, typical of certain urban residential areas. A vintage car is parked on the street, adding another layer to the setting's historical context.\n\nThe overall composition and setting allude to a casual, everyday moment among a group of friends, possibly in a neighborhood setting, capturing a slice of life from this particular era. The clothing style is notably retrospective, with elements like flared trousers, layered and textured coats, and a mix of earthy and bold colors. This scene not only depicts a social interaction but also subtly reflects the era's urban culture and fashion.","title":"Latin youths at Lynch Park in Brooklyn, New York City. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers, and tract homes. It is populated by blacks, Latins, and the white poor. Most of all, the inner city environment is human beings, as beautiful and threatened as the 19th-century buildings.","placename":"Brooklyn (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Brooklyn, New York","nn1":["553155","553183","549909","554178","550082","551063","551124","551126","556764","558395","551433","545231","553319","556532","551835","553804"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["step","woman","cigarette","fashion","seat","allude","era","smoke","man","escape"]}
