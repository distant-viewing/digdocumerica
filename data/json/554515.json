{"path":"554515.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene outdoor scene, likely taken at either dawn or dusk due to the soft quality of light and long shadows. It shows a rugged mountainous landscape viewed from a high vantage point. The foreground features a man bending over as he tends to a campfire near two pitched tents. The man is dressed in a casual, plaid, long-sleeve shirt and dark pants, focusing intently on his task.\n\nThe tents are set upon large, coarse rocks which dominate the terrain. One tent is brightly colored, likely red with a bright white top, highly contrasting against the muted tones of the surroundings. There is a sense of isolation and wilderness due to the sparse setup and lack of other visible human activity or structures.\n\nThe background stretches into multiple layers of mountain ranges receding into the distance, veiled slightly by atmospheric haze. This creates a gradient of color from dark silhouettes of nearby hills to lighter shades in the distance, enhancing the depth and vastness of the view.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph balances human activity and the expansive beauty of the natural environment, conveying a scene of adventure and tranquility.","title":"Backpacker camp at the summit of Algonquin Mountain at sunset, near Lake Placid, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554514","545780","542751","554507","554513","552898","545500","554674","554398","554500","544070","549450","554402","550421","550441","543376"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tent","campfire","gradient","adventure","plaid","lack","vantage","distance","dawn","haze"]}
