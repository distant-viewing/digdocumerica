{"path":"549114.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a middle-aged man with a focused, serious expression, looking slightly away from the camera. He has short dark hair, parted on the side, and wears thick-rimmed black glasses.\n\nHe is dressed in a dark suit jacket over a white shirt with a diagonal-striped tie that combines shades of red, white, and blue, giving him a very formal and professional appearance. He is positioned in front of a microphone array, suggesting he is either making a speech or participating in a press conference.\n\nThe background is simple and nondescript, featuring vertical blue-grey drapes that help to center focus on the man himself. The overall composition of the image conveys a sense of importance and formality, indicative of a business or political setting.","title":"William Ruckelshaus, first administrator of EPA","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["557648","557144","556415","548888","558261","554338","545471","557034","554339","553087","552872","557032","549330","557056","556443","546105"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["formality","speech","microphone","importance","tie","suit","business","array","man","jacket"]}
