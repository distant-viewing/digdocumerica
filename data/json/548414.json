{"path":"548414.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a dense urban area leading towards a large bridge in the distance. The setting appears to be a typical cityscape featuring a mixture of residential and commercial buildings.\n\nFrom the foreground to the midground, there is a view of numerous rectangular, tightly packed buildings, likely apartment blocks or residential units, interspersed with straight streets running perpendicular to the frame. These streets are bustling with traffic, hinting at a busy, populated area. Notably, some large, standalone buildings dominate the scene, suggesting areas of commercial or perhaps governmental use.\n\nTo the left foreground, thereâ€™s a patch of greenery that looks like a park or a recreational area amidst the urban environment, providing a touch of nature. Below, a highway system with multileveled roads and overpasses carves through the area, facilitating the movement of vehicles around the city.\n\nOn the right, a curved structure, perhaps an aqueduct or an old railway line, features prominently, while above it, the highway continues to snake around the landscape. In the farther distance, a large bridge stretches across a body of water, connecting this part of the city with another, barely visible through what appears to be a haze or smog. The bridge is partially obscured but recognizable by its high rise and suspension cables.\n\nIn the far background, the city continues towards a hazy horizon, where the outlines of other tall buildings or skyscrapers blend into the skyline. Above this, the early morning or late afternoon light suggests a time of day when the city might just be starting its daily bustle or winding down. This time of day gives the entire scene a slightly muted, serene quality despite the evident urban activity.\n\nOverall, the photograph beautifully captures the varied and dense infrastructure of a bustling cityscape transitioning from a natural landscape, highlighting both the hustle of city life and architectural features.","title":"View of the Bronx from the George Washington Bridge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548418","548344","548317","546569","550157","555734","548392","546707","555720","553559","556951","555733","546581","546704","546678","555743"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","bridge","continue","highway","cityscape","suspension","bustle","smog","overpass","hustle"]}
