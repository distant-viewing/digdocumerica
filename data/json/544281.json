{"path":"544281.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph presents a view framed by a somewhat industrial foreground, looking out towards a natural landscape through a large window-like opening. The scene is divided by large vertical and horizontal beams that may be part of a disused building or structure. On the left, we see a slightly rusted cylindrical pillar or silo, which partially obscures the view and suggests that the setting might be an abandoned or repurposed industrial site.\n\nIn the opening itself, the landscape depicted is a broad expanse of a wetland or shallow body of water, populated densely with thin vertical reeds or plants that rise straight through the surface. This suggests the view might be of a marsh or swamp. The water reflects the sky above, creating a tranquil and somewhat melancholic atmosphere.\n\nThe foreground inside the structure shows a ground covered with small rocks, pebbles, and some debris, including broken pieces that could be concrete or tiles. There are also pools of water accumulated, indicating either recent rainfall or a general state of disrepair and exposure to the elements, underlining a sense of abandonment.\n\nIn the background, the sky is visible, partly cloudy and bright, indicating daytime. This provides a natural backlight to the scene and enhances the contrast between the dark, shadowed interior of the foreground and the luminous, airy background landscape.\n\nThe photo captures a sense of isolation and the passage of time, where nature slowly reclaims spaces left by humans. The contrasting elements of industrial decay and natural beauty evoke a contemplative mood, inviting thoughts on nature, transformation, and the impermanence of human constructs.","title":"Tank battery belonging to Emerald Oil Company","placename":"Larose (La.)","location":"Larose, Louisiana","nn1":["554565","549555","545982","545008","546109","556351","552515","557997","551330","558003","546056","557976","558006","554807","552255","546066"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["opening","backlight","swamp","transformation","marsh","tile","pebble","pillar","reed","rainfall"]}
