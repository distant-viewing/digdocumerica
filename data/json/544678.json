{"path":"544678.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a relatively serene rural landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and long shadows present. The scene is primarily composed of a narrow water channel, or ditch, filled with flowing water, which diagonally cuts through the image from the foreground to the middle distance. The banks of the channel are lined with grass and other wild vegetation, which appears to be slightly dried and golden in color, suggesting it might be late summer or early autumn.\n\nParallel to the water channel, a dirt road runs into the distance alongside a row of evenly spaced utility poles carrying power lines. The composition emphasizes the perspective and depth, drawing the viewer's eye towards the horizon. In the background, a series of low mountains or hills are visible, creating a layered effect with the clear sky above them.\n\nNo people or moving vehicles are present in the scene, which contributes to an overall sense of quietness and isolation. The landscape is open and expansive, with no buildings or other structures immediately visible, indicating that this location is quite removed from urban areas. The photograph captures a moment of natural beauty and tranquility, emphasizing rural life and the simplicity of the scenery.","title":"Telephone poles march to distant hills","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["552521","553083","557091","547300","549261","557095","547316","542895","553652","556960","555881","553086","552733","549146","545040","547354"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["channel","ditch","quietness","remove","parallel","dry","simplicity","distance","autumn","scenery"]}
