{"path":"552728.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense urban landscape as viewed from an aerial perspective, capturing the immensity and regularity of housing and infrastructure in a sprawling cityscape. There are endless rows of uniformly spaced residential and commercial buildings, primarily low-rise with flat or sloping roofs. The buildings are closely packed, showing little to no space between them, arranged in a rigid grid pattern that stretches across the entire image frame.\n\nThe streets are visible as narrow, straight lines that intersect at right angles, emphasizing the grid structure. Some larger buildings, possibly schools, churches, or government buildings, interrupt the monotony with their larger footprints and distinct architectural styles.\n\nIn the distance, the density of the buildings slightly decreases, and larger structures, perhaps indicative of a city center with higher buildings or skyscrapers, become discernible against the skyline. The color palette is dominated by tones of blue and gray, possibly due to the lighting or photographic filter, giving the scene a somewhat cold, industrial feel.\n\nThis photograph effectively conveys the scale and organized nature of urban development in large cities, illustrating how space is maximized and structured in densely populated areas.","title":"Row houses","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552729","552730","548374","548424","549972","548425","551509","547445","548343","545914","553673","549971","551510","548364","555743","551506"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["grid","building","monotony","government","footprint","filter","school","city","housing","church"]}
