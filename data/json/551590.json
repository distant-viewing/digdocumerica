He is in an industrial or laboratory setting, characterized by metal structures and equipment. The individual is handling what appears to be a control lever, with thick cables and hooks nearby, suggestive of machinery used for lifting or adjusting heavy objects. The colors in the image are subdued, with soft lighting that highlights the man's face and the reflective surfaces of the metallic elements around him. The overall composition conveys a sense of concentration and precise control, with the manâ€™s serious expression underscoring the meticulous nature of the work being performed.","title":"National Water Quality Laboratory: aquatic biologist Wesley Smith makes a count of fish eggs in a substrate that has been contaminated with a regulated quantity of industrial waste","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["542664","556771","551595","556557","549364","557317","558379","558380","556315","542668","546291","553329","552369","548252","546328","556569"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["control","lever","hook","beard","laboratory","perform","male","lift","cable","concentration"]}
