{"path":"551734.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This is an image capturing a playful and active moment among a group of people in an outdoor park setting. The photograph shows three individuals interacting with a large tree. One of them is suspended horizontally from a low, thick branch of the tree, holding on with both hands and feet airborne, as if imitating flying or doing pull-ups. This individual is dressed in a vibrant and patterned sweater along with blue jeans and brown boots.\n\nTo the right, two other individuals are standing on a green park bench, reaching up to grasp the same tree branch. The individual closest to the camera wears a white sleeveless top paired with blue jeans and white sneakers, while the person next to them is dressed in a denim jacket and jeans, complete with dark shoes.\n\nThe background features grass and partially visible paths, suggesting a well-maintained public park. Various trees and lush greenery underline the tranquility and natural beauty of the setting. Moreover, the people appear engaged and enjoying their interactions with the natural environment, emphasizing a scene of leisure and friendship.","title":"In prospect park, Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551735","554899","549274","553438","545311","557410","552033","553065","553370","547197","550829","557983","557737","554669","555947","544739"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["friendship","jean","park","grasp","branch","sneaker","do","individual","suspend","foot"]}
