{"path":"545582.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning view of the Double Arch, a notable geological formation located in the Arches National Park in Utah, USA. The image is taken from a vantage point that frames these intertwined natural arches from below, emphasizing their grand scale and striking configuration.\n\nThe arches themselves are composed of Entrada Sandstone, which showcases a rich, red color that contrasts vividly against the vibrant blue sky visible through the arches' openings. The textured surface of the rock is marked with lines and grooves that indicate geological layers and erosion patterns formed over thousands of years.\n\nThe perspective of the photograph places the viewer within a shaded area beneath the arches, adding depth and a sense of enclosure to the composition. The foreground features rugged, rocky terrain, which is typical of the desert landscape that characterizes the park.\n\nThere are no human activities or people visible in the image; the focus is entirely on the natural architecture and the interplay of light and shadow, highlighting the serene and majestic environment of this famous landmark. This perspective not only captures the unique structural beauty of Double Arch but also evokes a sense of awe and wonder at the natural world's ability to create such impressive forms.","title":"Double arch in Windows section of Arches National Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545559","544935","545570","545573","544939","545551","545572","545569","545568","553077","545555","545566","545580","545585","545584","545563"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["arch","configuration","groove","wonder","enclosure","awe","perspective","intertwine","landmark","year"]}
