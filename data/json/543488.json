{"path":"543488.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph prominently features a close-up view of the trunk and branches of a tree. The tree, with its thick and rugged bark, seems aged and weathered. The main trunk divides into multiple large branches that spread out into the frame, each covered with a reddish-brown bark that appears rough and textured, possibly signifying exposure to harsh elements.\n\nIn the spaces between the branches, the background reveals a natural environment composed of more trees, possibly a forest or a dense grove. The trees in the background appear slightly blurred, emphasizing the focus on the tree in the foreground. The other trees have green foliage, hinting at a vibrant, living ecosystem surrounding the main subject of the image.\n\nThe image has a natural, earthy tone with the colors predominantly being shades of brown and green, reflecting an outdoor, naturalistic setting. The lighting seems natural, suggesting that the photograph was taken during the day. No human activity or artificial elements are visible in the image, lending it a serene and isolated feel.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["550792","557621","545288","554974","557616","551355","548687","542749","547634","554967","557622","542958","548709","558103","542791","543448"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bark","branch","trunk","tree","liive","reddish","signify","divide","isolate","exposure"]}
