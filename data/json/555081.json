{"path":"555081.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a moody and dramatic natural scene, primarily featuring tall trees against a dark, cloudy sky. On the left side of the image, a very tall, dark tree trunk vertically bisects the frame from top to bottom, its branches not visible as they extend out of the frame. Another similar tree appears on the right side, but further back, creating depth.\n\nIn the center and right portion of the image, two prominently silhouetted conifer trees, possibly pine or fir, stand out against the brighter background sky. These trees feature sparse branches typical of mature trees in a dense forest.\n\nThe sky itself is a dramatic element of the composition, filled with swirling clouds that vary in intensity from light to dark, suggesting a dynamic and possibly stormy weather situation. The clouds are illuminated from behind, likely by the sun, which though not directly visible, casts a glow that lights up parts of the cloud cover with a whitish to light gray hue, contrasting starkly with the darker clouds.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somber and introspective, emphasized by the silhouettes and the play of light and shadow. The setting appears to be a dense, wild forest, likely at either dawn or dusk given the dim light and color tones in the sky.","title":"Douglas fir seed trees more than 80 years old in the olympic national timberland, Washington.
