{"path":"555705.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a colorful, dynamic landscape. In the foreground and the center of the image, you can see a large body of water, perhaps a lake or coastal inlet, exhibiting a vibrant mix of blues and greens, suggesting the presence of algae or minerals. A prominent, curving shoreline composed of pinkish sediment or sand cuts through the center of the image, separating the water body from dense forest areas. \n\nThe left side of the photo shows a steep terrain predominantly covered by a dense forest of conifer trees, creating a dark green texture that contrasts strikingly with the brightness of the water and shore. To the right side, a more detailed landscape unfolds, where patches of vegetation alternate with exposed earth, and a meandering stream or small river snakes its way through the terrain. The stream appears to have multiple branches and flows through lighter-colored soil, which might indicate sandy or clay material.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a rugged natural environment where water and land interact closely, bordered by forested hills that suggest this setting might be in a mountainous region, possibly near the coast. No human activity or structures are evident, emphasizing the untouched and remote character of the landscape.","title":"A small stream draining into Jack Bay one mile southeast of Tongue Point.
