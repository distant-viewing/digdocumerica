{"path":"556691.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph portrays a scene inside a subway car, capturing a diverse group of passengers engaged in various activities. The interior of the car features rows of seats on either side, occupied by passengers, and advertisements displayed above the windows. The subway car has a metallic finish both inside and outside, with details characteristic of a typical older model subway, such as fluorescent lighting and handles for standing passengers.\n\nMost passengers are shown seated, facing the camera; a few are standing. Many are engrossed in reading newspapers or books, which seems to be a popular activity among them. The passengers display a range of attire from casual to semi-formal, reflective perhaps of different professions or personal styles. This attire, in combination with the various hairstyles and accessories, suggests the image may be from the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nThere is a sense of quiet engagement, as the passengers mainly keep to themselves, engaged in their reading or lost in thought. The atmosphere conveys a typical public transit environment where each person is absorbed in their own world, amidst the shared space of the subway car.\n\nThe individuals vary in appearance, including men and women of different ages and possibly different backgrounds, reflecting an urban, multicultural setting. Some details that speak to the era include the style of clothes, such as leather jackets and wide collars, and the physical styles of the subway car itself.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph captures a slice of urban life, showing how people coexist and share public spaces while engaged in personal activities, set against the backdrop of a city's public transit system.","title":"Passengers riding a subway car on the Lexington Avenue line the New York City Transit Authority system handled an average of 2.1 million people a day in 1970 which was 47 percent of the work force. In spite of the crucial importance of the 232-mile system voters have refused to authorize new funds for any more improvements, or to allow the fare to be raised above the present 35-cent rate to cover the costs of the system.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556780","556813","556665","556698","556661","554328","554370","556653","556817","556669","548256","554327","548261","554326","549893","556795"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","passenger","car","transit","profession","style","accessory","leather","finish","handle"]}
