{"path":"543135.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged coastal scene with natural tide pools. The view is captured during a time of day when the sunlight is reflecting brightly off the water and wet surfaces, creating a shimmering effect. There are multiple rock formations, both in the background and foreground, which appear dark and rugged; they have been sculpted by the forces of the ocean. These rocks form barriers around the pools of water, which have settled into the crevices of the rocky coast.\n\nThe tide pools are of various sizes, appealingly capturing the light and shading within the scene. The ocean in the background has a deeper, more uniform shade, contrasting with the sparkling tide pools. The wave action can be seen at the coastâ€™s boundary where the surf meets the rocks, adding a dynamic element to the tranquil tide pools.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveys a serene yet rugged natural landscape, typical of a coastline shaped by constant oceanic forces. It's a natural habitat likely home to various marine life adapted to the fluctuating conditions of tide pools. There are no human figures or man-made objects visible, suggesting a remote or purely natural setting. The composition of the photograph, which uses natural light and color contrasts between the dark rocks and the light water, highlights the beauty and harsh environment of coastal ecosystems.","title":"Rocky seashore","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["547471","543183","543984","547486","543289","543142","543297","543186","545173","543243","545095","543291","543292","547602","543060","543306"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["pool","tide","coast","rock","force","ocean","rug","sculpt","settle","surf"]}
