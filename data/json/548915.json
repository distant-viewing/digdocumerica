{"path":"548915.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a large dam structure surrounded by rugged, mountainous terrain. The dam, substantial in size and curved in shape, spans across a body of deep blue water, creating a reservoir. Directly adjacent to the dam are several large water intake towers, and there are roads curving around the landscape with a few small vehicles visible, which help provide a sense of scale.\n\nThe reservoir is bordered by steep, rocky hills with a sparse presence of vegetation, indicative of an arid or semi-arid environment. The difference in water levels on two sides of the dam is noticeable, indicating the dam's purpose in water storage and possible hydroelectric power generation.\n\nThe shadows cast by the high sun suggest this image was taken during the middle part of the day. The bright glistening of the water surface suggests either wind activity or the flow of water. On the opposite side of the dam from the reservoir, the terrain continues to be rugged and barren with minimal vegetation, conforming to the arid environment portrayed in the image.","title":"Parker Dam on the Colorado River impounds Havasu Lake.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548975","548936","548927","548920","548938","548947","548007","548013","548940","548003","548012","549004","548925","548930","548942","549024"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["dam","reservoir","water","difference","generation","terrain","wind","flow","vegetation","power"]}
