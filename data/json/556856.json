{"path":"556856.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene railway scene surrounded by lush greenery. It captures a view looking down a pair of railway tracks that stretch into the distance, gradually converging towards a vanishing point that is not visible in the image. The rails are supported by wooden ties and bordered by grass and small, white flowering plants, suggesting it is likely spring or summer.\n\nTo the right of the railway tracks, a small group of individuals can be seen engaged in some form of activity beside the tracks. The people appear to be workers, as some of them wear white protective helmets and are gathered around a red machinery piece that might be involved in railway maintenance or construction.\n\nThe surroundings are dense with trees and foliage, emphasizing the rural or semi-rural character of the location. Overhead, there are electrical lines mounted on tall poles and a structured metal framework, indicating that this railway line is electrified. This apparatus casts complex shadows on the tracks and adds an industrial touch to the natural landscape. The light and shadow play in the image suggests it is taken either in early morning or late afternoon, giving the photograph a warm tone and enhancing the tranquility of the scene.","title":"View of the track from an Amtrak passenger train enroute between Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Baltimore, Maryland. The train will continue to Washington, D.C. It was part of the Broadway Limited which traveled from Chicago to Harrisburg, then split into two sections. The other part of the train headed from New York City. In 1974 Amtrak carried 18 million passengers, an increase of 10 percent from the previous year. Revenue was $256.9 million, but there was a $272.6 million deficit.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545378","556902","550790","556877","556873","556769","556869","556888","556889","556837","556854","556841","556851","556783","556011","556860"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["railway","track","overhead","apparatus","pair","tie","rail","line","helmet","character"]}
