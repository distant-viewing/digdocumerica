{"path":"555111.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph showcases a sweeping landscape dominated by dense forest expanses, primarily composed of conifer trees characterized by a spectrum of greens mixed with some autumnal hues. The image seems to capture the scenery from a high vantage point, providing a panoramic view of the woodland area.\n\nCentrally framed in this dense forest area are transmission power lines, highlighted by visible tall towers supporting wires that dissect the landscape vertically. These lines stretch into the distance, establishing a clear pathway through the otherwise unbroken canopy of the trees.\n\nThe terrain is mildly undulating, and the forest is interspersed with small clearings and sporadic patches where trees are thinner or absent. Faded hills can be seen rolling into the background, gently enveloped by a haze that slightly obscures the detail of the landscape's farther reaches, giving the scene a serene and vast impression. The overall color tone is a mix of deep and soft greens tinged with earthen colors, capturing a natural and quiet wilderness setting.","title":"Douglas fir trees in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
