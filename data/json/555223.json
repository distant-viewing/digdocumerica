{"path":"555223.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged and natural mountain landscape. It shows a river gorge flanked by steep, forest-covered hillsides. The river itself is narrow and flows through the center of the image, surrounded by rough terrain including rocks and debris. Part of the river appears to be frozen or partially covered with snow or ice, suggesting that it could be during a colder season.\n\nThe left side of the river features a dirt road or path following along the riverâ€™s bank. Tree stumps and dead trees are visible along this path, indicating recent or past logging activities. The steep slopes are densely covered in coniferous trees, providing a contrast of dark greens against the grayer and more muted tones of the foreground.\n\nIn the background, the hills rise steeply, and the top of one hill shows evidence of a cleared or landslide area, with little vegetation. The sky is overcast, casting an even, diffuse light over the landscape, muting the colors and adding to the somber and rugged character of the setting.\n\nThe scene is devoid of any visible wildlife or human activity, emphasizing the solitude and untouched aspect of this natural environment. The focus and composition of the photograph suggest an exploration or documentation purpose, aimed at capturing the essence of the remote and wild terrain.","title":"Concrete covers a riverbank under a bridge in the Wynoochee Reservoir drainage system in Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
