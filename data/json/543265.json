{"path":"543265.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively ground squirrel in a natural habitat. The image shows the squirrel in mid-motion, likely scurrying or foraging. The animal's fur appears rough and grizzled with various shades of brown and gray, blending effectively with the surrounding environment.\n\nThe background and foreground of the picture are densely populated with dried grass and sparse vegetation, indicative of a dry, possibly arid, ecosystem. The soft golden and brown tones of the grass contrast subtly with the darker tones of soil visible in the foreground. The lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken during daylight, with natural light highlighting the textures of the squirrel's fur and the grassy terrain.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on capturing a moment in the life of the ground squirrel, possibly exploring or looking for food, set against a backdrop that complements its natural camouflage and the rough texture of its habitat.","title":"California--Point Lobos State Park","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550468","550472","550469","555668","554597","550470","554599","545564","545556","542629","545560","544738","542630","550467","557615","547043"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["fur","habitat","camouflage","explore","grass","dry","food","populate","complement","ecosystem"]}
