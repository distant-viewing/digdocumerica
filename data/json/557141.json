{"path":"557141.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph showcases an old, weathered two-story farmhouse surrounded by overgrown grass. The house has a flat front with an attachment on the right that looks partially collapsed; this section has exposed wooden beams and tattered timbers draped with fabric or tarp, suggesting it may be a makeshift repair to the structure. The main part of the house appears to be covered in white siding, though it's aged and peeling in some areas, and the roof appears to be in a state of decay. A mix of closed and boarded-up windows can be seen.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent old-fashioned hand pump stands, mounted on a small wooden platform, hinting at the house's lack of modern plumbing. This rustic scene is set against a soft-focus background, with flat terrain extending into the distance under a calm, dusky sky. The overall mood is one of desolation and abandonment, evoking a sense of isolation and the passage of time.","title":"Abandoned house and rusted iron hand pump on land which used to be covered by tallgrass prairie in Johnson County, Kansas, near Kansas City. The wave of pioneer farmers cleared the native grasses and planted crops in the fertile soil. As a result, only scattered patches of native tallgrass prairie survive. There is a bill in Congress which would make an area of Kansas a tallgrass prairie national park.","placename":"Johnson County (Kan.)","location":"Johnson County, Kansas","nn1":["552455","552491","552494","555612","554787","554822","555632","542588","556491","555611","547658","558110","554707","549195","557346","546989"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","attachment","tarp","farmhouse","collapse","pump","timber","repair","fabric","drape"]}
