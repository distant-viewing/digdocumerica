{"path":"550299.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene lakeside scene at sunset. The sun, partially obscured by haze, casts a warm golden light across the landscape and reflects shimmeringly on the water's surface. On the left, the silhouette of a dense tree extends into the frame, partially veiling the view while adding a natural frame to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, we see a silhouette of a fence partially submerged under water, suggesting a pier or a walkway leading into the lake. The water is calm, with gentle ripples visible around the submerged structures.\n\nSeveral boats are dotted across the lake. Close to the center and the right side of the frame, two boats are visible; they appear stationary or moving very slowly, enjoying the calm evening waters. Additionally, there's a hint of land or a large mass on the left side of the image, jutting into the lake and receding into the background covered in trees.\n\nThe sky above the lake is filled with layers of clouds, tinted by the sunset, creating a gradient of yellow, amber, and soft purple hues, adding a feeling of tranquility and depth to the photograph.\n\nOverall, the image captures a peaceful, picturesque moment typical of a tranquil evening spent near the water, evoking a sense of calm and a connection with nature.","title":"Lake Erie at sunset.
