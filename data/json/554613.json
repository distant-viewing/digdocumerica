It shows three divers in full gear, including suits, fins, and tanks, standing in shallow water. One of the divers is near a yellow buoy with a dive flag, indicating an underwater activity area. The lake is surrounded by dense forests and scenic hills under a cloudy sky, suggesting a natural, peaceful setting. Large boulders are visible at the edge of the lake, and the water appears calm. In the background, several small cabins or houses can be seen along the shoreline, contributing to the tranquil, vacation-like atmosphere of the setting.","title":"Group of scuba divers from a New York city club at Blue Mountain Lake, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve ready to look for remains of boats, steamers and railroad cars","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554614","549347","552276","544388","544129","549369","555834","555830","554007","548675","547134","543065","543491","548834","549359","553780"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["diver","lake","dive","fin","vacation","buoy","boulder","cabin","flag","suit"]}
