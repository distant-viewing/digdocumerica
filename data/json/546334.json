{"path":"546334.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures three men engaged in activities at a shoreline body of water under a bright sky. The setting appears to be a coastal or lakeside environment, characterized by calm waters and clear skies.\n\nFrom left to right: the first man, clad in a light short-sleeved shirt, dark shorts, and glasses, is positioned waist-deep in the water and is holding what looks like a clipboard or a plastic box. He peeks into the contents of the box, possibly checking or organizing whatever is inside.\n\nNext to him, the second man, sporting a casual greenish T-shirt and khaki shorts, kneels in the water and seems to be handling some marine equipment or a fishing net that floats on the water surface. He is more submerged in the activity, focused on adjusting or examining the apparatus.\n\nThe third man, farther to the right, is shirtless, wearing only blue swim shorts, and sports sunglasses. He handles a cluster of dark seaweed or marine plant material, examining it closely. His demeanor suggests a scrutinizing examination of the plant or collection of samples.\n\nIn the background, a rocky, constructed breakwater or jetty divides the land from the water, extending into the distance along the coast and disappearing into a thin stretch of land or bridge beyond. A series of utility poles follow the line of the jetty.\n\nThe scene is bathed in sunlight, indicating a clear day with good weather, optimal for outdoor marine or ecological research activities. Overall, the image conveys a sense of scientific fieldwork related to marine biology or environmental studies, centered around water and aquatic life.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory personnel are seining for fish to be used in bio assays.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544763","546307","546290","549356","546294","547020","547718","549059","545077","546302","546342","549616","552861","549351","548882","552290"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["jetty","short","box","water","deep","biology","breakwater","seaweed","clipboard","fieldwork"]}
