{"path":"547294.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view of a highway stretch with various vehicles in motion. The highway, which is divided by a grassy median, consists of multiple lanes in each direction. The lanes are prominently marked, guiding the flow of traffic. Vehicles, including several cars, a few trucks, and a couple of semi-trucks, are seen traveling in both directions. A notable feature is an access road curving around near the foreground, which connects to the main highway.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is characterized by gently rolling hills, indicative of a rural or semi-rural area. The terrain is mostly covered in lush green grass, implying that the photograph was taken during a warmer season. On the right side of the image, there's a small structure resembling a house or farm building, adding a human element to the otherwise natural environment. The skies are somewhat overcast, casting a soft light over the scene, which enhances the tranquility and spaciousness of the area. \n\nOverall, the composition skillfully captures a moment of everyday transport activity within a serene natural setting, emphasizing both the beauty of the landscape and the connectivity enabled by the highway.","title":"Interstate 80","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557471","547302","547298","546607","546733","543891","557430","554566","546720","546571","546603","549902","548391","546686","555630","547780"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["highway","lane","direction","spaciousness","median","truck","connectivity","stretch","vehicle","access"]}
