{"path":"549005.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph prominently features a vintage, colorful US mailbox mounted on a wooden post. The mailbox is styled with a vivid red top labeled \"LETTERS\" and a blue section just below with \"US MAIL\" printed in bold. The front part of the mailbox features a small window that displays \"HOURS OF COLLECTION\" and a schedule, suggesting it is a functional piece for collecting mail.\n\nThe mailbox is placed against a background that includes a white stucco building on the left and a partial view of another structure with a metallic exterior on the right. The ground is dry and cracked, hinting at a hot, arid location, possibly in a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nAn old, weathered tree stump appears right next to the mailbox, adding a rustic element to the scene, and there are minimalistic signs of vegetation, emphasizing the sparseness of the surroundings.\n\nNo people are visible in this photograph, focusing attention solely on the mailbox and its environment. The overall composition invokes a sense of outdated, rural Americana.","title":"Post office at Alamo","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549006","557759","556984","557760","557950","552468","554132","557566","550991","542702","557567","547290","556370","549196","547296","555640"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["mailbox","stucco","schedule","stump","hour","vintage","letter","post","exterior","piece"]}
