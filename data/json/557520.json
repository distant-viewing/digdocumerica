{"path":"557520.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural scene likely taken at dusk or dawn, given the subdued lighting and soft focus that contributes to a tranquil ambience. The image is dominated by a vast strawberry field in the foreground, with neat rows that eventually blur into the distance. The plants are lush and appear healthy, suggesting it's peak season for strawberries.\n\nIn the foreground, a person is engaged in the labor-intensive task of picking or inspecting the strawberries. This individual is bending over, attired in light-colored clothing, which covers them head to toe, likely as protection from the sun and plants. The person is partially blurred, emphasizing their motion and the ongoing nature of their task.\n\nThe background features a line of modest, two-story residential buildings with flat roofs, possibly farmworker housing or nearby community homes. These structures have a somewhat dated look, with faded exteriors and visible wear. There is also a large tree and a utility pole visible on the right side, which along with the houses, frame the agricultural activity, placing it within a broader community context.\n\nOverall, the composition balances elements of rural labor with a residential backdrop, suggesting a close-knit relationship between the agricultural activity and the community that possibly relies on this economy.","title":"Irrigated agricultural land on Oxnard Plain, a prime farming area now being developed for housing near Oxnard, California, north of Los Angeles. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressure. Restrictions on coastal development within 1,000 yards of the shoreline were tightened with the passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November 1972.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543454","546924","557478","546964","543845","543481","554015","544552","555541","557696","554056","548296","554047","553659","552812","543324"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["community","labor","economy","task","relationship","protection","ambience","plant","housing","person"]}
