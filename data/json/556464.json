{"path":"556464.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This is an aerial photograph that captures a large, sweeping railyard bordered by natural scenery and a small town. On the left side of the image, a river curves around the edge, reflecting the surrounding greenery. Adjacent to the river are multiple railway tracks densely packed with numerous parked freight trains, suggesting a primary railyard and transportation hub.\n\nThe tracks form an arc that follows the river's bend and lead into a more complex network further to the right. Here, the tracks are organized into various straight and curved lines, densely packed with trains and rail cars. This organization is indicative of the functioning and operational areas of the railyard, likely used for sorting, staging, and dispatching trains.\n\nThe curve of the railway tracks and river is contrasted against the structured layout of the town on the right side of the image. There are residences and possibly small commercial buildings clustered together, with roads meandering between them. The town's proximity to the railyard suggests a community likely connected to or reliant on the railway industry.\n\nIn the middle section between the railyard and the town, a highway cuts through the scene, marked by a few visible vehicles, providing a transportation link that contrasts with the static nature of the parked freight trains.\n\nThe photograph is shot from a high altitude, casting a wide perspective that shows a significant portion of landscape affected by industrial, natural, and residential elements. The overall composition illustrates a scene of industry, nature, and human habitat coexisting in a tightly integrated manner.","title":"Aerial of Williamson, West Virginia, showing the coal rail yards and the river that divides Kentucky at the upper left and West Virginia.
