{"path":"546438.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a charming, two-story vintage house painted in a soft green with white trim. The architectural details are intricate, featuring decorative woodwork around the windows and along the cornices. The house has multiple windows with curtains, some of which are partially drawn, and a few have darker shades pulled down.\n\nOn one side of the house, there's a small, green extension or annex that matches the primary building in style and color. The yard around the house is lush with green grass, and thereâ€™s a clothesline stretched out in the yard filled with laundry such as sheets, towels, and clothing, indicating a peaceful, domestic scene.\n\nThe background shows mature trees with dense foliage, providing a green canopy over the yard. A secondary structure, which appears to be a shed or a garage, is visible behind the house. It is painted in a similar green shade but with less ornate detailing. The environment is sunlit, suggesting a clear day with ample sunlight filtering through the leaves, casting light and shadow on the house and yard.","title":"Wash hangs alongside old home on chestnut street","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546434","546439","558036","557068","558153","557094","548662","557746","558160","545041","557076","551091","558156","550704","546441","557092"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["yard","house","woodwork","clothesline","cornice","laundry","extension","towel","sheet","garage"]}
