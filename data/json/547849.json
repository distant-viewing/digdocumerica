{"path":"547849.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph portrays a serene natural landscape with a person engaged in birdwatching or photography. A woman stands in the foreground on slightly elevated sandy ground. She is dressed in a dark red jacket and patterned trousers, looking through a pair of binoculars held up to her eyes. Her dark hair is medium-length and partly obscured by the binoculars.\n\nThe background features a still body of water, likely a lake or lagoon, surrounded by patches of green grass and sporadic sandy areas. This tranquil water body is dotted with numerous birds, primarily gulls, many of which are resting while others are in flight. The far shore across the water has dense green vegetation, contributing to the natural and untouched feel of the scene. The sky is overcast with a pale blue hue, suggesting it might be either early morning or a cloudy day. \n\nThis setting seems to be a peaceful wildlife reserve or a similar natural area, ideal for observing birds and enjoying the tranquility away from urban environments.","title":"Bird-watching at the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547864","547853","544838","546835","545991","553592","545095","550388","557495","552910","553777","547124","548832","556992","550380","547089"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["binocular","bird","lagoon","reserve","ideal","photography","flight","wildlife","length","pair"]}
