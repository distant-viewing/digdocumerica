{"path":"550485.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a fascinating natural landscape that features a variety of elements. The foreground shows a wide expanse of tundra with autumnal hues, featuring browns, yellows, and patches of green. Scattered throughout this vegetation are two prominent antlers, which appear whitish against the earthy tones of the tundra, suggesting they may belong to a caribou or similar animal.\n\nThe middle ground provides a view toward a distant lake or river, nestled within a broad valley. This body of water adds a serene blue contrast to the otherwise dominant earthy tones of the landscape.\n\nThe background is dramatic, featuring a range of sharp, jagged mountains that rise starkly against an overcast sky. The mountains sport dark hues, enhancing their rugged and imposing presence in the photograph.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a remote, wild setting, likely captured in a northern or alpine region given the vegetation and presence of antlers. The overcast sky combined with the rich, muted colors of the terrain contribute to a serene yet somber atmosphere.","title":"Naturally-shed caribou antlers embedded in the tundra below Peak 5308, looking west to Galbraith Lake","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550426","550611","550494","550488","550477","550380","555682","550403","550441","550592","550399","550588","550478","550402","550511","555696"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["tundra","antler","mountain","hue","yellow","sport","presence","tone","animal","valley"]}
