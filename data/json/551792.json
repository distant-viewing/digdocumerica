{"path":"551792.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and sunny outdoor plaza scene. At the center of the image is a water fountain, from which water is bursting upward, creating a refreshing spray. The base of the fountain appears to be a broad, shallow bowl made of a dark material.\n\nThe square is lined with pale and darker grey square tiles, creating a checkered effect. Positioned around the plaza are various large planters filled with a mix of lush greenery and vibrant flowers in shades of red, yellow, pink, and purple. These add a lively and colorful touch to the urban environment.\n\nPredominant on either side of the image are blue and white striped flags on tall poles, fluttering in the breeze. These flags could suggest a festive or celebrative atmosphere or possibly indicate a specific nationality or corporate presence.\n\nSeveral people are scattered across the plaza, engaged in various activities. To the left, some individuals appear to be sitting, taking in the sun or perhaps reading, while others are walking, likely strolling or moving through the plaza to other destinations. A child in a red top and white pants is walking near the fountain, and a small group of people are engaged in conversation or are also navigating through the square.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is relaxed and leisurely, characteristic of a pleasant day in a communal urban space. The bright sunlight suggests a clear, sunny day, enhancing the vivid colors of the flowers and the crisp appearance of the surroundings. This photo provides a glimpse into everyday life in an urban setting, where people enjoy the outdoors and the company of each other in a public space.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
