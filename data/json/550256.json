{"path":"550256.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, expansive landfill site under a clear, blue sky. The landfill is overflowing with various types of waste, primarily consisting of papers, plastics, woods, and miscellaneous discarded items. The scene is dominated by massive piles of trash that cover the entire visible area.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a large, black trash compactor is actively moving or compressing garbage. Plumes of dust are visible around this machine, suggesting its operation at the moment the photo was taken. To the right of the compactor, there are two large trash trucks. The one closest to the center is dumping trash from its red body, tilted upwards, releasing more content onto the pile. Another red truck, which is mostly obscured and located further to the right, is also involved in similar activity.\n\nThe scene illustrates the environmental impact of human waste, showcasing the overwhelming scale of trash accumulation at a landfill. It reflects issues related to waste management and environmental sustainability. The clear sky contrasts starkly with the debris and waste-filled ground, creating a poignant commentary on pollution and human impact on the natural environment.","title":"Landfill operation on warner road","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["548210","544799","549750","549936","550252","549747","543832","554541","546246","546231","543821","549792","546235","543828","549938","549946"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["trash","landfill","waste","compactor","sustainability","pile","overflow","poignant","discarded","closest"]}
