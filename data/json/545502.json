{"path":"545502.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an urban scene focused on waste management issues, taken during the daytime. In the foreground, there are sizable piles of garbage collected into numerous boxes and loosely thrown bags containing assorted rubbish. The waste is evidently overflowing, indicating either a backlog or inefficient collection schedule.\n\nA garbage truck, marked clearly as part of a municipal or city service, is visible in the middle ground of the image. The vehicle is painted mostly black, parked or possibly in motion, hinting at the ongoing collection process. Adjacent to this garbage truck, there is a smaller delivery vehicle marked with \"Golden Flake\" on its side, suggesting it is a delivery van, possibly for snacks or similar goods.\n\nThe background shows a city street extending into the distance lined with buildings of various designs typical of an urban setting. Notably, above the street, there is a large sign spanning across the road promoting “Birmingham Green - A Cooperative Effort.” This may suggest a civic initiative related to urban cleanliness or environmental efforts, which contrasts with the foreground filled with uncollected trash, adding a layer of irony or commentary on the city’s environmental initiatives.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph contrasts urban life's hustle with the less discussed, but crucial, aspects of municipal waste handling, set against a backdrop that hints at community involvement or environmental campaigns.","title":"Sanitation department truck prepares to haul accumulated trash from street.
