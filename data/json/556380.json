{"path":"556380.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a middle-aged man focusing his attention on a small, handheld camera device. He has a bald head and is wearing large-framed glasses, which highlight his intent expression. He holds the camera in his right hand, slightly angled, as if heâ€™s adjusting it or about to use it. The camera appears to be an older, possibly vintage model, attached to a wrist strap for security.\n\nThe man is dressed in a patterned shirt with intricate designs that suggest a formal or semi-formal occasion. His attire and the camera equipment suggests he might be engaged in documenting an event or conducting some form of visual research or photography.\n\nThe background is mostly blurred with neutral, dark tones which ensure the focus remains primarily on the man and his interaction with the camera. The soft focus and lighting enhance the contemplative mood of the scene, with the man's concentration and the details of the camera being the central elements in the composition. There's no additional context provided by the background, leading the viewer to concentrate entirely on the individual and his activity.","title":"A member of the Island Creek Coal Company training staff at its facilities near Richlands, Virginia, C.E.

Barnette has been employed by Island Creek for 42 years, 36 years inside the mines. All miners new to the company must spend a 40-hour training period with this man, even if they had prior experience.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["557034","548252","556563","552871","547116","552872","556452","557035","556443","543713","557648","547338","549384","542784","547179","548218"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Technology"],"terms":["camera","intent","security","wrist","strap","man","occasion","photography","research","concentration"]}
