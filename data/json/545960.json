{"path":"545960.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a distinctive red and white futuristic train-like vehicle on a narrow track. The vehicle has a streamlined, rounded front with a prominent dome-shaped structure on top that may contain sensors or lights, adding to its innovative appearance. The front window of the vehicle is large and panoramic, offering a clear view from inside, and there appear to be two people visible through this window, likely passengers or operators.\n\nThe setting appears to be an industrial or testing area as indicated by the simple, utilitarian metal buildings in the background and the minimal landscaping, composed mainly of a clear blue sky and a flat, arid terrain. The track itself is straightforward with no visible embellishments, emphasizing functionality over aesthetics. This environment suggests that the vehicle may be in a testing phase or situated at a research facility dedicated to transportation technologies. The scene does not show much activity beyond the stationary position of the train, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the vehicle itself and its design elements.","title":"The LIMTV (linear induction motor test vehicle) is tested at the Dept. of Transportation's high speed ground test center. The experimental vehicle is designed to operate at speeds up to 250 miles per hour. It uses electro-magnetic forces for noiseless propulsion.","placename":"Pueblo (Colo.)","location":"Pueblo, Colorado","nn1":["545931","545948","545946","545942","556784","545939","545964","555986","556058","545956","556076","556111","556759","556120","556059","556029"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["testing","vehicle","train","track","embellishment","phase","operator","landscaping","dome","functionality"]}
