{"path":"545685.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This is a powerful and somewhat unsettling photograph taken outdoors, capturing the aftermath of an apparent helicopter crash. The scene is set on terrain covered with red dirt, which suggests a desert-like environment, possibly characteristic of regions like the Southwest United States. \n\nIn the foreground, there are numerous remains of the aircraft, widely scattered and heavily damaged. Pieces of the helicopter's bodywork, broken and twisted pieces of metal, wires, and components are strewn about the ground. Among the wreckage, parts are still recognizable, such as parts of the helicopter's fuselage bearing the numbers \"1901E\".\n\nA man stands near the wreckage, dressed in a dark green flight jacket and a matching peaked cap. He appears somber as he surveys the disaster, holding what looks like a piece of equipment or possibly a personal belonging in his left hand. His posture and facial expression convey a mix of seriousness and perhaps contemplation or distress.\n\nIn the background, the landscape features rolling hills and rock formations typical of a mesa or plateau, further reinforcing the likelihood that this photograph was taken in a desert setting. The sky is overcast, adding to the somber mood of the scene.\n\nThis photograph captures a moment of reflection in the wake of a destructive event, highlighting both human presence and the powerful, often uncontrollable forces of technology and nature.","title":"Wreckage of an army helicopter assigned to clean-up of the San Juan river oil spill","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["545681","545670","545642","547982","544591","545638","545637","544754","542577","556445","555872","544741","547868","545649","553863","555199"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["helicopter","wreckage","piece","desert","parts","plateau","survey","seriousness","mesa","distress"]}
