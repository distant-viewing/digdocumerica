{"path":"550329.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene with a variety of buildings and structures typical of a large factory or processing plant. The complex features several large buildings painted in a light green hue which house the plant's operations. Multiple tall chimneys and towers are visible, some of them releasing thick plumes of white smoke into the sky, indicating active production.\n\nThe central focus of the image is the emissions and the infrastructure supporting these emissions; various sizes of smokestacks are distributing smoke at different heights and densities. The foreground of the image includes a part of a water body, suggesting that the plant is located near a river or lake, which might be utilized for industrial processes or cooling.\n\nThe background shows a cloudy sky and hints of a forested hill, placing the industrial complex in a location that is not densely urban. The overall composition of the image underlines the juxtaposition of industrial activity with natural elements. The color palette is dominated by the greens of the buildings, the white of the smoke, and the blues and grays of the sky and water, providing a somewhat muted but realistic representation of an industrial landscape.","title":"Georgia pacific paper plant in woodland on the st.
