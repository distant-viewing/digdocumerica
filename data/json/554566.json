{"path":"554566.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a curving highway that meanders through a tranquil, natural landscape. The road is split into two lanes divided by yellow dashes, with an additional lane on the right-hand side for passing or slower traffic. Along the road, three vehicles are visible, all appearing to travel in the same direction on the right-most lane.\n\nThe surrounding environment features green, lush trees that densely line one side of the highway, suggesting a forested area. On the other side of the road, there is a grass-covered slope, which extends into rock cut embankments that have been exposed, likely for the construction of the road. This exposes layers of rock, revealing geological features of the area.\n\nThe sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene, which contributes to the serene and slightly moody atmosphere. There are no buildings or human figures visible, emphasizing the natural and somewhat isolated setting of the highway. The overall composition and elements of the photograph portray a peaceful journey through a scenic, rural area.","title":"New Highway 30 near Tupper Lake, New York, shows fine grading, drainage fields and grassing for erosion control, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547302","551240","556579","547298","557010","548144","547294","557430","554130","550600","548100","544598","557528","546733","556988","546603"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["lane","highway","road","expose","dash","embankment","split","rock","journey","pass"]}
