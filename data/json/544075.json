{"path":"544075.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and vivid scene of a cityscape under the threat of an ominous weather event, possibly a dust storm. The sky is engulfed in a deep reddish-brown hue that casts an otherworldly glow over the entire scene. The color saturation suggests either the presence of a storm or a sunset intensified by atmospheric dust or pollution.\n\nThe landscape is densely populated with residential and a few commercial buildings. The houses, primarily single-story, feature flat or slightly sloping roofs, typical of architecture designed to cope with hot and dry climates. The consistency in housing design suggests a suburban environment.\n\nIn the distance, mountain silhouettes can be seen against the dark, menacing sky, providing a natural boundary to the urban sprawl. The absence of any visible vegetation or large trees in the immediate vicinity emphasizes the arid nature of the region.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the contrast between the natural and human-made environment, dramatized by the intense, almost surreal color palette of the sky, to create a striking visual narrative. The atmosphere is tense and anticipatory, waiting for the full impact of the weather phenomenon to unfold.","title":"Dust storm over residential area on labor day, 1972.
