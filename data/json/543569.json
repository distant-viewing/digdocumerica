{"path":"543569.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque natural landscape, likely taken in a mountainous region. The foreground features a marshy area with scattered patches of water and lush greenery. Several clusters of grass and small bushes are interspersed throughout the damp ground, contributing to a sense of wild, untouched nature.\n\nDominating the middle ground are several thin, sparsely leafed trees, standing somewhat isolated from each other. These trees appear to be adapted to a wet, possibly alpine environment. Beyond these trees, the terrain gently slopes upwards, leading to a dense forest of taller, thicker conifers that frame the scene.\n\nIn the background, majestic snow-capped mountains rise under a partly cloudy sky. These mountains, soaring in the distance, provide a dramatic backdrop and enhance the serene and remote feeling of the scene. The lighting suggests it is either late afternoon or early evening, casting soft shadows and enriching the colors of the landscape.\n\nThis image conveys a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, typical of a mountainous wilderness area, possibly intended for nature conservation or as a recreational national park.","title":"Nevada -- Tahoe National Forest, California","placename":"Tahoe National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe National Forest, California","nn1":["543582","555660","543586","555696","550629","550609","555657","550513","555682","544936","550441","552143","554461","550604","548025","555110"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["soar","adapt","intend","conifer","mountain","enrich","conservation","wilderness","tree","snow"]}
