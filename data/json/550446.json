{"path":"550446.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a Dall sheep in a rocky, mountainous environment. The sheep is shown in profile with its body elongated as if captured mid-stride or mid-movement. It has a sturdy build, predominantly light-colored or whitish fur, and distinctly curved, brownish horns, indicative of its species.\n\nThe sheep’s pose suggests alertness or movement, as it's slightly turned, possibly indicating its awareness of the surroundings or an interrupted action. The backdrop consists of dark-colored rocks and boulders, which contrast sharply with the sheep’s light fur, highlighting the sheep even more within the rugged terrain.\n\nThe focus and exposure on the sheep bring out details such as its muscular build, the texture of its coat, and expressions in its eyes and mouth, suggesting it might be gazing at something out of frame, which adds an element of curiosity and life to the image.\n\nOverall, the composition with natural light seems to cast shadows and highlights effectively across the scene, enhancing the three-dimensional effect of the terrain and the subject in its natural habitat.","title":"A young ram, not yet mature enough to be hunted because he lacks a full 3/4 curl to his horns, approaches a salt lick.
