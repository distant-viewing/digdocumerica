{"path":"557209.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of seven birds flying in the sky, captured in an asymmetrical and spread-out formation. The backdrop is a smooth, uniform gradient of deep blue, possibly indicating early twilight or a dimly lit sky condition. Each bird is silhouetted, and details such as species or color are indiscernible except for the outline which suggests that they might be larger birds, possibly waterfowl based on the wider wingspan and neck stretch. The spacing between the birds is uneven, with some closer to one another and others more isolated, giving a natural and non-uniform appearance to their flight pattern. The scene conveys a sense of tranquility and freedom.","title":"Flight of lesser sandhill cranes is airborne over the Lillian Annette Rowe Bird Sanctuary at GRand Island, Nebraska, in early morning. They are among the 250,000 birds of this type that stop here on their migratory route from the Gulf of Mexico to the Yukon Territory and Siberia. The birds are attracted to the shallow and marshy habitat of the Platte River. The area is threatened by a possible project to dredge and dam the river.","placename":"Grand Island (Neb.)","location":"Grand Island, Nebraska","nn1":["557203","554646","550382","553875","550903","544609","550889","557125","544605","550887","552238","550888","544597","557208","544834","557204"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","freedom","spread","stretch","neck","flight","specie","gradient","twilight","outline"]}
