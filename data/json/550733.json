{"path":"550733.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of environmental maintenance or construction near a river. The image features a large backhoe with a mechanical arm extended over the river, holding a large cylindrical object that appears somewhat rusty and used, potentially a piece of infrastructure related to sewage or water management. \n\nIn the foreground, a man dressed in what looks like traditional or older style clothing, wearing a flat cap and a jacket, is seen observing the activities. He stands leaning on a wooden fence, which partially frames the scene, suggesting the location might be in a park or rural setting accessible to the public.\n\nIn the background beyond the backhoe, two other individuals are involved in the activities; one is closer to the waterâ€™s edge, possibly guiding the mechanical operation or preparing the site, while another figure can be seen on a small pile of sand or dirt near a white canopy, which might be serving as a makeshift operational base or storage.\n\nThe river itself is calm, with a gentle reflection of the trees that line the opposite bank, adding a serene backdrop to the industrial activity in the foreground. Overall, the setting appears to be lush and green, indicating a temperate climate. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light over the scene, which suggests it might be early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Sewage pipes of the new Auburn-Lewiston municipal treatment plant being set in place at river crossing point.
