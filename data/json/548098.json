{"path":"548098.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape featuring a river flowing through a rocky, forested environment. The river is in a winding curve, bordered by a mix of greenery and rocky outcrops. On the left side of the image, there is a significant industrial installation, including a tall, thin structure resembling a water tower and other structures that look like industrial buildings. Near the edge of the river, there appears to be a small, old-fashioned boat moored next to a dock.\n\nA rustic bridge with an iron framework spans the river, contributing to the scenic, yet somewhat industrial feel of the setting. The bridge features a single track, suggesting it may be a railway bridge. To the right of the river, the terrain rises steeply into densely wooded hills. The hillside is covered in green trees, and some buildings are barely visible through the foliage, possibly part of a small community or private residences.\n\nThe skyline is clear, indicating a bright, sunny day, and the light reflects off the river, enhancing the natural beauty of the setting. The perspective of the photo, taken from an elevated vantage point, provides a comprehensive view of the interaction between natural landscapes and human-made structures, creating a contrasting yet harmonious environment.","title":"The Hood River.
