{"path":"545134.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set in a natural outdoor location, possibly a park or a sandy area surrounded by trees. It features two main subjects: a park ranger and a man seated on a motorcycle. Here’s a detailed description of the elements in the photo:\n\n1. **People**:\n   - **Park Ranger**: Wearing a light-colored uniform with a badge, glasses, and a serious expression, this man is standing to the left side of the image. He seems focused on writing or reading something from a yellow clipboard he’s holding.\n   - **Motorcyclist**: Seated on a red motorcycle with chrome accents, this man has a rugged appearance, characterized by wind-blown blonde hair and a denim shirt. He has a contemplative expression as he looks off to the side.\n\n2. **Motorcycle**: The motorcycle, featuring prominently in the foreground, adds an element of adventure or travel to the scene. Its intricate details, like the chrome handlebars and headlight, suggest it's well-maintained.\n\n3. **Environment**: The background is somewhat softly focused, filled with pine trees and sandy soil, creating a natural, somewhat remote setting. This gives a tranquil yet wild vibe to the scene.\n\n4. **Lighting and Atmosphere**: The overall lighting appears to be natural, likely during late afternoon, given the softness of the light and shadows. The quality of light adds a subdued tone to the image, enhancing the outdoor feel.\n\nThe composition and elements suggest a narrative of an interaction between a ranger and a motorcyclist, perhaps regarding regulations or directions within the park area. The casual posture of the motorcyclist and the attentiveness of the ranger add depth to their interaction, hinting at a story behind this moment captured on film.","title":"Motorcyclist receives ticket for riding on the National Seashore Park sand dunes","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["554876","548690","548691","545598","554874","554481","544844","553955","556206","554877","543730","544840","545596","551108","551237","553954"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["motorcycle","ranger","chrome","description","blow","park","handlebar","attentiveness","regard","clipboard"]}
