{"path":"542809.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a stark and somewhat surreal desert scene, featuring a close-up of a discarded Pepsi can on a textured, sandy surface. The can, appearing somewhat crushed and weather-worn, displays a classic blue design with the iconic red, white, and blue Pepsi logo. It lies prominently in the foreground, casting a sharp shadow on the fine, dark sand that surrounds it.\n\nBeyond the can, the scene extends to a desert landscape characterized by rippled sand that undulates gently towards the background, where a dead, branchless tree trunk protrudes from a sand dune. The treeâ€™s branches, stripped of any foliage, stretch upwards, stark against the bright sky. The horizon line is low, placing much of the visual emphasis on the vast sky above, which fills the upper half of the image.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of isolation and neglect, emphasized by the presence of trash in an otherwise natural and barren landscape. The composition and elements within the frame suggest themes of environmental impact and the encroachment of human-made objects into natural spaces.","title":"California--Arcata beach","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542978","552937","550805","556615","551246","556640","550806","544831","543614","543616","549944","556614","549043","550811","552446","544830"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["sand","can","desert","encroachment","dune","half","protrude","undulate","close","emphasis"]}
