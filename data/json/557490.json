{"path":"557490.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene by a body of water. In the foreground, a child with short hair, dressed in a light purple t-shirt and dark blue pants, is standing on a dirt and grassy area. The child appears to be engaged in feeding or interacting with a variety of waterfowl. Directly around the child are numerous ducks and a few larger water birds that are likely geese, located on both the shore and in the shallow waters.\n\nThe middle ground of the image is densely populated with more ducks and geese, enjoying the calm water and the late afternoon environment. The birds are assorted in color, varying from white and black to combinations of brown. The surface of the water reflects a serene light, signifying a clear sky above.\n\nIn the background, the scenery includes a park-like setting with more trees, some of which are quite sparse, possibly indicating a dry climate or season. The far background across the water shows what appears to be another landmass, possibly an island or the opposite shore, lined with verdant foliage and trees. There's a clear sky above with a hint of dusk approaching, based on the warm lighting. \n\nOn the left side, more people are visible; one adult and a few children are interacting or moving towards the waterfront, which suggests a communal or family leisure setting, typically seen in public parks or natural reserves. The candid and serene nature of this scene captures a harmonious interaction between humans and nature.","title":"Buena vista lagoon, is a wildlife sanctuary.  One of the last lagoons in southern California, there is concern for the body of water because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments.  Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1990.  By the early 1970's that amount had decreased to about 125,000 acres.  Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["552235","552993","552221","557126","557121","552220","553346","544838","555551","545991","557122","548542","556987","547744","546086","551501"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["duck","child","bird","feeding","interact","water","shore","verdant","landmass","reserve"]}
