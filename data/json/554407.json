{"path":"554407.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant natural scene centered around a rushing stream teeming with white, frothy water. The stream travels through a rocky bed where various sizes of rounded stones emerge prominently from the water, creating a sense of rough texture against the fluidity of the stream. The water's forceful movement suggests a lively current, and splashes can be observed where the water hits against the rocks.\n\nSurrounding the stream are abundant green foliage and branches, some of which intrude softly into the frame, adding layers and a wild, untamed feel to the scene. These plants are illuminated by sunlight, creating a contrast of light and shadow that adds depth and intrigue to the composition. The trees overhead contribute to a dappled lighting effect, with patches of light reaching through to the water and stones below.\n\nThe backdrop is comprised further of dense greenery, reinforcing the secluded and natural setting of the stream. The overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is one of serene yet dynamic natural beauty, typical of a woodland waterway.","title":"Trout stream near north branch of the Moose River","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554406","543869","544867","546171","550843","549550","555218","550678","558085","554748","544856","553416","553855","555222","544862","557823"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["stream","fluidity","stone","intrigue","teem","hit","water","bed","emerge","comprise"]}
