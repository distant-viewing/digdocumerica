{"path":"555574.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This is a photograph depicting an array of electrical power transmission towers stretching off into the distance. The scene appears to be set in a rural area characterized by an undulating landscape with some patches of greenery. The photograph captures different types and sizes of towers, each constructed with metal beams creating a series of intersecting lines against the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, shorter towers are closer together, possibly of older design, while taller, more robust towers dominating the midground and background suggest newer or higher capacity lines. The towers are interconnected by multiple levels of power lines which criss-cross the image, forming various geometric patterns against the backdrop.\n\nThe overall lighting and subdued, somewhat foggy conditions lend a soft, almost muted quality to the colors in the image. The background features gently rolling hills, the details of which are slightly obscured by atmospheric haze. There seems to be very little human activity or other architectural structures visible, giving the landscape a somewhat desolate, untouched feel.","title":"Hazy atmosphere of early morning with strip mining being carried on by coal companies behind the power lines","placename":"Athens (Ohio)","location":"Athens, Ohio","nn1":["549110","553028","557977","544355","548136","553830","543728","544296","544300","547940","549011","546054","543903","544277","544613","542643"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["towers","power","shorter","capacity","transmission","interconnect","beams","line","midground","haze"]}
