{"path":"555611.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph presents a rural scene centered around a traditional two-story house with exterior features painted predominantly in white. The house has a gabled roof with a visible chimney and an extended structure at the back. It is slightly weathered and has an aura of aging yet sturdy rural architecture. A less maintained, flatter-roofed addition is connected to the right side of the main house. \n\nIn the foreground, an extensively eroded or excavated area stretches across the image, marked by uneven, rugged soil that seems recently disturbed. This area lacks vegetation, in contrast to some lush greenery surrounding the house, suggesting possible construction or land-altering activity that disrupted the terrain. \n\nThe background of the scene offers a view of a rolling landscape, likely fields or farmland, which slopes gently into the distance under a pale blue sky. The overall impression is of a rural homestead standing against the challenges of land use and natural erosion or perhaps agricultural development.","title":"Abandoned farmhouse and out buildings are surrounded by coal company strip mined land off route #800 near Barnesville, Ohio","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["547658","547861","557746","550704","556959","558110","557750","554787","546992","551091","557141","548295","556578","546989","554822","551333"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","excavate","aura","disrupt","alter","addition","farmland","erode","land","roof"]}
