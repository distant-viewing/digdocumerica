{"path":"542778.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a deer positioned in a forest setting. The deer, appearing alert and cautiously observant, stands in the lower portion of the frame with its head raised above some foreground foliage, almost as if peeking over. Its fur is speckled and it seems to be in a state of molt, or perhaps shedding its winter coat.\n\nThe background consists of a variety of densely-packed dark green coniferous trees interspersed with some lighter green deciduous foliage, creating a rich tapestry of greens and shadows that hint at the depth and complexity of the forest environment. The lighting is dim, suggesting an overcast day or a time when the sunlight is filtered through thick tree canopies.\n\nForeground elements include patches of blurred greenery that appear to be closer to the camera lens, adding a layer of depth to the image. This suggests that the photo was taken with a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the deer while the immediate surroundings remain softly out of focus. The overall atmosphere is peaceful yet slightly mysterious, emphasizing the natural and somewhat secretive demeanor of the deer in its habitat.","title":"California--Shaver Lake","placename":"Shaver Lake (Calif.)","location":"Shaver Lake, California","nn1":["552339","544916","543279","546163","558368","554621","545902","544623","543369","550802","546159","544114","550804","545898","551367","550803"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","depth","alert","forest","tapestry","lens","foliage","peek","speckle","shed"]}
