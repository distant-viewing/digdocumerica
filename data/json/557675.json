{"path":"557675.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a scene depicting two young individuals and a woman in a relaxed outdoor setting, which appears to take place either by a residential home or a similar structure with a plain white siding and windows visible in the background.\n\nThe primary focus is on the two youths who are engaged in an activity with a turtle on the hood of an old, sizable car. The car, which has a noticeable reflective metallic finish along with visible components like windshield wipers and a radio antenna, suggests it might be from an earlier era, likely the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nOn the left, thereâ€™s a person in a yellow CAT (Caterpillar Inc. brand) cap and a striped, button-up shirt, lying prone on the hood as they closely observe or interact with the turtle. Beside this person, another young individual, shirtless except for blue overalls, is leaning forward while focusing intently on the small animal and holding something small in his hand, possibly food or an object to engage the turtle.\n\nStanding a short distance behind them is a woman, perhaps an adult supervising the activity or just passively observing. She has crossed arms, wears an orange sleeve-less top and dark pants, and is looking directly at the youngsters and the turtle, indicating either concern or casual interest in the ongoing interaction.\n\nThe setting, attire, and activity give the impression of a casual, perhaps spontaneous moment of leisure or curiosity, characteristic of a laid-back summer day in a rural or suburban home environment. Such scenes were common in small communities, showcasing a slice of everyday life involving children's curiosity and interactions with nature.","title":"Johnny Adams (in cap) and summer roommate, David Crook train their pet turtle for the Fourth of July races at nearby Unicoi State Park.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543947","556169","548488","544833","557367","548303","551032","553526","552304","555895","557755","557709","553507","553099","543856","554497"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["hood","curiosity","home","radio","youth","finish","antenna","windshield","overall","brand"]}
