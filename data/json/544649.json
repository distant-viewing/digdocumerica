{"path":"544649.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image captures an aerial view of a wetland environment, displaying a complex and intricate network of water bodies interspersed among lush green vegetation. The landscape is dominated by numerous small lakes or ponds, connected by winding water channels, surrounded by dense patches of trees and grassy areas. Some of the water bodies have a dark appearance, possibly indicating deep or murky water, contrasting with the surrounding vibrant greens of the vegetation.\n\nThe topography is flat, as is typical of wetland areas, allowing for the extensive spread of water and plant life across the landscape. The horizon stretching in the background suggests a vast, open sky with a few soft, white clouds subtly dotting it, enhancing the natural and untouched feel of the scene. The absence of any visible human-made structures or objects implies the location might be in a remote or protected natural area, offering a glimpse of nature's unaltered state. The entire scene is bathed in natural light, possibly captured during the middle of the day given the brightness and clarity.","title":"Ten Thousand Islands","placename":"Mexico, Gulf of","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545114","550569","544786","544515","547488","545033","550617","547532","550644","553856","557498","544530","550785","544760","544506","544556"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["wetland","water","spread","topography","channel","brightness","clarity","pond","absence","network"]}
