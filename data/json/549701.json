{"path":"549701.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of individuals dressed in historical military uniforms, participating in what appears to be a reenactment or a historical commemoration event. The men are lined up in a row, facing forward towards the camera, and are equipped with rifles slung over their shoulders. The uniforms are reminiscent of those worn by soldiers in the 19th-century, possibly during the American Civil War, featuring light-colored jackets, dark pants, and several wearing hats with fur detailing.\n\nIn the forefront, there is a young boy, dressed in civilian clothing, which consists of a plaid shirt, jeans, and a cap. He is holding a small drum and a drumstick, suggesting his role may be that of a drummer boy among the reenactors.\n\nThe background is outdoor, possibly in a park, given the presence of lush green trees and a clear sky. There are more similarly dressed individuals in the background, indicating a large gathering or event focused on historical reenactment. There is a festive ambiance, but with a solemn undertone as the actors take their roles seriously, embodying a period-correct demeanor. The overall composition effectively conveys a sense of historical immersion and educational engagement with the past.","title":"Old time Rifleman's meet, june 24, 1973, is held on the greenfield village green adjoining the henry ford museum of dearborn","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549698","549699","558274","549700","549697","558273","549735","549705","549729","558276","558277","558275","558271","556284","558272","558279"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["reenactment","role","uniform","boy","rifle","sling","undertone","immersion","embody","event"]}
