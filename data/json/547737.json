{"path":"547737.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph displays a somber natural scene. The foreground prominently features a dead fish, dried and decaying, lying on a mixture of rocks and pebbles near the water's edge. The area around the fish includes various debris and some small pieces of driftwood. The shallow water nearby is clear, revealing the stony lake or riverbed beneath.\n\nThe middle distance shows a flooded area with trees partially submerged, indicating a possible overflow or rising water levels in the environment. These trees are still standing, but their bases are underwater, hinting at ecological disruption possibly caused by flooding or changes in the water body's natural boundaries.\n\nIn the background, across the expanse of calm water, a bridge is visible, partially obscured by the trees. This suggests that the setting might be near a human habitation or a developed area. The sky above is clear, suggesting fair weather during the capture of this image, which contrasts with the evidence of environmental distress observed at the water's edge.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its focus on the dead fish and the flooded trees, evokes themes of ecological concern and the impact of environmental changes on aquatic life.","title":"Dead fish at Pahranagat Lake, a wildlife refuge.","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548973","546782","547687","555560","546898","552067","546779","546185","550878","546930","551122","546846","542985","543829","547704","552158"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["fish","change","water","distress","basis","evidence","riverbed","driftwood","flooding","disruption"]}
