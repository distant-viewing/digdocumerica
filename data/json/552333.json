{"path":"552333.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque outdoor scene featuring two people kayaking in calm waters near a rocky coast. The landscape includes a prominent rocky shoreline on the right side that is characterized by steep, jagged white and gray stones, interspersed with green vegetation and trees that appear to almost cling to the cliff edges. The trees are mostly coniferous with dense, dark green foliage that contrasts sharply with the light-colored rocks.\n\nThe kayak in the foreground is light blue with two occupants wearing bright orange life jackets, paddling gently. Both individuals are facing away from the camera, focusing on navigating the waters. This suggests a sense of movement and exploration in the tranquil sea. The sea itself is depicted in a lighter shade of blue, reflecting the clear sky above, which hints at good weather conditions.\n\nIn the background, the coast continues with more rugged, uneven rocky formations that suggest a natural and relatively undisturbed environment. The composition of the photograph allows for a focus on both the human activity and the natural beauty of the location, emphasizing the interaction between people and nature in a peaceful setting.","title":"Canoeing on puget sound at larrabee state park on northern puget sound","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["544759","558071","554465","543537","553988","558069","558070","550659","546349","552982","550822","550657","549996","550674","557492","550663"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["kayak","coast","sea","occupant","cling","paddle","continue","navigate","cliff","exploration"]}
