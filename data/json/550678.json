{"path":"550678.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and dynamic natural scene focused on a small, rocky river or stream. The image is rich with the textures and colors of nature, offering a sense of tranquility and the rugged beauty of a wilderness area.\n\nForeground: The foreground prominently features smoothly rounded large rocks. These stones are submerged partially in the flowing water, with one particularly prominent in the center, characterized by its large, smooth surface and a patch of green grass growing against it. This suggests that the rock is frequently above water, allowing vegetation to thrive.\n\nMiddle ground: Flowing water surrounds the rocks, looking white and frothy, indicative of a swift current. The water appears very dynamic, suggesting rapid movement which is further emphasized by the white foam and splashes around the rocks. Additional smaller rocks and patches of aquatic plants can be seen slightly submerged, adding to the sense of raw nature.\n\nBackground: The water continues to rush toward the background, where it becomes rougher and less defined, blending into colors and shapes rather than distinct elements. The lighting in the photograph enhances the texture of the water and rocks, with high contrast between the sunlit areas and the shadows, adding depth and dimension to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph skillfully balances the solidity of the rocks with the fluidity of the water, creating a scene that feels both serene and full of movement. The textures and colors – from the grey of the stones to the varying shades of brown and green in the water and vegetation – are captured with clarity, highlighting the beauty of this natural setting.","title":"Rocky course of the Androscoggin River","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["550843","554407","542557","544856","548156","555658","552061","543869","553416","546171","544862","550726","542743","542583","550658","544867"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["rock","water","fluidity","stone","flow","texture","dimension","round","movement","rush"]}
