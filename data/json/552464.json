{"path":"552464.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a large, somewhat isolated two-story house perched atop a gentle, grass-covered hill. The house, depicted under bright sunlight and a clear blue sky, appears deserted and slightly eerie in its quiet solitude. The architectural style is somewhat Victorian, with its fa√ßade decorated with symmetrical patterns and its roof structured in multiple steep pitches. The exterior of the house is pale or possibly white, complemented by dark trims and highlights around the windows and peaks.\n\nThe foreground of the photo is filled with lush green grass that looks freshly vibrant, perhaps indicating spring or summer. The grassy hill slopes gently upwards towards the house, which is positioned at the crest of the hill, dominating the landscape. There are no visible trees or other houses around it, enhancing the isolated feel. A few wildflowers can be seen sprinkled around the grass, adding small dots of color to the scene.\n\nThis composition evokes a sense of isolation and perhaps abandonment, with the large house standing alone against the vastness of the sky, suggesting themes of solitude or possibly the passage of time. The absence of people and movement gives it a static and somewhat timeless quality.","title":"Closed farmhouse in zearing","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["549195","554787","555632","554823","554822","558110","546997","544353","557669","546989","556962","548664","558159","546439","556999","554788"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","grass","solitude","sprinkle","isolated","crest","wildflower","hill","perch","static"]}
