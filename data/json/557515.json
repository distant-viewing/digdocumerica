{"path":"557515.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor setting during early evening or late afternoon, given the soft, ambient light. The main focus is a calm, reflective pond bordered by a circle of rounded rocks. A large tree, likely a type of Eucalyptus, stands prominently on the left side of the image, its image mirrored crisply in the still water of the pond. The reflection is clear, adding to the calm and tranquil atmosphere of the scene.\n\nIn the background, there is a mildly hillside on which several trees, including palm trees, are scattered. This green, wooded backdrop suggests a natural, possibly rural or semi-rural, setting. Towards the middle, multiple recreational vehicles (RVs) are parked in an orderly fashion, indicating the presence of a campground or RV park. The vehicles are neatly aligned, suggesting an organized and maintained area dedicated to outdoor recreation and camping.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a peaceful moment in a campground, emphasizing the beauty of nature and the leisurely enjoyment of the outdoors. The composition, with the central placement of the pond and tree, along with the reflections and the use of natural light, creates a balanced and pleasing visual experience.","title":"Campers at refugio state beach in Santa Barbara county California, north of Los Angeles.  This and other beaches along the coast are heavily used.  Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressures.  Restrictions on coastal development within 1,000 yards of the shoreline were tightened with the passage in november, 1972, of the coastal zone conservation act","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["558094","554776","543611","546963","553410","543561","550784","547536","554591","545293","557783","550779","558093","554623","554603","554753"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pond","reflection","circle","camping","dedicate","placement","palm","recreation","tree","hillside"]}
