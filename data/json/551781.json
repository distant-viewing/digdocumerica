{"path":"551781.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant urban scene viewed from an elevated perspective. The foreground is dominated by a lush, dense bush of bright pink roses, adding a splash of natural beauty and color. The roses obscure a significant portion of the view but through their gaps, a city street scene unfolds.\n\nTwo trees with verdant green leaves flank the sides of the image, contributing to the semi-hidden view of the street and setting a somewhat enclosed, secretive tone. Behind these natural elements, the background consists of a city street lined with parked cars. The cars are from a mix of periods, suggesting the photo might be from a few decades ago. Visible car colors include white, red, and a glimpse of other possibly darker shades.\n\nA person, possibly a man based on the attire, is walking on the sidewalk across the street. He is dressed in light-colored casual clothes and appears to be wearing a cap. He is captured mid-stride, contributing a dynamic element to the otherwise still scene.\n\nThe street itself is partially visible, with concrete sidewalks and typical curb elements like a fire hydrant peeping through. The buildings seen across the street have a classic urban residential design, probably apartments, with visible fire escapes and traditional brick construction.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is peaceful, contrasting the vibrant foreground of nature with the ordinary yet nostalgic background of an everyday city life. The image balances architectural and natural beauty, encapsulated in sharp, saturated colors and a serene atmosphere.","title":"Staircase of old brownstone house adorned with spring roses (brick wall is part of adjacent building).  30th street between third and second avenues in Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551743","551746","551747","551685","551652","551644","551739","548473","551784","551785","551665","550035","551742","557266","557257","551471"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["street","rose","fire","sidewalk","city","hydrant","car","escape","stride","gap"]}
