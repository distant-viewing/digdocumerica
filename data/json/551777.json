{"path":"551777.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vividly green, densely planted urban garden at night. The garden seems to be on a raised bed or planter which borders a sidewalk. Large, healthy leaves of various shades of green, along with some plants bearing white flowers, populate the foreground, showcasing a variety of shapes and textures. Besides the natural features, one can see part of the dark pavement of the sidewalk, subtly indicating this is an urban setting.\n\nThe background reveals a stark contrast to the lush garden, emphasizing urban elements. Here, a tall building with numerous lit windows stands imposingly. Several floors are visible, indicating the building's considerable height, and it appears to be made mostly of glass, reflecting some of the city lights and adding a glow to the scene.\n\nThe right side of the photo shows an interior space visible through large glass panels. Lights inside this space emit a warm glow, providing a cozy, inviting ambience contrasted sharply against the cold blue tones from the exterior building.\n\nAnother notable element in the photograph is the lighting. The garden is brightly lit, likely by artificial lights, which highlight the intricate details and colors of the plants. The overall composition juxtaposes the natural, lush, and vividly vibrant garden against the geometric, structured, and luminous elements of urban architecture.","title":"The spectacular indoor garden of the Equitable Life Assurance Society Building at Sixth Avenue and 52nd Street in Midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551743","551775","551755","550764","546534","546505","551620","551625","551756","548442","555372","551685","551626","551627","551488","551623"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","sidewalk","glow","planter","glass","ambience","pavement","plant","bed","night"]}
