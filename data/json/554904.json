The women are standing in clear, knee-deep water and holding hands, appearing to be playing or dancing. Both are smiling and seem to be enjoying the cool water and each other's company.\n\nOne of the women is wearing a sleeveless light purple tank top paired with white shorts, while the other is dressed in a white sleeveless top with a blue headband and similarly styled white shorts. Their casual attire suggests a relaxed, leisurely day, possibly during warm weather.\n\nThe background features a tranquil scene of lush greenery with large, tall trees that partially reflect on the water's surface, adding a sense of depth and tranquility to the setting. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is cheerful and idyllic, encapsulating a moment of pure, carefree enjoyment amidst nature.","title":"Teenage girls wading the Frio Canyon River near Leakey, Texas, while on an outing with friends near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551409","556293","544339","550242","554908","548113","550238","546320","554907","554903","551967","552952","556295","545489","557740","555649"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["short","dancing","woman","headband","company","knee","water","top","enjoyment","encapsulate"]}
