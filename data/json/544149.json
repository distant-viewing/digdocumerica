{"path":"544149.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts a suburban or rural landscape, likely in a desert or arid environment, characterized by a bright, clear sky and sparse vegetation. The main focal point is a mobile home parked beside a one-story residential building. Both structures feature pale, neutral colors that blend with the dry, grassy field surrounding them.\n\nA white picket fence runs across the foreground, extending into the distance and encircling the property. The consistency and condition of the fence suggest it is relatively new or well-maintained. Just beyond the fence, the soil appears dry and sparsely covered with grass and small plants, possibly due to the arid climate.\n\nIn the distance, there are more buildings visible, indicating a larger community or settlement in the area. The landscape beyond includes low hills or mountains, and the skyline features what seems to be a small industrial area or additional residential structures.\n\nThe scene is lit by bright sunlight, casting sharp shadows from the fence onto the ground, which indicates that the photograph was taken around the middle of the day. The overall composition conveys a sense of isolation typically associated with rural or semi-rural desert communities, with a focus on residential life and minimalistic landscaping.","title":"Mobile homes at Journey's End","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["557339","556455","552508","544147","544118","543774","544816","545205","547567","556950","548295","556629","557670","558300","544353","556417"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Construction Sites"],"terms":["fence","desert","picket","community","landscaping","settlement","property","distance","climate","skyline"]}
