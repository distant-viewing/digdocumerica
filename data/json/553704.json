{"path":"553704.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a suburban landscape, focusing on a residential area with numerous single-family homes. The houses are densely packed, with similar architectural styles characterized by pitched roofs, possibly covered with shingles, and external walls that seem to feature siding. Multiple houses display gabled roofs and attached garages. The neighborhood is relatively uniform in appearance, suggesting a planned community.\n\nIn the foreground, various trees punctuate the view, adding a touch of greenery to the residential setting. These include a prominent tree with a broad canopy on the left side of the frame and a taller, more slender tree closer to the center. They provide a natural contrast to the man-made structures.\n\nThe background features a scenic view of hills that rise gently in the distance. These hills are marked by sparse vegetation and patches of exposed soil or rock, contributing to a somewhat arid appearance. Electrical power lines stretch across the middle ground, running parallel to the rolling hills, and hinting at the infrastructure supporting this suburban development.\n\nOverall, the composition reflects a typical suburban neighborhood nestled within a valley or between hills, highlighting the interaction between residential development and the natural landscape surrounding it.","title":"Rezoning of \"surplus pineapple land\" enabled pineapple growers-turned-developers to build this subdivision in Mililani town, one solution to the island's housing shortage","placename":"Oahu (Hawaii)","location":"Oahu, Hawaii","nn1":["557405","557547","557427","553929","556601","557404","553700","557552","548011","556395","547769","553939","549071","557437","556956","548825"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["hill","neighborhood","development","house","shingle","plan","appearance","garage","roof","pitch"]}
