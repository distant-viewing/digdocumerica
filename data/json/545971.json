{"path":"545971.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a rural landscape dominated by a large, golden field likely during late summer or autumn, as suggested by the mature, dry state of the plants. The field appears to be either a type of tall grass or an agricultural crop nearing harvest. In the immediate foreground, the ground is covered with bits of crushed stone and debris, indicating a rough and less cultivated area, possibly a track or a less frequented path.\n\nThe perspective taken from ground level emphasizes the vastness of the field and leads the eye towards a distant industrial facility on the horizon. This facility includes several structures, including large tanks or silos, and what appears to be a factory complex with multiple buildings. Visually striking against this industrial backdrop is a plume of black smoke billowing out from one of the structures, contributing to an implicit commentary on industry versus nature.\n\nUtility poles line both sides of the field, receding into the distance and converging towards the industrial site, drawing a visual connection between the field and the facility, possibly hinting at the facilityâ€™s influence or impact on the surrounding area. The sky is clear and expansive, adding a sense of openness to the image, but this is contrasted by the industrial activity that marks the horizon.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the natural landscape of the field with human industrial activity, highlighting themes of land use, environmental impact, and the intersection of natural and developed spaces. The photograph serves as a document of the encroachment of industrialization into rural areas.","title":"A natural gas installation burns its petro waste marshlands in foreground near the Freeport Sulphur Co. pipeline canal.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544676","542589","553933","554807","552091","549191","545998","546398","542553","545989","555542","543668","546122","545013","546394","543159"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["field","facility","harvest","encroachment","industrialization","impact","commentary","influence","document","openness"]}
