{"path":"552601.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a busy street scene in a small town, set against a majestic mountainous backdrop. The image portrays a charming and vibrant street lined with vintage vehicles parked along the roadside and some in motion. The automobiles depicted are characteristic of late 20th-century models, suggesting the photo may be several decades old.\n\nThe architecture includes a mix of one and two-story buildings with various businesses. Visible signage includes a neon sign for \"Rexall Drugs\" and other signs advertising a cafe and possibly a men's clothing store or barber shop. The presence of these signs suggests a commercial area bustling with activity.\n\nPedestrians can be seen walking along the sidewalk, contributing to the lively street atmosphere. The greenery from the trees adds a fresh, natural element to the urban environment, contrasting with the constructed elements.\n\nAbove the street, the landscape transitions smoothly to residential homes nestled among more trees, and beyond that, the towering cliffs and mountains provide a dramatic and scenic background. This layered composition, from the busy street to the serene heights, gives a sense of the geographical setting and the community's interaction with its natural surroundings.","title":"Rifle, the major community of the Piceance Basin, is a small town with a one-street business district.
