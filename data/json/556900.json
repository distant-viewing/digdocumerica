{"path":"556900.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy and dynamic railroad yard scene, likely from the mid-20th century, judging by the style of the equipment and clothing of the workers. The focus of the image is on multiple sets of parallel railroad tracks filled with various types of freight cars, including boxcars and flatcars, some of which bear visible logos such as \"CN.\"\n\nSeveral pieces of railway maintenance equipment, including orange cranes and other heavy machinery, are seen actively being used by workers clad in typical workwear of the era, such as overalls and hard hats. The men appear to be engaged in tasks such as adjusting and repairing the railway infrastructure and the freight cars themselves.\n\nThe background reveals an industrial setting, underscored by a dense array of railroad lines stretching into the distance where smoke, possibly from a locomotive or a nearby industrial facility, billows into the sky. Various industrial buildings and possibly a distant cityscape form the distant horizon.\n\nThe photograph is enlivened by the lively human activity and the gritty, mechanical ambiance of the rail yard, illustrating the labor-intensive nature of railroad maintenance and logistics in this historical context. The image is well-composed, showing the sprawl of the rail yard leading into the industrial horizon, creating a sense of depth and the scale of operations characteristic of such facilities.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew and machinery workers are replacing old railroad ties with new ones to upgrade the roadbed. In 1974 the company spent 18.6 percent of its revenue on track maintenance. That year the company laid 91,808 tons of rails and placed 2,278,318 railroad ties. The maximum safe speed for the system's 10,531 miles of track usually is 60 miles per hour. That contrasts with another company which had some track with a maximum speed of eight miles per hour.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["551007","551006","556894","556886","556692","547140","546627","547050","556899","556783","556382","552063","546933","556879","556869","556895"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railroad","yard","freight","rail","railway","worker","workwear","maintenance","locomotive","overall"]}
