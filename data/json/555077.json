{"path":"555077.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil natural water body, likely a river or stream, viewed from an elevated perspective. The water is predominantly clear, enabling a view of the underlying rocky bed, which has smoothed surfaces suggesting constant water flow over time. Several moss-covered rocks protrude above the water surface, their greenish hues contrasting with the earthy brown tones of the riverbed and adding a touch of vibrancy.\n\nThe light, possibly sunlight, hits the water and rocks in a fashion that creates dancing reflections and some shimmering effects on the water's surface. There appears to be a subtle current visible by the movement patterns on the water, indicated by small ripples and swirls. Surrounding the water, you can see hints of verdant foliage, with some green leaves framing the top right corner of the image, which suggests the river is bordered by a wooded area.\n\nColors in the image are rich yet soothing, including shades of blue, green, brown, and hints of yellow from the sunlight. The overall mood conveyed is one of calm and unspoiled natural beauty. The composition is balanced, with the rocks centrally located drawing the viewer's focus towards the middle, while the flowing water provides a dynamic element, guiding the eye along the river's path.","title":"East fork of the humptulips river in the olympic national timberland, Washington.
