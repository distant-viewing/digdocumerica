{"path":"546064.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene set in a somewhat rural or semi-wooded area. In the foreground, there's a slightly muddy landscape with reflections in small pools of water, indicating either recent rainfall or a wet environment. Scattered dead vegetation and brown grasses suggest the area may be used for heavy operations or has been recently cleared.\n\nThe central focus of the image is a series of tall vertical tanks or cylinders, likely part of an oil refinery, chemical plant, or a facility related to the energy sector. These tanks are equipped with various pipes and valves, necessary for processing or storing liquid or gaseous materials. There are also a few horizontal storage tanks and a structure with a metal roof, which could serve as storage or a workstation. The presence of these industrial components suggests processing, manufacturing, or energy extraction activities.\n\nBehind the industrial setup, there's a dense line of tall trees, predominantly pine, which create a natural backdrop to the stark industrial equipment. The sky is overcast, contributing to a somewhat somber or muted tone in the scene, which combines natural elements with industrial activities. This juxtaposition highlights the interaction and possibly the conflict between industrial development and the natural environment.","title":"Bayou segnette swampland, which has been devastated by runoff petroleum sludge from the natural gas installation","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544179","556402","546073","546201","542705","542587","545998","546108","551082","552021","549713","550917","545836","549960","544289","555542"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["tank","energy","workstation","sector","refinery","valve","storage","cylinder","extraction","liquid"]}
