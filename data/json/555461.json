{"path":"555461.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling urban scene that includes a law enforcement officer standing beside a parked muscle car. The scene involves several vintage automobiles, reflecting an era possibly from the 1970s or early 1980s. The muscle car, distinctive with its elongated front lights and shiny grilles, has its blinking lights on, suggesting it might be stopping or about to move.\n\nThe officer is wearing a dark uniform, detailed with a badge, belt, and a white helmet, possibly indicating traffic police duties. He appears to be monitoring or managing the traffic, his posture leaning casually against his car, one hand on the vehicle, suggesting vigilance but also a moment of rest.\n\nIn the background, various cars and businesses can be observed. There's an advertising board promoting \"credit card validation,\" implying a commercial area. Nearby, a gas station can be seen with its prices and a slogan visible, while other cars indicate a busy street, possibly a main road given the density of vehicles and activity present.\n\nThe general atmosphere appears overcast or shadowy, contributing to the gritty urban feel of the scene, typical of busy city streetscapes from this era. The setting gives off a sense of routine urban activity, with a focus on transportation and everyday street surveillance or management.","title":"A police officer in Portland, controlled traffic at a gasoline station that was limiting its sales to only two gallons per customer in december, 1973","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["546635","546661","549932","554293","546631","542755","556709","557841","554354","546653","554297","546743","556724","554309","555475","549882"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["officer","car","streetscape","surveillance","enforcement","law","traffic","card","era","slogan"]}
