{"path":"549467.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This is a vibrant photograph capturing a group of people visiting a large waterfall. The scene is set on an observation platform that hugs the edge of a rocky terrain near the base of the waterfall. The waterfall is powerful and majestic, with white water cascading down in a broad sheet, generating spray and mist that can be seen in the air.\n\nThe platform is crowded with visitors dressed in varied attire, indicating this photo could be from a cooler season or a day with breezy weather. Some individuals wear jackets, long pants, and hats, suggesting they are dressed for comfort against the damp environment provided by the waterfall's spray.\n\nThe group consists of adults and a few children, standing or slowly moving along the platform, capturing the scene with their cameras or engaging with each other, pointing towards the waterfall or discussing the view. The railing of the platform is simple and metallic, with rock formations forming the base of the observation area.\n\nThe background shows more of the waterfall extending to the left side of the image with another portion of water visible at a higher level, indicating that the waterfall might be part of a larger system of falls or a river with significant breadth and volume.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of leisure and exploration, highlighting the attraction of natural wonders and the communal experience of enjoying and appreciating such sites.","title":"From the lookout point on Luna Island, visitors on the American side view the spectacular plunge of the waters at the brink of Niagara Falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549562","549560","549545","549536","549546","548021","549629","549534","549535","544342","553397","544340","549466","544335","549537","549563"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["waterfall","platform","spray","observation","base","breadth","wonder","attraction","comfort","volume"]}
