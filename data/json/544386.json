{"path":"544386.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from an industrial mining operation. In the foreground, we see a myriad of glistening raw coal chunks scattered over the ground, leading up to large mining vehicles and equipment in the background. The scene is dominated by a large yellow and blue crane with its arm extended, actively engaged in the extraction or movement of coal. To the left, a large yellow dump truck, partially visible, appears to be in motion, perhaps either receiving or transporting coal.\n\nA sizeable pile of coal forms a dark textured hill in the background, contributing to the rugged, industrial atmosphere of the scene. The ground is wet, indicated by the reflective quality of light on the surface of the coal, suggesting recent rain or the use of water in the mining process.\n\nOn the right side of the image, an individual wearing industrial workwear, including a visible safety helmet, is overseeing or working on the mining operation. This worker is turned away from the camera, focusing on the crane and its functions.\n\nThe environment appears harsh and dusty with a dim sky overhead, possibly from cloud cover or the dust raised by the ongoing industrial activities. The overall composition of the photo effectively portrays the intense and gritty nature of coal mining operations.","title":"Working a strip mine with an electric shovel","placename":"Black Mesa (Navajo County and Apache County, Ariz.)","location":"Black Mesa, Arizona","nn1":["544160","544134","545831","544165","549243","544375","557403","544099","552418","544135","544120","549171","543639","545887","554826","556466"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["coal","mining","operation","crane","workwear","myriad","chunk","dump","overhead","extraction"]}
