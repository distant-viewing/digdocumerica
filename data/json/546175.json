{"path":"546175.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up of an old, weathered wooden wagon with two visible wheels. The wagon's body shows signs of wear and tear and is constructed of dark, aged wood, with metal braces and bolts. The wooden wheels are large, featuring numerous spokes and a metal rim around the exterior that is also showing rust, indicative of exposure to the elements.\n\nThe wagon is parked beside a rustic wooden fence that appears similarly aged and worn. The fence is made of roughly hewn logs, stacked horizontally and held together by vertical posts.\n\nIn the background, there seems to be a grassy area with some greenery visible, implying that the photo was taken outdoors, likely in a rural or semi-rural setting. There's a clear sky which suggests it might be taken during daytime under good weather conditions.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its focus on historical or agrarian artifacts, evokes a sense of nostalgia and reflects a bygone era of manual labor and simpler living conditions. The lighting and clarity of the image suggest it might have been taken during the late afternoon, adding to the mood of tranquility and abandonment.","title":"Old carriage stands in front of Leakey's first schoolhouse which dates back to 1879.","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["543120","553984","543118","546142","542897","543354","553986","554561","552673","552448","553985","544225","543342","557701","552995","544767"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["wagon","wheel","fence","tear","bolt","rim","artifact","nostalgia","metal","living"]}
