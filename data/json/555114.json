{"path":"555114.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a dense forest scene dominated by tall, slender coniferous trees. These trees are tightly packed, exhibiting rich, dark green foliage which contrasts with the light brown of their trunks. Beneath the canopy of these larger trees, a variety of younger, smaller trees can be observed, suggesting a naturally regenerating forest environment.\n\nThe forest floor is uneven and partly visible, covered with fallen branches, some of which are quite large and rest horizontally, crossing each other. The undergrowth seems minimal due to the dense canopy blocking much of the sunlight, although some small bushes and plants are visible.\n\nIn the background, the density of the trees slightly lessens, allowing a glimpse of further wooded areas or possibly a clearing. The upper part of the image shows the sky, just seen through the treetops, suggesting it is either dusk or dawn, given the dim yet natural lighting condition which bathes the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the towering and lush nature of the forest, highlighting the tranquility and vibrant ecosystem of a coniferous woodland. No human activity is evident, reinforcing a sense of serene isolation.","title":"Douglas fir trees 20 to 40 years old in the foreground and mature Douglas firs behind them in olympic national timberland Washington.
