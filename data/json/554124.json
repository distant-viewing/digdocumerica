{"path":"554124.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image features a bright red fire hydrant prominently displayed in the foreground on the left side of the frame. The hydrant is traditional in style, with a rounded top and multiple nozzles. It is situated on a patch of ground with mixed grass and soil, showing some stones and small plants near its base.\n\nIn the background, there's a rural scene including a winded dirt road that stretches from the foreground into the distance, where it curves to the right. Along the side of this road, a small yellow sign with black writing can be seen, though the text is not readable from this distance. Scattered along the road are several rocks serving as a makeshift edge. The road is bordered by lush green grass and trees. In the far background, more dense patches of trees or bushes can be seen, contributing to a calm and serene landscape under a sky filled with large, fluffy white clouds against a bright blue backdrop. The photograph emits a peaceful, rustic vibe, typically found in countryside settings.","title":"Developers sign, evidence of land speculation in Puna area near Kalapana.
