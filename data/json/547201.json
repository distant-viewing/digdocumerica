{"path":"547201.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant outdoor scene, capturing a moment of youthful play in an urban park setting. In the foreground, there is a young child, likely a boy, in mid-action as he kicks a black soccer ball across a stretch of green grass. He is dressed casually in a t-shirt and shorts, suggesting the weather is warm and comfortable.\n\nThe background of the image features a mix of natural and urban elements. Behind the playing child, several leafless trees suggest the season could be either late fall or early spring. A line of parked cars along the road adds a typical city element, showcasing various models which seem to be from the mid-20th century, indicating the photo might be several decades old.\n\nProminent in the scene are towering high-rise buildings that loom in the background, typical of a densely populated urban environment. These buildings cast shadows over portions of the park, contrasting with the brightly lit patches illuminated by the possibly setting sun.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is one of relaxed, everyday city life where nature and urbanity coexist, providing a playground for the child. The setting also offers a snapshot of a time period, likely around the 1960s or 1970s, hinted by the architecture and vehicle designs, enveloped in the soft, nostalgic quality of film photography.","title":"Highrise buildings border Lincoln Park, Chicago's largest lakefront park.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551769","546537","553512","549271","552755","551768","545404","545400","557410","556431","551721","551725","555928","552035","556166","547176"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","park","playground","ball","city","stretch","photography","t","film","decade"]}
