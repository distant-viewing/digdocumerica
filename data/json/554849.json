{"path":"554849.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of tender caregiving in a bedroom setting, with an elderly woman resting on the bed and a male nurse attending to her. The room is lit by natural light coming through a large window, which reveals a glimpse of a peaceful, leafy outdoor area.\n\nThe woman, who appears elderly with visible gray hair and glasses, is lying back on a bed with a high wooden headboard, dressed in a long-floral patterned dress that reaches up to her neck. She appears calm and is being cared for, with her right leg raised slightly as the nurse wraps or unwraps her lower leg, possibly adjusting or removing a bandage.\n\nThe nurse, a middle-aged man exhibiting professional demeanor, is dressed in a crisp white uniform, indicating his medical or caregiving role. He is focused on his task, ensuring the woman's comfort.\n\nThe room possesses a homely atmosphere with a traditional aesthetic, emphasized through furnishings like the wooden bed frame, soft bedding, and a side table holding what appears to be a book or medical supplies. The sheer window blinds filter the soft daylight enhancing the serene and intimate feel of the scene. The overall composition of the photograph emphasizes care and attentionâ€”themes reflected in both the actions and the environment.","title":"A doctor from the Leakey, Texas, area visiting an elderly patient, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["543906","558338","553035","553545","545407","558172","558171","545478","558335","545486","558167","545552","556556","552931","558314","545408"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["bed","care","leg","room","woman","blind","furnishing","possess","remove","comfort"]}
