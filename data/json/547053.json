{"path":"547053.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of what appears to be a coastline affected by significant erosion or some form of environmental disruption. The key elements in this image include a large body of dark, muddy water contrasting with lighter, agitated water that has waves and maybe some foam. Both areas of water are bordered by land that shows signs of saturation and wear, possibly from water flow or weather conditions.\n\nOn the closer embankment, there are constructed barriers that look cylindrical and interconnected; they appear to be some type of temporary or makeshift measures to possibly prevent further erosion or to contain the water. A large, industrial crane or excavation machine is situated near the water’s edge on what looks like a dirt path leading up to the water. There’s also another solid line of road or pathway that comes perilously close to the eroded area.\n\nThe broader setting indicates a sparsely vegetated landscape, indicative of a rugged coastal or riverine environment. No buildings or people are clearly visible in the scene, emphasizing the focus on the interaction between human-made structures and the natural environment. The color palette consists largely of earth tones with the striking contrast provided by the dark and light waters. The perspective provided by the aerial view emphasizes the scale and the impact of the environmental phenomena depicted.","title":"Working to curb erosion of the Lake Michigan shoreline","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["555846","548641","547098","552169","551176","545938","544650","552427","545024","545904","544282","545854","555598","545680","544639","551231"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["water","erosion","phenomenon","prevent","embankment","disruption","measure","affect","saturation","foam"]}
