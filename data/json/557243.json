{"path":"557243.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of environmental pollution where a man is walking through a heavily polluted waterway. The water appears dark and contaminated with various debris, including cans and other indistinguishable objects floating on the surface. This man, dressed in a light-colored T-shirt and dark pants, seems to be wading through the water while carrying a metal bucket in his right hand.\n\nThe surroundings of the waterway are densely overgrown with green bushes and trees, suggesting a somewhat neglected or overgrown area. In the background, there's a contrasting and stark industrial setting visible. It features large metallic structures that are part of an industrial facility, including towers and elevated platforms that are rusty and show signs of weathering.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights a stark juxtaposition between nature and industrial development, emphasizing the impact of industrial activities on natural water bodies and raising concerns about environmental degradation and pollution.","title":"Employee of the Pennsylvania state department of environmental resources wades in the monongahela river to take a water sample from an outfall at a sintering plant at the united states steel corporation's Homestead works near Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.
