{"path":"547504.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a group of four individuals collecting or examining items on a rocky tidal flat by the sea. The environment appears wet and slightly muddy, indicating it might be low tide. The sea forms a calm, serene background with a subtle gradient from dark to a lighter hue, suggesting an overcast or foggy day. Each person is bent over or crouched down, closely inspecting the ground, likely searching for marine life such as shellfish or examining tidal pool ecosystems.\n\nThe individuals are equipped with buckets, colored in bright oranges and yellows, which provide a contrast to the otherwise muted tones of the scene. They wear casual, practical attire suitable for potentially wet conditions, including hats, boots, and gloves, underlining the hands-on nature of their activity.\n\nThe composition of the photograph emphasizes the expanse of the tidal flat and the small scale of human activity in comparison to the vastness of the natural environment, invoking a sense of humble interaction with nature. The flat is textured with patterns of water pools and rocky formations, enhancing the visual interest of the scene.\n","title":"Gathering periwinkles (edible snails)","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["545095","552278","552286","552305","545208","552289","543492","552290","545204","547020","545077","551411","546336","546334","544274","546308"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["flat","pool","examine","shellfish","buckets","search","sea","comparison","otherwise","crouch"]}
