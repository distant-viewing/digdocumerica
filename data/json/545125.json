{"path":"545125.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic view of a rugged coastline. The perspective is from an elevated position on a cliff, overlooking the ocean. The upper part of the image features a deep blue sky above the expansive ocean. There are several small rocky formations protruding from the sea, creating choppy white waves as the water crashes around them.\n\nThe lower part of the photo shows a lush cliffside, dense with wild grasses and shrubs, primarily in hues of green and brown. To the right, there's a noticeable incline leading down towards the beach. Here, accumulated driftwood can be seen along the shoreline, suggesting the tide often reaches quite high up this slope.\n\nThe image communicates a natural, untouched environment, with no visible human activity, structures, or pollution. This landscape appears both serene and dynamic, encapsulating the wildness of coastal regions. The composition uses natural lines—the slope of the cliff and the horizon to guide the viewer’s eye through the scene, emphasizing the contrast between the verdant cliff and the vast ocean.","title":"Oregon--Coos Bay","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["543061","545129","543184","543300","545230","543291","545934","543080","553771","545226","543297","545122","543374","543049","547991","543243"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","ocean","slope","wildness","incline","accumulate","crash","encapsulat","driftwood","tide"]}
