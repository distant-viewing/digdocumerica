{"path":"550664.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a tree trunk with multiple signs posted on it. The main sign, which is prominent in the foreground, reads \"FISHERMEN\" at the top in bold letters, followed by regulations about fishing in the area. It specifies the types of fishing allowed during certain periods and bag limits for the catch. The sign includes a legal disclaimer and names an official presumably in charge of the fishery management.\n\nThe background subtly reflects a tranquil water body, suggesting that the tree is located near a lake or a river. Reflections of the sky and surrounding trees can be seen in the water, creating a serene and naturalistic setting. The lighting is dim, possibly indicating that the photograph was taken at dawn or dusk, adding a moody atmosphere to the scene.\n\nUndergrowth is visible at the bottom of the image, indicating that this area might be lush and perhaps frequently visited by fishermen given the need for posted regulations. The composition of the photo, focused on the tree and the sign, tells a story of conservation and recreational fishing management.","title":"Notice for fishermen at \"13-Mile Woods\" near Errol.
