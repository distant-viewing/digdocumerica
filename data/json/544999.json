{"path":"544999.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial area situated near a large body of water, which appears to be either a lake or sea. The image is captured from a high vantage point, lending an extensive view over the industrial landscape. It features multiple large, flat buildings, likely factories or warehouses, outlined with visible emissions of steam or smoke rising into the hazy, overcast sky. One can note patches of vegetation interspersed within the area, most prominently at the foreground and slightly greener at the fringes of this industrial zone. The daylight conditions and the presence of parked cars suggest normal working hours. Additionally, environmental conditions such as mist or industrial pollution contribute to a slightly obscured and muted color palette in the photograph.","title":"Pulp mill air pollution","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548070","555769","548340","545268","551566","549508","549969","545987","555776","547696","546083","552187","543001","550890","552181","555770"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["fringe","emission","condition","warehouse","hour","vantage","steam","mist","zone","factory"]}
