{"path":"543655.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a young girl standing in a field of dandelions. The girl, with flowing red hair illuminated by sunlight, is wearing a blue and white horizontal-striped sweater and dark pants. She is holding a garden hose, which extends into the grass. The expression on her face shows enjoyment mixed with concentration as she undertakes the activity of possibly watering the plants or playing with the hose.\n\nThe setting is a rustic and somewhat rural area, indicated by the presence of buildings that appear slightly dilapidated in the background. These buildings add to the serene yet unkempt charm of the scene. The field is lush with green grass and sporadic white dandelion heads that are likely in their seed stage, speckling the landscape with white.\n\nThe lighting in this scene is particularly notable, with the sun casting dynamic shadows and highlighting the girlâ€™s hair and the texture of the grass. This adds a warm, golden tone to the entire image, enhancing the idyllic, peaceful atmosphere of a simple, joyful moment in nature.","title":"Colorado--Telluride","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["544747","542703","543979","543740","543319","552957","543468","543457","556546","551005","543040","546566","551728","549254","543688","553078"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["dandelion","girl","hose","grass","seed","hair","field","sweater","charm","concentration"]}
