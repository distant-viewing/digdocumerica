{"path":"550893.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph features a bright red tugboat bustling through a body of water, creating a significant wake due to its speed. The boat is equipped with large tires lining its side, presumably for buffering against other vessels or structures. The top of the tugboat features a prominent wheelhouse, from which the vessel is operated, painted in white with numerous windows for visibility.\n\nIn the background, there is an industrial setting characterized by multiple large structures, including storage tanks and towers, common in chemical plants or oil refineries. Several columns of smoke or steam are visible, rising from the tall chimneys and dispersing into the sky, indicating active industrial operations. The overall environment suggests a busy industrial harbor area, where maritime and industrial activities coincide.\n\nThe color palette of the scene is dominated by the bold red of the tugboat against the muted grays and blues of the industrial backdrop, providing a stark contrast that draws the viewer's eye primarily to the actions of the boat. The composition captures a moment of dynamic industrial activity, combining elements of maritime and industrial functionalities.","title":"Tugboat in the Houston ship channel, with oil storage tanks in the background","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["546938","550892","550894","551008","550901","550913","546832","550872","546836","550896","551179","546845","555798","549819","547061","548067"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tugboat","vessel","refinery","boat","disperse","harbor","bust","wake","oil","speed"]}
