{"path":"553065.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and relaxed moment in a lush, green park setting. The scene is filled with several groups of people engaged in various leisure activities, conveying a sense of communal recreation.\n\nOn the foreground and left side of the image, a couple is lounging on a vibrantly colored blanket, with the woman resting her head on the man's lap, suggesting an intimate and relaxed moment. Both are dressed casually; the man in jeans and the woman in a light dress.\n\nTowards the background, another group is seated around a picnic table, partly obscured by the leaves and branches that frame the image, which hints at a casual social gathering. A man wearing a hat is visible, suggesting a sunny day out.\n\nTo the right, there is a notably sharp image of an individual dressed in a white shirt, with a child sitting beside him. This person appears to be watching something out of frame or possibly overseeing the children, adding a thoughtful or supervisory tone to this part of the scene.\n\nThe trees above provide a dappled shade that contributes to the idyllic and summery feel of the park. The ground is scattered with dried leaves and patches of sunlight, which highlight the natural and serene setting of the photograph. The overall atmosphere is warm and welcoming, suited for relaxation and community bonding.","title":"White Rock Lake. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
