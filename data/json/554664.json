{"path":"554664.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat dramatic forest scene. A person is seen from behind, navigating a narrow, leaf-strewn trail flanked by tall, moss-covered rock walls rising steeply on either side. The forest surrounding this natural pathway is rich with varieties of trees, many of which are bearing autumnal leaves, hinting at the season. The trees reach high, their branches filtering the light which adds to the moody ambience of the setting. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet solitude and emphasizes the scale of the natural environment compared to the solitary figure walking through it. The focus and perspective draw the viewerâ€™s eye along the trail with the hiker, inviting a feeling of exploring or venturing into the woods.","title":"Hikers skirting a rock face on a trail up Slide Mountain near Lake Placid, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557822","557018","554720","553464","554705","558082","543445","554663","553373","557821","543490","555215","543446","542753","554976","554718"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["trail","hiker","forest","ambience","leaf","moss","pathway","season","feeling","solitude"]}
