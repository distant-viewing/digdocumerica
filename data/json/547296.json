{"path":"547296.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image features a whimsical and colorful roadside mailbox stand, artistically crafted to resemble a cartoon-like horse. The horse, predominantly red, with a white mid-section and a white face, stands upright on two legs. It has a playful expression and appears to be holding the mailbox with one of its front legs as if it were a briefcase. The mailbox itself is a standard, horizontal design, painted blue.\n\nTo the left of the mailbox, there is a rustic wooden sign attached to a wooden post. The sign reads, \"WYMORE RURAL FIRE DIST. 44.\" It appears hand-painted, with irregular lettering in a dark color against a lighter background.\n\nThe setting of the photograph is a lush, green roadside area. The background shows a curve of a paved road lined with grass and a few small trees, possibly indicating a rural locale. The road extends into the distance, hinting at a quiet, pastoral environment.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a creative and charming approach to everyday rural life, infusing functionality with art and humor.","title":"This little piggy minds the mail.
