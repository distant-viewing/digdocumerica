{"path":"543667.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene, framed through the wooden bars of a structure, likely a fence or a gate. In the center of the image, a farmer is seen operating an older model red tractor, which is tilling or cultivating a field of lush green crops. The figure on the tractor is dressed in a typical farm attire, including a wide-brimmed hat, providing protection from the sun.\n\nThe field that the farmer is working on is sprawling, with crops that appear healthy and well-maintained. In the background, the terrain gently rises to incorporate grassy hills and a tree-lined horizon. It suggests a tranquil, expansive rural landscape, likely dedicated to agriculture. Further in the distance, structures that could be other farm buildings or equipment can be faintly seen, blending in with the natural, green environment. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of peaceful and routine agricultural activity. The framing through wooden bars adds a layer of artistic perspective to a simple yet significant daily activity in rural life.","title":"Housing development encroaches upon farm land.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["544888","552577","557697","554204","549258","544323","557696","551333","557521","547297","546986","548950","547436","544319","547304","542654"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["farmer","tractor","bar","crop","farm","incorporate","till","gate","protection","dedicate"]}
