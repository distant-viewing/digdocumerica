{"path":"552516.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a rural landscape featuring a prominent, leafless tree with sprawling branches situated on the left side of a winding dirt road. The tree stands taller than the dense green bushes that surround its base, contributing to a stark contrast in foliage and vitality. Beyond the tree, the road curves gently to the right as it disappears into the distance, lined on either side by low grassy banks and sporadic, small green shrubs.\n\nThe sky in the background of the scene is partially covered by a few fluffy clouds, suggesting a clear day with good weather conditions. The upper branches of the tree stretch out widely, enough to slightly overhang over the road. The overall setting evokes a serene and somewhat isolated pastoral scene, likely far from urban areas. There is no visible wildlife or human activity in the photograph, emphasizing the quiet and untouched nature of the location. The natural light suggests midday or early afternoon, with sunlight casting soft shadows and enhancing the textures of the road and vegetation.","title":"\"Private road\"","placename":"Carbondale (Ill.)","location":"Carbondale, Illinois","nn1":["552484","555639","547300","549235","555818","547316","547354","554803","547546","547649","549182","556976","549261","552541","543104","554800"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","vitality","branch","disappear","overhang","sprawl","tree","midday","wildlife","bank"]}
