{"path":"553601.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of outdoor activity in a forested area. The predominant elements are densely packed trees with thin trunks stretching upwards, appearing mostly leafless which could suggest it is either during wintertime or these are predominantly coniferous trees. The ground is covered by a mix of dirt, fallen leaves, and broken branches, typical of a natural forest floor.\n\nThe focus of the photo is on two people engaged in wood cutting or forestry work. Both individuals, dressed in casual outdoor clothing suitable for physical labor, are located near the center and right side of the image. One of the individuals is using a chainsaw to cut through a fallen tree trunk which suggests they might be clearing deadwood or possibly harvesting timber.\n\nThe lighting in this photo seems natural, filtered through the scant tree canopy above, which casts a calm but somewhat somber mood over the scene. The background is softly out of focus, emphasizing the action and workers in the foreground. The surrounding environment is rugged and untouched, hinting that this activity is taking place in a remote area.","title":"In august, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the sierra mountain range near Sonora.  In post-fire salvage operation, a \"faller\" has just cut down a giant tree which the flames had desTroyed.  Clouds of soot and ashes stirred up by the crash, are beginning to drift away.
