{"path":"551979.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a large collection of deteriorated and abandoned structures floating in a large body of water. There are multiple rectangular and irregularly shaped pontoons and platforms, many of which appear to be old, broken-down barges and possibly parts of disused maritime shipping structures. They are densely packed in sections, with narrow waterways separating them. Some of the structures have remnants of metal frames and rust, indicative of significant decay and long-term exposure to harsh weather conditions.\n\nIn the background, a long bridge stretches across the photo horizontally, suggesting that this body of water is near an urban area. Further beyond the bridge, modern buildings that possibly make up a city skyline are visible, indicating an industrial or urban setting. Several small boats can be seen moving through the water around the abandoned barges, and there are various smaller structures that might be related to maritime or industrial functions on the waterâ€™s edge.\n\nThe palette of the photo is dominated by muted tones of browns and blues, reflecting the aged and industrial nature of the scene. The overall impression is one of neglect and the passage of time, illustrating a scene possibly related to industrial decline or the remnants of a once-active maritime area.","title":"Shutters island, at the mouth of Arthur Kill, is a graveyard for sunken barges and derelict vessels.
