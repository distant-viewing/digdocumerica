{"path":"544357.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"In the photograph, a young boy stands confidently in front of a set of stacked tires. He wears a bright red shirt, vertically striped green and cream trousers, and polished black shoes. His hands are placed casually on the tires, giving him a relaxed yet poised stance. He is smiling at the camera, his face expressing a hint of playfulness and confidence.\n\nThe background of the image reveals a rustic setting, possibly a playground or an outdoor area as indicated by a wooden and metal structure visible in the top right corner of the frame. The ground beneath the boy is dusty, and the lighting suggests it's either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the warm glow and long shadows. The atmosphere feels informal and outdoorsy, marked by a touch of rural life.","title":"Navaho boy leans against tower of discarded tires.
