{"path":"553415.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a lush, forested area. The primary focus is on a group of about ten people standing on a rustic wooden bridge that spans across a small stream. The individuals in the group vary in age and are casually dressed, suitable for a day outdoors. They appear engaged in an exploration or tour, with some looking at elements off the bridge or conversing with each other.\n\nIn the foreground, slightly distanced from the group on the bridge, there is a young woman sitting alone on a rock wall, possibly taking a break or enjoying a moment of solitude. She has her knees drawn up and seems to be holding something small in her hand.\n\nThe environment around them is dense with tall trees, primarily evergreens, suggesting that this might be in a temperate forest location. The vegetation is lush and green, indicating it might be somewhere with a relatively moist climate or during a season of growth. The light overcast sky casts a soft, diffused light, enhancing the tranquil and serene ambiance of the setting. The overall composition and setting evoke a sense of calmness and connection with nature.","title":"Mine Falls Park consists of three miles of attractive woodland along the shore of the Nashua River. The Nashua Conservation Commission envisions it as a nature preserve, with facilities for hiking, picnicking, bicycling and eventually swimming once the heavily polluted river is cleaned up. Members of the commission are on an outing to study the park's possibilities.","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["557985","558066","553752","557005","546803","553357","553756","554663","543467","550213","554672","557024","543233","543446","545290","545512"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["bridge","group","evergreen","tour","calmness","knee","break","connection","stream","growth"]}
