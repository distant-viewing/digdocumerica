{"path":"556446.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial mining scene. In the foreground, there is a heavy-duty, red mining vehicle with large wheels and a flat top, possibly used for transporting equipment or materials. It sits on muddy terrain scattered with small rocks and debris. To the left, another similar vehicle can be seen, and various pieces of equipment, possibly including pylons and metal parts, are strewn about the area.\n\nThe central focus of the image is a large mine entrance carved into a rock face. The entrance is framed by wooden beams, suggesting reinforcement and structural support. The rock face itself shows layers of geological strata, indicating the cutting through various sedimentary layers â€” a typical feature in mining operations.\n\nBehind the vehicle and mine entrance, the environment is rugged and natural, with trees and vegetation that hint at a location possibly nestled in a valley or a mountainous area. The lighting in the image, likely natural and subdued, suggests an overcast day which casts an overall gloom over the scene, emphasizing the stark industrial activity against the natural backdrop.","title":"Machinery surrounds the opening of a new coal mine, called the Robin Mine, owned by the Alma Coal Corporation near Clothier and Madison, West Virginia. It is called a punch mine because it is \"punched\" or cut into the face of the hill. It is also referred to as a drift mine. Eight miners were working on openings; no machinery had yet been placed in the mine for digging coal.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554765","544107","549245","544139","543785","544135","554828","544110","543639","554826","553049","549148","544099","545831","544165","556505"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["entrance","mining","mine","rock","reinforcement","cutting","stratum","vehicle","layer","face"]}
