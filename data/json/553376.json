{"path":"553376.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a group of three people, presumably a family, engaging with nature in a forested setting. The composition has a shallow depth of field, focusing particularly on the foreground where the activities are centered.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a woman with long brown hair tied back and wearing a blue buttoned shirt is closely examining a small pine branch that she holds delicately in her hands. She appears thoughtful and absorbed in her examination of the pine needles.\n\nNext to her, a younger woman or a teenage girl, wearing glasses and a brownish, collared sweater, looks on attentively at the branch. Her facial expression suggests interest and curiosity about what is being shown or discussed.\n\nOn the far right, there is a young child, likely a toddler, held close to the second woman's chest. The child, dressed in a simple blue shirt, also appears engaged with the natural surroundings, reaching out towards some bushes with a look of exploration and wonder.\n\nThe background is a softly blurred tapestry of greenery, indicating that this moment is happening in a richly wooded area, possibly during a nature walk or a similar outdoor activity. The lighting in the photograph suggests it's a bright, sunny day, casting natural light that enhances the lush, green environment around the subjects. The atmosphere conveys a sense of peaceful exploration and connection with nature.","title":"\"fern freaks\" follow the shore of the nissitisset river, a branch of the Nashua, in search of rare ferns, lady slippers and other wild flowers","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553377","543467","553357","557005","545308","544739","545512","543238","543446","557006","554665","554662","553364","543233","543466","553755"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["pine","exploration","happene","buttoned","brownish","woman","wonder","toddler","branch","child"]}
