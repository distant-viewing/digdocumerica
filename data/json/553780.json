{"path":"553780.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures three snorkelers engaged in exploring underwater in a coastal environment. The sea appears calm with light ripples on the surface, reflecting a sunny day. The water is clear, revealing some underwater rocks near the snorkelers.\n\nThe first snorkeler, closer to the foreground, is swimming towards the right. This individual is wearing a light-colored swimming cap and dark goggles, and is equipped with a snorkel. Slightly behind to the left, the second snorkeler, also wearing a light-colored cap, goggles, and snorkel, is swimming in a similar direction.\n\nFurther back, partially visible, is the third snorkeler who is distinguished by a different style, perhaps wearing fins since a blue flipper is noticeable above the water. Unlike the first two, this individual's headgear or specific details aren't clearly visible due to the perspective.\n\nIn the background, a rocky coastline forms a crescent around the bay, offering a stark contrast to the lighter tones of the sea. The coastline is characterized by steep slopes and sparse vegetation, typical of rugged coastal areas. The sea and coastline meet under a clear sky, emphasizing a tranquil marine setting ideal for such water activities. This setting suggests a remote or protected area, likely popular for snorkeling due to its clear waters and natural surroundings.","title":"Koko Head Park in the Hanauma Bay Marine Life Conservation District is a popular snorkeling and skin diving spot.
