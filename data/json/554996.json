{"path":"554996.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph prominently features a cluster of large, lush ferns that display a vibrantly healthy green color. The ferns are densely packed, covering the entire frame with their broad, delicate fronds, which overlap each other, creating a textured appearance and a feeling of depth. The ferns seem to be thriving, suggesting a moist, possibly shaded environment typically found in forested or jungle areas. There is no visible sky or ground; the image is entirely filled with fern leaves. The lighting seems natural, possibly with sunlight filtering through canopy gaps above, enhancing the vibrant green hues and casting subtle shadows across the fronds. This contributes to a sense of serenity and untouched natural beauty. There are no people, man-made objects, or animals visible, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the natural flora and its details.","title":"Western red cedar foliage in Olympic National Park Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555049","555191","555192","555050","553589","553590","555093","554993","554957","545285","553358","555054","543542","555043","554972","554991"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fern","frond","overlap","gap","thrive","serenity","flora","find","animal","canopy"]}
