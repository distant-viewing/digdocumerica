{"path":"554261.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a winter scene, presumably in a ski-resort town given the presence of snow and individuals carrying ski equipment. The main subject is a person dressed in bright, 1970s-style ski attire—a vivid yellow ski suit paired with a yellow hat—and they are holding a pair of red skis and black ski poles. This individual is wearing sunglasses, a red neck scarf, and black gloves, suggesting they are fully prepared for a day of skiing.\n\nThe person is standing on a paved path beside a snow-covered curb. The background features a quaint mountain town with snowbanks, a few pedestrians likely also engaged in skiing activities as they are dressed in winter gear. The architecture suggests small-town buildings with a traditional, perhaps Alpine-inspired, aesthetic. Snow-covered mountains in the distance and a clear blue sky give a serene and scenic feel to the setting, emphasizing a popular winter sports atmosphere. This photograph likely captures a moment of leisure and sport in a vibrant ski community.","title":"In the village","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554275","554259","554238","554289","554244","554243","554279","554267","554235","554262","554221","554276","554242","554251","554282","550017"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["ski","skiing","winter","town","snow","sport","scarf","resort","mountain","glove"]}
