{"path":"542865.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a deforested landscape under a clear blue sky. The foreground is covered with scattered debris, mostly consisting of large tree stumps and felled logs. The ground appears rocky and uneven, with some areas glistening in the sunlight, possibly due to the presence of small rocks or wet surfaces.\n\nThe mid-background shows a line of tall, thin trees that have been spared from cutting, standing on a slightly elevated area. These trees are sparsely spaced, suggesting that the area might have once been more densely forested.\n\nIn the far background, beneath the tree line, hints of a misty mountain or hill can be seen, adding a sense of depth to the scene. The silhouette of the remaining trees against the sky gives a stark, almost desolate contrast to the relatively bright and exposed foreground. The entire scene conveys a sense of loss and the stark impact of logging or similar industrial activity on a natural environment.","title":"Clear cut and burnt-over area","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["545138","542820","555150","555094","555148","555221","555136","555092","542840","546060","555139","555208","555104","545143","555107","543757"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["loss","tree","stump","line","log","silhouette","impact","rock","hint","debris"]}
