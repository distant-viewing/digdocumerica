{"path":"557999.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a wooded area, depicting a narrow, contaminated stream flowing through the forest. It appears that pollutants have affected the water, which shows visible signs of contamination, such as an unnatural blueish white coloration possibly from chemicals. The banks of the stream are muddy, surrounded by dense underbrush and scattered foliage.\n\nFallen branches and debris clutter the course of the stream, suggesting neglect or natural decay in the area. The surrounding vegetation is thick, featuring various types of plants and trees, some of which lean over the water, creating a shadowed and secluded atmosphere.\n\nThe overall setting gives a sense of an environment in distress, highlighting the intrusion of pollution in what would otherwise be a natural and potentially serene woodland stream. The image serves as a stark reminder of environmental issues relating to water bodies in forested areas.","title":"An oily substance in water is seen near the railroad tracks and from the area north of this point near the cuyahoga river and Peninsula, Ohio, which is north of Akron.
