{"path":"545758.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of outdoor adventure and exploration in a rugged, natural environment. The setting is within a narrow, winding canyon with distinctively layered rock walls that show years of geological formation. The curved lines in the rock surface lead toward a smooth, sandy path at the bottom of the canyon.\n\nIn the foreground, a person with shoulder-length hair is depicted from behind, equipped for hiking or backpacking. They are carrying a large red backpack, possibly containing supplies for an extended outdoor excursion. This person is also holding a camera and seems to be either setting up for a shot or reviewing a previous capture, suggesting an interest in documenting their experiences. They are wearing long pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and boots, appropriate attire for rugged terrain.\n\nFurther in the background, another individual is visible, walking away and deeper into the canyon. This second person reinforces the sense of exploring or traversing the canyonâ€™s length.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of adventure, isolation, and the beauty of natural, untouched landscapes.","title":"A hiker in the Maze, a remote and rugged region in the heart of the Canyonlands. In these wild sections there are not trails, and the explorer must rely on map and compass. Previous experience is necessary: water is scarce, the terrain unforgiving and help is sometimes days away. But the rewards are great, and many people feel that this is the only way to truly experience the Canyonlands.","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544301","545697","544931","545768","545759","544903","544917","545762","545766","544895","545704","544305","545785","545772","545781","545780"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","adventure","length","person","review","excursion","traverse","backpack","rock","hiking"]}
