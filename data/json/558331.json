{"path":"558331.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man sitting alone on a swing in a peaceful, outdoor setting during what appears to be the late afternoon or early evening, judging by the soft lighting. The swing is a traditional white wooden garden swing suspended from a metal frame, situated on a neatly trimmed lawn.\n\nThe man is dressed in a short-sleeved, striped blue and white shirt, dark trousers, and dark shoes. He wears glasses and has a serious, contemplative expression. There is a hint of smoke around him, suggesting he might be smoking, though the object itself is not clearly visible.\n\nThe background features a well-maintained residential area. Behind the swing, there is a lush green grass and a partial view of a white house with a small, visible porch. Another house, slightly obscured, can be seen in the distance. The trees surrounding the area enhance the tranquil suburban atmosphere of the scene, suggesting a quiet and serene environment typical of a residential neighborhood.","title":"Senior citizens find that New Ulm, Minnesota, is a good place to retire. There is a close community responsibility towards older people no matter what their financial position might be. Older citizens and those unable to care for themselves physically are cared for in two community facilities, Alexander Home and Highland Manor. New Ulm is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["556489","555580","547355","545524","552523","556488","558321","552722","548614","548615","557363","545232","556484","548458","548660","552871"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["swing","smoke","house","suspend","judge","shoe","trim","lawn","garden","porch"]}
