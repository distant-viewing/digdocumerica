{"path":"544180.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a drought-impacted landscape. The foreground is dominated by cracked earth, indicating a severe lack of water. These cracks create a mosaic of dry, parched soil plates. A disused loose pipe and some pieces of wood debris are scattered across the cracked ground, suggesting abandonment and a lack of maintenance.\n\nThe middle of the image shows a large expanse of similarly cracked ground that transitions into a pool of stagnant water. This body of water reflects the light and sky but is bordered by the extensive drying terrain, highlighting the effects of prolonged aridity.\n\nIn the background, there are dense, green trees lining the horizon, creating a sharp contrast with the dryness of the foreground. The sky above appears clear and somewhat bright, suggesting a sunny day without precipitation.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a striking visual of environmental stress, possibly indicating a region experiencing drought conditions. The presence of water amidst the cracked earth also suggests the uneven distribution of hydration, emphasizing the severity and impact of drought on this landscape.","title":"Draining of marsh leaves floor of dry, cracked mud","placename":"Grand Isle (La. : Island)","location":"Grand Isle, Louisiana","nn1":["544184","552060","552053","549201","542863","544176","557417","545004","544751","552435","552059","549034","544733","547661","550397","552056"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["crack","drink","lack","prolonge","drying","visual","severity","stress","earth","impacte"]}
