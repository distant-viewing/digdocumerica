{"path":"556482.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a seated older woman inside a wooden house. The woman is wearing a pink dress and a matching headwrap, seated comfortably on what appears to be a couch or a padded bench. To her right, there is a clear glass bottle containing a red liquid, possibly a soft drink, placed on the floor. A wooden chair with square rungs and a part of another upholstered furniture piece, possibly a chair or a couch, can be seen to the left of the frame. \n\nThe room is relatively cluttered and lived-in. Behind the woman, a pile of assorted items including what seems to be fabrics, newspapers, and other personal belongings is visible, creating a sense of coziness or domestic clutter. A floral-print fabric covers some of these items. The rear wall is made of wood planks, and the daylight outside is visible through a window directly behind the woman, softly lighting the scene and creating a serene atmosphere. The overall ambient is homey, and the scene captures a moment of quiet and personal space within a domestic setting.","title":"Mrs. Thaxton, 90, is a widow and mother of retired miners who live in Rhodell, West Virginia, near Beckley.
