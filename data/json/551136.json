The image shows a busy street lined with a variety of parked cars and traffic that includes vans and sedans, exhibiting designs typical of the 1960s or 1970s. The roadway is bustling, filled with several pedestrians walking along the sidewalks and crossing the street.\n\nThe architecture along the street includes multi-story buildings of varying designs that host a mix of businesses. Key visible signage includes “HOTEL DANIEL BOONE,” “STERLING,” “Union Mission,” and “Coca-Cola.” Other signs advertise services like printing, auto repair, and several food and drink options, suggesting a diverse commercial area.\n\nSeveral neon signs and cable lines crisscross above the street, adding to the busy, eclectic urban atmosphere. The setting has an air of past-era charm, evidenced not just by the architecture and cars, but also by the style of signage and overall layout of the street. It’s a snapshot of city life, capturing a moment of daily activity and commerce.","title":"Capitol street in downtown Charleston, seen from the railroad, looking toward the kanawha river","placename":"Charleston (W.
