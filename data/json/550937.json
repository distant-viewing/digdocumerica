{"path":"550937.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet industrial scene by a large body of water, likely a river or bay. The foreground features several individuals, possibly a family, standing on a jagged, rocky shoreline. The figures are silhouetted against the glittering water, suggesting the image was taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon when the sun is low. The individuals appear engaged in leisure activities, possibly fishing or just enjoying the view.\n\nThe water itself is a prominent element, dotted with countless reflections of sunlight, creating a shimmering effect that contrasts with the darker tones of the foreground and background.\n\nIn the background, there is an industrial skyline marked by various structures including tall chimneys emitting smoke, spherical storage tanks, and other industrial facilities that indicate the area's industrial nature. There also appears to be a water tower and possibly a dome-shaped building among the facilities, underscoring the active industrial operations in this region.\n\nThe overall composition balances the natural beauty and tranquility of the water and the human presence at its edge with the industrial backdrop, offering a snapshot that speaks to human interaction with industrial environments. The scene is framed with a natural border of the shoreline and rocks, directing the viewer's focus towards the individuals and the industrial horizon beyond them.","title":"Fishing at sunset in the Houston ship channel.
