{"path":"556881.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of railway track maintenance or construction. Two workers are actively engaged in manual labor on the railway track. They are bending over, seemingly picking or handling metal components such as bolts or spikes, essential for securing the rails. Both workers are wearing safety helmets, one in orange and the other in white, and they are dressed in long-sleeve shirts and pants, which suggests attention to safety measures typical in such industrial environments.\n\nBehind the workers, there is a large, orange railway maintenance machine. The machine appears robust, equipped with a cabin and various operational apparatuses, likely used for laying, repairing, or maintaining the tracks. There is also another worker visible near the machine, supervising or managing the work, also wearing a safety helmet.\n\nThe setting reveals that this work is taking place in a broad daylight environment, under clear skies as indicated by the bright and even lighting in the photo. The landscape around the railway track is flat and open, hinting that this might be a rural or less developed area, given the lack of visible buildings or other infrastructures.\n\nFurther down the track, other individuals and possibly more machinery can be observed, suggesting that this photograph is part of a larger operation focusing on extensive railway track work. The overall composition emphasizes the industry and effort involved in maintaining and constructing railway infrastructure.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew with machinery used to replace old track with new quarter mile long sections of rails. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded tracks per day. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of track. In that year, Southern spent 18.6 percent of its revenue on maintenance.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556897","556871","556883","556859","556012","556898","556901","556869","556874","556895","556861","556872","556870","556884","556862","556899"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","track","worker","machine","safety","helmet","maintenance","work","maintain","bolt"]}
