{"path":"552053.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a dry and cracked earth surface, with several wooden branches scattered or partially embedded across it. The setting appears to be in a rural area with a background showing lush green vegetation on an incline, suggesting that the photographed area might be at the base of a slope or near farmland. The sky, partly visible at the top left corner, is overcast, casting a dull light over the scene and enhancing the starkness of the dry ground. The dryness of the soil is so pronounced that it has formed elaborate patterns of cracks, indicating a period of severe dry weather or drought conditions. The mix of greenery and parched land speaks to a contrast in moisture availability, potentially due to irrigation or natural landscape features redirecting water away from the photographed area.","title":"Water level of the Kansas river has receded to a trickle exposing the river bed.
