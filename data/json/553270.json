{"path":"553270.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing urban scene featuring two men in a colorful setting. On the left side, a man walks from right to left. He has a full beard and is wearing a pink short-sleeved shirt, plaid shorts, and dark shoes. His posture suggests movement, and he appears to be in mid-stride.\n\nOn the right side, another man is seated with his legs crossed at the ankle and appears contemplative or relaxed. He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved button-up shirt, dark pants, socks, and polished dark shoes. Notably, he is wearing a banded fedora. This man is seated on a step beside a large, vibrant, multicolored pink and yellow vertical banner. The banner adds a bright pop of color to the image, contrasting with the otherwise mellow urban environment. \n\nShadows falling across the scene suggest a sunny day. The background includes a muted pink wall which complements the brighter colors of the banner. The overall composition and use of color create a vivid, yet serene urban tableau, encapsulating a moment of motion and reflection in everyday life.","title":"D'aug days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, fountain square.
