{"path":"550998.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a striking industrial scene dominated by tall, cylindrical chimneys emitting white and grey smoke into the air. The smoke blends into a mostly clear sky, slightly obscured by the emissions. In the background, lush green trees on a hillside provide a stark contrast to the industrial foreground. On the left side of the image, an inclined structure, possibly a conveyor or an access way, rises up the hill, partially obscured by trees and aligned parallel to a utility pole line that runs up the hill as well.\n\nForeground features include multiple industrial buildings, some with visible signs of wear and age, and additional smoke stacks. On the left, a smaller structure emits a substantial amount of smoke, suggesting ongoing industrial activity. The composition of the image, with its contrast between nature and industry, and the focus on pollution, may evoke themes regarding environmental impact and industrialization. There is no visible presence of people, emphasizing the focus on the facilities and their environmental interaction.","title":"Smokestacks of the DuPont Belle Works on the Kanawha River.
