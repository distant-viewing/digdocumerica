{"path":"545004.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a desolate landscape where the ground is parched and cracked, covering most of the foreground and extending into the distance. The cracks are wide and deep, creating a stark visual of drought or severe dry conditions. In the foreground, slightly to the right, there is a faded red sign with white lettering that reads \"DANGER SOFT MUD TREACHERY.\" This warning sign implies a hazard despite the dry and cracked appearance of the surface, suggesting that the mud beneath might still be soft and potentially dangerous.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a patch of dry yellow grass, contrasting with the dark tones of the cracked earth. The background features a dramatic sky filled with heavy, grey clouds suggesting an overcast or stormy day, which adds a moody atmosphere to the scene. In the distance, the landscape rises gently into rolling hills, barely discernible under the cloudy sky. This composition highlights environmental issues, possibly pointing towards the effects of extreme weather conditions such as drought.","title":"A portion of the Astoria estuary that has been filled in.
