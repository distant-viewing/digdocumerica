{"path":"555704.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a vivid aerial view of a mountainous landscape intersected by a blue, serpentine lake or inlet. The scene is captured with a perspective that includes multiple ridges and snow-capped peaks, suggesting it might be in a region known for its rugged terrain, possibly in a coastal or high-altitude area.\n\nThe water body prominently featured in the image stretches across the frame, bounded by the landforms. It has a deep blue color that contrasts sharply with the varying shades of green and brown of the wooded and rocky shoreline. The topography suggests steep, possibly forested terrain with patches of snow or ice visible on the higher elevations.\n\nA boat is visible on the lake, moving at speed, leaving a white wake behind that contrasts with the blue of the water. This element adds a dynamic aspect to the otherwise tranquil natural scene.\n\nThe image does not contain any visible buildings or human settlements, indicating that this is a relatively untouched or protected natural area. The lighting and clarity suggest that the photograph was taken on a clear day, enhancing the visibility and the striking natural colors of the landscape.","title":"The Alaska ferry \"Bartlett\" heading west in Prince William Sound.
