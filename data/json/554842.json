{"path":"554842.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a close-up shot of a large, white flower that is distinctly marked with a few small brown spots. The flower has broad, delicate petals with soft, rounded edges. In the center of the flower is a cluster of golden-yellow stamens, creating a rich, textured contrast against the white petals.\n\nOccupying the central part of the image, there are two insects, possibly beetles, that appear to be engaging with the flower, either feeding on the pollen or simply resting. The beetles have shiny, patterned exoskeletons, marked with black and white spots, which stand out against the golden and white hues of the flower's interior.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights the intricate details of the flower's textures, from the smooth surface of the petals to the grainy appearance of the stamens. The natural daylight seems to enhance the vividness of the colors and accentuates the shadows within the flower's folds, adding depth and dimension to the overall composition.\n\nThere is no discernible background beyond the close focus on the flower and the insects, which suggests the photographer aimed to isolate these natural elements to capture their beauty and interaction in detail.","title":"Closeup of a prickly poppy flower populated with beetles in the Texas countryside, near San Antonio","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545699","544590","551380","544875","549230","554586","543623","544619","554840","544618","553368","545695","544553","557167","555035","544479"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","petal","stamen","insect","spot","dimension","photographer","feed","mark","fold"]}
