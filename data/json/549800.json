{"path":"549800.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a stark, industrial scene focused on a large, metallic crane that is situated along a body of water. The crane, which is painted yellow, is seen from an aerial perspective looking down its length. Its structure includes a central, elongated arm that extends over a barge filled with an array of compacted garbage. The waste materials appear densely packed and consist of various colors and types, including pieces that suggest household and industrial refuse.\n\nThe crane is supported by a complex system of cables and beams that contribute to its towering and somewhat angular appearance. The perspective of the shot showcases the depth and reach of the crane as it projects over the garbage barge, emphasizing the scale of waste management operations in this setting.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate setting of the crane and barge, there is a calm body of water that extends towards a distant shoreline. Along the horizon, industrial structures are visible, including buildings and another smokestack emitting a plume of dark smoke into the sky, hinting at ongoing industrial activities in the vicinity.\n\nThe image conveys a powerful visual narrative about environmental impact and industrial processes related to waste management, framed against a clear blue sky that contrasts sharply with the industrial elements and pollutants depicted.","title":"Unloading garbage scows at Staten Island.
