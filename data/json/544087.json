{"path":"544087.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat cluttered and gritty alleyway scene, likely taken in a residential area. The focus of the image is on a white garbage truck with an open door, advancing down the alley, positioned on the right side and moving towards the viewpoint of the camera. The alley is lined with numerous green garbage bins, unevenly distributed and some titled, indicating perhaps they have been emptied or disturbed.\n\nTo the left, the background features a weathered wooden house with a cluttered yard, where various items and debris are visible, including an overfilled barrel. Flourishing bushes with white blossoms slightly obscure the house, adding a touch of natural beauty to the otherwise stark environment. The presence of utility poles and lines running across the top part of the image suggests a typical urban or suburban setting.\n\nThe ground of the alley is a mixture of dirt and patches of grass, with traces of litter scattered throughout, reflecting a lack of meticulous maintenance. A wooden fence, appearing somewhat dilapidated, runs alongside the left of the alley, parallel to a narrow road covered with what looks like gravel or crushed rock, reinforcing the rugged, utilitarian nature of the scene. \n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of everyday municipal activity within an environment marked by a mix of neglect and occupancy, hinting at the everyday rhythms of life in this community.","title":"A new mechanical trash collection method, sponsored by the environmental protection agency","placename":"Tolleson (Ariz.)","location":"Tolleson, Arizona","nn1":["550147","550162","544072","552969","549839","545502","549837","544091","545494","547878","547975","551131","550154","550159","549833","547775"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["alley","garbage","flourish","alleyway","rhythm","bin","title","disturb","run","blossom"]}
