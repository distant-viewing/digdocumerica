{"path":"553090.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man sitting on a metal folding chair. He appears thoughtful or solemn. The man is dressed in a practical and somewhat worn attire: a grey button-up shirt with pockets filled with pens and other small items, dark blue jeans, and rugged dark shoes accented with light-colored laces. His accessories include a dark belt with a prominent buckle and greenish-yellow socks. On his head, he wears a distinctive cap adorned with a golden emblem in the front.\n\nThe man's overall appearance gives the impression of someone accustomed to work or outdoor activity, suggested by the dusty condition of his clothes and the robust build of his shoes. Beside him, there is a hint of a textured, grey object resembling a stuffed seal, adding an intriguing contextual element—possibly indicating a cultural or regional significance.\n\nThe background is quite minimal, with focus mainly on the man and his immediate surroundings. The ground is dusty and scattered with small pieces of debris, typical of an outdoor, possibly rural setting. The backdrop shows a neutral-toned environment that doesn’t distract from the main subject of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the composition creates a portrait that offers a glimpse into this man's life and environment, suggesting themes of work, culture, and individual character.","title":"Avery winnemucca is one of several paiute indians who run the dock at Sutcliffe's landing, Pyramid Lake indian reservation","placename":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation, Nevada","nn1":["547330","557844","547313","552684","556563","554926","548218","552103","547179","552871","554857","547679","544409","555532","547427","549042"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["shoe","man","buckle","seal","distract","folding","lace","accessory","sock","emblem"]}
