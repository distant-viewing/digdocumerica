{"path":"543185.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a natural landscape scene, possibly of a stream or small riverbed. The top half of the image shows a vibrant green, lush patch of what appears to be water plants or algae that thrive in moist environments, giving a fresh and verdant look. Below this green patch, the scene shifts to a dryer terrain characterized by numerous rocks and boulders of varying sizes. These stones have a rough texture and are mottled with browns, grays, and slight mossy colorations, suggesting they might be frequently wet, either from the stream that recedes or from tidal activity, depending on the exact location.\n\nThe boundary between the green aquatic vegetation and the rocky area is quite sharp, suggesting a natural division possibly created by water flow patterns or changes in elevation. The scene is outdoors and bathed in natural sunlight, highlighting details like the moisture on the rocks and the individual strands of the green plants. The composition of the photograph, which combines contrasting textures and colors, offers a detailed glimpse into a dynamic aquatic ecosystem.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546875","544790","543172","554407","543549","550726","555077","555212","555626","550678","542583","551520","553420","542582","546202","543869"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["stream","mossy","strand","division","riverbed","algae","rock","coloration","boulder","plant"]}
