{"path":"545921.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rogers, Chuck","caption":"The photograph features a vibrant and detailed river scene captured from a vantage point that includes the interior framework of a bridge, emphasizing the industrial architecture. In the foreground, a large, traditional riverboat named the \"Belle of Louisville\" is prominent, cruising on the water. It appears ornate and historical, with multiple decks and a large paddle wheel visible at its stern, pushing up white frothy water as it moves. American flags are visible on the boat, flying from the rear and top decks.\n\nThe riverboat is framed by a complex background of multiple bridges crossing the water behind it. These bridges vary in design, ranging from intricate truss structures to more straightforward beam designs, indicating different periods of construction and styles. The setting suggests an urban river environment, likely near a city, indicated by buildings and industrial structures faintly discernible in the distant background. The lighting condition, possibly dusk, casts a slight bluish hue over the scene, enhancing the atmospheric feel of the view.","title":"Chattahoochee river","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["543971","545917","543964","543972","543966","543967","543963","543962","550964","543954","543959","543955","553815","557309","544255","550965"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["riverboat","bridge","deck","cruise","paddle","stern","push","fly","intricate","river"]}
