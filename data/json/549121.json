{"path":"549121.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts two men outdoors in a rural setting, holding and examining a large dark rock. The man on the left is kneeling and holds the rock with both hands, extending it forward slightly towards the camera. He is wearing a light blue, plaid, long-sleeve shirt and a straw cowboy hat. His expression appears somewhat serious or focused.\n\nThe man on the right is sitting on the grass with one knee raised, smiling broadly at the camera. He wears glasses, a light brown fedora, and a brown and yellow plaid shirt. His hands are resting on his raised knee, and he seems to be enjoying the activity or the conversation.\n\nThe background features a rolling grassy landscape under a clear blue sky. A wire fence runs parallel to the horizon behind them, and a couple of small buildings or sheds can be seen in the distance, adding to the rural feel of the setting.\n\nThe scene likely captures a moment of geological interest or a demonstration of a significant find, perhaps in a mining or agricultural context given the surroundings and attire of the individuals. The mood is casual yet engaging, with a clear focus on the rock and its significance.","title":"Sub-bituminous coal like the piece John Redding is holding lies under the surface of some 25,000 square miles of Montana and Wyoming. Much of that land is now used for farming and ranching. The Westmoreland Coal Company wants to strip mine.
