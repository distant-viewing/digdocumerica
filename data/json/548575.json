{"path":"548575.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant moment of two people playing water volleyball. Both individuals appear to be adult men, engaging in a playful game in a body of clear blue water, possibly a pool, given the presence of a dedicated volleyball net.\n\nThe man on the left is in the act of either blocking or striking the volleyball, his hands positioned close together and raised above the water's surface. He is wearing a white swim cap and has a focused expression, his eyes watching the ball's trajectory intently. Splashes of water surround him, indicating the dynamic nature of the game.\n\nThe individual on the right is also actively participating, his hands raised in a pushing or blocking gesture as well. He, too, is wearing a white swim cap, and his face displays a mix of concentration and the physical effort involved in the sport.\n\nThe sky in the background is a clear, pale blue, suggesting a sunny, calm day ideal for outdoor activities. The net is stretched tight across the frame, marking the boundary between the two players and adding a layer of competitive tension to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, coupled with the vibrant colors and clear imagery, vividly captures an energetic and joyful sporting moment.","title":"Some of the male residents of the Century Village retirement community meet each evening to play water-volleyball in the club pool.","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548576","556295","552227","548844","543512","544204","546349","543458","553430","548834","553449","557481","551544","546337","551285","546330"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["swim","game","net","cap","sporting","imagery","tension","player","ball","act"]}
