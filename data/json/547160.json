{"path":"547160.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures two individuals on what appears to be a wet and possibly industrial outdoor setting, suggestive of mutual warmth and camaraderie in a work environment.\n\nThe person on the left is a larger-build male wearing a blue jacket over a white shirt, dark trousers, and work boots. He sports a yellow hard hat and is smiling towards the camera. \n\nThe individual on the right is smaller in stature, dressed in a distinctive yellow rain jacket and trousers, also wearing a yellow hard hat. Their face expresses happiness as they lean in closely to the person on the left, showcasing a moment of close interaction.\n\nThe background is dim and blurred but hints at a rugged, industrial setting with some visible heavy equipment or structures that might be part of a construction or industrial site.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of partnership and a break from labor, captured during a dreary, wet day, with both subjects equipped with protective gear appropriate for a potentially hazardous work environment.","title":"Workers at Inland Steel plant on Lake Michigan","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["543651","556868","549947","547987","553606","556391","542783","556339","556866","546023","544969","553802","553025","546824","542779","546036"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["trouser","work","express","happiness","jacket","camaraderie","hat","warmth","person","male"]}
