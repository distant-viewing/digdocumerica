{"path":"551200.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a rugged landscape, likely taken from an airplane or a high vantage point. The central feature of the image is a massive landslide, which has left a wide, barren, and deep scar on the side of a mountain, exposing the brown and gray earth underneath the previously vegetated surface. \n\nThe landslide descends down the slope, with several distinct trails of debris visible, flowing towards a valley. At the top right side of the landslide, a small cluster of white and pale-colored buildings are perched perilously close to the edge, highlighting the dramatic impact and potential danger posed by the landslide. \n\nAround the affected area, the landscape is densely forested, featuring a mix of dark greens which suggest a rich, healthy vegetation, typical of a mountainous region. The bottom of the image shows a narrow road winding its way past a few more buildings aligned along its side, suggesting this area may be either residential or used for light commercial purposes.\n\nThe overall composition effectively conveys a scene of natural disasters and their impact on human habitats and the environment, emphasizing the power of nature and the vulnerability of man-made structures in such settings.","title":"In heavy rain this bare hill is a hazard to the homes below.","placename":"Charleston (W.
