{"path":"545956.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features a large, futuristic vehicle identified as a tracked hovercraft. This particular hovercraft is marked with the emblem and text for the \"Department of Transportation\". The design of the hovercraft is sleek with a rounded, bullet-like shape emphasizing streamlined efficiency. The body is predominantly white with red accents and features like vents and viewports that add to its sophisticated, technical appearance.\n\nThe vehicle is situated on a flat, barren landscape that resembles a desert, indicated by sandy, untextured ground under a clear blue sky. There is very little vegetation or any other detail in the background, which accentuates the isolation and the experimental or testing nature of the scene. The lighting conditions suggest it might be either morning or late afternoon, with natural light casting clear shadows and contributing to the sharpness of the image.\n\nTo the left in the background, a small structure resembling a tower or wind turbine is visible, suggesting some form of monitoring or energy-related activity on site. The focus and framing on the hovercraft underscore its prominence and the potential significance of its technology in transportation contexts.","title":"The LIMTV (linear induction motor test vehicle) is tested at the Department of Transportation's high speed ground test center. The experimental vehicle is designed to operate at speeds up to 250 miles per hour. It uses electro-magnetic forces for noiseless propulsion.","placename":"Pueblo (Colo.)","location":"Pueblo, Colorado","nn1":["545948","545946","545942","545947","545931","545960","545964","545939","544766","544061","545642","555875","547979","557472","552798","545637"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["efficiency","sharpness","prominence","testing","vent","emblem","monitoring","accent","significance","technology"]}
