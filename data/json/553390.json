{"path":"553390.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic river scene accentuated by a natural and architectural backdrop. In the foreground, lush green foliage, including dense shrubs and slender leaves, frame the view, infusing a hint of vitality and freshness. The river itself is the focal point, coursing energetically through the scene. Captured with a slow shutter speed, the water appears as a soft, flowing blur, emphasizing its swift movement and the power of the current. \n\nOn the right side of the river, there is an aged stone building, suggesting a historical or old-world setting. The building features small, rectangular windows and is constructed with exposed brick and stone, giving it a rustic charm. Against these windows, the interaction of light and shadow plays subtly, contributing to the building's texture and depth. \n\nA stone wall runs parallel to the river's edge, perhaps functioning as a retaining structure. This wall and the building together create a stark contrast between the manmade structures and the river's untamed force. The overall composition of the image, with its mix of natural beauty and old architecture, evokes a sense of timelessness and the enduring relationship between human habitats and natural landscapes.","title":"Waste from the Weyerhaeuser mill is discharged into the Whitman River, which in turn flows into the nearby, and heavily polluted Nashua River.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["542557","550658","557745","557239","549514","542743","548061","547526","553395","553389","542537","547952","553462","544871","548097","548156"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["river","stone","vitality","freshness","timelessness","relationship","shutter","wall","building","current"]}
