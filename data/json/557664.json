{"path":"557664.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene of a group dining outdoors at a restaurant. There are seven people around the table, which appears to be a family or a group of friends enjoying a meal together. From left to right, the individuals include a woman standing partially out of the frame, a man seated with sunglasses and a white shirt, and a smiling woman next to him. Children of various ages are sitting around the table too, some facing the camera while others are turned towards each other, engaged in conversation.\n\nThe table is set with various dishes, paper cups, and some visible food items, suggesting a casual dining experience. The outfits of the people, particularly the children wearing sports jerseys, impart a relaxed and informal atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, there is a street view showing parked cars and a pedestrian. The architecture has European-style elements, as seen in the building across the street which features decorative trim and a red roof. This setting, combined with the festive atmosphere and familial interaction, suggests that this might be a vacation or a special outing captured in the moment. The image carries a nostalgic feel, reminiscent of family gatherings and simple pleasures.","title":"Tourists eat at outdoor facilities at the Wurst Haus in Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown. New development and a surge of tourism have come to the village of some 270 residents 90 miles northeast of Atlanta since the town decided on a Bavarian alpine theme for its small business district. With success of the project has come a question of how much commercialism can be accommodated without losing the character of the town or its longtime residents.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551277","553186","544990","554861","551846","543631","548568","551276","556843","551688","558188","544975","556611","557488","551634","553169"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["dining","table","family","jersey","dish","vacation","child","pleasure","restaurant","meal"]}
