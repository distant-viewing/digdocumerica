{"path":"556091.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene at a train station, likely during the late 20th century, judging by the style of clothing and the design of the train. The image shows several people engaged in activities typical of a busy train platform.\n\nIn the foreground, two women are walking towards the train. The woman on the right is dressed in a white, cropped blouse and jeans, with her hair styled in curls. She is waving at someone. The other woman, slightly ahead of her, is wearing a blue and white checked shirt and jeans and is carrying a bag that reads \"Marlboro.\" Her back is mostly turned to the camera.\n\nIn the background, there is another woman, standing nearer to a train, waving back to the woman in the white blouse. She is wearing a red tracksuit and her pose suggests she is either greeting or bidding farewell. Beside her, there is a group of people, possibly a family, gathered with luggage, indicating they might be preparing to board the train.\n\nThe train itself is prominently featured. It has a silver exterior with a unique red and blue striped design along its sides. This indicates the train might belong to a specific rail service, perhaps identifiable by the livery.\n\nThe scene is set under a clear blue sky with only a few clouds, suggesting a pleasant day, which adds to the cheerful ambiance. In the distant background, you can notice other infrastructure typical of a train station, like additional railway tracks and station buildings.\n\nOverall, this image captures a moment filled with movement and excitement, typical of travel scenes at train stations, highlighted by friendly interactions and the anticipation of journeying.","title":"One last photograph before passengers board the empire builder at fargo, North Dakota, enroute from Chicago to east glacier park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington.
