{"path":"552999.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph depicts a vast car junkyard, filled with a multitude of damaged and discarded vehicles. The scene is densely packed with cars of various models and colors, most of which show signs of significant wear and damage. Car parts such as doors, hoods, and wheels are visibly mangled or missing. The perspective of the image suggests the photo was taken during daylight, indicated by the bright lighting and shadows visible on and around the cars.\n\nThe cars are tightly grouped together, covering the entire field of view, and extending into the horizon. The background features a clear sky and faint outlines of distant hills or mountains, emphasizing the expansive scale of the junkyard. However, the focus is overwhelmingly on the amassed wreckage of the vehicles which dominates the composition. The photograph portrays a sense of abandonment and decay, capturing a landscape repurposed for automotive waste.","title":"Gaede's wrecking yard.  (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
