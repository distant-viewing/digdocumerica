{"path":"550543.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph depicts a winding river from an aerial perspective. The river carves its serpentine path through a predominantly green and brown landscape, which appears to be a wetland or marshy area. The fluid shapes of the river create a striking contrast against the darker and lighter patches of surrounding vegetation and what might be muddy or sandy areas. There are distinct spots along the river where the water has pooled, forming variously shaped oxbow lakes with clearer water. Small patches of vegetation are clustered within these bends of the river. The overall appearance is natural and undeveloped, suggesting a remote or protected area not disturbed by urban development. The land around the river is uneven, suggesting natural processes of erosion and sediment deposition influencing the landscape's appearance.","title":"Creek meanders and oxbows typical of this general area","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549262","550616","552838","550570","552925","550571","555753","550545","550623","550527","552908","550622","553452","550392","549456","544744"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","deposition","disturb","shape","appearance","carve","influence","protect","sediment","pool"]}
