{"path":"549077.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a man and a young girl standing together in a vast agricultural field with distinct rows of plowed soil stretching far into the background. The man, appearing middle-aged, is dressed in a plaid shirt and denim jeans. He stands in a relaxed posture with one hand on his hip and the other on the young girl's shoulder. He is looking downwards at the girl with a gentle expression. The girl, who is smiling, is wearing a light-colored sleeveless dress and is barefoot, slightly hiding behind the man. \n\nThe lighting suggests it is either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and illuminating the side of the subjects' faces with a golden hue, creating a serene and warm atmosphere. \n\nThe landscape is flat, with a clear sky and distant mountains forming the horizon. The lack of visible vegetation in the field indicates it might be a newly plowed field ready for planting or after a harvest. The simplicity of the scene emphasizes the stillness and vastness of the agricultural environment.","title":"Cotton farmer, john vanderslice, and his daughter stand on newly planted field","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["557113","552581","548997","543845","543040","549036","553093","554203","543117","544250","558106","546986","558243","554015","553094","555819"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["girl","plow","field","planting","hip","hide","harvest","denim","man","stillness"]}
