{"path":"547913.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a coastal scene with various elements of activity and calmness. In the foreground, the shoreline is visible with gentle waves washing onto the sandy surface, accented with spots of frothy sea foam. The water is a deep, reflective blue, mirroring the clear, cloudless sky above.\n\nTowards the left, a small, anchored boat floats near the shore. It is a simple rowboat, colored in dark tones with an outboard motor attached at the rear, which is slightly tilted up out of the water. A single oar is visible inside the boat, resting along its length.\n\nIn the middle of the image, a person is wading waist-deep in the water. They are holding onto a long, thin pole, possibly using it to stabilize themselves or to probe underwater. The person is dressed entirely in dark clothing, making their movements a central point of interest against the expansive backdrop of the beach and water.\n\nBehind the scene, the opposite shore extends across the horizon, featuring low-lying hills or ridges that recede into the distance under a wide expanse of sky, enhancing the serene and expansive feel of the setting. The composition and ambient lighting suggest a peaceful, perhaps solitary moment in nature, emphasizing a sense of tranquility and the simple joy of being by the water.","title":"Clam digger at Spermacetti Cove on Sandy Hook, one of the few remaining uncontaminated areas on the Jersey coast.","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["548733","554147","545081","545095","547556","547558","550826","554002","542870","555396","546953","555400","545086","542877","544284","554101"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["underwater","deep","shore","oar","rowboat","water","waist","motor","boat","rear"]}
