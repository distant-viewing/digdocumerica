{"path":"548959.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a livestock facility, possibly a ranch or a farm. The setting is outdoors, under a clear sky with some light clouds, and a hilly landscape is visible in the background, hinting at a rural or semi-arid location.\n\nIn the foreground, the image is framed by the wooden corner of a pen or stable, giving a slightly cloistered perspective on the activities inside. A dirt pathway bordered by wooden fences leads into the scene, emphasizing the rustic and utilitarian nature of the environment.\n\nThe main activity in the photo involves a man and a cow. The man, wearing denim overalls, a long-sleeve shirt, and rubber boots, is engaged in washing or perhaps medically treating the cow, which is harnessed and attached to a leash tied to the fence. The cow, predominantly white with large brown patches, stands on a concrete platform that appears wet, possibly from the washing activity, indicated by puddles of water around the area.\n\nThe man seems focused on his task, either adjusting something on the cowâ€™s head or perhaps preparing to lead it away. Throughout the composition, the functionality of the space is emphasized by elements like the concrete platform for easy cleaning, the simple yet sturdy wooden fencing and structures, and the practical clothing of the man.\n\nOverall, this photograph reveals a moment of everyday life on a farm or ranch, highlighting the interaction between a farmer and livestock within a work environment designed for such tasks.","title":"On experimental farm operated by EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center. \"Big Sam\", steer with \"see through\" hole in his hide.","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["552669","554950","548952","554949","552569","548960","543686","552677","548957","547326","543690","553107","548962","553104","553106","548993"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["cow","washing","ranch","livestock","farm","platform","leash","treat","fence","farmer"]}
