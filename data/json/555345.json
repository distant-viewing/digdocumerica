{"path":"555345.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph showcases a close-up view of an object with a distinctive, repeated pattern. We are looking at a series of parallel, metallic ribs that have a reflective, silver-gray color. These ribs are organized tightly next to each other, providing a textured surface appearance.\n\nEach rib has an indented line running along its length, adding more detail to the texture. The edges of the object are bordered by a red material that contrasts vividly with the metallic ribs. This red border appears somewhat rough and uneven, hinting that the object might be a part of some machinery or perhaps a component in an industrial setting.\n\nThe focus of the photograph is on the ribs, with a shallow depth of field that fades slightly out of focus towards the edges of the image, drawing attention to the central part of the object. The background of the image is nondescript and out of focus, emphasizing the object in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the intricate details and design of a mechanical or industrial component, highlighted by the contrast between the metallic texture and the red border.","title":"A model of the cust-shaped solar heating panel to be built and tested by the Aden Meinel family near Tucson, Arizona. Blackened tubes are laid inside semi-cylindrical reflectors and absorb energy from sunlight to heat circulating fluid.
