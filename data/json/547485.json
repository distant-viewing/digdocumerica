{"path":"547485.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a landscape heavily affected by industrial or environmental destruction. It shows a narrow waterway running through the middle, possibly a man-made channel, surrounded by large mounds of what appears to be debris and refuse. The scene is littered with various forms of industrial waste and detritus including crushed pipes, fragments of concrete, twisted metal rods, and scattered, miscellaneous debris.\n\nThe color of the water is dark, suggesting possible pollution. The banks of the channel are steep and entirely covered with the rubble, preventing any visible natural earth or vegetation from being seen. The overall ambiance is bleak and dystopian, with harsh lighting and shadows that further emphasize the destruction and abandonment of the area.\n\nThe background shows a similar continuation of waste-strewn landscape, reaching towards a slightly brighter, open sky that contrasts with the overall darkness of the foreground. The horizon meets a distant tree line, possibly indicating the outskirts of a natural area, yet this too looks overshadowed by the environmental impact depicted in the foreground.\n\nThis photograph is powerful in its portrayal of environmental degradation, hinting at human neglect or the aftermath of an industrial operation gone awry. It communicates a strong message about the impact of human activity on natural landscapes and the harsh realities of pollution and waste management.","title":"Dumping along the shore of Narragansett bay at fields point","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["555852","547907","551562","550259","544810","551531","550352","543815","549307","552169","547524","551559","543819","547897","555848","543636"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waste","destruction","channel","pollution","overshadow","detritus","prevent","continuation","reality","crush"]}
