{"path":"542539.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene, likely involving construction or material handling activities. A focal feature of the image is a large, operational front-end loader with a dappled beige and white body. It's shown in movement as indicated by dust clouds swirling around its wheels. The loader is carrying a substantial load of jagged, off-white rocks in its bucket.\n\nThe operator, a person wearing a light-colored sleeve shirt, jeans, and a protective helmet, is seated in the driver's compartment, attentively maneuvering the vehicle.\n\nIn the background, two large cylindrical tanks can be seen. One is much closer and painted in a matt black color which absorbs light, making its surface features indistinct apart from some superficial rust and wear that suggest it is not new. The second tank stands slightly obscured and sideways further back; itâ€™s black and shows signs of functional use. The environment around these tanks abounds with industrial structures, including pipework and metal frameworks.\n\nThe ground on which the loader is operating appears compacted and dusty, characteristic of a typical industrial or construction site. The overall setting conveys a busy, somewhat gritty atmosphere typical of heavy equipment operations in an industrial zone.","title":"Drying sulfur at plant","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["555636","555638","544138","547922","549956","547243","556430","542538","554837","544161","544099","555644","547161","544134","544379","555866"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["loader","tank","operator","load","construction","compartment","handling","driver","dust","bucket"]}
