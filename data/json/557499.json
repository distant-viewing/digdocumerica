{"path":"557499.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural scene focused on wetland vegetation, specifically a collection of grass clumps growing through a wet, textured surface likely composed of mud and algae. The grass is vibrant and green, with long, thin blades pointing upward. The sunlight casts visible shadows on the muddy ground, enhancing the texture which appears rough and slightly glossy, indicating wetness.\n\nThe environment suggests a marshy or swampy area, with the ground saturated by water. This setting is characteristic of nutrient-rich wetlands that support a variety of plant life. The image has a shallow depth of field which blurs the background slightly, directing the focus primarily to the grass and the immediate surface around it.\n\nNo visible fauna or human elements are included in the frame, reinforcing the natural, undisturbed quality of the scene. The overall atmosphere is tranquil and closely observer the details of this particular ecosystem.","title":"Closeup of grasses and algae in Buena Vista Lagoon. It is one of the last lagoons in Southern California. There is concern that the wildlife sanctuary is endangered because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast and it has resulted in increased land use pressures.","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["545033","544884","547924","553084","550783","547532","547500","557498","549232","547589","550670","557442","557445","547488","547544","542554"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetness","grass","fauna","observer","blade","algae","clump","mud","wetland","collection"]}
