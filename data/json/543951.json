{"path":"543951.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, judging by the soft lighting. Two people, likely adults, are seated close to each other on the beach, observing the water. The person on the left is wearing a hat, suggesting a casual, relaxed setting. They are both silhouetted against the shimmering water, emphasizing a calm, peaceful atmosphere.\n\nIn the water, there is a small boat moving right-to-left, creating a light wake on the lake's surface which reflects the sunlight, adding a dynamic element to the peaceful setting. The water appears mostly calm, with just the gentle ripples from the boat and small waves lapping at the shore.\n\nThe foreground is comprised of a sandy beach littered with small pieces of debris, perhaps twigs or washed-up vegetation, which suggests a natural, possibly untended stretch of shoreline. Overall, the image evokes a sense of tranquility and leisure, with nature playing a central role in the composition.","title":"The Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543601","557563","553440","554486","550822","549417","546976","550324","543892","557562","545229","552029","550236","554477","544266","543579"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["lapping","beach","twig","wash","wake","lakeside","shimmering","water","comprise","judge"]}
