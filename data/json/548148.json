{"path":"548148.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic river scene where individuals are engaged in log driving, a historical method of moving logs from forests down rivers to sawmills. The scene unfolds with intense, choppy waters in a broad river that dominates the image.\n\nSeveral boats are in the river, closely interacting with large accumulations of logs floating in the water. The boats, which appear to be small and motorized, are crowded with people wearing caps, some of whom are actively working with the logs, likely using pike poles or similar tools to maneuver and control the logs to prevent jams.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a substantial concentration of logs cluttered together, creating a makeshift raft amidst foamy white waters, indicating a rapid or turbulent section of the river. In one of the boats, a canvas or plastic cover is set up, possibly as a shield against spray or debris.\n\nThe background shows a rocky riverbank and dense surrounding forest, emphasizing the natural and somewhat remote setting of the activity. This landscape suggests the area is likely used primarily for logging purposes.\n\nThis image captures a moment full of action and concerted effort, portraying a labor-intensive practice surrounded by a rugged environment.","title":"Fishing on the Willamette River.
