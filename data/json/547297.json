{"path":"547297.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic agricultural setting, primarily dominated by activity on a field. In the foreground, there's a vast expanse of freshly turned or tilled soil, appearing dark and rich, dotted with remnants of previous crop residue. Towards the middle of the scene, a tract of land is being worked by a tractor, which is moving from left to right. The tractor is older, painted green, and pulling behind it a farm implement that is likely used for either sowing seeds or spreading fertilizer, as suggested by the dust or particles being dispersed into the air around it.\n\nAbove the tractor and the freshly disturbed soil, a flock of birds, possibly gulls or similar light-colored birds, is depicted in flight. These birds are scattered across the middle to upper parts of the image, adding a dynamic aspect as they seemingly react to the tractorâ€™s disruption of the ground. Their presence likely indicates the stirring up of insects or worms which serves as food, drawing the birds to the area.\n\nThe background is relatively flat and shows sparse vegetation, fence lines, and a few scattered trees. Farther back, there are farm buildings, including barns or storage structures, which contribute to the rural farming atmosphere. The horizon is low, and the sky above is overcast, casting an overall muted tone on the lighting and colors within the photograph. This setting speaks to traditional farming practices and the interaction between human agricultural activity and nature.","title":"Farm east of Jansen","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547301","554202","548902","548898","547436","545893","544888","548820","548903","547304","554204","547303","555879","544323","548296","553665"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tractor","bird","farming","farm","implement","react","middle","soil","seed","insect"]}
