{"path":"551262.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction or excavation scene by a body of water. In the center of the image, there is a yellow bulldozer that appears to be stuck or operating on difficult, uneven terrain composed of soil and rocks. A man is seated on the bulldozer, perhaps operating it or trying to navigate through the terrain.\n\nBehind the bulldozer, at a slightly higher elevation, is a yellow four-wheel drive truck with a cargo bed filled with materials. The truck is parked on a more solid ground compared to where the bulldozer is.\n\nThe background shows a large body of calm water, likely a lake, which occupies the upper portion of the frame. The shoreline is rugged and vegetated with trees and undergrowth that are typical of a natural, outdoor setting.\n\nThe environment suggests that the activity is taking place in a remote or less developed area, where construction or excavation is being conducted possibly for development or resource extraction purposes.\n\nThe overall color tone of the photo, combined with the natural and industrial elements, conveys a sense of ongoing human intervention in a natural landscape. The sky is slightly overcast, suggesting an overcast or cool day.","title":"Digging foundations for a home directly above lake at sunrise beach on the lake of the ozarks.
