{"path":"543897.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a small, translucent squid resting comfortably in the palm of a human hand. The squid is quite small in size, its body lightly colored with a pattern of darker speckles across its mantle. It has two large, prominent eyes and its tentacles extend towards the human's fingers. The texture of the squid's skin appears soft and gelatinous.\n\nThe human hand holding the squid is slightly weathered, with visible lines and creases, indicating that it may belong to an adult. The fingers are slightly curled to form a gentle cradle for the squid.\n\nThe background of the photo is out of focus but suggests a natural, outdoor setting with soft, diffused lighting, possibly indicating daytime. The overall composition focuses on the interaction between human and marine life, capturing a moment of gentle handling and observation of a delicate sea creature. This highlights a sense of curiosity and respect for the natural world.","title":"Marine life is taken from water near the p.h.  Robinson generating plant.
