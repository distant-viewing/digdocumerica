{"path":"547293.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and long shadows. Two main structures, a house and a barn, are silhouetted against a pale, gradient sky transitioning from a deep blue at the top to a warmer, lighter hue near the horizon. The house, to the left, features a classic A-frame roof with visible eaves and a small front porch. Next to it on the right is a larger building, likely a barn, with a broad, slightly slanting roof. This building is connected to a smaller structure sharing the same roofline.\n\nA prominent feature in the scene is a traditional windmill, positioned directly in between the house and barn. It stands out as a silhouette, adding a rustic charm to the composition.\n\nForeground details are not distinct due to backlighting, but suggest a field, possibly with vegetation or crops. The overall atmosphere conveys calmness and simplicity, typical of a rural environment away from urban hustle. The use of silhouette and natural light emphasizes the peaceful end of a day in a countryside setting.","title":"A farm, east of Jansen","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547289","547347","552462","547309","556963","557023","554767","547345","547288","547658","547292","542801","547428","542916","557119","547128"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","house","eave","windmill","silhouette","roofline","backlighting","countryside","hustle","calmness"]}
