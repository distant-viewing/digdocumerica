{"path":"548740.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph showcases a coastal natural scene with visible signs of environmental distress. In the foreground, a focal point is a large, discolored buoy that lies among scattered debris and natural detritus. The buoy is white and appears to be weathered with age, featuring strands of rope still attached to it.\n\nSurrounding the buoy, there are numerous branches and pieces of driftwood, strewn haphazardly across the muddy ground, indicating possible after-effects of a storm or consistent shoreline erosion. These wooden elements vary in size and thickness, and mostly appear bleached and aged.\n\nIn the background, a thin line of mangrove trees can be seen, which characterizes this as a mangrove swamp area. These trees are dense and green, suggesting a stark contrast to the otherwise barren and littered foreground. A glimpse of open water or wetland can also be seen beyond the mangrove trees, hinting at a tidal zone that might be experiencing low water levels.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on environmental themes, emphasizing the interaction between natural habitats and human-produced waste. The color palette is predominantly muted with earth tones, greens from the mangroves, and the grayish-white of the driftwood and buoy, creating a somber and possibly cautionary visual narrative about ecological impact and resilience.","title":"Land cleared of mangroves for commercial development in North Key Largo.
