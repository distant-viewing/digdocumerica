{"path":"542948.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a large-scale deforestation and construction site, illustrating significant environmental impact. The scene shows a heavily logged area where numerous tall trees have been cut down, leaving behind only a few standing amidst the barren landscape. The ground is scarred with deep tracks and piles of logs and debris, indicative of recent logging activity.\n\nCentral in the image is a winding dirt road that curves through the cleared area. Along and near the road, various heavy construction and logging machinery are visible, including cranes, bulldozers, and trucks, some of which are bright blue and yellow, adding spots of color to the otherwise earth-toned scene. These machines are either parked or in operation, contributing to the transformation of the landscape.\n\nThe composition also features areas with dense, dark green trees in the background, contrasting starkly with the disturbed earth and denuded sections. The overall impression is one of industrial activity and environmental change, highlighting the impact of human operations on natural forest landscapes. The photo captures a moment of transition where nature and industrialized activities collide.","title":"Lumber roads and clear-cutting encroach on pine forest","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542949","542827","542947","542851","542828","550354","545272","542852","545143","542824","542839","542833","555221","542840","542834","542850"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["logging","earth","deforestation","tracks","transformation","construction","parke","ton","impact","standing"]}
