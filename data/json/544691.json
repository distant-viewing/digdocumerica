{"path":"544691.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features an industrial setting, possibly a factory or processing plant. In the scene, multiple large structures dominate the foreground, including tanks and towers made of metal, equipped with various pipes and conduits. There are several ladders and platforms visible, likely for maintenance access.\n\nThe factory is active, as evidenced by the multiple plumes of smoke or steam emanating from tall stacks. These emissions are thick and billowy, suggesting substantial industrial activity. The smoke varies in color from white to gray, contrasting with the clear sky in the background.\n\nThe lighting indicates it might be either early morning or late afternoon, given the softness and angle of the sunlight. In the distance, a clear blue sky forms the backdrop, creating a stark contrast with the industrial foreground.\n\nForeground elements like blurred fence posts suggest the photo was taken from behind a barrier, possibly for safety or restricted access reasons. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of gritty industrial activity, juxtaposed against the natural calm of the sky.","title":"Massive concentration of industry in the San Francisco Bay Area has resulted in severe pollution problems.","placename":"Fremont (Calif.)","location":"Fremont, California","nn1":["542999","543011","557304","545447","550328","545920","549713","546908","557293","546884","546143","546107","545446","551026","550344","557374"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["access","factory","reason","conduit","smoke","softness","ladder","emission","calm","stack"]}
