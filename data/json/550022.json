{"path":"550022.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban environment, likely a street corner, beneath an elevated railway line. The scene has a gritty, urban aesthetic suggestive of a densely populated city area.\n\nIn the foreground, three cars are parked on the street, associating it with a period identifiable by the style and design of the vehicles, possibly the 1970s or 1980s. A greenish-yellow car faces the camera while a silver car is parked perpendicular to it. Behind these, there is a darker colored car that's partially visible.\n\nDirectly under the elevated train tracks, and partly engulfed in their shadow, is a place called the Egleston Grille, identified by a prominent sign. Adjacent to Egleston Grille are other commercial establishments, their visibility limited by the framing.\n\nAbove the street, the elevated train track dominates the composition, forming a dark and looming presence overhead. Alongside the track, there is an elevated walkway where two individuals are seen. One, wearing dark clothing and carrying a bag, appears to be descending stairs that lead down to the street level. The other individual, dressed in red, is partially visible and positioned higher on the walkway, suggesting movement or travel.\n\nThe buildings adjacent to the elevated tracks display features typical of residences or mixed-use structures in urban American settings, with brick facades and multiple windows. Posters and flyers on the walls and the utility pole at the corner add to the urban tapestry, injecting a sense of local culture and activity.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a vibrant, if somewhat gritty, slice of city life under the literal and figurative shadow of urban infrastructures like the railway system. The human presence, architectural style, commercial entities, and transportation elements collectively paint a dynamic picture of urban existence.","title":"Washington street under the el, looking toward egleston square","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550012","555927","555890","548474","555925","556224","547580","556202","555930","550065","555988","550053","556853","557278","548479","546700"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["elevate","track","walkway","car","railway","train","street","corner","entity","inject"]}
