{"path":"549500.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This is an aerial photograph displaying a blend of natural and urban landscapes. It shows a curving river with turbulent waters, which could be rapids or a spill-off from a dam. The river is surrounded by lush greenery from trees and vegetation that fringe the banks. Alongside the river is a well-defined cliff or embankment.\n\nAdjacent to the cliff, a large building complex, likely a hydroelectric power station, is visible. This facility extends close to the edge, overlooking the river, with visible water discharge areas contributing to the turbulence in the water below.\n\nThe urban setup includes a street parallel to the river, lined with neat rows of residential houses with pitched roofs. The street is active, potentially with parked or moving cars, and is bordered by sidewalks and streetlights. In the distance, parallel to the residential street, a wider road or highway with what appear to be moving vehicles can be observed, emphasizing the connectivity of the area. \n\nFurther beyond the river and cluster of homes, another large green area and what might be an industrial or commercial region indicate a blend of residential and possibly economic activities in the area. Thereâ€™s a subtle gradient in elevation from the riverbanks moving upward through the residential area, adding to the scenic variation in the landscape. The overall impression is of a serene yet active community by a powerful river.","title":"Wastes from the city of Niagara Falls flow into the Niagara River at discharge point shown in this aerial view.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549498","550548","546694","550732","549497","550861","557420","557421","556949","547227","551195","550546","550730","549499","548061","550539"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["river","cliff","street","off","blend","spill","discharge","streetlight","turbulence","rapid"]}
