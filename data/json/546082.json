{"path":"546082.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, industrial cargo ship named \"Ness Mariner\" registered in Monrovia. The ship is captured in a body of water, likely a river or estuary, under a clear blue sky without clouds. The ship is shown from a close-to-mid range angle that covers its midsection to its bow, viewed slightly from the starboard side and facing forward.\n\nThe name \"Ness Mariner\" is clearly visible on the hull, along with the word \"Monrovia\" indicating its port of registration. The ship is colored predominantly dark, with red and black on its funnel, and its deck features various pieces of deck machinery and structures, possibly for cargo handling or navigation. \n\nThe river water is rippling and shows different shades of blue and brown, indicating movement possibly caused by the ship's progression through the water. The background is simple and only shows the waterway extending behind the ship, and a tree-lined bank in the far distance, which is slightly out of focus, adding a sense of depth to the scene. There are no visible people or other moving objects, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention primarily on the vessel and its industrial features.","title":"Oil spews from a damaged liberian oil tanker (the naess mariner) after it collided with a barge on the Mississippi river","placename":"Kenner (La.)","location":"Kenner, Louisiana","nn1":["546024","546020","549613","551581","548201","555801","548126","551990","555811","548127","546804","551558","546040","550944","545845","548122"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","cargo","deck","name","estuary","rippl","funnel","register","registration","navigation"]}
