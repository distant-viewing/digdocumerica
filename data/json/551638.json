{"path":"551638.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and playful scene at an outdoor public space, featuring three young children interacting with a large, dynamic fountain. The children are positioned on a ledge or step near the base of the fountain, surrounded by jets of water shooting upwards, creating a lively and joyful atmosphere.\n\nOn the left, a girl with blonde hair tied back, wearing a red dress with floral patterns, is covering her mouth with her handsâ€”possibly squealing or laughing. In the center, another girl, also with her hair tied back, is wearing a blue and orange polka-dot dress and seems to be enthusiastically talking or calling out, with a slightly open mouth as if mid-speech. On the right, there is a boy with slightly longer hair, dressed in a red and black floral outfit, holding something that might be a toy or a snack, looking towards the other children with a playful demeanor.\n\nThe background of the scene features a large, modernist building with a facade of vertical columns and large windows, suggesting an urban setting. The architecture has a strong mid-20th century aesthetic, possibly indicating a cultural or civic building.\n\nThe setting is sunlit, casting a bright and warm light on the scene, further enhancing the cheery, summer-like feel of the moment. The shadows indicate it might be midday or early afternoon. The composition of the image, with the children spaced relatively evenly across the frame against the lively background of water and structured architecture, creates a scene full of energy and movement, capturing a moment of childhood delight and playfulness.","title":"Lincoln Center Plaza is enclosed by two theaters, an opera house and a concert hall.
