{"path":"545597.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a dry, cracked surface. The texture is highly detailed, showing a mosaic of dark and light brown earth tones. The cracks create jagged, irregular divisions across the surface, suggesting that the material could be either dried mud or a type of rock. Small, round objects that may be pebbles or small mineral deposits are scattered across the surface, embedded into the crevices and sitting atop the flats. The composition focuses on the contrast in colors and the depth introduced by the cracks, conveying a sense of an arid and barren environment. Various subtle shades and the gritty texture contribute to a rugged, natural aesthetic.","title":"One of the fossils along trail from spanish bottom.
