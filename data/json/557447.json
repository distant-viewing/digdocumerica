{"path":"557447.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a body of water, potentially a river or a lake. The sun, large and luminous, is positioned nearly in the center of the composition, slightly above the horizon, bathing the scene in a warm, golden light. Below the sun, the sky transitions from a bright yellow near the sun to deeper shades of orange and then to a dark blue at the very top, illustrating a typical gradient of sunset colors.\n\nThe silhouette of a treeline is visible along the horizon, creating a dark outline against the lighter sky. This suggests that the viewpoint might be from an opposite shore or from a considerable distance, emphasizing a feeling of looking across the water.\n\nThe water itself reflects the sun's glow, creating a path of shimmering light that leads from the lower portion of the image towards the sun. The reflective qualities of the water are enhanced by small ripples or disturbances on the surface, which catch the light and add texture.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a landmass or a large body of vegetation that juts into the water, adding asymmetry to the composition and providing depth. This section is also silhouetted, enhancing the contrast between the dark and light elements within the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a tranquil and beautiful moment in nature, characterized by its vibrant yet harmonious color palette, the calmness of the water, and the stark silhouettes of the landscape. It evokes a sense of peace and contemplation.","title":"Sunset over Upper Newport Bay, near Newport Beach. The bay was scheduled for development as a yacht harbor. The state's coastal waters and lands provide a habitat for more than 108 species and subspecies of mammals, 260 birds, 54 reptiles and amphibians, and a wide variety of fish. Coastal wetlands necessary for their survival decreased from 381,000 acres in 1900 to about 125,000 acres in the early 1970s.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552294","543144","554404","544711","552277","554759","552338","552038","552335","547731","544707","548182","550296","557497","550299","551206"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sun","silhouette","sunset","water","treeline","landmass","jut","peace","calmness","disturbance"]}
