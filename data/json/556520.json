{"path":"556520.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely a mining operation. In the foreground, there is a collection of vehicles, including several cars with designs typical of the mid-20th century, indicating this photo may be a few decades old. The cars are parked on a dirt ground and appear dormant.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a significant amount of coal piled up, suggesting this is a coal mining site. A part of a coal conveyor belt system is visible on the right side, with coal possibly being transported or processed.\n\nIn the background, the focal point is a large, aging metal structure that seems to be part of the mining facility. It appears to be a tower used for loading or sorting coal, with visible chutes and frameworks supporting its operations. This structure towers over the scene, set against a dense backdrop of lush green trees that contrast starkly with the industrial foreground.\n\nThe overall composition balances natural elements with human-made structures and machinery, illustrating the intrusion of industrial operations into a forested area. The image conveys a sense of the industrial era's scale and its environmental impact.","title":"Coal is shown spilling from a conveyor belt at mine #21 owned by the Tennessee consolidated coal company near jasper and Chattanooga, Tennessee.  It will be trucked to the company's processing plant for cleaning and sorting.  Most of the metallurical (high grade) coal will be sold to japan.
