{"path":"543576.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of an air conditioning unit covered with frost. The upper section of the unit shows several vertical cooling fins peeking through a layer of ice and frost that coats them. Below this, there is a visible accumulation of dense frost build-up, denser and thicker than on the upper fins. Multiple stalactite-like formations of ice dangle down from the bulk of accumulated frost, some of which are melting and forming droplets of water. The image highlights the texture and detail of the ice and frost, showing how it clings to the structure of the air conditioner, suggesting cold weather conditions or a dysfunction causing excessive icing. The color palette is largely muted, with shades of gray, white, and subtle hints of green from possible algal growth. The focus and lighting emphasize the cold and icy textures, giving it a slightly eerie and frozen aspect.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["555005","543562","545865","557197","547166","557607","557200","543167","547153","557199","546888","557198","543770","543098","543766","552907"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["frost","ice","unit","air","conditioning","melte","fin","bulk","cooling","accumulate"]}
