{"path":"550972.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph features an industrial or possibly small-town scene framed against a vivid blue sky, scattered with voluminous clouds tinged with a hint of pink and purple, likely indicating early morning or late afternoon. Dominating the center background is a large cloud of dirty, orange-tinted smoke rising prominently and dispersing into the sky, suggesting air pollution likely emanating from the industrial activity depicted.\n\nIn the foreground, the scene is lined with a road where a variety of vintage vehicles, including a prominent red truck, a police car, and a couple of other cars, move along or are parked. Structures flanking the road include low-rise commercial buildings with prominent signage, such as \"MARKET\" featured on one building, and adjacent to it is another building labeled \"LIVE BAIT\" identifying a store selling fishing supplies. Also visible is a large water tower standing in the mid-ground, characteristic of small American towns.\n\nThe surrounding environment includes lush green mountains, which embrace the town, adding a natural contrast to the industrial activity and hinting at a rural or semi-rural setting. The overall atmosphere conveys a day-to-day snapshot of life in a town engaged with industrial operations, coupled with regular traffic movement and possibly local commerce.","title":"Union Carbide's ferro Alloy plant at Alloy, WV., on U.S. Route 60","placename":"Charleston (W.
