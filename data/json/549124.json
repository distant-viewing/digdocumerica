{"path":"549124.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial mining scene in a large open pit setting. Dominating the foreground is a large mining dragline with a visible bucket, which is situated on a muddy, rugged landscape filled predominantly with dark soil and rocks. The dragline is mounted on tracks and painted with faded colors, mainly yellows and blues, indicating it has been used extensively. The body of the machine houses what appears to be the motor and operator's cabin, both essential for the machine's operation. \n\nIn the background, there are mounds of earth that have been displaced as a result of the mining activity. Another large piece of mining equipment, which resembles a crane, is noticeable in the distance at the ridge of the newly formed earth banks. This equipment points to the ongoing excavation and earth-moving processes typical of such industrial environments.\n\nSurrounding the scene, the terrain is barren with no visible vegetation, emphasizing the industrial nature of the location. The sky is overcast, lending a gloomy and heavy atmosphere to the setting, which is common in areas undergoing extensive mining due to dust and emissions.\n\nOverall, the composition and elements present in the picture present a vivid snapshot of the mining operations, highlighting heavy machinery and the transformation of the natural landscape due to industrial activities.","title":"Peabody coal company strip mine, south of colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["554812","554826","552416","552418","555644","545831","555606","554831","552417","544139","544099","554769","544134","543639","549126","554828"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","earth","machine","for","transformation","undergo","operator","banks","gloomy","motor"]}
