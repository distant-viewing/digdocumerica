{"path":"551492.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a city street scene, focused on a ground-level view of a circular feature made of different shades of stone or tiles, seemingly integrated into the pavement. This circle is nestled at the intersection of a seemingly pedestrian zone.\n\nThe street is quiet with only a few pedestrians visible, giving the image a somewhat peaceful yet urban atmosphere. On the left side of the street, there are buildings that host shops and possibly offices, with large glass windows and what appears to be pedestrian pathways between the structures. Directly in the background, a modern building with a glass facade dominates the view. \n\nThere's a skybridge connecting two buildings high above the street. This feature, along with the modern architecture of the buildings and street lamps, indicates a downtown area of a contemporary city.\n\nOn the far left and right of the photograph, there are people crossing the street and walking along the sidewalks. They are dressed in casual wear, suggesting a relaxed day in the city.\n\nOverhead, there's a clear sky that adds brightness to the scene, enhancing the visibility of urban elements and the activities of the people. There are no vehicles in sight, which might imply either the timing of the photo or a pedestrian-priority area in this part of the city.","title":"Geometric patterns of colored asphalt and terrazzo decorate the centers of the intersections along nicollet mall.
