{"path":"542741.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque natural setting, featuring a river winding through a rocky landscape. Toward the foreground and middle of the image, a large riverbed filled with smoothly rounded, sizeable boulders can be seen. The river appears calm, flowing gently among the stones.\n\nA significant aspect of the scene is the snaking, narrow pathway constructed along the river. The pathway includes several sections with stairs, allowing for easier navigation up the steep slopes. It also includes fenced sections for safety. The path winds from the foreground through the curves of the terrain, seemingly continuing far into the distance surrounded by lush greenery.\n\nThroughout the landscape, dense tree coverage suggests a forest environment. The trees, primarily green in color and seemingly mature, imply a well-established natural area. The backdrop, possibly mountainous, adds to the rugged charm of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition skillfully balances elements of water, rock, and vegetation, creating a serene and inviting natural vista. It appears to be a place for outdoor activities like hiking and possibly observing nature.","title":"Sequoia and kings canyon national parks","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["548156","542523","542557","542558","555674","543647","544861","542735","546171","542537","542583","542555","543789","545301","555575","550524"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pathway","river","wind","riverbed","section","vista","coverage","navigation","hiking","establish"]}
