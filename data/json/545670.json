{"path":"545670.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph shows a dramatic and somber scene of an aircraft crash at an outdoor location. At the center of the image is the wreckage of an aircraft that appears quite mangled and fragmented. The main body and structures of the plane are twisted and covered in debris, with pieces scattered around the sandy ground. Prominently visible on one of the larger fragments is the label “UNITED STAT”, likely part of the text \"UNITED STATES,\" indicating the aircraft might be from the United States.\n\nThe terrain is a reddish, sandy area typical of a desert environment. In the background, natural rock formations and large, flat-topped mesas suggest a location that could be in a southwestern desert of the USA, possibly in areas similar to Utah or Arizona.\n\nIn the scene, three people are examining the wreckage. They are dressed in dark clothes, possibly suits, which is unusual attire for an outdoor, rugged setting like this. The reason for their formal dress is not clear from the image alone. Their presence and activities suggest they could be investigators or officials assessing the crash site. They seem to be looking closely at the debris and discussing their findings.\n\nOverall, the mood of the photograph is grave, and the setting stark, emphasizing the seriousness and impact of the crash depicted.","title":"Wreckage of an army helicopter assigned to clean-up of the San Juan river oil spill","placename":"Powell, Lake (Utah and Ariz.)","location":"Powell, Lake, Arizona","nn1":["545685","545681","544591","547982","554302","542577","553863","551089","554303","555780","547888","552083","555199","555869","554437","550020"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["crash","aircraft","wreckage","fragment","desert","mangle","official","reason","twist","mesa"]}
