{"path":"556149.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up portrait of an elderly African-American man wearing a dark fedora hat and thick-rimmed glasses. He is looking slightly away from the camera. The man's expression appears serious and contemplative. He is dressed in a dark, vertically striped green shirt, a practical attire which, along with his overall appearance, suggests a sense of timeless style and character.\n\nThe background is blurred and features vertical metal bars, giving a sense of depth and possibly an urban setting. The lighting on the man's face is soft yet highlights his facial features well, accentuating the textures of his skin and the slight sheen of perspiration, possibly indicating a warm day or physical exertion prior to the capture of the image.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with the man slightly off to the right and looking towards the left, adds a dynamic element to the portrait. His gaze directed out of frame evokes curiosity about his thoughts or what he might be looking at. Overall, the photograph offers a strong emotional and visual narrative about its subject.","title":"A black man, one of nearly 1.2 million people of his race who make up over one third of Chicago's population. It is one of the many black faces in this project that portray life in all its seasons. The photos are portraits that reflect pride, love, beauty, hope struggle, joy, hate, frustration, discontent, worship and faith. In short, portraits of individual human beings who are proud of their heritage.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556133","554857","556137","547179","556452","548226","556147","552103","554858","553176","547282","556563","548236","556443","548218","543701"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["portrait","exertion","fedora","man","sheen","capture","bar","skin","gaze","curiosity"]}
