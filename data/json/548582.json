{"path":"548582.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of elderly women engaged in a game of Mahjong. In the foreground, an elderly woman with curly gray hair, wearing glasses, gold earrings, and a colorful dress with green, red and white patterns, is focused intently on the game. She is seated at a table, holding a Mahjong tile in her hand and appears to be contemplating her move. \n\nThe table is covered with a white cloth, and several Mahjong tiles are neatly arranged in rows on a tile holder, indicating the ongoing game. A card with printed text and Chinese characters, possibly a guide or a scorecard, is seen in front of her.\n\nIn the background, two more women are visible. One of them, to the left, is wearing a light yellow tank top and sunglasses atop her head, actively engaging with someone out of the shot or observing the game. Another woman, standing and partially obscured, wears a floral pink and yellow tank top. She seems to be chatting with others or watching the game.\n\nThe setting appears to be an outdoor or a semi-outdoor area under a shelter, with a bright daylight illuminating the scene, suggesting a social, casual gathering during the day. The atmosphere is relaxed and leisurely, typical of a social game setting among friends or community members.","title":"\"Mah-jong\" at the club-house of the Century Village retirement community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548586","548581","558320","558227","558329","552627","557362","556702","546155","557175","558342","548580","548646","544213","557795","546855"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["game","tile","woman","table","holder","tank","card","guide","move","earring"]}
