{"path":"545391.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a man standing near a car in an outdoor setting. The man is prominently placed in the foreground, centered in the composition. He is dressed in a matching mustard-colored short-sleeve shirt and pants, with his shirt buttoned up to the top and tucked neatly into his trousers. The trousers are secured with a dark belt. The sunlight illuminates the man from behind, creating a backlight effect and causing some parts near his edges to slightly glow.\n\nThe car, appearing partially and focused on the left side of the frame, shows just the rear trunk area with a noticeably dusty or dirty surface that reflects some sunlight. The car's color looks to be a dark tone, contrasting with the light-colored dust.\n\nIn the background, there is a rustic setting with overgrown vegetation and some small trees, suggesting a rural or semi-rural environment. The sky above is partially visible with a light blue tone and minor cloud coverage.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photo has a warm, sunny feel, but the exact expression and features of the man are not entirely clear due to the backlighting and the resolution of the image. His posture and position suggest he is either stepping forward or standing still in a relaxed pose.","title":"Resident of community adjacent to u.s.  Steel plant.
