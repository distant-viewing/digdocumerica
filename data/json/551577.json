{"path":"551577.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling industrial waterfront scene. The foreground is dominated by a shimmering body of water, its surface speckled with sunlight, suggesting the photo was taken on a bright day. In the middle ground, there's a large cargo ship docked at the port, with multiple cranes and other cargo-handling equipment visible, indicating ongoing loading or unloading activities.\n\nBehind the ship, several prominent structures loom, including massive grain elevators or silos labeled \"CARGILL.\" These structures appear large and cylindrical, with vertical and horizontal features that are typical of bulk storage facilities in industrial ports.\n\nThe background features a hilly landscape under a partly cloudy sky, hinting that the port is likely situated in a valley or along a river's edge. The entire scene is bathed in natural light, enhancing the industrial aesthetic of the environment.\n\nThe setting suggests a focus on the import and export of goods, possibly grains, given the presence of the Cargill grain storage facilities, reflecting a vibrant trade and commercial activity. The overall composition of the photograph, with water in the foreground and industrial elements occupying the mid to background areas, portrays a harmonious integration of natural and man-made environments.","title":"Dust fills air as ships are loaded from the cargil grain elevator","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["551609","555760","552244","550906","551582","555270","547998","550910","552200","546828","552215","555773","555271","551574","552207","547572"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["grain","port","cargo","ship","storage","bulk","trade","integration","unloading","facility"]}
