{"path":"546199.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene in which several individuals are involved in activities at a water dam. Centrally, we see a woman and a small child walking cautiously along the curved, narrow concrete dam that cuts through the water. The child appears to be holding onto the woman's hand for balance. Additionally, the woman carries a red bag in her other hand. Behind them, another person is swimming alongside the dam, navigating through the water. In the background on the dam, another individual is kneeling, perhaps tying a shoe or picking something up, next to a fishing rod that extends over the water.\n\nFurther upstream, on the dam, there are two more individuals. One seems to be crouching or bending down while the other stands close by. The water around the dam shimmers in the sunlight, suggesting a bright sunny day. The left bank of the river is covered with large stones and boulders, and we can see two more people seated, likely enjoying the setting or observing the activities in the river.\n\nThe background features a natural landscape with sparse trees on the right river bank and clear blue sky above, emphasizing a serene and picturesque outdoor environment, ideal for leisure and recreation. The overall atmosphere is one of casual outdoor activity, with individuals engaging in walking, swimming, and possibly fishing or relaxing by the water.","title":"Campers in garner state park","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["542649","550213","546338","550846","553412","543530","546811","550847","550227","551525","551499","545941","543692","558065","551538","543164"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["dam","bank","individual","river","water","woman","fishe","child","relax","crouch"]}
