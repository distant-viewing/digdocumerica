{"path":"552074.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph depicts an agricultural scene where large, black tires are repurposed as containers for growing plants. These tires are arrayed in irregular rows upon a dry, cracked earthen ground, teeming with some uncultivated vegetation and weeds.\n\nEach tire is filled with soil, and within many, green shrubbery or small plants are flourishing. The setting is expansive, suggesting it might be part of a larger farm or rural area. The background stretches to a treeline in the distance under a clear, blue sky, indicating the area is quite open and possibly subject to direct sunlight, beneficial for the plants being grown.\n\nThis creative use of old tires likely serves a dual purpose: recycling unused materials and creating a controlled environment for plant growth, possibly conserving water and soil, and protecting young plants from external stresses. Such innovative farming techniques might be practiced in regions where traditional planting space is limited or where soil conditions are suboptimal.","title":"The greening of a junk pile. These discarded tires might have ended up littering a field or polluting a river. Instead, they have been salvaged by a Linwood farmer, who uses them to divide and support his tomato plants.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552075","546022","542531","546893","547517","548950","555521","544552","542565","557973","555541","553698","547986","555364","557673","554202"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["tire","plant","soil","stress","planting","treeline","weed","technique","shrubbery","farming"]}
