{"path":"543285.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a seagull in the midst of a beach setting. The focal point of the image is the bird, which is shown with its wings partially lifted as though it has just landed or is preparing to make another movement. In its beak, the seagull clutches a fish, suggesting a successful foraging effort. The fish appears to be large in relation to the bird, hinting at the seagull's prowess or luck in catching such a sizeable meal.\n\nThe background of the image is simple and unobtrusive, mostly consisting of a flat, sandy surface that fills the frame. The color palette of the background is a muted mix of grayish tones, contrasting subtly with the primarily white plumage of the seagull, making the bird stand out as the clear subject of the photo. The lighting in the photograph casts soft shadows on the sand, indicating either early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo together with its subject matter—a seagull and its prey on an undisturbed beach—evokes themes of survival and the daily life of coastal wildlife. The image is captured with a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the seagull and rendering the background slightly blurred, further emphasizing the action and the protagonist in this natural dynamic.","title":"California--zmudowski state beach","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"Zmudowski Beach State Park, California","nn1":["542919","549896","547008","554600","553347","552992","543281","543282","545995","550387","549738","543923","543317","552238","552146","548832"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["seagull","bird","fish","relation","beach","clutch","survival","beak","plumage","matter"]}
