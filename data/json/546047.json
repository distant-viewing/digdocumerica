{"path":"546047.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a striking visual juxtaposition and carries an environmental commentary. In the center of the image, a large industrial smokestack discharges a voluminous, dense cloud of smoke or steam that is gray in color. This emission contrasts starkly with the sky, which is tinged in hues of purple and pink, suggesting either an early morning or late evening setting.\n\nOn the right side of the composition, a church steeple is visible, characterized by its sharp, angular architecture and topped with a simple cross that silhouettes against the sky. The placement of these two elements— the industrial chimney and the religious steeple—next to each other creates a powerful symbolic contrast between industry and faith, man-made pollution and spiritual purity.\n\nThe overall mood of the scene is somewhat somber and reflective, enhanced by the dim lighting and the somewhat ominous presence of the smoke against the softer background of the twilight sky. The image might be interpreted as a commentary on environmental degradation in juxtaposition with spiritual or moral considerations, emphasizing a discord or call for reflection regarding human impact on the environment.","title":"The Kaiser Aluminum plant smokestack, behind the Catholic church, belches fumes over the residential area in the Chalmette section.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546048","546031","550905","545250","543013","550821","550333","551026","546042","545239","550938","545439","551062","546237","551054","555166"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["steeple","commentary","juxtaposition","consideration","regard","discharge","interpret","smoke","call","tinge"]}
