{"path":"558104.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor setting during what appears to be the autumn season, given the fall foliage and scattered leaves on the ground. In the foreground, there is a well-maintained grassy area with numerous fallen leaves spread across it, indicating a change in season. On the left side of the image, a small, white, traditional-style house with a porch is partially visible. The house features two visible windows and a darker roof, contributing to a quaint and cozy atmosphere.\n\nDominating the middle and right portions of the background are dense, tall trees displaying a range of autumn colors from deep green to vibrant oranges and browns. These trees form a natural backdrop, creating a sense of seclusion and natural beauty around the house. There are no visible people or active movements in the scene, which amplifies the tranquility and stillness of a typical autumnal landscape in a temperate climate. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and reflective, typical of a quiet residential area surrounded by nature.","title":"Gleeson Mound, a Hopewell burial place dated 100 A.D., is located behind a privately owned home at Gleeson Road and Valley View, Ohio, near Cleveland. The Cleveland Museum of Natural History reports the site is well maintained. The nearby Cuyahoga River was a major transportation artery for the Indians before being pushed out of the area by white settlers in the 19th century. This location is within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["558105","554715","558021","554633","557127","558102","554758","554738","554721","554737","558110","554668","554723","553458","557165","557159"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","autumn","season","leave","seclusion","outdoor","fall","stillness","change","porch"]}
