{"path":"558104.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor setting during what appears to be the autumn season, given the fall foliage and scattered leaves on the ground. In the foreground, there is a well-maintained grassy area with numerous fallen leaves spread across it, indicating a change in season. On the left side of the image, a small, white, traditional-style house with a porch is partially visible. The house features two visible windows and a darker roof, contributing to a quaint and cozy atmosphere.\n\nDominating the middle and right portions of the background are dense, tall trees displaying a range of autumn colors from deep green to vibrant oranges and browns. These trees form a natural backdrop, creating a sense of seclusion and natural beauty around the house. There are no visible people or active movements in the scene, which amplifies the tranquility and stillness of a typical autumnal landscape in a temperate climate. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and reflective, typical of a quiet residential area surrounded by nature.","title":"Gleeson mound, a hopewell burial placed dated 100 a.d., is located behind a privately owned home at gleeson road and valley view, Ohio, near Cleveland.
