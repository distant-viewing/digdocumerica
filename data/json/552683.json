{"path":"552683.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a plain, rural cemetery set in a dry, mountainous landscape. The ground is barren and sparsely vegetated, with patches of dry grass and scattered shrubs. A number of graves, marked by both traditional upright headstones and flat grave markers, are evident. Many of the graves have mementos, such as flowers (both fresh and artificial), statues, wreaths, and other personal items left by loved ones, indicating they are visited and tended to despite the rugged surroundings.\n\nThe cemetery is unenclosed and exposed to the elements, with no immediate signs of ongoing maintenance. The backdrop consists of rolling hills and a clear sky with a few fluffy clouds, suggesting a remote location that emphasizes solitude and the passing of time in a quiet setting. The overall mood evoked by the scene is one of peaceful rest, seemingly undisturbed by the hustle of modern life, closely merging with the natural environment.","title":"De beque, like other small towns is the piceance basin, is barely maintaining itself.
