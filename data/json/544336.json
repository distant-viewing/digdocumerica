{"path":"544336.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil outdoor scene of a person engaging in leisurely activity in a natural setting. The primary focus is on an individual, who appears to be a young adult, swinging from a rope that is attached to an overhanging tree branch. The person is midway through the swing, hanging onto the rope with both hands and leaning back slightly. The background features a dense thicket of lush green foliage, indicating a forested or wooded area. The rope swing hangs over a clear body of water, possibly a river or lake, which dominates the foreground of the image. The water's surface is calm, reflecting the verdant hues of the surrounding trees. The overall composition of the image, with its natural earth tones and the dynamic posture of the swinging individual, conveys a sense of leisurely enjoyment and connection with nature.","title":"The havasu creek is owned by the national park service - though it is on the havaSupai indian reservation","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["553437","550830","553438","551498","551530","553436","557737","550829","551499","544339","551734","548800","543093","553435","552976","553439"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["swing","rope","overhange","hang","thicket","person","enjoyment","connection","forested","wooded"]}
