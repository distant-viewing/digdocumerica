{"path":"544778.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph offers an expansive aerial view of a vast landscape that appears to be a mix of wetlands and dry areas. The main elements include a long, straight roadway cutting through the scene from the lower left to the mid-right, bordered by areas of patchy vegetation and large expanses of what look like salt flats or dried mud flats.\n\nThe salt flats are characterized by their white, textured appearance, which contrasts dramatically with the darker areas of vegetation surrounding them. The white areas have patterns that suggest they could be either dry or shallowly submerged under water, with various intricate channels and indentations throughout.\n\nOn the left side, near the roadway, thereâ€™s a rounded formation covered in dense vegetation, possibly a small hill or raised area that stands out against the flatter surrounding terrain. Throughout the environment, there are numerous trails and marks, some of which are likely from vehicles, evidenced by the visible tire tracks.\n\nThe top of the image shows a horizon that blends into a hazy sky, suggesting overcast weather conditions, which casts a soft, diffuse light over the whole area. The landscape bears a raw, rugged natural beauty, likely shaped by both human activity and natural processes.","title":"Eastern Shore","placename":"Great Salt Lake (Utah)","location":"Great Salt Lake, Utah","nn1":["555865","544764","555863","544774","555844","543644","545623","548703","555864","555845","552902","550598","544721","553867","550397","544733"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["flat","salt","roadway","vegetation","mark","mud","channel","area","tire","trail"]}
