{"path":"550675.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor event where several people are participating in what appears to be a lively auction or public gathering. The focus is on a man standing in the center who is speaking into a microphone. He is holding up a white, ceramic plate-like object, likely showcasing it to the audience. This man is dressed in a brown sweater and dark pants.\n\nNext to this central figure, another man, donning a striped shirt and hat, is also holding up a similar plate, actively participating in the event. Around these two men, there are a few other individuals observe, some looking upwards towards the plates being held aloft. One man in the background is wearing sunglasses and another hat, perhaps to shield from the sun, indicating the event is taking place during the daytime.\n\nThe setting includes a simple, low building with a dark exterior in the background, and there's a leafless tree visible above the building, suggesting it might be either late fall or winter. The image has a vintage feel, likely due to its color saturation and the style of clothing worn by the participants. The atmosphere appears informal and community-oriented, with people gathered closely together outdoors.","title":"Auction at milan, on the androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["547381","558293","551696","550671","557163","547378","550068","556526","551694","551749","552664","557135","557131","551690","558290","547374"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["plate","event","man","donn","hold","microphone","shield","hat","audience","participate"]}
