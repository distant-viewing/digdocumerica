{"path":"554718.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, sunlit deciduous forest during what appears to be early autumn. The predominant colors are earthy browns, soft greens, and subtle yellows, indicating the transitional period between seasons.\n\nSeveral dozen slender, medium-to-tall trees with thin trunks stand scattered throughout the image. Most trees are bare, suggesting that they have shed their leaves, but some retain yellow foliage, adding a splash of color and emphasizing the season. The forest floor is carpeted with a thick layer of fallen leaves that creates a textured blanket of browns and occasional spots of green vegetation.\n\nThe ground is uneven and covered with patches of moss and small rocks, hinting at a natural, rugged terrain. Light streams through the branches, creating dynamic patterns of shadow and sunlight across the forest floor, enhancing the depth and richness of the scene. The background and edges of the image fade into a blur of trees and light, focusing attention on the forest's serene and undisturbed appearance.\n\nNo human or animal activity is evident; the forest scene is tranquil, pure, and untouched by external disturbances, evoking a sense of peaceful isolation and natural beauty.","title":"Typical hardwood beech woodland with little undergrowth except ferns which usually are found on the southâ€‘facing slopes; this growth is at Cedar River Flow.","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557821","554728","554715","558012","547643","555216","550603","554394","554425","557822","555116","543581","558082","550791","550602","557159"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["forest","season","dozen","floor","brown","medium","richness","leave","blur","blanket"]}
