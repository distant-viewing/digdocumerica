{"path":"556692.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban railway yard under a cloudy sky. The perspective seems to be taken from an elevated position, looking down at multiple sets of railway tracks that converge and diverge in the distance. On these railway tracks, different models and types of passenger trains are visible, each in different states of motion or rest. Some tracks are empty while others hold stationary trains.\n\nAt the forefront, there is a platform with a parked train featuring a streamlined, metallic exterior suggesting it is relatively modern. To the right of this train, another section of the platform shows two more trains; one directly beside the platform and another on an outer track. Further back, multiple train lines can be seen including a densely packed yard filled with several more train cars and tracks.\n\nTo the left side of the image is a large parking area with neatly marked spaces. Only one car, a dark sedan, is parked there, which appears somewhat dated in model, indicative of the era captured in this photograph.\n\nIn the background, beyond the complexity of the rail yard, several industrial and residential buildings can be seen. The architecture is utilitarian, typical of urban surroundings. Prominent buildings and billboards add to the urban tableau, suggesting this scene is likely in a significant city.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its focus on the rail yard juxtaposed against an urban backdrop, conveys a sense of dynamic human activity centered on mass transportation. The color tones are muted, mostly in shades of gray and blue, adding a somewhat somber or subdued aesthetic to the scene.","title":"Long Island commuter trains arrive to interconnect with New York City Transit Authority subways. The subway system has 232 miles of track and is the longest in the world. In 1970 there was an average of 2.1 million people who rode the subway each day, about 47 percent of the work force. Despite its crucial importance, voters have refused to authorize new funds for any more improvements, or to allow the 35-cent fare to be raised to cover costs of the system.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547140","544664","556783","547050","546627","545541","556853","546719","552063","556841","547265","556900","556382","556852","556464","556076"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Transportation Hubs"],"terms":["train","yard","track","railway","platform","rail","model","tableau","billboard","set"]}
