{"path":"554959.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a dense forest scene bathed in soft, diffused light. The image is dominated by various species of tall trees, most prominently conifers, which have lush, green foliage. The forest has a mystical appearance, enhanced by a light fog or mist that seems to weave through the trees, creating layers of various shades of blues and greens.\n\nThe composition of the photo invites the viewer to look through a natural tunnel-like view formed by the trees. The lighting emphasizes the texture of the leaves and branches, and adds depth to the scene by highlighting some trees more than others. There doesn't appear to be any human activity or artificial structures, giving the scene a wild and serene atmosphere. The overall mood is calm and somewhat ethereal, with a strong impression of being immersed in nature.","title":"Douglas fir, hemlock and bigleaf maple in a fog shrouded valley in Ish Rivers country of the Pacific Northwest.
