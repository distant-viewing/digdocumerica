{"path":"554669.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene set in a picturesque park during autumn. The picture shows several people engaged in various activities, emphasizing a communal and recreational atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, there are three young individuals clearly in motion as if they are playing or running through a dirt path. One of them, on the left side, is a redhead male bending as if heâ€™s either dodging or picking something up. Near the center, another male appears to be following the first, while a female, probably around the same age, is slightly behind them. There's also a medium-sized, light-colored dog, possibly a golden retriever, facing the direction of the children and partaking in their activities.\n\nThe central part of the image shows a wooden boardwalk or bridge, filled with numerous people walking or standing, observing the surroundings or interacting with each other. The attire of the crowd, consisting mostly of light jackets and pants, suggests a cool but not cold climate, typical of autumn.\n\nThe background is dominated by vibrant fall foliage with trees displaying a spectrum of colors from green and yellow to red and orange. A calm body of water is visible beside the boardwalk adding a serene element to the scene. Beyond the park, a mountain can be seen, further enhancing the scenic beauty of the location with its gentle slopes and dense tree coverage.\n\nThe sky is clear and the overall lighting indicates a bright sunny day, enhancing the colors and shadows in the photograph. The scene is imbued with the joy of outdoor activities and the beauty of a change of seasons.","title":"Hikers and backpackers are shown on a busy fall weekend crossing the bridge over Marcy Dam, the most heavily used trail in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
