{"path":"551573.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This is an aerial photograph capturing a vast body of water and surrounding landscapes during what appears to be either early morning or late evening, given the soft, dim lighting and shadowy tones. The water body dominates the view, displaying a range of blues with slightly ruffled water texture, suggesting a gentle movement from wind or current.\n\nTo the left of the image, the coastline is visible, marked by undulating terrain and dense vegetation that comes right up to the shoreline. Small inlets and protruding peninsulas shape the coast, creating a natural, rugged look. The land features a variety of green tones indicating the presence of forests or thick bushes. Some areas also show lighter patches that could be sandy beaches or clearings.\n\nThe right in the aerial view spreads out into the distance, where the water extends to meet a hazy horizon, blending with the sky in a seamless transition. The overall effect is a tranquil, natural scene with no visible human influence like buildings or boats at the moment of capture.\n\nThis photograph has an overall peacefulness and isolation to it, accentuated by the large expanses of natural landscape and water, all bathed in a cool, subtle lighting.","title":"SouthWesterly currents have carried taconite tailings discharged by reserve mining company's plant in silver bay, to stony point, eight miles away","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["552922","556928","552229","542882","552141","548178","555728","543085","556905","552916","548604","556982","556931","553569","556923","548785"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["undulating","ruffle","shadowy","inlet","water","protrud","coast","peacefulness","influence","clearing"]}
