{"path":"545265.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph provides a view of an industrial district with signs of heavy pollution. In the foreground, there are various industrial elements including scattered stacks of lumber and railway tracks indicating the presence of a cargo or freight area. Also visible are several freight train containers to the left side, suggesting active rail transport operations.\n\nBeyond the immediate foreground, the middle ground hosts a collection of industrial buildings and facilities, characterized by their low-rise, flat structures. Several smokestacks are visible, releasing large volumes of smoke that billow into the sky, contributing to a thick haze that partially obscures the background.\n\nIn the background, despite the smog, the silhouette of a city skyline can be discerned, marked by several tall buildings including a prominent skyscraper. This juxtaposition emphasizes the contrast between the industrial area and the urban commercial hub.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the scene is grim and polluted, with a greyish haze dominating the sky, hinting at environmental degradation typically associated with industrial zones. The lighting in the photo suggests it might be either dawn or dusk, as the sky to the right appears slightly lighter than the rest of the overcast sky.","title":"Smog hangs over waterfront area, with tacoma skyline in background","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545268","550181","550185","557226","550172","550177","549965","550176","551054","550983","557225","545447","545434","557373","550862","555770"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["freight","smog","lumber","volume","release","host","hub","low","district","discern"]}
