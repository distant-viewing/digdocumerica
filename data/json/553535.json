{"path":"553535.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a serene indoor scene featuring a woman absorbed in reading a book. It exudes a quiet, contemplative atmosphere. The woman is seated on the floor with one leg folded up, leaning over a large, open book. Her dark hair falls over her face, partially concealing her expression focused on her reading.\n\nThe surrounding environment appears lived-in and slightly cluttered, suggesting a personal, intimate space. On the left side of the image, a small table is visible, covered with a cloth upon which various objects rest: a vase with flowers, a glass, and a bottle. Notably, a baby bottle rests on one of the cloths, hinting at the presence of a child in the vicinity. \n\nBehind the woman, the background is softly lit, revealing two photographs pinned to the wall; one is in clearer view and seems to portray a male figure, possibly adding a personal or familial layer to the setting. The room's soft, natural lighting and the abundance of personal objects create moody, reflective ambiance. This composition skillfully frames a moment of solitude and engagement, with the surrounding elements enriching the narrative of daily life and personal moments.","title":"Billy Watkins, one of nine children in a Mulky Square family, doesn't go to school, but he amuses himself sometimes by writing and drawing.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["555428","546478","546564","546479","546554","546474","555429","546560","552114","551294","546990","546500","545510","554193","556033","549361"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["cloth","bottle","book","vase","woman","in","baby","abundance","reading","object"]}
