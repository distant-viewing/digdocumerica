{"path":"556516.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a person in a dark, subdued setting, accentuated by minimal lighting. The focal point of the image is a face, dimly illuminated; only parts of the face—like the eyes and mouth—are visible, creating an effect that is both mysterious and dramatic. The surrounding area is enveloped in darkness, focusing all attention on the illuminated parts of the face. There appears to be a reflection or a secondary dim light source that faintly outlines other facial features, enhancing the eerie or introspective mood of the image. The overall composition leans towards a minimalistic and artistic portrayal, playing significantly with shadows and light to evoke emotion or contemplation.","title":"The glow of a miner's lamp illuminates the head of a co-worker as his lamp shines on his work in a mine of the Tennessee consolidated coal company near jasper and Chattanooga Tennessee.
