{"path":"554562.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene dominated by natural and man-made elements. In the foreground, a variety of wildflowers, prominently yellow blossoms with a few white flowers mixed in, brighten a gravelly path. The vegetation suggests a late spring or summer season.\n\nBeyond the flowers, a lush green field stretches out, enhancing the sense of open space. Midway across the photo, a simple white house with a clearly visible slanted roof and a small visible porch area can be seen. This house appears modest and is typical of rural architecture, suggesting functionality over style.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is dominated by a large, densely wooded mountain, which rises prominently and fills the upper half of the frame. Its presence adds a sense of ruggedness and isolation to the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and quaint, with overcast skies suggesting a cool or damp day, which adds a soft, diffuse light to the image, reducing harsh shadows and highlighting the natural beauty of the setting. The composition pulls the viewerâ€™s eye from the vibrant foreground through the expansive middle ground and up to the imposing mountain, creating a deep sense of depth and space.","title":"Abandoned farm which did not succeed near Elizabethtown, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["557674","554721","554401","550667","543763","544997","554722","543660","544881","545040","557190","544857","557023","556341","557099","557087"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["flower","brighten","reduce","blossom","house","ruggedness","mountain","half","wildflower","functionality"]}
