{"path":"553307.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene from what appears to be a public demonstration or protest. Several individuals are present, mainly women, engaged in the demonstration activity. \n\nOne prominent female figure in the foreground wears a white polka-dotted scarf tied around her head, a white top with revealing mesh or lace on the back, and black tights paired with a miniskirt. She is holding a sign that says, \"YOU HAVE NOT COME A LONG WAY BABY!\" in bold red and black letters, with a large red exclamation point for emphasis.\n\nTo the left of her, another woman is visible, wearing a headscarf with a checkered pattern reminiscent of the 1970s. She holds a sign stating, \"Zero Population Growth supports [ERA],\" indicating involvement in environmental or reproductive rights issues along with support for the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nIn the background, glimpses of other participants can be seen, one of whom is a woman with curly hair dressed in a red blazer and blouse. There are other partially visible signs and a bicycle leaning against someone in the crowd, suggesting a casual yet politically active atmosphere. The setting is outdoors, possibly in a street or park, where various demonstrators have gathered, also suggesting the event took place during the day, under overcast lighting conditions.","title":"Women's suffrage day in fountain square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553321","553237","550077","556256","553140","543032","556257","553761","553267","547190","553143","557714","551939","553233","552720","556255"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["demonstration","woman","stating","lace","headscarf","polka","sign","scarf","mesh","blazer"]}
