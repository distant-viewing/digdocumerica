{"path":"550818.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic yet industrial landscape. In the foreground, there is a rocky river with rapids flowing through it. The water appears to be moving rapidly over and around large boulders, forming white foam and patterns in the current, suggesting significant water movement and possibly some pollution, evident from the foam and the sheen on the water surface.\n\nThe middle ground includes lush green grass and trees that frame the view. On the right side of the riverbank, there's a large, red industrial building prominently labeled \"Mosinee Paper Mills.\" The structure has multiple sections with varying roof heights, and a tall red and white water tower stands adjacent to it. What appears to be two large smokestacks are emitting billowing white smoke, venting into the overcast sky, which fills the background, giving the scene a grim, heavy industrial atmosphere.\n\nThe landscape has both natural beauty and overt signs of industry, creating a stark contrast between the environmental and manufactured elements of the scene. This blend highlights the interaction, and potentially the conflict, between nature and industrial activity in this area.","title":"Scum forms on the Wisconsin river near the mosinee paper company","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["550814","550710","550673","551579","557222","550335","548061","551578","550860","550340","550684","550694","545152","551192","557377","554630"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["foam","rapid","manufacture","vent","sheen","current","boulder","water","billow","riverbank"]}
