{"path":"543625.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph displays a serene natural scene set during either sunrise or sunset. The image shows a large body of water with gentle ripples on its surface, implying a calm atmosphere. In the center of the image, there is an isolated island densely covered by shrubs and small trees. The sky above is expansive, with a mixture of darker and lighter shades creating a gradient, possibly due to the time of day. Wisps of clouds are scattered across the sky, enhancing the dramatic effect of the scene.\n\nIn the background, a range of mountains is faintly visible, adding a sense of depth and grandeur to the landscape. The mountains are partially obscured due to the low light, suggesting distance from the vantage point of the viewer. The overall mood of the photograph is tranquil and somewhat mysterious, accentuated by the natural lighting and the composition that focuses on the solitary island in the vast water body. The corners and edges of the image appear slightly darker, indicating that this might have been taken using a particular type of camera lens or filter that vignettes at the edges, common in older photographic processes.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552229","552336","542994","549446","557572","555692","552894","550389","557000","546963","543058","552142","542808","548030","554616","543611"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["island","vignette","mountain","sunrise","edge","gradient","grandeur","mixture","ripple","corner"]}
