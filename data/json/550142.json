{"path":"550142.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph is a vibrant street scene possibly taken during the 1960s or 1970s, displaying a lively urban environment full of activity. On the street, there are various pedestrians engaging in everyday activities, including walking and conversing with each other. The crowd is diverse, with men, women, and possibly some children or younger individuals, wearing clothing styles indicative of the period, such as suits, casual shirts, and dresses.\n\nThe setting is dominated by an array of colorful neon signs and advertisements showcasing various businesses such as \"Burro,\" \"Federal,\" \"Flaming Embers Steaks,\" and \"Best Jewelry.\" The architecture visible includes tall buildings with detailed facades, signs extending out from the structures into the street adding depth and a bustling commercial feel to the scene.\n\nTraffic is present, with cars of the era visible on the road. The street is also equipped with infrastructure typical of a busy city area, such as traffic lights, street lamps, signage indicating a bus stop, and dual \"Walk\" and \"One Way\" road signs. A noticeable detail is the civic signage for \"6 Euclid\" indicating a bus route or street direction, which adds a realistic element to the urban setting.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph seems natural, accentuated by the bright daylight which contributes to the clarity and vividness of the colors, particularly the reds and blues of the signs and traffic signals. The overall composition offers a dynamic but nostalgic snapshot of urban life during this time period, highlighting both the architecture and the day-to-day dynamics of people in the city.","title":"Euclid Avenue, Cleveland's main shipping street, a welter of shoppers and signs","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551125","550127","551135","548369","548399","549872","556224","550139","545216","548402","556225","549906","551494","548388","549882","552411"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","traffic","bus","sign","signage","period","signal","neon","stop","architecture"]}
