{"path":"551001.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from a rustic, possibly economically distressed area, likely in a rural or small-town setting. The image is dominated by a row of dilapidated, wooden houses showing significant signs of wear and neglect, such as peeling paint and damaged roofs. The houses are set against a backdrop of lush green hills, giving the area a secluded, enveloped feel.\n\nAt the center of the composition are three children engaged in outdoor activities, infusing life into the otherwise desolate-looking street. Two of the children are riding bicycles, while the third seems to be running alongside them. The children are engaging with each other in a way that suggests play and everyday familiarity with their surroundings. \n\nOn the left side of the image, there is an old car, perhaps a Dodge or a similar model from the mid-20th century, parked in front of one of the houses. The car, like the buildings, appears worn and unmaintained, with visible rust and dirt. The presence of this old vehicle contributes to the historical and time-worn aura of the setting.\n\nOther noteworthy elements include various objects lying around: tires, a kind of axle or metal wheel nearby the car, and assorted debris scattered along the dirt road. These items further emphasize the neglected state of the area. The utility poles and lines suggest that despite its appearance, this is not a completely abandoned place.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of a close-knit community living in a harsh economic environment, whilst showing glimpses of the innocent and carefree play of children against a backdrop of challenge and decay.","title":"Rand, W.Va., with much of its population living in poverty, has many unpaved roads, substandard houses, and junked autoMobiles.","placename":"Charleston (W.
