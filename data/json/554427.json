{"path":"554427.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a logging or wood processing site. A young man, who looks to be a worker, is visible in the foreground. He is wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt, dark pants, and appears to be walking while looking to his side, possibly towards a destination or another person off-camera. He is positioned under a large metal structure, possibly a conveyance system or part of a processing facility, which is supporting a substantial load of logged tree trunks.\n\nBehind this man, on the right side of the image, there is heavy machinery, specifically a yellow backhoe or digger, with its arm extended towards the piles of tree trunks. These logs are also stacked on top of the metal structure above the man. The background shows a tree-lined horizon, suggesting that the site is either on the edge of a forest or in a heavily wooded area.\n\nThe ground is littered with wood debris and foliage, indicative of recent logging activity. The overall atmosphere is busy and industrially focused, centered around the processing or movement of these large tree logs.\n","title":"Logs taken from skidder are loaded onto receiving ramp at the litchfield paper company mill near Tupper Lake","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554419","554416","554418","555472","550337","545046","542857","542790","542856","542623","553612","553644","553646","553641","553645","544007"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","processing","logging","trunk","wood","site","destination","tree","metal","man"]}
