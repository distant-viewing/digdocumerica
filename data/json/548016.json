{"path":"548016.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a large dam structure with distinct architectural features. The dominant feature is the dam itself, which stretches across the image horizontally. The dam comprises multiple gated sections, likely for regulating water flow, and each gate has a triangular shape, adding a geometric aesthetic to the structure.\n\nAdjacent to the dam, on the left side of the image, there's a large spillway which is a stair-stepped decline likely utilized for overflow purposes. This spillway appears to be made out of concrete, and each step is clearly visible, descending towards the the river below.\n\nThe water around the dam exhibits two different shades. Directly underneath the dam and in the immediate spillway area, the water appears darker, suggesting greater depth or shadowing from the dam itself. Beyond the spillway, particularly at the bottom right corner of the image, the water is lighter in color, possible due to shallower depth or presence of sediments. No significant built-up areas or vegetation is visible in the immediate vicinity of the dam, indicating the structure's isolation or the focus on the utilitarian nature of the area. No people or moving vehicles are visible, implying a lack of activity at the moment the photograph was taken. The overall ambiance is industrial and functional.","title":"The spillway at priest rapods dam","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["548003","548936","548013","551212","548150","548012","548920","544141","548007","548938","548927","548940","548947","543978","549004","544166"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","spillway","step","regulate","decline","gate","stair","descend","water","sediment"]}
