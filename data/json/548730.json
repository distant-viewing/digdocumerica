{"path":"548730.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a large, colorful advertising billboard standing prominently against a natural background. The billboard is structured in two parts and mounted on two sturdy, reddish-brown wooden poles. The top part of the billboard is a directional sign painted in a bright yellow background with bold, black text stating \"TURN LEFT 3 1/2 Mi.\" alongside indicating \"6 Mi. North of Key West Tamarac Park.\" The bottom half of the billboard, separated by a horizontal line, advertises \"WATERFRONT MOBILE HOMESITES\" in black text on a yellow background with \"MOBILE HOMES ON DISPLAY\" and \"BIG SALE\" emphasized in larger type. The phrase \"Early Terms\" is also visible in smaller print.\n\nThe backdrop of the image features a stormy sky, cast in grey, suggesting an impending or current poor weather condition. Below the skyline, there is a stretch of dense, lush greenery, predominantly shrubs or small trees, that forms a natural horizon line. On the left side of the photograph, slightly below the level of the sign, a single white bird is perched atop one of the trees, adding a touch of natural life to the scene. Overall, the image captures a juxtaposition between human commercial endeavor and the natural environment.","title":"A typical developer's sign in the Florida Keys","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548674","547648","546425","543557","545263","548762","547841","544551","546421","544594","557419","543814","544145","543100","544287","557502"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["billboard","text","print","phrase","advertising","endeavor","stretch","half","sale","term"]}
