{"path":"546965.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a sandy beach with a foreground focus on discarded debris and a background filled with beachgoers. In the foreground, there is a collection of trash prominently featuring discarded beer cans and bottles, a crumpled brown paper bag, and some other small debris laid out on the sand, suggesting recent human activity and negligence towards environmental cleanliness.\n\nThe background of the image shows a typical beach scene under an overcast sky. Numerous people are scattered across the shore, engaging in various beach activities. Some are lying down sunbathing, while others stand or walk around. There's a diversity in the crowd—individuals and groups, some closer to the water and others further back on the beach. The ocean itself is not clearly visible, focusing the viewer’s attention more on the sandy area and the people thereon.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the relaxed, leisurely mood of the beachgoers against the immediate environmental impact of pollution, creating a narrative about human recreational habits and their consequences on natural settings. The placement of the camera close to the ground among the trash adds a striking perspective and dominates the visual narrative, making the environmental message apparent.","title":"Littered beach at isle of palms","placename":"South Carolina","location":"South Carolina","nn1":["548747","550197","546374","547831","550215","550687","543056","546393","550280","552080","543698","548741","550276","549820","547545","548617"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["beach","beachgoer","trash","discard","narrative","sunbathing","consequence","cleanliness","crumple","beer"]}
