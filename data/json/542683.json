{"path":"542683.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a city skyline during what appears to be sunset or sunrise, engulfed in a hazy, golden-orange glow likely indicative of air pollution or smog. The scene is layered, with a distinctive silhouette of a mountain range forming the upper background. The middle ground predominantly features densely packed urban buildings of various sizes. These include both high-rise and mid-rise structures, with visible antennas, water towers, and rooftop equipment, contributing to a varied outline against the skyline.\n\nIn the foreground, more buildings are visible, along with some foliage, including palm trees. The haze markedly obscures architectural details and casts the entire scene in a uniform orange tint, which may suggest the presence of significant environmental pollution. The lighting condition provides the photograph with a dramatic and somewhat somber mood, emphasizing the impact of urban sprawl and environmental issues. The overall composition uses layers and color saturation to create depth and elicit a response to the urban environmental condition depicted.","title":"'Low-hanging smog'","placename":"San Gabriel (Calif.)","location":"San Gabriel, California","nn1":["543969","544086","553021","549970","545499","544791","548385","544082","545428","551141","552394","544090","544783","545406","550190","549620"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["skyline","pollution","engulf","response","smog","antenna","layer","palm","rooftop","saturation"]}
