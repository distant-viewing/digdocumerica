{"path":"556954.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a forested coastal area with a combination of natural and residential elements. On the left side, you can see a large body of water with a sandy beach lining the edge. The water extends into the distance, suggesting it might be a bay or a lake.\n\nThe central and right parts of the image display a community nestled among dense green forests. There are numerous houses, most of which appear to have ample yard space and are surrounded by trees. The roads are winding and seem to be laid out to accommodate the natural landscape rather than following a strict grid pattern.\n\nThe upper right section of the photo shows more open, possibly agricultural land, as it is less densely forested than the other parts and has few visible structures. This area provides some contrast to the densely wooded and residential areas.\n\nThe top of the photo extends towards a horizon filled with similarly forested areas, and in the distance, there seems to be another body of water or perhaps a clearing. The overall impression is of a serene and scenic rural community living in harmony with a forest environment.","title":"Aerial view looking southwest at the gilberton area and Bremerton.
