{"path":"555281.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a laboratory. In the foreground, numerous scientific glassware items, such as beakers and flasks, are filled with various clear and colored liquids, prominently occupying the lower section of the image. These glass containers, equipped with rubber tubing and stoppers, suggest ongoing experimental activities.\n\nIn the background, a man, probably a scientist, is seen seated amid the clutter of laboratory equipment. He wears a white lab coat and a tie, indicating a professional setting. He appears focused and pensive, holding a notebook or journal, possibly recording observations or results from the experiments. His somber expression and direct gaze towards the camera or beyond it add a layer of solemnity to the scene.\n\nThe laboratory environment is further characterized by various other scientific instruments and setups, possibly including stands, clamps, and additional glassware blurred out owing to the focus on the glassware in the foreground. The overall lighting and color tones in the image suggest an indoor setting with artificial lighting, common in laboratory environments.\n\nThis image visually communicates the meticulous and focused nature of scientific research in a laboratory setting, emphasized by the dense arrangement of equipment and the scientist's engaged demeanor.","title":"An Environmental Protection Agency laboratory technician in New York City works with dithiocarbamate.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555280","546277","546284","542666","546278","543834","549332","549333","549349","555249","546296","545002","546275","549608","543801","555250"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["laboratory","glassware","scientist","tubing","flask","notebook","solemnity","rubber","clutter","result"]}
