{"path":"557376.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features an industrial scene likely captured near a body of water. In the foreground, there is a calm and reflective river that mirrors the background elements to some extent. On the far side of the river, a series of industrial buildings and facilities are seen, including a tall water tower to the left and stacks emitting smoke or steam near the center and the right side of the image. The colors of the industrial components are muted, predominantly shades of dark blues and grays, contributing to a heavy, industrial atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, forest-covered hills or mountains create a natural skyline, contrasting with the industrial foreground. This juxtaposition highlights the interplay between nature and human-made environments. The overall lighting suggests this photograph was taken on a bright day, yet the tones give a feeling of haze or slight pollution, possibly due to the emissions from the industrial processes depicted. The image overall evokes themes of industrialization, environmental impact, and the interface between natural landscapes and industrial development.","title":"Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. Emissions from the metallurgical plant were reduced 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975. The decrease occurred after agreement on a compliance schedule between Union Carbide and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards. The Kanawha River is in the foreground (see fiche #141 to 146).","placename":"Alloy (W.
