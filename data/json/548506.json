{"path":"548506.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of sailing on the ocean. In the foreground is a white sailboat moving from right to left in the frame, heavily inclined towards its left side indicating a strong breeze. The boat has a clean and well-maintained appearance, featuring a prominent mainsail and a smaller jib in front, both filled by the wind. The hull of the boat is predominantly white with a dark strip near the deck and on the bow, with the name \"EQUUS\" visible.\n\nOn the boat, two people can be seen: one seated at the rear, near the steering wheel, and the other positioned midship. They appear relaxed and are possibly enjoying their sailing activity, dressed in suitable outdoor attire for a day at sea.\n\nIn the background, the vast open ocean stretches to the horizon under a hazy sky, contributing to a serene marine ambience. Slightly to the right in the background, two other sailboats are visible at a distance, also sailing and adding to the picturesque nautical setting. The overall composition and soft, natural lighting create a tranquil maritime scene, characterized by the leisure and beauty of sailing.","title":"Chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["544667","549403","547463","548498","548521","549421","544224","552345","548203","549394","549409","552343","548513","547273","549386","548494"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sailboat","boat","sai","maintained","steering","ambience","breeze","bow","strip"]}
