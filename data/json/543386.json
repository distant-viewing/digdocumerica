{"path":"543386.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and joyful moment of a person sledging down a snowy slope. The subject is a young man who is seated on a simple wooden sled. He is dressed for winter weather, wearing a red jacket with a white pattern, dark trousers, and a pair of round, dark goggles. He also wears a dark hat and gloves. The man's expression is exuberant, with his mouth open in a shout and his eyes wide, adding a sense of excitement and thrill to the image.\n\nThe snowy environment around him is blurred due to his rapid movement, with snow particles visibly kicked up around him, creating a dynamic, action-packed scene. His posture and the position of his limbs suggest he is moving swiftly down the hill. The background is a white, snowy landscape that blends into a gray sky, emphasizing the wintry setting. The photograph has a sense of motion, capturing the sheer fun and adrenaline of sledging.","title":"Hikers of Explorer Post 397 of Los Angeles area takes slide during climb to Monarch Lake","placename":"Monarch Lakes (Calif.)","location":"Monarch Lakes, California","nn1":["549989","554252","554257","550017","550004","543377","554259","554261","548154","548153","555539","543384","558246","545701","554251","548032"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["goggle","thrill","fun","limb","particle","excitement","glove","mouth","pair","position"]}
