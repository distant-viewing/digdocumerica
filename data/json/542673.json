{"path":"542673.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a densely populated city from the vantage point of an airplane. The majority of the image shows a vast urban landscape filled with tightly packed buildings, streets, and several notable larger roads. There are no distinct skyscrapers, suggesting a sprawling urban area rather than a central business district.\n\nThe foreground prominently features part of the airplane, with the edge of a green wing visible in the lower right corner. This element adds a layer of depth and context to the image, indicating that this is a view from an in-flight aircraft.\n\nIn the background, a range of mountains can be seen, somewhat obscured by a haze which could be either mist or pollution, giving the scene a slightly blurred appearance. The mountains act as a natural boundary for the urban sprawl.\n\nThe color tone of the image has a vintage quality, likely due to the type of film used or the age of the photograph. The slightly grainy texture further confirms this older quality.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the vastness of an urban area juxtaposed with natural elements, viewed from an unusual aerial perspective.","title":"Smog over Los Angeles is monitored by scientists from nasa and statewide air pollution research center.
