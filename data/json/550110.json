{"path":"550110.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an urban streetscape likely from the late 20th century, characterized by a row of contiguous commercial buildings. The scene is viewed from a shaded perspective, possibly under a tree or an overhang, as suggested by shadows and a darkened foreground.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, there are clearly visible signs hanging perpendicular to the buildings, advertising various businesses. The names on the signs include “Rocky River School of Music” and “Offices John F. Seelie & Assoc.”, hinting at a mix of educational and professional services available in this locality.\n\nThe buildings have a rustic architectural style, with external white painted wood siding, decorative shutters next to the windows, and prominent, well-defined doorways that are slightly recessed from the sidewalk, offering a traditional, quaint feel.\n\nOn the sidewalk, two pedestrians are evident - capturing a slice of daily life. One person stands near the center of the frame, seemingly peering into or waiting near a doorway. This individual is dressed in casual contemporary clothes, holding a bag and might be a customer or someone having business in the building. Another person can be observed further down the sidewalk, walking away from the viewer, contributing to the narrative of a busy commercial street.\n\nThe overall ambiance is sunny and clear, indicated by the bright illumination and shadows cast on the sidewalk, suggesting that this photo was taken on a bright day. On the far right, a fire hydrant adds another urban element to the scene, enhancing the realistic depiction of a typical city street. Additionally, the streets and pathways are devoid of any noticeable litter or debris, presenting a clean and ordered environment.","title":"Attractive storefronts and signs give new life to decaying business section of suburban Rocky River","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546428","550107","545333","550114","550108","546440","550130","552933","550127","543360","556422","551474","542900","545362","550111","550115"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["sidewalk","doorway","business","street","locality","hydrant","recess","streetscape","peer","order"]}
