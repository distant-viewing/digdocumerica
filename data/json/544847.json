{"path":"544847.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures an impressive outdoor art installation. The scene is set in a mountainous area, where a massive orange fabric is draped over a valley, suspended between two rugged peaks. The fabric appears vast and billowing, stretching across the breadth of the valley and falling like a curtain against the natural landscape. Below the fabric, a small road winds along the contours of the valley, alongside which a river flows, adding a dynamic element to the peaceful environment.\n\nSeveral people are visible in the photograph, walking near or standing under the fabric, providing a sense of scale to the monumental art piece. They seem to be visitors, possibly tourists or locals, exploring or photographing the installation.\n\nThe setting also includes clear blue skies and the harsh sunlight casts shadows and illuminates the bright orange of the fabric, enhancing its vividness against the darker mountainous backdrop. The contrast between the man-made installation and the natural environment creates a striking visual juxtaposition, inviting viewers to reflect on the interaction between human creativity and natural beauty.","title":"Billowing across Rifle Gap, artist Christo Javacheff's six-ton $700,000 curtain billows across Rifle Gap.
