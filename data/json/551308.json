{"path":"551308.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaged in a thrilling water activity. They are in a small, speeding boat that's cutting through the water, generating sprays of water around it. The boat, possibly a small motorboat, has a sleek design and seems to be made of a light-colored material. \n\nThe two individuals on the boat appear lively and are interacting with the camera. They are both shirtless, suggesting warm weather, and are wearing life vests, indicating safety precautions for the activity. One person is driving the boat, gripping the steering mechanism attentively while looking straightforward, likely focusing on navigating. The other person is seated beside the driver, waving cheerfully at the camera, reflecting a joyous and adventurous mood.\n\nThe setting is aquatic, most likely a lake or a wide river, given the calm water. The lighting in the photograph is natural, with strong sunlight enhancing the energetic splash of the water droplets. This recreation scene captures a moment of joy and adventure, effectively conveying the excitement of water sports.","title":"A \"drag boat,\" one of a small number of such craft on the lake.
