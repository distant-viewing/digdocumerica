{"path":"554526.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and natural landscape featuring a body of water, likely a lake, which is bordered by a dense forest of primarily evergreen trees. The trees are lush and various shades of green, indicating healthy vegetation. In the background, a hill or mountain rises steeply from the waterâ€™s edge, covered with both deciduous and coniferous trees, illustrating a diverse ecosystem.\n\nThe left foreground shows branches with young, bright green leaves, suggesting that the photo was taken during spring or early summer when foliage is beginning to flourish. The sky, visible through a slight break in the clouds, hints at overcast weather, which casts a soft light over the entire scene and reflects gently off the lake.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with trees framing the lake and the hill in the background, creates a sense of depth and tranquility. This setting appears to be a quiet, untouched natural environment, perfect for relaxation and reflection, away from urban settings. The image does not include any human activity, enhancing its feel of solitude and untouched nature.","title":"Hill of hardwood trees, including beech, birch and red and sugar maple, leafing out in spring.
