{"path":"554485.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene, predominantly featuring outdoor recreational activities and a picturesque natural landscape. In the foreground, there's a sandy picnic area marked by a wooden sign stating \"NO ANIMALS PERMITTED IN PICNIC OR BEACH AREAS,\" indicating the presence of a managed recreational site.\n\nAdjacent to the picnic area, a vintage two-tone (brown and cream) pickup truck parked next to the lake draws attention. The truck is connected to a trailer that carries a boat, moving towards the water. The truck and trailer are on a makeshift boat ramp extending into the lake.\n\nIn terms of human activity, several individuals are engaged with the boat. One person is inside the boat, adjusting something near the outboard motor, while another stands in the water beside the boat, appearing to guide or stabilize it. Two additional people are near the truck; one is standing by the driver's door seemingly interacting with someone inside the truck, while the other individual standing at the rear of the truck observes the activities around the boat.\n\nThe overall setting is enhanced by tall pine trees framing the scene, and the calm waters of the lake reflect a grey sky, hinting at overcast weather. In the distant background, dense forest and low undulating hills encircle the lake, completing this tranquil, outdoor landscape.","title":"Boater uses his pickup truck camper to pull his outboard motor runabout out of the water at Golden Beach State Campsite at Raquette Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543579","544002","551528","553082","544006","553133","554552","544260","554683","542527","555386","551219","544266","554684","544770","551259"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["truck","boat","lake","picnic","trailer","permit","ramp","encircle","stabilize","motor"]}
