{"path":"550119.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a multi-storied building, presumably an apartment complex, featuring a repetitive architectural pattern of balconies. The building facade is mostly concrete with a vertical and horizontal grid layout. The image is closely framed around a particular section of the building, showing several floors and multiple balconies.\n\nThe balconies have dark rails and some are enclosed with what appears to be either glass or plastic, reflecting a blue tone. There is considerable variation in how each apartment's balcony is utilized: some have curtains drawn, while others are open, allowing a glimpse into the living spaces. You can see various household items and furniture pieces on some of the balconies.\n\nNotably, there are two individuals visible in the photograph. One person is standing on a balcony near the top of the frame, leaning over the balcony rail while wearing a red top. Below and slightly to the left, another person is partially visible through what appears to be a clear balcony enclosure; this person is facing away from the viewer.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of urban dwelling, emphasizing both the uniformity of the building design and the individuality of how people inhabit these spaces.","title":"Park centre, downtown apartment building at east 12th and chester streets.
