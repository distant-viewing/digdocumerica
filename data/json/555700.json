{"path":"555700.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph presents a fascinating aerial view of a densely forested island or landmass, surrounded by water. The uniqueness of the image lies in its perspective and how it is rotated such that the reflection of the trees in the water creates an optical illusion, making the terrain appear as if it's floating in mid-air.\n\nLet's break down the elements:\n\n1. **Trees:** The prominent feature in the image is the dense covering of dark green trees. They cover the entire landmass, appearing lush and vibrant, hinting at a natural, untouched environment.\n\n2. **Water:** Surrounding the forested area is a body of water, likely a lake or a calm river, considering the smoothness and the expansive reflection. The water mirrors the shape and texture of the trees very sharply and clearly, contributing to the surreal, dream-like quality of the image.\n\n3. **Reflection:** The optical illusion results from the reflection of the trees in the water. The reflection is exceptionally clear, duplicating every detail of the trees above and resulting in what appears like an upside-down mountain range or a floating island.\n\n4. **Color Palette:** The image utilizes a cool color palette, with dominant blues and greens that evoke a serene, almost mystical scene. This palette suggests that the photograph was either taken in early morning light or possibly altered for a specific mood effect.\n\n5. **Composition and Perspective:** The rotation of the image adds an artistic touch, playing with the viewerâ€™s perception and enhancing the visual impact. It challenges the viewer's orientation and encourages them to look closer.\n\nOverall, the image is both disorienting and captivating, with a strong focus on natural beauty and a touch of surrealism through clever manipulation of perspective and reflections.","title":"Port Valdez waters appear milky under some lighting conditions as a result of suspended sediments dumped into the sea by the lowe river and others like it which annually dump tons of ground rock flour into the ocean.
