The audience is seated in pews, facing forward towards the stage area. Many attendees are wearing hats, suggesting a formal occasion. Several individuals in the foreground are identifiable by their diverse attire, which ranges from modern casual to formal dresses and suits.\n\nOn stage, there is a large choir dressed in traditional red and white robes, actively engaged in singing or preparation to sing, as indicated by some members holding choir books. To the right-hand side of the stage, an organist is visible, playing a large pipe organ. The stage is backed by a significant stained-glass window, contributing to the reverential and colorful atmosphere.\n\nThe church's architectural design combines a semicircular auditorium style with a vaulted ceiling, enhancing acoustics for the musical performance. The overall composition of the photograph captures both the grandeur of the setting and the communal aspect of the event, highlighted by the rapt attention of the participants and the audience. The setting promotes a sense of community and shared experience, framed by the architectural and decorative elements of the church interior.","title":"Services at sixth avenue baptist church","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["558388","545377","558400","556238","556241","558408","558391","558382","552623","558407","558383","558404","558406","545470","558401","558384"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["stage","church","audience","pew","ceremony","event","suits","occasion","promote","attendee"]}
