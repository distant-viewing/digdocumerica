{"path":"543393.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic scene of a surfer riding a wave in the ocean. The surfer, positioned centrally in the composition, is silhouetted against the bright background of the sea and sky due to backlighting from the sun. The surfer stands upright on a surfboard, facing left, with one arm extended for balance.\n\nThe surfboard cuts across a large, curling wave that shows a vibrant play of light through its translucent crest. The water surrounding the surfer is frothy and turbulent, suggesting strong wave action. In the background, calm ocean extends to the horizon under a clear sky, melding seamlessly with the bright, reflective water surface.\n\nThe overall lighting conditions indicate either early morning or late afternoon, creating long shadows and highlighting the textures of the waterâ€™s surface. The photo captures a sense of motion, both in the fluidity of the wave and the poised maneuver of the surfer.","title":"California -- southern Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["544964","554066","557424","543073","553687","543876","543251","543397","554065","547609","550237","543138","553690","543019","543253","552354"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["wave","surfboard","meld","fluidity","backlight","poise","crest","facing","maneuver","extend"]}
