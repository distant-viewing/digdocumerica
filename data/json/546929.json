{"path":"546929.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of construction workers at a high altitude on a structure. Three workers are visible; they are equipped with safety helmets and tools, and they are engaged in assembly or repair activities. The workers appear to be fastening or adjusting panels or beams on what looks like the top section of a large, wooden framework, possibly the top of a building under construction.\n\nIn the background, a large crane with a metal lattice structure is visible. The crane's boom is extended towards the sky, implying its use in lifting heavy materials to heights where the workers are stationed. The sky behind the scene is gray and overcast, suggesting a cool or cloudy day, which may impact visibility and working conditions.\n\nThe image angle is from below, looking up towards the workers and the top of the wooden structure, providing a dramatic sense of scale and the height at which the workers are operating. This angle highlights the risks and skills involved in such construction activities. The photograph has a gritty, realistic feel, likely intended to document the challenging and vital aspects of construction work.","title":"At work on the supports of a new bridge.
