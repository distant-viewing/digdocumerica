{"path":"550125.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant residential scene featuring older, large homes, typical of early 20th-century architecture. The focus is on the left house, which has a grayish-blue color scheme, a covered porch supported by columns with stone bases, and a balcony above the porch. The right side of the image shows another house, painted dark gray with visible red brick steps leading to a porch similar in construction style to the first.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a lush garden containing various shrubs and flowering plants, prominently featuring large, blooming red bushes which possibly are azaleas or rhododendrons. The yards are divided by a walkway leading to the homes.\n\nA young, fair-haired girl is visible; she is bending over the shrubs and seems to be engaged in gardening or examining the plants more closely. She is wearing a light-colored sleeveless dress which contrasts with the dark foliage and rich floral colors around her.\n\nThe setting is bright and sunny, casting shadows that indicate either morning or late afternoon lighting. The overall scene is quaint and peaceful, evoking a sense of quiet suburban life.","title":"Well maintained block on Crawford road","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546441","557641","557094","546439","556448","548662","550117","550121","556433","558160","557076","558155","546434","558036","557068","548664"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","home","shrub","first","basis","grayish","gardening","house","lead","scheme"]}
