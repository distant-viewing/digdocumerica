{"path":"550281.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"In this photograph, you can see a close-up view of an old, metallic, possibly coal-powered machinery enveloped in thick, white smoke. The main focus of the image is a weathered, soot-covered metal furnace or engine part, characterized by its robust, cylindrical shape and a squared base that sits directly on a metal platform. The glass window on the front provides a view into the illuminated interior, hinting at intense heat.\n\nThis component appears to have a lid or opening mechanism on the top, suggesting it may be used for firing or heating something inside. The surrounding area is obscured mostly by the dense white smoke that dominates the scene, though part of a dark, rectangular structure is barely visible through the haze. The background is grimy and underlit, emphasizing the industrial setting. The blue-tinted dark hues of the photograph further add to the obsolete and rugged industrial atmosphere.","title":"Smoke at Republic Steel","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["557397","544045","546757","557396","547468","546884","542544","545920","557214","542591","545236","544049","546191","546760","555330","545445"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["furnace","lid","smoke","heat","mechanism","coal","engine","opening","metal","component"]}
