{"path":"546708.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a city block featuring a large parking area densely packed with cars. The scene includes several distinct parts.\n\nOn the main street running vertically through the image, cars are visible in motion, indicating an active, busy area. Parallel and perpendicular streets intersect, guiding the traffic around the block.\n\nCentral to the image are two large adjoining parking lots filled primarily with cars, suggesting a commercial or industrial area where many employees or visitors gather. Both parking lots are surrounded by several buildings, likely offices or businesses due to their proximity to the parking spaces and their utilitarian architectural styles, which include flat roofs and minimal decorative features.\n\nSurrounding the parking lots and streets are various other structures, including what appears to be a church with a tall, pointed steeple on the left, indicating a mixed-use area where commercial and possibly residential properties coexist. Additionally, scattered trees and greenery line the streets, offering a contrast to the urban environment.\n\nOverall, the dense arrangement of cars and the layout of the roads suggest a well-utilized urban space likely bustling with daily activities. The photograph provides a snapshot of urban planning that accommodates both vehicular and pedestrian traffic, interspersed with architectural diversity.","title":"Crowded parking area","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546715","546671","549875","546579","548434","556722","546716","546723","543961","547776","550126","550100","546732","548419","546617","549476"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["parking","block","lot","street","adjoin","employee","car","traffic","streets","accommodate"]}
