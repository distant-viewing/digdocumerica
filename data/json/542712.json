{"path":"542712.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is an impactful photograph showing a vast field being consumed by fire. The foreground and much of the middle section of the image are dominated by flames and smoke rising from the burning field. The fire appears intense, with bright orange flames and thick, darker smoke plumes, indicating a substantial and fierce burn.\n\nThe vegetation, likely tall grass or crop stubble, has been mostly burnt, revealing scorched earth and the remnants of some plant structure that has not yet completely combusted. The unburned patches contrast starkly with the fiery areas, enhancing the visual representation of the fire's destructive path.\n\nIn the background, the horizon is somewhat obscured by the smoke, but a hint of a landscape or distant structures can be perceived, although details are not clearly distinguishable due to the haze.\n\nThe sky above the scene has a gradient effect; it appears lighter near the horizon and progressively darkens as it extends upwards, suggesting either the time of the day being either early morning or late afternoon, or it could be an effect of the smoke partially blocking the sunlight.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures the dramatic and harsh reality of a field fire, possibly for agricultural management or due to natural causes, showing both the destructive power of fire and the stark beauty it can inadvertently create in a landscape.","title":"Burning grass","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["547728","553128","548977","548591","553843","548592","548590","547736","555157","555156","548597","548595","548853","545025","548854","543908"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["fire","burn","smoke","flame","field","consume","effect","reality","darken","representation"]}
