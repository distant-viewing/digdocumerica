{"path":"548171.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a gas station scene, captured with a focus on a makeshift sign stating \"NO GAS\" prominently displayed in the service window. The sign seems to be crafted from a large piece of cardboard, with the message painted in bold, black letters. \n\nIn the background, inside the service station window, several objects are visible, contributing to a somewhat cluttered look. These include a small can of product marked as Bar's Leaks, an automotive additive, alongside other unidentifiable containers and automotive products. There's a paper bag labeled \"CARTERS,\" and various papers and posters scattered around, including a large map and a Monroe shock absorbers box, hinting at automotive services or products offered here.\n\nThe composition includes a stone wall forming part of the station's structure, visible through the window. This rustic detail contrasts with the modernity of the gas pump, which is out of focus in the foreground, labeled with prices and fuel grades, capped at 99.9 cents, which may suggest the era when the photograph was taken.\n\nThis photo captures not just physical elements but a moment of shortage or crisis, indicated by the \"NO GAS\" sign, giving it historical and possibly economic significance.","title":"Away from the freeway, many Portland service stations carry signs like this","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548169","555413","548173","555494","548053","548047","555434","548174","555416","555414","548176","555455","548049","548168","548175","555452"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["gas","product","service","station","paper","label","modernity","crisis","shortage","window"]}
