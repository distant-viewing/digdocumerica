{"path":"554854.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features a large pile of weathered and gnarled tree roots and stumps, filling most of the frame with their twisted and intricate forms. The roots and stumps are clustered in a disorderly heap, exhibiting various shades of brown, gray and hints of white, probably indicating aging or exposure to elements. Their textures are rough and jagged, suggesting that they may have been uprooted from the ground a while ago.\n\nIn the background, partially shielded by the high pile of wooden debris, there are two people visible. They wear protective gear, including helmets and light-colored clothing, which might suggest they are workers involved in managing or processing these tree remains. They seem to be standing or moving behind the pile, within a structure that appears to be an open-sided shed or warehouse with a dark-colored roof, supported by visible beams and columns. The shelter might be used to store or process the wood, shielding it and the workers from environmental elements.\n\nThe overall mood of the image conveys a sense of industry, perhaps related to forestry, tree removal, or landscaping activities. The environment looks a bit bleak possibly due to overcast weather, adding to the utilitarian and rugged nature of the scene. The entire setting emphasizes themes of nature's raw textures and human interaction with the environment, suggesting laborious efforts related to wood processing or similar industries.","title":"Labor from mexico working at a cedar mill near Leakey Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["545060","555086","555092","542771","555205","553601","553612","542596","555143","542770","554997","553600","554416","555204","555208","552057"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["shield","root","stump","pile","industry","worker","uproot","removal","wood","process"]}
