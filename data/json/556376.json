{"path":"556376.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene likely within an industrial or mining environment. There are several individuals, presumably workers, visible in the image. The workers are outfitted with protective gear that includes hard hats, some with headlamps, and dirty, practical work clothes. Most of them appear to be exiting or standing near a gated area within an industrial structure, possibly at the end of a shift or during a work break.\n\nThe setting is characterized by robust metal structures, including a heavy metal frame and beams that suggest a substantial, utilitarian construction typical of industrial facilities. The floor is concrete and shows significant staining, possibly from oils or other industrial fluids.\n\nBehind the workers, diverse industrial elements are visible, including what looks like lifting equipment or hoisting mechanisms, as well as a variety of pipes and conduits, possibly for electrical or plumbing systems. The background reveals a barren landscape, likely indicating that this facility is located in a sparsely vegetated or industrial zone.\n\nOverall, the mood captured suggests a gritty, working environment where heavy machinery or materials are handled. The workers' expressions and posture suggest tiredness or the end of a demanding workday. The photograph likely aims to document the labor conditions, environment, or daily activities within such an industrial setting.","title":"Miners just emerging from the elevator of Virginia-pocahontas coal company mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia after returning to the surface from work below.
