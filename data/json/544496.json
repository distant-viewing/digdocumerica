{"path":"544496.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene coastal scene where a group of pelicans congregates near the shore, emphasizing a nature reserve atmosphere. At the center, a prominent sign with a clear message is mounted on a pole, reading \"NO BOATS ALLOWED AREA BEYOND HERE RESERVED FOR THE BIRDS,\" which is directly applicable to the scene at hand. Below and around the sign, several pelicans—both perched and in flight—are visible. Two pelicans are on the foreground shoreline, while others are grouped together slightly in the water. To the right, another similar sign stands in the distance, reinforcing the protected area's boundaries.\n\nThe background features a calm ocean extending to the horizon under a bright, clear sky, enhancing the tranquil and undisturbed setting intended for avian life. This backdrop, combined with the focused content of the signs, highlights measures taken to protect these birds by restricting human activity in the area. The composition effectively juxtaposes human-made elements (the signs) with the natural environment (the birds and the sea), conveying a message of coexistence and conservation.","title":"Pelicans on little pavillon key at 10,000 islands","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["548728","545187","545302","552911","552912","547008","544500","555554","544611","557489","544838","547865","552910","550903","552909","545991"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","reserve","sign","protect","message","congregate","restrict","focused","measure","content"]}
