{"path":"555961.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures two women seated next to each other on a wooden bench in what appears to be a public waiting area or a hall. The woman on the left is elderly with light, curly hair. She wears a bright yellow jacket over a lighter blouse and has glasses hanging from a chain necklace. She is focused on some type of pamphlet or small book she holds in her hands.\n\nBeside her, the younger woman, possibly middle-aged, features dark hair, also with glasses. She is dressed in a layered outfit that includes a striped scarf, a grey cardigan, and a multi-colored, striped blanket over her lap. This woman is engaged in knitting, holding needles and yarn in her hands.\n\nThe setting has an old-fashioned feel, highlighted by the warm-toned wood of the bench and paneled walls in the background. An advertisement poster is partially visible on the wall behind them, suggesting a public or commercial space.\n\nBetween the two women, there's a shopping bag placed on the floor, adding to the casual, everyday nature of the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of calm and quiet, with both women absorbed in their own activities.","title":"Amtrak train passengers pass the time before boarding at the Los Angeles union passenger terminal.
