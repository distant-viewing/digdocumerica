{"path":"552427.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial landscape, likely a mining operation or a large-scale excavation site. Central to the image is a body of water, bordered by rugged, eroded terrain consisting of contoured hills that appear to be made of loosely piled earth or sand. The colors of these mounds range from dark brown to gray. The water captures reflections and has subdued ripples on its surface, indicating a relatively calm state.\n\nIn the background, there are two large mechanical structures, possibly conveyors or cranes, which stand out against the otherwise natural and rugged terrain. These machines extend over the land and appear to be part of the mining or excavation process, implying movement of materials or resources.\n\nThe sky is overcast with grayish clouds, giving the scene a somber and industrial feel. The overall atmosphere of the image is quiet and desolate, focussing on the impact of industrial activities on a natural landscape. There is no visible wildlife or vegetation, emphasizing the starkness and possible environmental degradation associated with the site.","title":"Aftermath of strip mining in Monterey, in fulton county after land has been stripped, the cut often fills with water from underground springs and rain.
