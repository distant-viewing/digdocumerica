{"path":"554780.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape that appears both desolate and in the process of regrowth. In the foreground, a small, leafy tree or shrub stands prominently, its sparse branches and leaves contrasted against the clear sky. The ground around this plant is rough and covered with sparse vegetation and what looks like scattered debris or small rocks, suggesting recent land disturbance or ongoing recovery.\n\nBeyond the immediate foreground, the landscape opens into a wide, hilly terrain that looks barren in many areas with pockets of low vegetation. The coloration of the ground varies, with darker patches that could be indicative of wet soil or shadows, contrasted with lighter, dry soil areas. This expanse is not uniform and has irregularities that indicate erosion or perhaps excavation activities that have altered the natural topography.\n\nIn the distance, undulating hills line the horizon under a sky scattered with fluffy, white clouds, suggesting an expansive and open environment. The sky's vivid blue contrasts starkly with the earthy tones of the landscape, adding a sense of depth and vastness.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of bleakness interspersed with signs of natural recovery. There is no human activity visible, reinforcing the sense of abandonment and wilderness. This image may evoke contemplation on environmental impact and natureâ€™s resilience in face of human and natural alterations.","title":"A small, dying tree marks this land stripping restoration effort off Route 9.","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["549119","549183","543718","545534","555610","549179","548673","546056","544019","543658","552420","555103","545879","549132","544751","543722"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["recovery","soil","alteration","pocket","coloration","topography","disturbance","resilience","excavation","contemplation"]}
