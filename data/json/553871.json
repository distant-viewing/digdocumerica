{"path":"553871.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat unusual scene set in a large body of water, most likely a lake or a calm sea. In the foreground, a singular white Styrofoam cup is floating upright on the surface of the water. The dark blue water around the cup shows gentle ripples, suggesting a slight movement in an otherwise tranquil scene.\n\nThe background reveals a distant shoreline punctuated by low hills or a forested area that stretches across the horizon. Above this, the sky is overcast with shades of gray and blue, hinting at a cool or overcast day. The overall atmosphere of the image is one of quiet and stillness, with a focus on the singular, isolated object—the floating cup—which adds a touch of ponderous or environmental significance to the scene. The quality of the image, indicated by the fine grain and color saturation, suggests it might be shot on film, adding a vintage or timeless essence to the visual experience.","title":"Styrofoam cup adrift on dead calm waters of puget sound (from the sites exhibition.
