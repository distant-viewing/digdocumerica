{"path":"549542.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural outdoor scene focusing on a turbulent river. The vantage point seems to be from above, providing a view of swirling river waters, possibly from a waterfall or rapids. There are frothy white water patterns indicating strong currents and water movement, likely caused by the river flowing over and between rocks. The body of water extends towards the foggy background and is flanked by rock formations visible on the sides and foreground.\n\nThe foreground is partially dominated by a leafless tree with budding branches that suggest early spring. The tree's intricate branch structure adds a detailed, organic texture contrasting with the smooth, rushing water in the river.\n\nThe colors in the image are natural and subdued, consisting mainly of greens, blues, browns, and whites, evoking a serene yet dynamic natural setting. The photograph captures the power and beauty of natural water bodies, along with a hint of budding spring life with the presence of the tree.","title":"Outfall from the city of Niagara Falls sewage plant flows into the Niagara River below the falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549550","553855","553416","544856","550658","542743","550742","553653","550698","549442","544871","552692","548156","552061","549553","554407"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["bud","river","spring","water","rapid","branch","rush","rock","current","waterfall"]}
