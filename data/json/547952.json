{"path":"547952.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a serene river scene dominated by calm waters under a foggy or misty sky. On the right side of the image, there is a substantial concrete structure, looking like a wall or barrier, running parallel to the riverbank. This structure has multiple openings from which water is pouring out briskly into the river, creating small cascades and ripples on the surface.\n\nThe background includes a flat, gently blurred landscape that fades into the haze, providing a sense of tranquility and spaciousness. On the far left, indistinct features suggest distant riverbanks or low-lying hills, barely visible through the fog.\n\nAdding to the peaceful yet industrial feel of the scene, on the right edge, just behind the concrete barrier, there are signs of machinery or agricultural equipment, likely associated with the management of the water or nearby land.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the interplay between the man-made structure and the natural water body, emphasizing themes of water management or control in a natural setting. The mist lends an ethereal quality, while the foreground activities suggest human interaction with the environment.","title":"After a storm, raw sewage flows into Jamaica Bay from an outmoded treatment plant.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557239","547807","547526","551230","557745","549514","553354","551519","548870","555730","549486","553390","553349","557234","553393","553392"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["barrier","riverbank","management","spaciousness","cascade","water","fog","opening","river","control"]}
