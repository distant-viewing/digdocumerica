{"path":"548007.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a large hydroelectric dam and its surrounding environment. The dam spans across a broad river, forming a significant reservoir marked by deep blue waters. On the left side of the image, the dam structure is visible with multiple sections and gates, some of which are creating small water disturbances possibly due to release of water.\n\nA settlement can be seen near the river, upstream of the dam, consisting of clustered buildings that could be residential or associated with the dam's operations. The landscape surrounding the dam and the river is rugged and mostly barren, with sparse vegetation and rocky outcrops, suggesting an arid or semi-arid zone.\n\nThe roads around the dam are clearly visible, curving along the contours of the landscape and the riverbank. The sky above is vivid with scattered clouds, enhancing the dramatic and expansive outlook of this geographical setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph uses the line of the dam and river to guide the viewer's eye through the scene, from the structures and settlement on the left across to the open and less developed land on the right. The image captures a blend of human engineering and natural terrain under a dynamic sky.","title":"Chief Joseph Dam on the upper Columbia River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["548936","549004","548927","548013","548938","548024","548975","548920","548003","548947","548925","548940","548915","549497","544166","548012"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","settlement","river","reservoir","gate","outcrop","disturbance","engineering","contour","riverbank"]}
