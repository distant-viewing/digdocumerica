{"path":"549311.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of considerable debris and devastation, possibly following a natural disaster or an incident. The focus of the image is on a body of water littered with a range of objects, primarily consisting of fragmented wooden planks and beams. The wood pieces vary in size, condition, and color, suggesting they came from different sources or structures.\n\nIn the middle of the image, there is a prominent, partly submerged wooden object that resembles a crate or a small, rectangular wooden box. This object appears worn and weathered, and it provides a focal point amid the surrounding chaos. The waterâ€™s surface is scattered with smaller debris and particles, adding to the sense of destruction and disarray.\n\nThe photograph overall communicates a bleak, abandoned atmosphere, hinting at the aftermath of a significant disruptive event. The slight ripples in the water suggest a stillness to the scene, with no immediate action or movement present. The image captures the textures and patterns of the wreckage, focusing on the interplay of light and shadow amidst the floating debris.","title":"Debris floating on the Hudson River near the newly constructed World Trade Center","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552158","548688","547872","544462","547622","547527","552204","551602","547598","557993","542973","547541","555209","543165","548692","550201"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["object","debris","incident","wreckage","crate","disarray","devastation","particle","chaos","overall"]}
