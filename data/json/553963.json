{"path":"553963.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and bustling scene, likely at an outdoor tourist spot on a sunny day. In the foreground, three individuals are prominently featured:\n\n1. A middle-aged man, to the left, wearing a colorful patterned bucket hat and sunglasses, has his chest bare and is clad in a white shirt that is open and draped off his shoulders. His attire appears casual with shorts, and he is stepping over or ducking under a metal railing.\n\n2. Next to him, to the right, there is a young boy also going under the railing. He is wearing a striped tank top with vivid colors, which may be a sports jersey, and dark trousers.\n\n3. A woman to the far right appears elegant in a light-colored summer dress adorned with a floral pattern and a matching scarf wrapped around her head. She wears white-rimmed sunglasses and white shoes, indicating a coordinated and stylish outfit. She too is maneuvering past the railing.\n\nIn the scene's background, other people can be observed milling about and conversing, enhancing the sense of a crowded and lively place. The environment suggests a warm and arid location, reinforced by the brown, rocky hills in the far background, indicating the setting might be near a mountain or desert landscape. The railing serves as a partition guiding or controlling the movement of the crowd, suggesting the area might be a viewpoint or entrance to a significant attraction.","title":"Tourists climbing for view of waimea canyon","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["551648","553275","558295","553204","549314","553965","543235","551812","549329","557054","551808","558249","553755","558292","551811","544385"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["railing","partition","jersey","duck","bare","attraction","scarf","rim","shoulders","chest"]}
