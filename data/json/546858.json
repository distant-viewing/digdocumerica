{"path":"546858.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts two individuals on a small raft alongside a large ship, engaged in a maintenance activity. The ship, prominently featuring the name \"SILVA\" in black letters against its white hull, is the focal element of the image.\n\nThe raft, floating on water, is quite basic and appears to be made of metal. It is not much larger than the space required to support the two individuals and a few supplies, including a bucket and what appears to be a paint can. One person, wearing a striped sweater and blue jeans, is actively painting or cleaning the hull of the ship using a long pole with a roller or brush at the end. The other individual, in darker clothing, assists or observes the process.\n\nVisible on the ship's hull is a streak of rust or dirt running downwards, which contrasts sharply with the otherwise bright and clean appearance of the ship. This area seems to be the focus of the cleaning effort.\n\nThe background of the image is largely the water and the side of the ship, giving a sense of being in an industrial or maintenance setting at a dock or shipyard. The colors are vivid, with the rust's deep browns and reds standing out against the white and gray of the shipâ€™s hull. The overall composition captures a moment of routine maintenance work in maritime settings, emphasizing themes of upkeep and care in maritime industries.","title":"Trash left near the Baltimore harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546852","549590","549591","546040","546802","549618","546818","546012","548125","551046","549594","552149","549365","552148","549589","546758"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["ship","hull","raft","maintenance","rust","roller","shipyard","cleaning","upkeep","brush"]}
