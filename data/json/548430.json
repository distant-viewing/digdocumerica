{"path":"548430.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a busy airport. The airport is located near large bodies of water and coastal areas visible in the distance. There are multiple runways and taxiways filled with various parked aircraft, including large passenger airlines with noticeable jetways attached to them. Some of the visible airplanes resemble the designs typical of commercial airliners from around the mid-20th century.\n\nThe airport terminal buildings and several other structures are compact and spread around the airfield. A significant amount of construction activity is evident on the right side of the image, with cranes and partially constructed frames suggesting expansion or renovation work at the site. The environment surrounding the airport features flat terrain with minimal vegetation.\n\nThe image captures a clear day with good visibility, allowing distant geographical features and objects to be seen distinctly. The scene conveys a sense of busy, organised activity typical of a major airport.","title":"Logan airport--construction of new terminal on right Boston harbor in background","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548428","550104","556932","554092","548487","550554","548782","548433","553731","548778","550575","547237","548444","547824","556909","555759"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airport","runway","renovation","terminal","expansion","airplane","aircraft","amount","passenger","visibility"]}
