{"path":"546362.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures three men on a boat conducting water activities, possibly related to environmental work or wildlife study. The boat, labelled \"U.S. Government Clean Water EPA Region IV,\" suggests that these individuals are engaged in a government-operated project, likely pertaining to environmental research or monitoring in this particular region.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows tall grass or reeds, partially obscuring the view and adding a sense of depth. The focus is on the central activity where one man, wearing a white t-shirt, holds a large net or cage containing several turtles. Another man, also in a white shirt, assists him, handling the turtles. A third person, visible behind them, seems to be steering the boat or managing equipment. The setting appears to be a freshwater environment, perhaps a lake or a slow-moving river, under a partly cloudy sky which creates dynamic and natural lighting.\n\nThis scene suggests a moment of fieldwork, emphasizing conservation efforts or species monitoring, reflecting the broader objective of maintaining and understanding aquatic ecosystems.","title":"These aquatic biologists from the Southeast Water Laboratory in Athens, GA, have set up a Mobile lab near the EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory in order to study the continuous fishkill in Escambia Bay. Tissues of these fish will be sent to the Athens lab for analysis.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546357","546331","548882","546324","552861","546334","546339","549616","546053","546307","550962","544763","549622","546302","546758","546342"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["monitoring","boat","cage","fieldwork","government","reed","net","project","conservation","study"]}
