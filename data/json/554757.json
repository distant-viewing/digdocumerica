{"path":"554757.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque autumn landscape featuring a calm, reflective lake surrounded by densely wooded hills. The trees display a vibrant tapestry of fall colors, ranging from fiery reds, oranges, to golden yellows, implying it's likely mid to late autumn. There are no visible people or man-made structures, enhancing the natural and untouched feel of the scene.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy with large, soft white and gray clouds, which contrast with the bright colors of the forest and the darker surface of the lake. The clouds and blue sky are reflected in the still waters of the lake, adding a sense of depth and tranquility to the image.\n\nThe foreground shows the grassy edge of the lake, possibly a gentle slope leading down to the water, with some aquatic plants floating near the shore. The overall composition and the interplay of light and color create a peaceful, almost idyllic autumnal setting.","title":"Fall scene at Bald Mountain Pond on Route #28 in New York looking north, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554758","554649","554648","554750","554749","554751","554714","554761","554737","554635","554711","552599","554756","558093","554738","554719"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","autumn","tapestry","cloud","yellow","woode","orange","float","red","interplay"]}
