{"path":"552808.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a young man standing outdoors next to a car with its trunk open. He is dressed casually in a grey, short-sleeved button-up shirt with rolled-up sleeves, blue jeans, and a baseball cap. He has curly hair and is smiling at the camera, giving a cheerful expression.\n\nThe young man is holding a large, round, metal container filled with crab meat. He appears to be in the process of handling the seafood, possibly either preparing it for cooking or sorting it after a catch. His hands are both in the container as if he's either placing or arranging the crabs.\n\nIn the background, there is a white building and a yellow barrel, suggesting an industrial or a casual outdoor setting, perhaps near a dock or a place where fresh seafood is processed or sold. The environment feels sunny and busy, typical of a working area related to seafood procurement or preparation.","title":"In the spring of 1973, the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
