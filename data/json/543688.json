{"path":"543688.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a young child, outdoors on a sunny day. The child, who appears to be a young boy with pale blonde hair, is looking over his shoulder towards the camera, giving a slight and playful expression. He is standing barefoot and shirtless, which, combined with the lighting and the nature around, suggests a warm, summer day. The background is shaded with patches of sunlight filtering through the leaves of trees, creating dappled patterns on the sandy, leaf-strewn ground. The effect of the light and shadow emphasizes the carefree and idyllic atmosphere of the scene. The image is imbued with a sense of innocence and the simple joys of childhood, possibly in a backyard or a similarly familiar outdoor setting where a child might play and explore freely.","title":"Child on camping trip","placename":"Boulder (Colo.)","location":"Boulder, Colorado","nn1":["552035","543791","549642","545307","555915","556558","543870","544207","549254","547727","558183","552942","549105","543677","544380","548965"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","innocence","backyard","childhood","leaf","joy","shoulder","boy","summer","day"]}
