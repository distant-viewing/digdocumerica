{"path":"547200.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This is a photograph presenting an industrial scene at dusk. The photograph captures multiple structures typical of an industrial complex: various buildings with flat and sloped roofs, tall smokestacks, and a water tower. Plumes of smoke or steam are visible, emanating from at least one of the smokestacks, backlit by the sun setting behind the industrial complex. \n\nIn the foreground, a road or pathway is visible with signs of minor wear and some patchy grass alongside it. The sky, transitioning from the warm hues near the horizon to the darker shades of blue above, suggests the time is either dawn or dusk, enhancing the silhouette effect of the buildings.\n\nThe overall composition of the image emphasizes the industrial activity, with no evident signs of human presence or any moving objects, creating a static yet powerful image of industrial life. The backlighting from the sunset adds a dramatic flair to the scene, casting the buildings and smoke in dark shadow against the lighter sky.","title":"Steel mill smoke obscures early morning sun.
