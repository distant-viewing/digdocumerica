{"path":"544260.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene at a waterside location, possibly a river or lakefront. There are several key elements and activities visible:\n\n1. **People**: Two individuals are captured in the setting. Foremost, a person wearing a white hat and shirt is closely focused on some kind of task on a wooden dock or jetty. They are squatting and appear to be working with tools or handling fishing equipment. In the background, another individual is seen aboard a slender, red and white boat, seemingly preparing or adjusting something before or after navigating the water.\n\n2. **Boats**: The image features two boats. The foreground boat is equipped with a black motor labeled \"EVINRUDE 18\", indicating an 18 horsepower engine. This boat is moored to the dock where the first individual is working. The second boat, which carries the other person, is simpler in design, painted red and white, without any visible motor.\n\n3. **Dock/Jetty**: The wooden structure extends into the water, showing signs of wear and exposure to elements, possibly used for mooring boats or as a fishing platform. Thereâ€™s a variety of objects scattered across it, potentially fishing gear, tools, or personal items.\n\n4. **Background and Environment**: Lush green vegetation surrounds the water body, suggesting a secluded, natural setting. The background is dense with tall grass and shrubs, typical of a wetland or riverbank area.\n\n5. **Atmosphere and Lighting**: The photograph is taken during bright daylight, with vivid natural colors from the blue sky subtly blending into the greens and browns of the flora and the varied hues of the wooden structures and boats.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed is peaceful, focused on outdoor and possibly leisure activities like fishing or boating, set in a quiet, natural environment where water and greenery are predominant.","title":"Checking crab box","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["546976","544266","551350","544567","552317","545666","552283","552806","543579","550000","551313","544770","544126","554552","547549","544209"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","motor","fishing","tool","dock","fishe","mooring","waterside","squatt","moor"]}
