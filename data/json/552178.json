{"path":"552178.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a sprawling field of felled and aging tree logs floating in a water channel. The setting appears to be a logging area or a river designed for transporting logs, which is a common practice in the timber industry. The image shows the logs densely packed, with some submerged in water and others floating on the surface. The logs vary in size and length, with some exhibiting rough, broken ends, while others are more uniformly cut.\n\nThe backdrop of the scene features lush greenery; dense forest lines the horizon, contributing to a feeling of seclusion and natural beauty. The sky is mostly clear with a rich blue hue, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a sunny day. There is no visible human activity in the photograph, emphasizing the focus on the timbers and the industrial aspect of logging. The overall composition highlights an intersection of natural environments and human industrial practices.","title":"Logs stored on Chambers Creek.
