{"path":"543935.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a serene river scene involving boating activities. There are two boats at docking points along the river, both with people on them. The boat on the left, labeled \"Cajun Queen,\" features a small group of people—two men and a woman—sitting around a table, seemingly engaged in conversation. They appear relaxed, possibly enjoying a leisurely day on the water. The boat has a white structure with large windows and a pale yellow lower deck, giving it a classic, comfortable look.\n\nNext to the \"Cajun Queen,\" there's another, smaller boat docked. It has a white body with a deep blue trim along the edges, and it is equipped with an open sitting area at the front where a man is seated. He appears to be reading or looking down at something just out of view.\n\nThe background is lush with dense green trees, reflecting a tranquil, natural setting. Some of these trees lean over the bank into the river, enhancing the calm and secluded ambience of the location. The water is calm, with reflections of the boats and trees lightly dancing on the surface.\n\nOverall, the scene is composed in a way that emphasizes a peaceful outing on the water, surrounded by natural beauty, with individuals enjoying a slow-paced day of relaxation and conversation.","title":"The Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["550825","550769","551209","552316","551350","557972","546856","553411","551281","552982","549417","551680","550000","543943","551217","553403"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","river","conversation","enjoy","dance","docking","pace","ambience","relax","outing"]}
