{"path":"547627.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial maritime scene. It features a large ship, a cargo vessel named \"Louisiana Getty,\" docked at a port. The ship dominates the right side of the image with its massive dark hull, positioned close to the shore.\n\nAlong the left side and leading directly toward the ship are multiple long, parallel pipes, spanning the foreground to the middle ground of the image. These pipes are white and rest on supports that lift them above the ground. The perspective the photographer has chosen has these conduits converging towards the ship, creating a strong linear perspective.\n\nIn the background, beyond the ship and across the water, industrial structures are visible, including what appears to be cranes and other maritime or dockside machinery, indicating a bustling port area. The skyline suggests an urban setting on the far side of the water body, possibly indicating the near outskirts of a city.\n\nThe setting has an sparse, industrial feel with merely traces of vegetationâ€”a few grassy areas and sparse shrubbery beside the pipes. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of industry, focusing on transportation and possibly the energy sector, given the presence and prominence of the pipes in the composition.","title":"Getty tanker terminal on the Providence River","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["552244","550963","551577","547056","553739","545147","546919","546828","547474","551977","547667","550910","552008","551599","548127","551976"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","pipe","maritime","port","sector","conduit","photographer","prominence","trace","perspective"]}
