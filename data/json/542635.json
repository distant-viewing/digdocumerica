{"path":"542635.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image displays a vast parking lot filled with a large number of cars, predominantly station wagons, laid out in numerous orderly rows. The cars feature a variety of colors, including shades of red, blue, yellow, brown, and white, creating a colorful pattern against the gray asphalt of the lot.\n\nThe cars are closely packed and aligned in a diagonal fashion relative to the viewerâ€™s perspective, showcasing an organized and efficient use of the space. The sunlight casts shadows of the cars onto the ground, indicating either an early morning or late afternoon time frame.\n\nThe setting seems to be an industrial or commercial area, possibly associated with car manufacturing or dealership, given the uniformity and number of vehicles. The background is minimal, focusing entirely on the cars, with a glimpse of a tree line or distant buildings barely visible at the top edge of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of scale and organization, possibly highlighting aspects of automotive industry operations, transportation logistics, or a dealership ready for market.","title":"Datsuns on pier","placename":"Terminal Island (Calif.)","location":"Terminal Island, California","nn1":["546813","546900","547686","546879","553303","547742","549696","554349","547480","548432","547469","553896","556197","556721","549875","550100"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["dealership","car","lot","number","uniformity","logistic","organization","asphalt","wagon","market"]}
