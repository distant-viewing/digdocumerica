{"path":"549029.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene dominated by a broad, calm river curving through the landscape. On the left, two people on horseback are in the middle of fording the river, partially submerged and making their way across to the opposite bank. On the riverbank, another individual stands in the water fishing, seemingly casting a line or checking a net.\n\nThe area surrounding the river features sparse, low vegetation, including shrubs and small trees, which suggests a semi-arid environment. There are a few wooden and brick-built structures visible, appearing rudimentary and functional, typical of rural or less developed areas. Some structures have fences made of natural materials.\n\nIn the background, the landscape is more developed with several houses and other structures spread out, indicating a small community. These buildings are simple and seem to be interspersed with patches of cultivated fields or dry grasslands, enhancing the rural feel of the scene.\n\nThe overall scene is calm, with the people and animals blending into their natural surroundings, suggesting daily life in this area involves close interaction with the natural environment and possibly a reliance on the river for resources like water and food. This photograph captures both the beauty of a simple, peaceful riverside setting and the essence of rural life.","title":"The Colorado River near the Mexican border","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548839","549089","548868","555575","544607","549457","548096","551067","542555","542653","550989","542558","552108","549027","551282","550208"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","reliance","horseback","grassland","cultivate","net","riverside","check","resource","food"]}
