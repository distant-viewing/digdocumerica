{"path":"553951.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene possibly from the mid to late 20th century, given the style of clothing and film quality. The image depicts an exposed sandy beach in the foreground, leading into a calm tidal pool where a few people and a dog are wading. One individual near the center foreground, likely a woman based on the hairstyle and outfit, is walking towards the water away from the camera, dressed in a light-colored, possibly floral, knee-length dress.\n\nThe middle ground features a rock barrier that appears to be a natural or man-made jetty, populated with several people engaged in various activities. These individuals are standing, sitting, or moving around the rocks, dressed in casual beachwear such as shorts and T-shirts. Some are looking towards the ocean, suggesting they might be watching the waves or possibly other people outside the frame.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows the open sea, characterized by small whitecaps indicating moderate wind or waves, under a partly cloudy sky that casts natural light across the scene, coloring it in soft, muted tones typical of older color photographs. The overall composition imparts a casual, relaxed atmosphere typical of a beach setting where people gather to enjoy nature, companionship, and outdoor activities.","title":"Japanese tourists stand on rocks to watch the Hawaiian fishermen.","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["550930","543072","546794","555923","553952","547503","550936","547009","557507","550924","546982","555402","546768","543474","543395","546874"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","people","whitecap","wave","jetty","companionship","hairstyle","rock","knee","dog"]}
