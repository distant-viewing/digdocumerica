{"path":"548474.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban scene featuring a range of elements that form a bustling cityscape. In the foreground, there's an elevated train line with a train composed of several cars passing through. The train, with its classic design, is currently in motion, indicated by a slight blur and its position partially out of the frame. \n\nTo the left of the train, there's a multi-story residential building. It appears to be an older structure with gray siding and multiple balconies. Its architectural style includes features like bay windows and external fire escapes, typical of urban residential buildings from the mid-20th century.\n\nBeyond the train and adjacent to the building, there's a small parking lot filled with cars from various periods, suggesting an approximate era for the photograph, possibly the 1970s or 1980s. These vehicles vary in style and color and are distinctly from an earlier automotive era.\n\nThe middle and right parts of the image show a beautifully tree-lined street with a green, grassy median running down its center. The street is bordered by townhouses with similar architectural styles to the gray building, including protruding bay windows and upper-story balconies.\n\nIn the background, similar residential or possibly mixed-use buildings can be seen. The entire scene is surrounded by lush greenery, adding a touch of nature to the urban environment. The weather is clear and sunny, casting natural light that brightens the picture and creates a lively atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph captures a vibrant city life scene, juxtaposing moving transportation with static architectural elements and serene natural details.","title":"MBTA (Metropolitan Boston Transit Authority) tracks cut across Neptune Road.","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548479","555925","550022","550153","556076","550012","555890","550065","555927","556224","555988","551471","550157","556772","556127","556692"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["train","balcony","bay","median","style","townhouse","building","era","blur","street"]}
