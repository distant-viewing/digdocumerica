{"path":"553865.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid and unique aerial view of a waterfront cityscape. It prominently shows a river on the left side of the image with three floating structures, which appear to be barges densely packed with numerous cars. These barges are in the water parallel to the riverbank, creating a visually striking contrast between the blue water and the metallic hues of the vehicles.\n\nOn the right side of the image rises an urban skyline consisting of numerous buildings. The architecture varies, including high-rise apartment buildings, commercial structures, and possibly institutional facilities, arranged in close proximity to each other. The buildings display a range of colors and designs, suggesting a densely populated metropolitan area. Streets running alongside the riverbank seem busy, lined with cars suggesting peak traffic hours.\n\nThe photo is distinctly colored with shades of blues, browns, and greys, and is taken during daylight with clear skies. The light appears to be bright but not overly harsh, indicating either morning or late afternoon. The overall composition of the photograph masterfully juxtaposes the bustling urban life with the calm and steady flow of the river, accentuated by the intriguing inclusion of car-packed barges floating by.","title":"New york city garbage being towed to sea from the east river.
