{"path":"544768.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a diverse landscape, highlighting a mix of natural and cultivated areas. The image captures the essence of a sprawling terrain from a high vantage point, rendering it slightly blurry which may be due to the high altitude or motion.\n\nThe bottom of the image shows cultivated fields arranged in neat, rectangular plots. These plots are filled with crops that appear green, suggesting lush vegetation, typical of agricultural zones. To the right, these green plots are adjacent to large expanses of golden-yellow fields. These areas seem to be either harvested fields or perhaps fields of dry, wild vegetation, contrasting vividly with the green agricultural plots.\n\nCentral to the image, there is a significant presence of natural landscape features including meandering water bodies. These bodies of water, displaying a rich blue tone, snake through the terrain, splitting and diverging into smaller streams. Alongside the watery trails, patches of vibrant green wetland vegetation are visible, indicating moist, fertile soil conditions, possibly supporting diverse wetland flora and fauna.\n\nIn the upper portion of the photograph, the landscape merges into a vast plain leading up to a mountain range. The mountains, under a haze, create a muted blue-grey background that fades into the horizon under a pale blue sky. The transition from the densely packed field areas to the more open and natural wetland regions and then to the dry plains and mountains creates a tableau that is rich in texture and color contrasts.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is balanced yet dynamic, emphasizing the interaction between human agriculture and natural ecosystems. The image captures the essence of geographical and ecological diversity, providing a snapshot that highlights both the beauty and complexity of managing land resources.","title":"Utah--Great Salt Lake","placename":"Great Salt Lake (Utah)","location":"Great Salt Lake, Utah","nn1":["553668","549175","552858","553059","555684","552594","553817","547724","554027","553661","542730","555845","553973","555873","553972","553977"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["plot","wetland","field","cultivate","essence","mountain","fauna","diverge","plain","render"]}
