{"path":"550117.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a residential street scene featuring a row of traditional wooden houses with prominent front porches. The houses display a variety of architectural details like gingerbread trims and gabled roofs, showing signs of wear and age. The paint appears weathered and the woodwork a bit decayed, adding a rustic charm to the setting.\n\nIn the foreground, a white picket fence runs parallel to the sidewalk, leading the eye towards the houses. The fence is mostly intact but shows minor disrepair and peeling paint, suggesting a long-standing structure.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, a lone girl stands on a front porch. She is dressed in a patterned, possibly floral dress and is looking towards the ground, contributing a relaxed and somewhat introspective mood to the scene.\n\nThe sidewalks are made of concrete, and there is visible debris and neglected vegetation along the edges, indicating a lack of recent upkeep. Each houseâ€™s stairway that leads to the front porches is uniquely styled but shares a common functional and welcoming purpose.\n\nOverall, the scene is evocative of a quiet, somewhat neglected urban neighborhood that may have seen more lively days in the past. Its charm lies in the architectural character and the lived-in feel of the environment.","title":"Ohio city area homes, like these on jay street, are being Renovated as part of a privately financed renewal project","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550121","556950","550125","557641","545522","557638","548470","556448","556438","557646","550113","552742","557286","555905","556578","556436"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["porch","house","charm","sidewalk","fence","stairway","neglect","woodwork","picket","upkeep"]}
