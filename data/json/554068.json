{"path":"554068.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene featuring two black-necked stilts standing in water. The image is notable for the sharp reflections of the birds mirrored perfectly in the calm, blue water beneath them. The black-necked stilts have long, thin pink legs, distinct long, straight black bills, and crisp white and black plumage that contrasts beautifully with the subtle blue of the water. Their positioning is almost symmetrical, adding to the balanced aesthetic of the composition. The image appears to be taken during early morning or late evening, as suggested by the soft lighting conditions that enhance the tranquility of the scene. The background is minimalistic, primarily comprising the smooth, unmarked surface of the water, which extends to fill the entire frame, emphasizing the focus on the birds and their reflections.","title":"Stilt birds live protected in Kanahe Pond, in a conservation district surrounded by an urban area. The pond was made more than 200 years ago by King Kanehameha the Great as a royal fish pond. The stilt bird, sacred to the old Hawaiians, is now an endangered species.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["554067","547726","550388","543284","553777","548832","557495","554069","544539","557448","544838","547744","545967","543063","545991","544543"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["stilt","bird","reflection","plumage","positioning","water","leg","aesthetic","evening","tranquility"]}
