{"path":"550410.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image captures a breathtaking aerial view of a rugged, snow-covered landscape, likely a mountainous region. The foreground is dominated by an expansive, textured terrain where the snow and rock create intricate patterns, suggesting that the photograph was taken at a considerable height. Several dark lines, possibly paths or minor roads, can be seen winding through the snow, adding depth and contrast to the scene.\n\nThe middle of the photograph features a broad, curving river or stream, cutting through the landscape and accompanied by dark riverbanks, indicating erosion or possibly vegetation. The river flows from the upper left part of the image towards the center, where it meanders and splits into multiple smaller channels, creating a braided river pattern typically found in glacial regions.\n\nThe background consists of towering mountains with sharp peaks, partially enveloped in clouds, highlighting the remote and possibly harsh conditions of the area. The sunlight illuminating one side of the mountains creates a dramatic effect, emphasizing the rugged texture and vertical rise of the terrain.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its contrasting dark and light areas, textured landscapes, and the dynamic river flowing through, showcases the natural beauty and complexity of a high-altitude, possibly Arctic or subarctic environment.","title":"Atigun Gorge (not the same as the Atigun Valley) seen from a point above the pipeline crossing of the Atigun River on the east side of the Atigun Valley. The view looks southeast toward Peak 5308.
