{"path":"542792.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a picturesque natural scene, likely captured in a mountainous area such as Yosemite National Park. Prominent in the image is a distinct, smooth, granite dome, possibly a feature like Liberty Cap or Half Dome, which rises majestically in the background, partially framed by lush pine trees.\n\nThe foreground is rugged and rocky, composed of large granite boulders and scattered patches of dry grass, typical of high-altitude terrains. These elements strongly suggest that the vantage point is from an elevated position on a slope or another part of the rock formations. The pine trees, common in subalpine zones, add a verdant touch to the otherwise stark rocky landscape.\n\nVisible through the trees in the further distance is a haze, which could be either due to atmospheric conditions like fog or smoke, or a natural mist common in valley areas during certain times of the day or year. This mist adds a sense of depth and mystery to the scene, enhancing the ethereal quality of the wilderness.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its significant natural elements and the framing of the iconic dome through the trees, captures the essence of wilderness exploration and the grandeur of mountain landscapes.","title":"Area of slash (logging debris) ready to pile and burn","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["543450","544392","550604","543376","550629","544341","543569","554398","543582","550585","549151","545601","545775","550441","555657","548025"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["dome","mist","wilderness","mystery","boulder","tree","year","fog","framing","altitude"]}
