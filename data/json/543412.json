{"path":"543412.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph displays a large, stationary wooden boat supported on stands on land, possibly in a dockyard or display setting. Most notable is the figurehead on the boat's prow, sculpted in the form of a mermaid with detailed facial features, flowing hair, and a traditional mermaid tail, painted in white and holding a position that appears dynamic and forward-moving.\n\nThe boat itself has a richly detailed body with a white and orange color scheme. Its name, visible on the hull, is \"Storm\" and it bears the registration number \"CF 0007 BM\". The construction features include wooden planking and a sturdy bow. A prominent feature on the deck includes a large crane or mast.\n\nThe boat rests on greenish plants that look like they could be succulents, possibly indicating a coastal or arid environment. Behind the boat, an overcast sky suggests a dull or cloudy day, and a faint, blurred background suggests a setting that lacks significant structures or other boats, focusing the viewer's attention primarily on the detailed features of the boat and its figurehead.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["549395","551581","546807","548124","542873","544181","549431","544234","549396","549383","548535","548122","544672","543247","545270","547156"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["boat","feature","registration","tail","mast","bow","storm","stand","scheme","hull"]}
