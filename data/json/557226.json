{"path":"557226.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene characterized by heavy pollution. There are multiple layers of infrastructure visible: in the foreground, there's lush greenery; midground features several levels of rail lines, with the lower one occupied by a train emitting white vapor or smoke. Overhead, there are additional framework structures possibly for conveyance of materials or support.\n\nThe background shows a residential area with several houses perched on a hillside, enveloped in a haze, likely from the air pollution emanating from the industrial operations below. The atmosphere is thick with gray and bluish smoke that dramatically obscures parts of the houses and surrounding vegetation.\n\nThe color palette is primarily muted with shades of blue and gray dominating, punctuated by the rusted red of the metal structures and the green of the trees. The scene captures a juxtaposition between heavy industrial activity and residential life, underscored by environmental impact.","title":"Pollutants coming from coke plant owned by the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation obscure nearby homes on a hillside at Hazelwood, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh.
