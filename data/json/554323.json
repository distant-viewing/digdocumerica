{"path":"554323.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph provides a compelling glimpse into public transportation scenes through multiple windows of, presumably, a bus or train during nighttime. The image captures four distinct window frames, each disclosing different interactions and expressions of the passengers within.\n\nIn the upper left window, we see two women engaged in a cheerful conversation. Their joyful expressions, along with the warm ambient light, highlight their interaction. Another person is visible between them, facing away from the camera.\n\nThe upper right window frames a more crowded situation. Several individuals appear to be reading; one is noticeable by the light reflecting off a newspaper onto his face. There seems to be a mix of standing and seated passengers, all absorbed in their activities, which suggests a typical busy transit scene.\n\nIn the lower left part, a woman is seen in close-up, engaged intensely in thought or perhaps lost in a daydream. She is holding something close to her face, possibly a handkerchief.\n\nFinally, the lower right window shows a man, seemingly in a reflective mood, with his hand close to his chin, suggesting contemplation or restlessness. He is dressed casually and appears separate from the surrounding hustle and bustle of the other framed scenes.\n\nThe photographâ€™s mood is a mix of intimacy, solitary reflection, casual engagement, and everyday travel routine. The dim lighting, combined with glares and reflections on the windows, enhances the nighttime transit experience, conveying both the private moments and public nature of commuting. The overall composition of the image, with its partitioned views into different lives, tells a multifaceted story of urban transportation and its passengers.","title":"Subway car, older and dirtier than some","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548256","554326","554327","549897","554370","556795","549893","556656","556745","556669","556797","556079","546244","555998","556817","554241"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["window","nighttime","transit","passenger","face","partition","transportation","commuting","glare","ambient"]}
