{"path":"550233.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, atmospheric scene at the beach during what appears to be the early evening or sunset. The focus is on a young child who is kneeling in shallow water near the shore. The child is silhouetted, which obscures detailed features but highlights the outline of curly hair and a reflective moment of play or exploration in the water.\n\nThe lighting is dim and moody, predominantly in shades of dark blue and black, emphasizing the last light of day reflecting off the gentle movements of the water's surface. The waves are small and lapping softly around the child, suggesting a peaceful, tranquil environment.\n\nThe background is minimally detailed, mostly dark, with a slightly lighter horizon line suggesting the vastness of the ocean and the closing of the day. The overall composition of the image, with its focus on the solitary figure amidst the vastness of nature, evokes a sense of quiet contemplation and connection with the natural world.","title":"Huntington beach on lake erie.
