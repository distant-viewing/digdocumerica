{"path":"557920.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph captures a daily life scene at a place of business. In the foreground, a mother, wearing sunglasses, a yellow shirt with a dark blazer, and jeans, is holding a sleeping baby in one arm while interacting with a cashier through a window. The word \"CASHIER\" is prominently displayed on a sign above the window. The mother is holding some papers or possibly money, which she seems to be handing to or receiving from the cashier. A small child, possibly a toddler, stands next to her, facing towards the cashier's window, dressed in a white shirt with black accents and black pants. The background shows a covered outdoor area of a business with a glimpse of a sunlit street or outdoor area beyond. The overall mood is casual and depicts a moment of everyday transaction and interaction.","title":"Mother with her children at the cashier's window paying for her annual sticker after her car had successfully passed testing at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio all light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles must be tested annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions and be given a safety check.
