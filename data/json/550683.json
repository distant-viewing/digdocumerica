{"path":"550683.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an old, vintage car parked on grass near some trees. The car has a sturdy, utilitarian design indicative of early automotive engineering, possibly from the early to mid-20th century. It features a prominent front grille with a noticeable radiator cap and two classic, rounded headlamps. The car is equipped with a solid, metal snow plow attached to its front, indicative of its use for practical, perhaps rural purposes.\n\nOn the front of the car, there is a license plate that reads \"New Hampshire 662\" with a validation sticker showing the last registered year as 1976. The body of the car is in relatively good shape but shows signs of wear, aging, and possibly some rusting, especially on the plow blade.\n\nIn the background, there is a chain-link fence partially obscured by trees, beyond which a street with parked cars and residential houses can be seen. The houses have a typical American architectural style for rural or suburban areas, featuring clapboard siding.\n\nThe environment appears slightly overcast, suggesting either an early morning or late afternoon setting with soft, natural lighting, enhancing the historical and somewhat nostalgic feel of the scene.","title":"Owner of this old model-t is attending a summer auction in milan","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["551021","546230","554920","546177","553008","557692","545540","544641","553002","552995","555483","554933","550796","555922","542862","542920"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","plow","headlamp","sticker","grille","blade","license","house","front","aging"]}
