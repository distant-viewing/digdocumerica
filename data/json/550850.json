{"path":"550850.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively fishing scene taking place along a concrete canal or riverbank. Several individuals, a mix of men and women, can be seen engaging in fishing activities. They are using fishing rods, and some appear to be adjusting their equipment or chatting with one another, adding a casual and communal feel to the setting. \n\nIn the center, three men are sitting right on the edge of the canal, focusing on their lines in the water. Behind them, to the right, a group of people stands by a wooden building, appearing to be either preparing for fishing or taking a break. A sign on the building reads \"PARK FOOT FROM WALL,\" likely indicating some direction about where to stand or park belongings.\n\nThe attire of the people varies from casual t-shirts and caps to more formal attire which includes a sweater and collared shirt. This diversity in dress suggests a relaxed and informal event where participants have come as they are.\n\nAdditionally, the background includes lush greenery and plant life, contrasting with the urban elements of the concrete and the structure. The overall atmosphere is one of leisure and recreation, typical of community fishing spots frequented by locals for relaxation and social gathering.","title":"Fishing from lock on the fox river near montello.
