{"path":"554607.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a natural outdoor scene dominated by a woodland and a body of water, potentially a pond or marsh. The foreground prominently displays a large pile of twigs and branches, possibly a beaver dam, located at the edge of the water. Surrounding this focal point are various types of trees, mostly conifers, which are fairly tall and densely populate the background. The sky, which is visible through gaps in the treetops, appears to be partly cloudy.\n\nThe ground around the water is covered in what looks like marshy vegetation, possibly grasses or small bushes, which are scattered loosely around the area, adding to the wild and natural feel of the scene. There is no visible human activity or presence in this serene and somewhat secluded environment, emphasizing the tranquility of the wooded landscape. The lighting suggests it might be either late afternoon or a slightly overcast day, creating a soft and natural ambiance.","title":"Beaver lodge in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554529","550345","558088","550351","554776","554605","554606","543611","553465","554525","546205","554603","555217","555216","544765","547011"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["treetop","marsh","gap","twig","conifer","dam","woodland","pond","populate","bush"]}
