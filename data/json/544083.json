{"path":"544083.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene from a waste management or construction setup, showcasing heavy machinery and equipment in action. The image is focused on a large blue-green metallic bucket, which is hanging from a mechanical arm, possibly a crane or an excavator. This bucket, labeled \"94 L,\" seems to be tipping over to deposit its contents – what appears to be a pile of waste or debris – into a white dump truck labeled \"MYERS.\"\n\nThe truck, which is mostly white, features elements such as a side mirror reflecting the blue sky, a clear view into the cabin, and a headlamp towards the right of the frame. The rear part of the truck also shows protective metal bars or framing around the vehicle’s body and tail lights. Just beyond the machinery, the sky is clear and bright blue, indicating a sunny day without much cloud cover. The environment appears to be an outdoor industrial or construction site, given the visible elements and the context of the operation observed.","title":"Trash Barrels are emptied mechanically into truck bin; part of a new trash collection method sponsored by EPA.","placename":"Tolleson (Ariz.)","location":"Tolleson, Arizona","nn1":["549940","549792","555636","550270","547922","549795","549749","546257","549791","549949","545653","547208","547975","549945","543896","548348"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["truck","bucket","waste","label","headlamp","machinery","excavator","construction","tail","deposit"]}
