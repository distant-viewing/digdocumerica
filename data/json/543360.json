{"path":"543360.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint and colorful street scene, likely taken during the day given the bright conditions and shadows on the ground. The setting is an urban alley or narrow street, flanked by weathered, historic-looking buildings.\n\nThe buildings appear aged, with exposed brickwork, chipped paint, and functional yet rustic details. The architecture suggests a mix of residential and possibly commercial usage. There are wooden doors, some with clear signs of wear, and windows with security bars. High up on the walls of the buildings, various types of pipes, vents, and utility lines are visible, contributing to the overall industrial feel of the scene.\n\nOn the right side of the street, there are storefronts visible, with doors open to the public. One of the doors is framed by large posters or artworks. In front of these commercial spaces, the sidewalk is adorned with numerous plants and flowers set in low pots, adding a touch of nature and vibrancy to the urban environment.\n\nOn the left side, near a building with a red entryway, potted plants are also placed outside, further enhancing the charming atmosphere of the street.\n\nAt the middle part of the street, two people are captured in this moment, lending a sense of scale and life to the image. One individual is walking toward the camera while the other appears to be walking away. Near them, a bicycle is parked on the sidewalk against a building, suggesting a relaxed, pedestrian-friendly area.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a feeling of a lived-in, dynamic neighborhood with a blend of historical charm and everyday urban life.\n","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["545356","551722","550145","550115","556167","551864","551778","550107","557656","549280","555902","557287","551685","550110","551786","550108"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","door","sidewalk","public","entryway","building","security","brickwork","alley","artwork"]}
