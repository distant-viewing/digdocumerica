{"path":"547134.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a diver emerging from dark blue water near a rocky shore. The diver, dressed in professional diving gear, is wearing a black wetsuit, red life vest, and a dive mask pushed up on top of their head. In one hand, they hold a yellow diving fin and are grabbing a rope with the other, suggesting they are either steadying themselves or preparing to exit the water. The water appears slightly choppy, reflecting a cloudy sky.\n\nThe background reveals a type of rustic, low stone wall along the water's edge, contributing to the rugged, natural environment of the scene. The angle of the shot is from above the diver, looking down, emphasizing the diver's interaction with the water and the immediate surroundings. The image conveys an adventurous or explorative mood, possibly after a dive session, capturing a moment of transition between the underwater exploration and returning to the shore.","title":"Police scuba diver emerging from pere marquette river estuary.
