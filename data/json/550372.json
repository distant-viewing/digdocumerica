{"path":"550372.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph features an abstract and dynamic view of what appears to be a dark liquid surface interspersed with swirling patterns of a lighter, almost silvery substance. The composition is visually akin to a satellite view of a turbulent, oil-slicked ocean, though it could also be interpreted as an artistic close-up of some fluid medium.\n\nThe image is vertically oriented and displays a series of intricate, curvilinear forms that weave and intersect with each other against a mostly dark background. These forms have varied textures and brightness, ranging from bright whites and grays to deep blacks, creating a striking contrast. The patterns are reminiscent of marbled textures seen in various types of art or natural phenomena.\n\nThe overall appearance is organic and fluid, with swirls that suggest movement and a certain ephemeral qualityâ€”as if capturing a moment where two fluids of different densities and colors mix but are not yet fully blended. There are occasional spots of bright white, which could be reflections or points where the lighter substance is more concentrated.\n\nThe aesthetic is both chaotic and harmonious, conveying a sense of natural movement and transformation. This photograph could be appreciated for its abstract beauty and the way it provokes the imagination to interpret its origin and the nature of the materials involved.","title":"Foam, a sign of pollution, floats on the St. Croix River at Calais, a few miles below the Georgia Pacific paper mill.","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["552239","550373","550374","550375","544716","555226","557626","545850","555804","555155","555177","555714","550849","543194","547617","553180"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["fluid","interpret","substance","swirl","phenomena","slick","medium","origin","provoke","transformation"]}
