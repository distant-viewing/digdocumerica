{"path":"547233.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The image depicts an aerial view of a bustling urban waterfront area featuring a variety of elements. In the forefront, there is a river crowded with numerous boats, both small and large; these vessels are docked at a busy pier that appears crowded and functional, utilized possibly for transport or commercial purposes. The water is a murky brown, suggesting it might be a busy, frequently used waterway.\n\nAdjacent to this waterfront space is a large parking area filled with numerous vehicles, surrounded by several low-rise buildings that seem to serve as warehouses or offices for maritime or industrial businesses. Above this level, the landscape shifts to include elevated highways and overpasses that curve gracefully around large, modernist buildings. These large buildings include both a horizontally striped facade structure and a beige-colored high-rise building, portraying a typical mid-to-late 20th-century architectural style, likely used for offices or government facilities.\n\nThe scene is framed by these roadways and infrastructure, with cars visible on the roads, which suggests typical urban activity and traffic. Green spaces can be seen along these roads, providing a visual break from the dense urban environment. The overall composition highlights a juxtaposition of industrial maritime activity and urban transportation structures, all situated within a modern cityscape.","title":"Marina on the potomac in southwest Washington","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546578","551992","548023","549503","556947","549505","551980","549483","552215","548320","547214","552020","547996","555768","551609","553865"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["office","waterfront","government","overpass","beige","rise","building","shift","utilize","space"]}
