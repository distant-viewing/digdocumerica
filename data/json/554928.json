{"path":"554928.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a rustic rural scene featuring a flock of sheep. The sheep are depicted traversing a dirt path that cuts through a grassy field. The terrain is uneven and marked with the shadows and grooves formed by regular use. The animals, mottled with shades of grey and white, are adorned with thick, shaggy wool, suggesting a cooler climate or season.\n\nThe background is softly lit by what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon sunlight, given the long shadows cast behind the sheep and the warm but subdued tones of the light. A row of leafy, deciduous trees lines one side of the dirt path, reinforcing the rural, pastoral setting. The trees stand leafless, which along with the sheep's thick coats, implies the season might be either late fall or early winter.\n\nA fence, visibly constructed from wire and wooden posts, runs parallel to the tree line, indicating that this is a managed agricultural or livestock field. The overall setting is tranquil and natural, devoid of any visible modern elements like buildings or vehicles, lending a timeless quality to the image. The composition of the photograph, with the flock centered and moving towards the foreground, draws the viewer into the peaceful, pastoral life it depicts.","title":"Angora goats graze on a farm near Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554779","555820","554887","544933","544384","557747","552556","544391","554932","543269","552555","554935","550450","554890","550452","554883"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["sheep","flock","season","wool","groove","path","dirt","livestock","field","fall"]}
