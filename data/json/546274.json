{"path":"546274.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up view of a person examining a petri dish through a magnifying glass. The petri dish contains numerous pale yellow colonies of bacteria, and it is patterned with grid lines that divide the space into squares, likely for the purpose of quantification or organized observation. The dish is mostly transparent with markings that are delineated in white, enhancing visibility and measurement.\n\nIn the foreground, a hand holding a black magnifying glass focuses on a specific area of the petri dish. This magnification tool makes the bacterial colonies appear larger and clearer, suggesting a detailed analysis is being conducted, perhaps as a part of a scientific experiment or a quality control process in a laboratory. The background is dark, focusing all attention on the scientific activity being performed.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: The micro-biology lab.
