{"path":"557845.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts an interior view of a bus or truck maintenance garage. The image shows a large, spacious hall with high ceilings, designed specifically for accommodating large vehicles. On the left side of the photo, there are several maintenance bays, each outlined with painted lines on the floor and equipped with various machinery and tools. The machinery includes large red fuel dispensers and other service equipment.\n\nOverhead, bright fluorescent lights illuminate the space uniformly, hanging from a long metal fixture that runs parallel to the bays. The garage has a somewhat industrial aesthetic with a practical setup for vehicle maintenance.\n\nThe floor is marked with yellow and black stripes directing movement paths within the garage, and there appears to be some oil or fluid stains, suggesting regular use of the facility. \n\nIn the far end, there is an open garage door through which natural light is entering and the entrance of a vehicle is slightly visible. Toward the middle and right side of the hall, benches and additional equipment are present, possibly for workersâ€™ use during breaks or for additional storage.\n\nA figure is visible in the upper middle section of the photograph, standing and facing towards the open garage door, which may indicate they are supervising or awaiting something from outside.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is quiet and somewhat subdued, capturing a typical workday scene within a mechanical or vehicle maintenance environment.","title":"View of the safety lane in the auto emission inspection station at Norwood, Ohio.  Each evening it is swept and dusted, and the yellow markings are washed.  All light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles in the city are tested annually by an exhaust analyzer for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions if a vehicle fails, its owner has 30 days to make repairs and have it retested.  Officials hope to have 74 percent of the vehicles tested in Norwood and Cincinnati by the end of the year","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["557852","557886","557905","557884","542763","557858","557848","557885","557902","544818","549770","553490","557851","549723","557875","557850"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["garage","maintenance","hall","bay","vehicle","dispenser","floor","await","door","workday"]}
