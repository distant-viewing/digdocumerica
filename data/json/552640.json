The setting is expansive and surrounded by lush, dense greenery, indicating a rural or semi-rural location.\n\nIn the foreground, a rustic split-rail fence borders the scene, contributing to the rural ambiance. The middle ground is dominated by a group of people gathered around an open grave, where a funeral service appears to be taking place. Several attendees are visible, clad in formal attire, which is typical for such an occasion.\n\nThere are several vehicles parked near the gathering, including a hearse and other cars, which suggest the presence of family and friends who have come to pay their respects.\n\nBeyond the immediate scene of the funeral, the cemetery is dotted with various tombstones, and mature trees provide shade and add a tranquil feel to the environment. The background shows a further expanse of vibrant greenery, while in the far distance, a clearer, open landscape under a calm sky can be seen, giving the whole image a layered and peaceful depth.","title":"Funeral at Rifle","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552639","557184","554790","550364","550731","552641","552451","557185","554824","557089","558289","552017","557942","554792","546147","555566"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cemetery","tombstone","respect","pay","grave","occasion","split","attendee","friend","greenery"]}
