{"path":"558209.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Haque, Abul","caption":"This photograph depicts a young boy, likely a student, immersed in studying or reading at a desk. He is wearing a red sweater and black-rimmed glasses, with his dark hair slightly tousled. The boy is holding a paper with his left hand while his right hand is resting against his forehead, suggesting a moment of concentration or perhaps slight frustration. There are several books and notebooks stacked in front of him on the pale surface of the desk, indicating an academic setting.\n\nThe setting appears to be a classroom, suggested by the plain light blue background which gives off an institutional feel typical of many school environments. The lighting in the image is soft and diffuse, casting gentle shadows but clearly illuminating the boy and the objects on the desk. The overall ambiance of the photograph portrays a common scene of a student engaged in study, reflecting themes of education, learning, and possibly the pressures that come with it.","title":"Students studying at Cathedral Senior High School in New Ulm, Minnesota. The town is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe. Several manufacturing firms have arrived since 1950 and have helped the town to grow. The business district was revitalized in the 1960's with community effort.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["546561","551294","546565","544326","546556","546552","542690","552592","556250","554838","558220","558225","546560","553088","543744","551897"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["desk","student","boy","forehead","notebook","education","classroom","pressure","learning","school"]}
