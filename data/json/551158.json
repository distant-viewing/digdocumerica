{"path":"551158.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene of agricultural activity, likely taken on a sunny day given the bright lighting and clear skies. In the foreground, a rusty red tractor is connected to a flatbed trailer loaded with neatly stacked hay bales. The trailer is partially filled, indicating ongoing work in hay collection.\n\nAboard the trailer, three individuals are engaged in the process. Two of them stand atop the accumulated hay, one evidently in the act of positioning or organizing the bales, while another person stands at the edge of the trailer, possibly ready to load more bales or interacting with the tractor driver. All three individuals appear to be wearing practical work attire—light-colored long-sleeve shirts and wide-brimmed hats, likely for sun protection.\n\nThe background features a lush, dense treeline bordering the field, suggesting that this might be a rural or semi-rural area. The trees are full and green, characteristic of a summertime setting. The field itself is vast and open, with freshly mown patches and scattered hay, suggesting recent or ongoing mowing and baling operations.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—with its focus on the agricultural machinery, the activity centered around hay collection, and the expansive natural landscape—evokes a sense of rural life and farming practices.","title":"Men work with a hay baler on a farm near Pt.
