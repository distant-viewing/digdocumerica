{"path":"553745.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a detailed urban landscape that appears to be taken from a high vantage point, looking down towards a large, prominently featured building and its surrounding area. The main building at the center of the image has a unique, square shape with a distinctly large central courtyard that is square and likely open-air, surrounded by layered tiers that give the building a stepped, pyramid-like appearance.\n\nSurrounding this central structure are various other buildings of different sizes and designs, compactly arranged and interspersed with patches of greenery. Roads and streets weave through the scene, filled with the small, indistinct shapes of vehicles, suggesting a bustling urban environment.\n\nIn the backdrop, the coastline is visible, marking a transition from the dense urban landscape to the vastness of a calm sea. The horizon is faintly visible, blending the sea into a cloudy sky. There are a few ships or boats on the water, appearing as tiny specs against the blue.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph presents a contrast between the geometric regularity and human-constructed order of the urban environment and the natural, undulating line of the coast and expansive sea. The lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, considering the softness and angle of the shadows cast by the buildings.","title":"Hawaii--Hawaiian state capitol, Honolulu (Oahu I)","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553679","553790","551505","555756","553672","549477","553677","556180","553945","553678","546624","552233","547445","551506","553680","551510"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["sea","pyramid","courtyard","building","tier","softness","order","consider","shape","coast"]}
