{"path":"556213.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a young child engaged in the simple pleasure of eating a snow cone. The child is holding a white paper cone, filled with finely shaved ice, up to their mouth. The child is wearing a plaid shirt with intricate lace detailing along the collar and front panel, possibly indicating a special occasion or Sunday dress.\n\nThe young child has dark skin and their hair is styled in small, neat braids that frame their face. The child's eyes are slightly downcast, focused on the snow cone, revealing long eyelashes.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred, indicating a shallow depth of field, which emphasizes the child and their immediate action. In the distant background, urban elements like brick buildings, possibly apartment complexes, and a street with parked cars are visible, suggesting the setting is in a city environment. The presence of these elements in soft focus allows viewers to understand the context without detracting from the focal point, which is the child enjoying a simple, joyous moment.","title":"Black ghetto child savors a snow cone just received from a sidewalk vendor on Chicago's west side.  This portion of the city was hard hit by riots and fires in the mid and late 1960's and was slow to recover.  Help came when black businessmen, with federal help reached an agreement with several national franchises which resulted in $20 million worth of jobs to residents by 1974","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["558183","558190","555390","554495","553161","556140","551639","556138","553150","551845","547887","548540","547813","556454","556144","553212"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["child","cone","braid","snow","eyes","lace","pleasure","eat","occasion","intricate"]}
