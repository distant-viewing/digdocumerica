{"path":"555913.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a young person standing outdoors during twilight. Predominantly visible in the foreground is the individual with a slight smile, facing slightly left of the cameraâ€™s direct view. The person has a prominent afro hairstyle and is wearing a t-shirt with light and dark horizontal stripes.\n\nThe lighting in the image gives it a very muted and dark tone, making it somewhat challenging to discern finer details. In the background, you can notice a softly glowing, circular moon low in the sky, centered in the upper middle part of the frame. The rest of the background shows silhouetted trees and what appears to be a tranquil park-like setting. The overall mood conveyed by this image is serene and intimate, captured during a quiet evening moment.","title":"Latin youth in Hiland Park of Brooklyn, New York City. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers, and tract homes. It is populated by Blacks, Latins, and the White poor. Most of all, the inner city environment is human beings, as beautiful and threatened as the 19th century buildings they live in.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553223","544870","556143","545859","549642","553494","552035","556142","556140","543870","545373","547705","545347","557112","543747","550048"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["moon","notice","hairstyle","discern","person","t","challenge","twilight","stripe","smile"]}
