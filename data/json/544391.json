{"path":"544391.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a rural, pastoral scene, likely on a farm or similar setting. In the foreground, a group of sheep are gathered inside an enclosure made of rugged, thick wooden logs and branches that form a semi-open pen. The texture of the wood is prominent, showing a silvery-gray weathered appearance that suggests they have been exposed to the elements for a long time.\n\nTo the right side of the image, an older man with white hair, wearing a blue shirt and hat, is seated on the ground in a position that suggests he is engaged in an activity with one of the sheep, possibly inspecting, treating, or shearing it. The man appears focused on his task, indicating a sense of routine or expertise in handling the animals.\n\nThe ground is mostly bare soil, compacted and appearing slightly muddy, indicating frequent use and perhaps recent rain. In the background, the pen continues with a similar rugged construction, and sparse vegetation can be sighted beyond the confines of the enclosure. The sky is overcast, lending a soft, diffuse light to the scene which highlights the textures and the tranquility of the rural setting.","title":"Shearing by hand is an after-hours chore for this Navajo hard-hat.
