{"path":"548664.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a charming two-story house, possibly Victorian in style, partially obscured by shadows due to the angle of the sunlight. The house features a prominent architectural design with a wrap-around porch on both the first and second floors. The second floor also features a central gabled roof extending over a bay window, enhancing the house's traditional appeal.\n\nOn the left, a portion of lush green foliage, likely from nearby trees, frames the image, adding a touch of nature and depth to the scene. The interaction of sunlight and shadows creates a dramatic effect, highlighting parts of the porch and casting other sections into deep shade, contributing to the photo's moody atmosphere.\n\nThe sky visible in the photograph is mostly clear with a few scattered clouds, suggesting a bright sunny day, though the exact time of day isn't discernible due to the high contrast lighting. No people are visible in the scene, giving the image a serene and somewhat mysterious aura.\n\nOverall, the composition successfully conveys a quaint and peaceful residential setting, rich in detail and character, evoking a sense of quiet and solitude.","title":"One of the historic wooden houses of Key West.
