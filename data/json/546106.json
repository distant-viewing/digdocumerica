{"path":"546106.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an ornate, old cemetery scene featuring individual fenced graves in a field of brown grass. The predominant element in the image is an aged, wrought iron fence, intricately designed with pointed finials and decorative elements including a heart shape on the entrancing gate. At the center of this fenced enclosure is a weathered tombstone, barely readable, slightly tilted, and surrounded by sparse, dried grass indicating a lack of recent care. In the background, there are similar graves, each enclosed by similar metal fences, suggesting a pattern across the burial ground. The setting appears quiet and desolate, under an overcast sky, which contributes to the somber and historical ambiance of the scene.","title":"Graves of some of the first Leakey settlers.","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["557942","545322","546147","554824","557184","552683","549041","550731","547420","547417","544267","552451","546098","550364","554792","554790"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["grave","tombstone","fence","cemetery","heart","enclosure","gate","iron","care","grass"]}
