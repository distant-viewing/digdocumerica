{"path":"556228.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up silhouette of a person working with focus and care. This individual, who is in profile, appears to be painting or repairing a window. The shot is artistically composed, focusing specifically on the contrast between the dark silhouette of the person and the bright, textured surface of the window.\n\nThe person is shown holding a brush or some sort of tool, which is being applied to the window's surface. The details of their facial features are not visible due to the silhouette effect, but we can see that they are wearing glasses and their outline suggests a focused, meticulous working posture.\n\nThe window itself is a prominent part of the image, covered in streaks and spots that could be paint or some residue, catching light in a way that adds texture and depth to the composition. The natural light source behind the window highlights these details and the overall mood is one of concentration and attention to detail. The background is subdued, allowing the viewer to focus primarily on the interaction of light, shadow, and texture between the person and the window.","title":"Artist Ron Blackburn painting an outdoor wall mural at the corner of 33rd and Giles Streets in Chicago. He is one of many Black artists painting such art. They feel it is a means of sharing art with the people of the ghetto who don't go to the city's museums.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["548072","557846","543028","544437","553592","556154","548232","547713","554796","556185","552745","553554","546486","542802","555303","547723"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["window","person","silhouette","detail","residue","brush","streak","sort","profile","source"]}
