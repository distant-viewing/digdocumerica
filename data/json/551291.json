{"path":"551291.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a group of eleven people posing outside a store named \"Way Out Shop.\" The group consists mainly of young men, with a wide age range apparent from teens to potentially early 30s. They exhibit a variety of expressions and are dressed in casual attire typical of the 1970s or early 80s. Some individuals are wearing jeans or casual trousers and t-shirts, with one visible logo reading \"Conanicut Football\" suggesting a sporting connection, possibly a team or local club reference.\n\nThe storefront behind them displays signs reading \"Way Out Shop\" and \"Do your thing CUSTOM PRINTED SHIRTS,\" implying the shop specializes in custom-printed shirts. The lighting in the image, slightly overexposed in areas such as the sign and part of the street, suggests an evening or night setting given the illuminated store signs and strings of lights above.\n\nThe background features additional signage for other shops, including one that is partially visible and reads \"Cottages,\" and another sign that might be indicating directions or additional store information. The mise-en-sc√®ne, with its casual urban setup, accentuates a relaxed, communal atmosphere typical of a small town or local business area frequented by the community.","title":"Photograph of graduating Gibault High School students from Waterloo, Illinois visiting the Bagnell Dam Strip in Lake Ozark, Missouri","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["554852","551124","556214","556221","553155","552411","552753","554872","545440","545231","551835","558251","549855","557803","555906","548452"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["store","shop","read","sign","30","80","specialize","club","teen","sporting"]}
