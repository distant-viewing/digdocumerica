{"path":"554839.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a single thistle flower with a butterfly perched on its bloom. The thistle flower stands straight and features a round, spiky bloom that displays vibrant pink-purple hues. Its telescoping stalk rises from a bulbous and patterned green base. A butterfly with dark wings enlivened by patterns of white spots and orange markings clings to one side of the flower, likely feeding or resting. Its wings are slightly blurred, indicating movement.\n\nThe background is soft and out-of-focus, rendered in muted brown tones that enhance the visual contrast with the sharply defined and brightly colored details of the thistle and the butterfly. The composition focuses on the interplay between the natural geometry of the thistle and the delicate form of the butterfly, showcasing a moment of interaction in their shared habitat. This photograph captures the details of these elements with clarity and depth, emphasizing the beauty of nature in a serene setting.","title":"Milk wort and butterfly in the Texas countryside, near San Antonio","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554841","545691","544578","544553","544479","544619","544603","543603","547818","544618","544517","544514","544614","551381","544566","550462"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","wing","flower","bloom","sharply","stalk","render","cling","feed","perch"]}
