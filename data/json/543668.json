{"path":"543668.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a rural landscape with industrial elements under a hazy, overcast sky. In the foreground, a sparsely vegetated plain spreads out, primarily in shades of green and brown, indicating either agricultural land or grassland. A few sporadic trees appear, and a fenced area is visible at the bottom edge of the image. \n\nA small white building with a darker roof is situated near the lower left side of the image. In front of this structure, a lone vehicle is seen on a road, illuminated by its headlights owing to the dim ambient light conditions. Electrical poles run parallel to the road, extending into the distance.\n\nDominating the midground and partly obscured by atmospheric haze, a large industrial facility with multiple tall chimneys stands prominently. White smoke or steam billows out of several stacks, dispersing into the air and contributing to the general haze that overlays the scene.\n\nIn the background, a silhouette of a mountain range can be faintly discerned through the haze, enhancing the depth and scale of the view. The mountains appear layered and recede progressively into the mist. \n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the tranquility and natural spaciousness of a rural setting against the imposing, somewhat stark presence of industrial activity. This contrast is heightened by the atmospheric conditions and the muted color palette, creating a scene that speaks both to the interplay of human activity with nature and to environmental concerns associated with industrialization.","title":"Air is polluted by emissions from cement plant","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["545020","549191","547539","545013","544039","551026","557374","548850","551061","545239","545048","543159","544736","545989","546398","545354"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["haze","heighten","spaciousness","overlay","industrialization","grassland","disperse","mountain","headlight","discern"]}
