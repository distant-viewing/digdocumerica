{"path":"556984.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a scene from a rural location beside a road. In the foreground, three old and somewhat rusted mailbox units mounted on posts are closely aligned, with their open sides facing towards the left, positioned at the edge of a gravel area adjacent to the asphalt road. The mailboxes are typical of those found in the United States, specifically meant for roadside mail delivery.\n\nThe road runs from the bottom right of the frame towards the center left, disappearing into the distance. It appears to be a two-lane highway with a solid white border line and dashed center lines, indicating a standard rural highway where overtaking is allowed.\n\nOn the left side of the road, opposite the mailboxes, stands a single-story building with a sign reading \"BANK\" in red letters and offering \"5½\" percent interest. The style of the building is simple and unadorned, indicative of small-town commercial architecture, possibly dating from the mid-20th century.\n\nThe background of the scene is dominated by a row of tall, thin trees with autumnal yellow leaves, most likely poplars, aligning parallel to the road and contributing to the rural atmosphere. Their presence adds a serene and almost picturesque quality to the area.\n\nThe overall composition and the elements in the photograph—mailboxes, road, bank, and trees—suggest a quiet, less populated area where these features are integral to daily life and local infrastructure. The clear sky and the shadows suggest it is a sunny day, perhaps morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows. The absence of people and movement gives the image a calm, static quality, focusing attention on the infrastructure and natural landscape of the area.","title":"The main street of the Kitsap County town of silverdale showing rural route mail boxes and a Mobile home bank office.
