{"path":"557046.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a group of riders on horseback participating in a parade in a small town setting. The riders, a mix of adults and children, are dressed in Western attire, including cowboy hats and casual shirts. They are riding a variety of horses, some of which are adorned with decorative tack, suggesting a celebratory or festival atmosphere.\n\nThe scene takes place on a sunny day, with bright light casting shadows on the ground. The parade seems to be moving down a main street, lined with spectators and traditional storefronts, including a visible 'Real Estate' sign. In the background, there is a street corner prominently featuring a 'Standard' gas station sign, which hints at a mid-20th-century American setting. Classic cars are parked along the curb, further invoking a sense of a historical or celebratory event.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of community and tradition, with the townspeople gathered to watch or participate in the parade, enjoying a communal festive activity.","title":"Horse riders parade down the main street of Cottonwood Falls, Kansas, near Emporia, during festivities for the Flint Hills Rodeo, a major cultural event of the area.
