{"path":"543587.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a two-story building nestled among tall pine trees under a clear blue sky. The architectural style of the building integrates rustic elements with modern design, featuring a prominent use of large glass windows and wooden beams which contribute to a transparent and open appearance. The main facade is accented with a substantial stone chimney, which extends from the ground and complements the brown tones of the wood.\n\nThe environment around the building is natural and forested, helping the structure blend seamlessly with its surroundings. The ground is covered with a mix of grass and pine needles, typical of a woodland area, and the presence of thin, relatively tall pine trees adds to the serene and peaceful setting. Sunlight filters through the trees, creating dappled light patches on the structure and the ground, enhancing the natural allure of the location.\n\nNo people or moving objects are visible in the scene, which gives it a tranquil and untouched feel. The building itself suggests a function possibly related to a retreat, lodge, or community center, designed to engage visitors with the natural environment through its large windows and outdoor-oriented structure.","title":"Condominium construction","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["542593","544448","543580","552986","543526","557669","557329","556644","546464","557327","555295","546472","552987","555232","546460","546456"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Historic Architecture"],"terms":["allure","lodge","retreat","needle","ground","pine","building","function","window","visitor"]}
