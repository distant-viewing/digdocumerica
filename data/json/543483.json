{"path":"543483.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals, a man and a woman, walking along a dirt path in a forested setting. The man, walking slightly behind the woman, is clad in a green t-shirt and khaki pants, accented with a belt and a camouflage hat. He carries a pickaxe resting on his shoulder. The woman, leading slightly, wears a light blue long-sleeve shirt, dark pants, and carries a red bucket, suggesting they may be involved in some outdoor activity like gardening or trail maintenance.\n\nThe surroundings are lush with various types of vegetation, showcasing tall trees, including pine trees, and a mix of shrubs and ground cover, indicating this might be in a mountainous or wooded area. The path they are on is narrow, edged by natural vegetation, and looks to be sloping gently uphill. The presence of a tool and a bucket hints at a possibly active engagement with the environment, possibly planting or maintaining the area. Overall, the image gives an impression of active involvement in nature conservation or similar outdoor activities in a serene forest setting.","title":"California -- Big Basin Redwoods State Park","placename":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park (Calif.)","location":"Big Basin Redwoods State Park, California","nn1":["544337","545512","553373","554662","551426","545493","543439","543455","545721","542603","554705","558078","553638","543490","557005","553755"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["bucket","woman","carry","path","mountainous","camouflage","khaki","gardening","walk","pants"]}
