{"path":"552408.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and colorful garden scene. The foreground is dominated by an expansive bed of flowers with multiple layers of colors; bright orange and yellow flowers are most prominent, bordered by a patch of red flowers closer to the edge of the grass, and interspersed with small clumps of white flowers. \n\nVisitors are enjoying the garden. On the left side, a group of three adults, two women and a man, are seen observing or tending to the flowers near a path that wraps behind the flowerbed. A small child wearing a light-colored hat is slightly distant from them, focused on the garden. On the right side of the image, two men and a woman are engaged in a conversation, with one man gesturing as they talk, standing on a grassy area that borders the paved path. Another child, wearing a dark outfit, is standing near the edge of the flowerbed, facing towards the adults.\n\nThe background is filled with lush green trees, providing a dense canopy and a contrasting backdrop to the bright colors of the flowers in the foreground. The environment is peaceful and well-maintained, indicative of a public park or similar recreational area.","title":"Family outing on the beautifully landscaped grounds of the canadian school of horticulture bordering the niagara parkway north of Niagara Falls, ontario","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["552409","552400","552396","551746","551728","551785","551649","551698","551623","557262","551620","551743","550063","551705","551702","550027"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["flower","flowerbed","garden","adult","path","border","child","clump","tend","wrap"]}
