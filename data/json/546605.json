{"path":"546605.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene from an urban setting, possibly during the late 1960s or early 1970s, where a group of people is engaged in the activity of boarding a city bus. The bus, a vintage model colored white and silver, has a rounded, streamlined body design and features large, clear windows. It is parked in a spacious parking lot.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a car, possibly a Ford Mustang or similar coupe, which reflects the automotive styles of the period. Behind the bus, a large department store serves as the background. The store features a bland, typical mid-20th century commercial architecture with a simple, unadorned brown brick facade. Signage on the building is minimal, but the name \"LESIER\" is partially visible in faded letters.\n\nThe group of people waiting to board the bus includes about a dozen individuals, both men and women. They are dressed in typical attire of the period: men in suits and overcoats, many wearing hats, and women in coats that reach mid-calf, accessorized with bags and possibly scarves. This attire suggests a cooler weather setting.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a routine moment of city life, characterized by daily transportation, subdued winter clothing, and a backdrop of commercial architecture. The image portrays a slice of urban Americana, emphasizing the communal and sometimes monotonous aspects of daily work commutes in an industrial age cityscape.","title":"Early morning express bus from Maryland suburb to Washington, DC","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546655","546604","553796","547195","549921","556786","545385","556742","547814","546735","556794","549891","546668","556791","556795","556203"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","store","period","calf","overcoat","dozen","coupe","commute","scarf","architecture"]}
