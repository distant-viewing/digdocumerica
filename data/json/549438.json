{"path":"549438.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures two individuals by a river, actively engaged in preparing or repairing a large inflatable raft. They are on a stony riverbank surrounded by a natural landscape. The river is flowing briskly in the background, bordered by rocks and shaded by trees which suggest a remote, possibly mountainous environment.\n\nThe person on the left, appears to be a man, crouches as he manually manipulates what seems to be a pump or some mechanical device attached to the raft. The person on the right, who appears to be a woman, is bending over a different section of the raft, holding what looks like a circular object - potentially a part of the raft or a tool.\n\nBoth individuals wear casual outdoor clothing suitable for a rugged, outdoor activity. The man is dressed in a light-colored long sleeve shirt and dark pants, while the woman wears a striped tank top and light-colored pants.\n\nThe overall composition of the image focuses on the interaction of the individuals with the raft amid a vibrant natural setting, conveying a sense of active engagement and outdoor adventure. The bright sunlight and clear blue sky above accentuate the vividness of the wilderness and the activity taking place.","title":"Members of Wilderness Expedition inflate a 28-foot raft at the beginning of a trip through Hells Canyon on the Snake River.","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["546338","549441","549996","545908","544925","545733","545741","546320","554462","546880","545937","551538","550659","546352","545745","543943"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["raft","pant","pump","individual","vividness","person","river","woman","adventure","device"]}
