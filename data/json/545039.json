{"path":"545039.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a vast rural landscape featuring a series of distinct dust devils in action. The foreground shows expansive agricultural fields varying in color from golden yellow to rich brown, interspersed with patches of green vegetation. A solitary tree is noticeable in one segment of the fields. The middle ground prominently sports multiple dust devils, stirring up considerable volumes of dust, visible as vertical, dusty tendrils rising above the land. The background is marked by a series of rolling hills partially obscured by the dusty haze near the horizon line. Above, a dramatic sky looms filled with puffy, voluminous clouds in varying shades of gray and white, suggesting a vivid dynamism in the weather. Overall, the image presents a dramatic interaction of natural forces within a serene rural setting.","title":"Grass-seed stubble is burned in Willamette Valley.","placename":"Salem (Or.)","location":"Salem, Oregon","nn1":["544024","545051","545009","549181","554030","545025","549186","549179","552483","544034","549182","552484","548673","554027","545040","545790"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["dust","series","stir","dynamism","volume","loom","vary","field","force","segment"]}
