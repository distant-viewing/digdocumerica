{"path":"557323.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph displays a view from inside a greenhouse looking out onto a snowy landscape. The focus is on the dense vegetation near the foreground and a wire-meshed frame that supports the plants. Various plants with green leaves, some budding with flowers are seen growing robustly within the greenhouse structure. Numerous thin wooden sticks support the plants, helping them stay upright.\n\nA noticeable feature of the greenhouse is the transparent glass or plastic pane that covers the whole background. It is slightly fogged or frosted, blurring the details of the snowy landscape outside. The structure of the greenhouse includes wooden beams which frame the mesh and glass, suggesting a sturdy yet simple construction.\n\nOn the top side of this frame hangs a thermometer, indicating the temperature within the greenhouse and possibly aiding in the monitoring and maintenance of an optimal environment for the plants. The background shows a densely snow-covered area with obscured details due to the frost on the glass, emphasizing the contrast between the protected, lively interior and the harsh, wintery exterior.","title":"Solar greenhouse owned and built by Peter Howell located at about the 8,500 foot level in the Front Range","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["557325","557321","557322","555356","555300","555372","555362","555359","555357","555361","555299","555364","542691","555298","557324","542692"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["greenhouse","mesh","plant","glass","wintery","stay","frost","bud","temperature","support"]}
