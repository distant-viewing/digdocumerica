{"path":"543385.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures three hikers in a mountainous, snowy landscape. The hikers, dressed in bright orange jackets and dark trousers, trek on a rocky path partially covered with patches of snow and ice. Each hiker carries a backpack, suggesting a journey of some duration. \n\nThe terrain around them is rugged and scattered with large boulders and patches of snow, indicating that this area might experience cold temperatures throughout much of the year. The rock face in the background slopes steeply, streaked with gray and black lines, which might be due to geological formations or varying kinds of rock surfaces. The topography suggests it's either a high-altitude environment or a region well-known for its challenging hiking trails.\n\nThe picture conveys a sense of adventure and the isolation often found in high mountain ranges. The clear sky in the distance contrasts with the severity of the mountainous terrain, providing a beautiful but stark backdrop to the human endeavor of hiking and exploration. The focus and composition emphasize the scale of the landscape compared to the human figures, highlighting the vastness and the rough beauty of the natural environment.","title":"Hikers of explorer post 397 of Los Angeles area climb from 7500 ft.
