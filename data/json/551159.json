{"path":"551159.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and playful outdoor scene featuring three children at a riverbank. The viewpoint is framed by lush, green foliage on the sides, focusing on a rustic wooden dock that extends into the glistening waters. One child, appearing joyful and dynamic, is caught in mid-jump off the dock into the river, while another child is poised on the edge preparing to dive, and a third child stands in the water close to the dock. The river itself sparkles with reflections from the sun, and the background reveals a dense tree line across the water, suggesting a secluded, natural setting. Overall, this scene evokes a sense of carefree summer days spent enjoying nature and companionship.","title":"Down the Kanawha River from Charleston on Route 62, boys swim and dive from piers of an old coal-loading operation.","placename":"Charleston (W.
