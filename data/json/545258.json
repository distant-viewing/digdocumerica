{"path":"545258.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a desolate landscape dominated by the remnants of a clear-cut forest. The scene is filled with strewn pieces of broken and splintered wood, indicating recent logging activity. The ground is littered with debris, composed largely of various sizes of wood logs, sharply broken tree stumps, and scattered branches, suggesting a violent disruption of the natural environment.\n\nIn the middle of this chaotic scene stands a person, giving a sense of scale to the devastation. This individual is dressed in a red vest over a long-sleeved shirt and pants, with boots, seemingly surveying the area. They are positioned on a large tree stump, which serves as a small platform amidst the surrounding wreckage.\n\nThe background further emphasizes the extent of the logging, as no standing trees are visible near the person; the horizon is just a continuation of the mess of timber and earth. The sky above is clear and blue, contrasting starkly with the destruction on the ground. This juxtaposition may invoke a feeling of bleakness or the harsh impact of human activity on natural landscapes.","title":"The Butte Creek stream, formerly a salmon spawning ground, was ruined by the forestry practices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, according to forestry consultant Dee Terry.
