{"path":"554634.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts a picturesque mountain landscape during what seems to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and muted colors. The scene is dominated by a range of rolling mountains which extend across the frame, receding into the distance under a sky that is a mix of blue and light violet hues with scattered clouds.\n\nThe mountains themselves display a variety of greens, purples, and browns, hinting at a diverse vegetation cover which changes with altitude. The nearest range shows a relatively dark outline at the bottom, suggesting a thick forested area which gradually thins as the elevation increases. Above these treelines, the mountain surfaces appear softer and smoother, reflecting less dense vegetation or possibly rocky outcrops.\n\nThe middle ground mountains have patches of sunlight illuminating them, highlighting orange and red tones that may indicate autumn foliage. These colors provide a warm contrast to the overall cooler tones of the landscape.\n\nClouds obscure parts of the highest peaks in the distance, creating a dramatic and mysterious effect, leading to a feeling of depth and vastness in the landscape. Overall, the composition and the varying intensities of light and shadow create a serene and contemplative mood in this scenic mountain view. The photograph's vintage quality adds to its charm, offering a timeless glimpse into a tranquil natural setting.","title":"View towards algonquin mountain with fall colors and balsam fir spires in the foreground","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["554962","555131","543023","544070","542681","542923","554402","555130","553825","542676","552927","546749","552695","557519","555378","554398"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","outcrops","violet","increase","cooler","treeline","reced","range","softer","scenic"]}
