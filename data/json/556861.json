{"path":"556861.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene on what appears to be a railway construction or maintenance site. In the image, two individuals are engaged in some activity involving a large, heavy piece of machinery situated on a railway track. The person closer to the foreground is standing and looking down at something next to the machinery, perhaps inspecting or operating it. He is wearing a safety helmet, a dark long-sleeve shirt, and gloves, indicating a focus on safety in the work environment.\n\nThe machinery itself is sizeable, with various mechanical components and structures visible, some of which seem rather complex. It might be used for laying down tracks, repairing them, or some related task, given its placement directly on the railway tracks.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred and subdued in color, likely due to the quality of the photograph or the lighting conditions, which seem overcast. It suggests a somewhat open space without any distinct structures immediately visible behind the figures. The overall scene conveys a sense of industrious, manual labor taking place in an outdoor, possibly rural, railway setting.\n","title":"Southern Railway track repair crew removes old rails and replaces them with new quarter mile long rails in a regular program to improve the company's 10,531 miles of track. On a good day, when the crew doesn't have to halt work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded track per day. The crew numbers 50 to 55 men, and Southern has an average of four working throughout the system.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556901","556871","556887","556881","556872","556883","556878","556860","556899","556875","556870","556865","556898","556890","556874","556892"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","track","machinery","safety","glove","placement","helmet","component","labor","maintenance"]}
