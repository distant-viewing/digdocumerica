{"path":"549096.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a striking sunset scene with the silhouette of a train and multiple rows of telephone poles. The sun is positioned low in the sky, casting a warm yellow-orange glow across the scene. The background consists primarily of a gradient sky that fades from a deep orange near the horizon to a darker hue at the top.\n\nThe foreground prominently displays a freight train moving towards the viewer, its front light illuminated and visible through the low light conditions, suggesting the train is in operation. Parallel to the train, numerous telephone poles, lined up in a receding perspective, establish a strong linear pattern that draws the eye towards the horizon. The wires connected to these poles create soft curves that contrast with the straight lines of the poles.\n\nThe entire scene is bathed in the golden tones of the sunset, which adds a serene yet dynamic quality to the composition, highlighting the intersection of human-made structures and the natural beauty of the sunset. This evokes themes of travel, technology, and the passing of time.","title":"Railroad and transmission lines near Salton Sea.
