{"path":"547854.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features a rectangular sign mounted on a slender post amidst what appears to be a wooded area with pine branches surrounding it. The sign is painted in a shade of forest green with white lettering, providing a clear, coherent contrast designed for legibility.\n\nThe sign reads, bold and instructive:\n\n\"PLEASE COOPERATE!\nSO THE BIRDS, ANIMALS, PLANTS CAN REMAIN UNDISTURBED…\nENJOY, DON'T DESTROY\nOBEY ALL RULES!\nIN WEST POND AREA NO ONE EXCEPT PARK PERSONNEL TO\nLEAVE BLUE STONE PATH…\nRESTING AREA OPEN IN WINTER ONLY!\nDO NOT REMOVE ANY BIRD, ANIMAL, PLANT, SHRUB OR FLOWER ECT. DEAD OR ALIVE!!\nPARENTS…WATCH YOUR CHILDREN\nNO RADIOS, LOUD NOISES, SITTING ON GRASS, FOOD, DRINKS OR LITTER\"\n\nThe text emphasizes cooperation with park regulations intended to protect and preserve the natural environment and wildlife, as well as ensure a pleasant experience for visitors. Notable rules include prohibitions against removing any natural elements, creating loud noises, sitting on the grass, and consuming food or drinks within the designated area. The sign also makes a specific mention of an area that is only open in the winter.\n\nThe background behind the sign blurred with glimpses of evergreen pine needles creates a natural frame that reinforces the sign’s environmental conservation message. The setting suggests that the sign is situated in a naturally delicate or preservation-focused area, likely within a park or a reserved natural habitat.","title":"Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547850","544177","550699","544531","545617","554119","547865","548158","546966","557205","548846","554568","546386","542789","544913","548836"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["rule","noise","sign","drink","food","winter","parent","mention","cooperation","park"]}
