{"path":"544239.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape focusing on a sign that reads \"ORGANIC GROWN\" mounted on a single dark pole placed in the center foreground of the image. The scene is set in a lightly wooded area where tall, straight pine trees dominate the background, their trunks rising high and creating a visual line that frames the rest of the scene.\n\nIn the background, the trees are densely packed, casting shadows and patches of sunlight on the forest floor, adding a dappled effect to the visibility of the area. The undergrowth is sparse, possibly due to the density of the trees preventing much sunlight from reaching the ground. There's a sense of quiet tranquility exuded by the soft, natural lighting.\n\nThe area immediately surrounding the sign seems to be a field or clearing with scattered grass and patches of bare soil, suggesting that it could be a cultivated space or part of a managed forest or park. The \"ORGANIC GROWN\" sign, stark against the more muted colors of the woodland, hints at ecological or agricultural activities, possibly indicating that the area is used for organic farming or gardening. This sign serves as a focal point in the photograph, drawing attention to the relationship between human agricultural practices and natural forest environments.","title":"Southeastern Louisiana","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["542789","551962","544262","547049","543104","542568","555116","542791","544913","558088","545045","553457","554982","545283","543615","550536"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["forest","sign","prevent","gardening","relationship","undergrowth","clear","sunlight","farming","practice"]}
