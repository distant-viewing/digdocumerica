{"path":"544762.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a muddy riverbed with scattered debris and waste. The setting is in a broad valley with hills visible in the background, stretching under a clear sky. The immediate focus is on a muddy surface glistening with moisture, possibly after a tide has receded or a flood has subsided. Sprawled across the mud are numerous sticks, leaves, and other organic detritus, typical of natural waterway deposits after the water level drops.\n\nA striking element in the foreground is a green, cylindrical barrel, which stands out against the natural brown hues of the mud. This barrel, likely a discarded container, adds an industrial or human-made contrast to the otherwise natural scene. It's positioned at a slight tilt, half-buried in the mud, suggesting it has been there for some time.\n\nThe way the light reflects on the mud lends a textured, almost sparkling quality to the surface, highlighting the environmental message possibly conveyed by the imageâ€”the intrusion of pollution in natural settings. The overall mood is one of tranquility mixed with a subtle critique of environmental negligence.","title":"Trash on Clear Creek","placename":"Black Hawk (Colo.)","location":"Black Hawk, Colorado","nn1":["544810","552062","543762","546920","551531","544858","552069","545680","548090","552082","552054","552248","543806","555559","553427","552983"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["mud","barrel","detritus","bury","drop","intrusion","riverbed","tide","deposit","flood"]}
