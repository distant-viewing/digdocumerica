{"path":"554794.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"In the image provided, an elderly man is pictured outside, engaging directly with the camera with a serious facial expression. He is dressed in a dark blue puffer jacket and a distinctive black cap embellished with a golden emblem resembling a crescent moon and star. The man holds both of his hands extended towards the camera, showing a handful of dark soil or dirt, suggesting he might be illustrating something related to the soil or the ground.\n\nThe background of the photo is predominantly a dull, earthen landscape dotted with small mounds of similar dark soil or compost, which stretch across the photo behind the man. There are no distinct features or vegetation that stand out prominently in the background, providing a muted backdrop that focuses attention on the man and his demonstration. The overall lighting is flat and overcast, suggesting cloudy or gloomy weather conditions at the time the photo was taken. The composition and elements of the photograph seem to emphasize themes of agriculture, soil science, or environmental study.","title":"Floyd lamb holds waste ash that has been shipped from Cleveland and dumped in some of the strip pits, off route 33","placename":"Saint Clairsville (Ohio)","location":"Saint Clairsville, Ohio","nn1":["549083","555824","542548","554797","558108","547179","554846","545091","547416","554915","554028","543802","545087","544154","556563","544275"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["soil","dull","embellish","moon","science","demonstration","man","photo","emblem","mounds"]}
