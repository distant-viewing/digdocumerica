{"path":"554937.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of labor, likely related to agriculture or landscaping. There are two men in the image, focused on their tasks.\n\nThe man in the foreground is actively working. He wears a bright yellow long-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, a large white cowboy hat, and brown boots. He is using a shovel to transfer dark-colored material into a red wheelbarrow. His posture is bent slightly at the waist, indicating the effort involved in his task. The material he's shoveling appears to be moist, suggesting it could be soil, mulch, or compost.\n\nThe second man is visible in the background and stands watching or waiting. He is dressed in a green shirt, faded jeans, a dark cowboy hat, and what appears to be work boots. He is positioned near what seems to be a pile of similar material and various agricultural or construction setting elements, such as old corrugated metal structures, which form parts of the background.\n\nThe setting is somewhat rugged and practical with a focus on utility. The ground around the men is covered with the same dark material, implying an extensive use or processing of this substance. The roofing above appears rustic and improvised, consisting of metal sheets, and indicates that this might be a semi-indoor or covered outdoor workspace, typical in rural or semi-rural environments used for processing materials.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph provides a strong sense of physical labor and the environment associated with agricultural or landscaping work. The lighting and details, such as the texture of the material and the clothing of the men, contribute to a vivid portrayal of a moment in their working day.","title":"Worker from mexico uses a shovel in a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554856","544154","548761","553138","547498","556903","553093","552570","544828","544371","554047","556893","552574","554853","552572","547108"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["material","shovel","landscaping","work","boot","labor","man","processing","improvise","jean"]}
