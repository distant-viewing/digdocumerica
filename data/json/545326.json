{"path":"545326.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph features a vintage urban scene, likely captured during the late afternoon given the lighting and long shadows. A two-story brick building with a weathered appearance is the main subject of the image. The fa√ßade is characterized by rows of doors and windows, some of which are boarded up or damaged. On the second-floor balcony, an array of white laundry items are hanging, suggesting that the building may house apartments where residents live.\n\nOn the street level, directly in front of the building, three individuals are seen. Two are standing closer to the building, engaged in what appears to be a conversation, and are dressed in brightly colored, possibly floral, outfits typical of earlier decades. A third individual is leaning against the wall next to them. Their presence along with the laundry suggests everyday residential life.\n\nIn the street, which is devoid of any pavement markings, several vintage cars are parked, enhancing the historical feel of the image. The street surface is rough and patchy, indicating wear and possibly neglect. There is a puddle reflecting the building and sky, indicating recent rain or a spill.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the scene is one of a lived-in, somewhat neglected urban setting. The photo captures both the architectural character and the human elements of life in this particular urban enclave, evocative of a specific period in the late 20th century.","title":"El Paso's second ward, a Chicano neighborhood","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["552965","545350","556167","550108","549287","555902","545351","545353","557645","555905","550053","550138","556225","549267","557278","555942"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","spill","laundry","in","building","resident","puddle","apartment","pavement","marking"]}
