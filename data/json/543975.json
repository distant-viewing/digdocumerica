{"path":"543975.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor scene set in a dimly lit room where several people are engaged in leisure activities. The predominant activity in the image is pool playing. There are two pool tables visible, covered with green felt and scattered with balls. \n\nOn the left side of the image, a man is taking a shot at one of the pool tables, leaning over with his cue stick carefully aligned. Another man stands nearby observing the shot. In the background, two others sit at a low table chatting and sharing a drink.\n\nOn the right side of the room, another pool table is in use where a man stands playing, and another bystanding. Both are dressed casually, typical of a relaxed, social setting.\n\nThe decoration of the room includes mounted deer heads on the walls adding a rustic touch. Above the pool tables, pendant lamps with wide shades provide focal lighting. A wall clock is also visible, indicating the passage of time in this social setting.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and appears to be a gathering spot for relaxation and social interaction. The tone and decor suggest the era could be from the mid-20th century, giving the scene a retrospective feel. Overall, the photograph captures a social slice-of-life in a recreational indoor environment.","title":"Pool hall","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543990","547794","546975","558302","547376","546025","550323","556441","551293","554897","553518","543041","551279","554866","551267","548564"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["pool","table","room","shot","playing","deer","ball","clock","decor","wall"]}
