{"path":"549804.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph presents a close-up view of a part of a vintage or old industrial vehicle, possibly a train or heavy machinery. The left side of the image features a relatively clean, pale reddish surface, possibly a door or panel, adorned with rivets that hold it in place. The panel is framed by a metal edge, and just above it a lever or handle is faintly visible.\n\nThe right side of the image shows a darker, more worn and rusty area with more complex mechanical parts, including exposed bars, levers, and additional riveted panels. This section also includes a dirty window with a cracked pane, suggesting this might be part of a cab area of the vehicle.\n\nAt the bottom center, prominently displayed, is a safety plaque with the warning \"WATCH YOUR STEP\" painted in white on a black background. This sign is affixed to a metal surface that has noticeable rust and paint peeling, indicating age and weathering. \n\nThe juxtaposition of the slightly cleaner left side and the tarnished, mechanical right side gives the image a strong industrial feel, highlighting themes of decay and the passing of time in machinery. The careful inclusion of the warning sign suggests a concern for safety in an environment that may pose hazards. The overall condition and elements suggest that the vehicle has seen significant use and has been exposed to the elements.","title":"Sanitation department truck, Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552505","550255","547894","542897","543258","557389","556389","556844","543330","556353","557944","554353","545978","544720","554319","546757"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["lever","panel","warning","safety","rivet","plaque","hazard","vehicle","machinery","cab"]}
