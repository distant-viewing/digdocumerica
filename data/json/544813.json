{"path":"544813.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a polluted natural scene underscored by the incongruity of environmental neglect and its management efforts. At the forefront, there is a faded and slightly rusted red and white sign embedded in the dry, brownish reeds. The sign, proclaiming \"NO DUMPING - Violators will be prosecuted,\" suggests an official attempt to prevent pollution, though ironically, it stands among scattered trash. Directly in front of the sign, there is a large yellow barrel, likely a chemical container, discarded in the reeds, emphasizing the ongoing violation of the posted warning.\n\nBeyond the immediate foreground, the scene opens up to a body of water that reflects the blue sky. The water body is bordered by more reeds and some scattered debris, hinting that it might be a common site for illegal dumping. In the middle distance, the opposite bank of the water can be seen, lined with more dry vegetation and a sparsely built environment that includes a large, flat industrial or commercial building and utility poles, giving the scene a somewhat desolate, neglected industrial outskirts vibe.\n\nThe sky is quite clear and blue, indicating a sunny day, which contrasts with the pollution and abandonment indicated on the ground. This juxtaposition adds a layer of starkness to the image, as the natural beauty of the day does not align with the carelessness shown to the environment in the photographed area.","title":"Colorado--Denver","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["546805","548308","547992","547512","547520","547907","550812","552811","544810","547493","545517","550280","550258","547516","550800","552089"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["reed","dumping","pollution","neglect","starkness","prevent","embed","sign","built","attempt"]}
