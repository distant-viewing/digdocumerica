{"path":"550990.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a series of old industrial buildings nestled in a lush, wooded landscape. The buildings are primarily constructed of wood and metal, showing signs of weathering and age. They exhibit various muted colors, mainly shades of green, gray, and blue. These structures are perched on a hillside, supported by wooden stilts and frameworks, suggesting a steep terrain.\n\nThe buildings are interconnected by a series of external staircases and walkways, indicating a multi-level design that likely follows the natural slope of the hillside. The architecture appears utilitarian, typical of mid-20th century industrial sites, possibly associated with mining or manufacturing due to the location and robust construction.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a disused railroad track overgrown with grass and weeds, indicating that the area may no longer be in active use. This track hints at a past when these facilities were possibly accessed by rail for transportation of goods or raw materials.\n\nThe background is heavily wooded, featuring dense trees which are predominantly green, suggesting that the photograph was taken in late spring to summer. The natural setting envelops the industrial complex, giving it a secluded, almost abandoned feel. No people are visible in the image, enhancing the sense of abandonment and disuse. The scene is bathed in natural sunlight, casting soft shadows and highlighting the textures of the buildings and vegetation.","title":"This housing in smithers lies between the railroad tracks and u.s.
