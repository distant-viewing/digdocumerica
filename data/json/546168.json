{"path":"546168.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph showcases a contrast between industrial and serene elements in a cemetery setting. In the foreground, the focus is on a well-maintained grassy area dotted with headstones and floral tributes at a cemetery. Various gravestones with inscriptions such as \"FOWLER\" and \"PHILLIPS\" are visible, suggesting the resting places of different families. Some of these grave markers are embellished with bright floral arrangements, adding splashes of color to the green landscape.\n\nDominating the background, there is a series of large, towering oil derricks, which stand stark against the clear sky. These industrial structures are composed of metal frameworks and are distributed at varying distances, creating a depth of field in the image. The presence of these oil derricks provides a strong industrial backdrop to the otherwise peaceful and somber setting of the cemetery, highlighting the juxtaposition between the two environments. The sky is clear, indicating a bright, sunny day which illuminates both the cemetery and the metallic structures in the background, enhancing the vividness of the scene.","title":"Oil derrick in cemetery","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["546204","546196","546179","546379","554825","546147","546038","554791","555566","545322","550364","545363","557942","547397","552451","557184"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["cemetery","oil","headstone","gravestone","inscription","marker","vividness","splash","family","framework"]}
