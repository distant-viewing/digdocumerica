{"path":"549972.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of an urban area with a dense and highly organized arrangement of buildings and streets. The area captured showcases a grid-like pattern where multiple blocks are uniformly aligned adjacent to each other. The roads run parallel and perpendicular, dividing the landscape into distinct square or rectangular blocks.\n\nThe buildings within the grid are predominantly low-rise, possibly residential or mixed-use, with uniform heights and similar rooftop colors, ranging from reddish-brown to dark tones. Interspersed among the residential blocks, there are several larger buildings and open spaces that might be commercial properties, public facilities, or parks.\n\nThe photo encapsulates a view that allows no specific landmarks to be distinctly recognized but serves to highlight the planned, repetitive urban layout typical of many densely populated cities. The coloration of the image suggests it might have been taken during the early to mid-twentieth century, given the photographic film's apparent age and quality. No natural landscapes or water bodies are visible; it's purely an urban sprawl stretching to the horizon where the cityscape gradually fades into the distance under a hazy sky.","title":"Row houses","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552730","552729","552728","548343","547445","551505","548425","548318","548424","545914","553971","552734","553935","546399","551509","553060"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["block","grid","sprawl","coloration","rooftop","landmark","film","property","layout","height"]}
