{"path":"550958.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid industrial scene likely from a petroleum refinery or a chemical processing plant. The dominant features in the image are the large structures and equipment typical of such facilities, including storage tanks, complex pipework, and large cylindrical towers.\n\nTo the right of the image, a flare stack is visible with a bright flame erupting from its top, emitting a plume of dark smoke against the sky. This flare is a safety device used in industrial plants to burn off flammable gas released by pressure relief valves. Adjacent to the flare, thick clouds of darker smoke or emissions billow from another stack, contributing to an overcast atmosphere in the sky.\n\nThe background is mostly filled with additional industrial components and infrastructure, such as stairs, supporting frameworks, and possibly conveyors or maintenance platforms. Overall, the landscape is devoid of visible natural elements, focusing instead on the man-made, functional aspects of the plant.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon, with the light source enhancing the dramatic effect of the flames and emissions against the darker industrial backdrop. The photograph serves as a strong visual representation of heavy industry and its environmental impacts.","title":"The FMC Corporation's South Charleston plant","placename":"Charleston (W.
