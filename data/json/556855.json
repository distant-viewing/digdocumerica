{"path":"556855.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy scene at what appears to be a train station. The focus is on several people near the boarding area of a train on the right side of the image. The train, prominently visible, is colored dark with a number and is stationed under a covered platform.\n\nMultiple people are engaged in various activities: a few are boarding the train, others are walking or standing on the platform. A man in the foreground on the right side is either embarking or disembarking from the train. In the middle ground, there's a man carrying a child on his shoulders while a young child in red looks towards the train.\n\nThe platform, supported by columns, stretches the length of the image, shading the area where the people are. Luggage and cargo are visible on pallets on the platform, indicating either arrivals or departures. The overall lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and highlighting certain features of the station structure.\n\nThe atmosphere captured shows a blend of movement and stillness, characteristic of a transport hub, with people preparing for journeys or having just concluded them. The image portrays a snapshot of everyday transit with individuals and families engaged in the commonplace yet personal activity of travel.","title":"Passengers who have just left an Amtrak passenger train head for the station in Washington, D.C., after arriving two hours late. The train, which originates in Chicago, has a history of late arrivals. Officials blame the frequent delay on the poor quality of the track. Amtrak owns the trains and allied equipment, but leases use of the track from the nation's railroads. In 1974 the corporation carried 18 million people, an increase of 10 percent over 1973.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556044","555967","556827","556831","556670","556026","555984","556041","555959","556074","556686","556768","556091","556688","556673","556054"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","platform","station","boarding","people","arrival","pallet","departure","luggage","child"]}
