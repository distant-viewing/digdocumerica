{"path":"543626.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil scene of a large body of water, most likely a lake, with a clear blue sky overhead dotted with a few white, fluffy clouds. In the distance, an expansive range of snow-capped mountains provides a majestic backdrop. On the left side of the image, the shoreline is visible, densely lined with coniferous trees that stretch into the distance. The calm water reflects the blue of the sky, giving it a vibrant hue.\n\nA single sailboat, with its sails down, floats gently on the water near the center of the image. It appears to be a small to medium-sized craft, painted in light shades, likely red and white. The boat is anchored, as there is no visible movement of the water around it to suggest it is sailing.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is peaceful and serene, suggesting a quiet, sunny day ideal for relaxation and perhaps contemplation by the water. The composition and natural lighting underscore the tranquility and beauty of the natural setting.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543531","552222","543613","555693","548204","547757","548118","549117","557562","555692","547754","552921","543618","551216","543548","552038"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["water","craft","overhead","ideal","sail","sailboat","relaxation","contemplation","distance","snow"]}
