{"path":"555536.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, misty landscape, likely taken during early morning or late evening, as evidenced by the soft light and shadows. The image shows a series of rolling hills or low mountains, densely covered with trees, which create varying shades of dark green and brown across the landscape. A thick layer of fog envelopes the valleys between the hills, adding a mysterious and ethereal quality to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, a variety of trees, possibly in early spring or late autumn given the apparent lack of leaves on some and the presence of greenery on others, dot the landscape. Some are bare, while others have foliage, adding contrast in texture and color to the scene.\n\nThe middle ground and background feature the enveloping fog, which obscures the lower parts of the hills and creates a smooth, white blanket over much of the terrain. Above the fog, the tips of the hills are visible, creating a layered effect, with each successive ridge appearing progressively fainter in the distance due to the atmospheric effect of the mist and distance.\n\nOverall, the composition uses natural elements and subtle color variations—from greens and browns to the white of the fog—to compose a peaceful, almost painting-like depiction of a natural landscape. The absence of human presence or man-made structures enhances the untouched, wild character of the scene.","title":"Early morning mist from a river carpets the length of the east Randolph, Vermont, valley","placename":"Barre (Vt.)","location":"Barre, Vermont","nn1":["545012","556985","556587","542924","542848","554647","555110","545209","557014","543312","552695","556425","557519","555132","552336","545018"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["fog","hill","det","layered","effect","green","tip","other","atmospheric","envelope"]}
