{"path":"542999.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene, possibly from a factory or processing plant. The setting is defined by a large expanse bathed in the dim light of either dawn or dusk, giving the sky a moody, bluish tone while silhouetting the structures and equipment against it. Prominent in the image are several smokestacks, from which clouds of dark smoke billow into the sky, contributing to a somewhat somber industrial atmosphere.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a definite focus on heavy machinery and industrial activity. A crane-like structure is visible, which seems to be either loading or unloading material. Various indistinct industrial buildings and structures dot the scene, creating a layered effect of architectural and mechanical elements. The entire facility is enclosed with what appears to be a chain-link fence, hinting at restricted access typical of such industrial zones.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with smoke trailing into the sky and machinery at work, conveys a sense of ongoing industrial operation, potentially dealing with production or processing that involves heavy machinery and significant emissions. The lighting and shadows dramatize the scene, emphasizing the industrial impact on the environment.","title":"Smoke against the sun over industrial Humboldt Bay-Eureka area","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544173","550328","545446","544691","545447","557214","557381","550983","557231","547010","543011","550982","550181","546908","544696","545239"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["machinery","processing","restrict","deal","smoke","unloading","production","chain","emission","link"]}
