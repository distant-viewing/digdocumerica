{"path":"544822.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a scene within an industrial or manufacturing setting. A man is the primary focus, and he appears to be engaged in an activity involving machinery. The man is wearing a striped long-sleeve shirt, denim jeans, and a white hard hat. He seems to be examining or working on a control panel or instrument that is part of a much larger machine.\n\nThe machine is large and predominantly painted in a light gray color, with various geometric shapes creating a complex assembly of parts. Notable features on the machine include a large, dome-shaped top, multiple angular structures, and a series of bolts and compartments. It appears robust and possibly part of a power generation or heavy industrial process.\n\nIn the background, the environment is defined by a high ceiling painted yellow and supported by metal beams, indicative of a spacious industrial facility. Fluorescent lights are mounted along these beams, illuminating the area with bright artificial light.\n\nThe overall atmosphere suggests a scene of careful inspection or maintenance work, crucial to the operation of the depicted machinery. The setting is clean and organized, reflecting a well-maintained industrial space.","title":"Turbine at st.
