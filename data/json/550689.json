{"path":"550689.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a quiet, tree-lined suburban street with two individuals cycling. \n\nOn the left side of the image, a man with short hair, wearing a green shirt and light-colored pants, is riding a dark-colored bicycle. To his side, a young girl with blonde hair, wearing a colorful plaid shirt and white shorts, rides a lighter colored bicycle with a basket on the front. \n\nThe background features traditional residential architecture, with two large, white, two-story houses that possess distinct colonial features, including symmetrical windows and ornate entrance frames. The homes have green shutters and are set back from the street, separated by well-manicured lawns. The environment is lush with mature deciduous trees providing shade over the area.\n\nThe street itself is a narrow, paved road without visible markings, hinting that this might be a low-traffic residential area. The light suggests it is daytime with bright sunlight filtering through the leaves, creating a calm and peaceful setting typical of a serene neighborhood.","title":"Residential street near Gould Academy in Bethel.
