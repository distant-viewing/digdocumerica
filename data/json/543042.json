{"path":"543042.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment between two older men at a rustic Marina setting. Both men are holding beverage cans and appear to be engaged in a leisurely conversation.\n\nOn the left, one man is dressed smart-casual with a checkered shirt under a dark jacket and a black cap adorned with a badge. He stands near an old white boat with the word \"SHELLS\" painted in black on its side. The boat is moored with heavy chains visible in the foreground.\n\nOn the right, the other man wears a green cap, a dark jacket layered over a red vest and green pants, looking slightly more rugged and work-worn. He is positioned in a way that suggests middle of a conversation or argument, facing slightly towards the left man.\n\nBehind them, the background is a cluttered view of a busy marina peppered with various boats and maritime paraphernalia. Some boats are vividly colored, bringing a lively contrast to the otherwise worn-out appearance of the place. The scene is bathed in natural sunlight, suggesting a clear day which adds vibrancy to the setting.","title":"California--Bodega Bay","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["549927","552870","551253","546077","543231","551386","552868","544412","548278","543465","552874","547566","548770","547382","553519","546948"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["boat","man","worn","conversation","cap","pepper","moor","jacket","marina","badge"]}
