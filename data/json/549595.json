{"path":"549595.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures an individual working on some type of maritime equipment. The person, likely male based on the haircut and physique, is wearing a dark long-sleeved shirt with a white crewneck detail and appears to be engaged in adjusting or securing a mechanical device with cables or chains. The person's focus is on the task at hand, grasping an instrument or tool that is attached by a clear line or wire.\n\nThe scene takes place outdoors, on what appears to be a platform or dock constructed of wood, as there are wooden beams and edges visible. The background reveals a body of water, shimmering due to the sunlight reflecting off its surface. The water's appearance suggests it might be a sea or ocean environment, given the expanse and the nature of the light reflections.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph is active yet serene, combining human activity with the calmness of a water setting. The photograph may be documenting occupational work related to marine research, fishing, or some form of aquatic monitoring, evidenced by the technical setup and outdoor location.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical, biological and meteorological conditions in Lake Superior.
