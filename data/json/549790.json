{"path":"549790.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph features a large, open area strewn with various types of debris and discarded objects, depicting a striking contrast between urban decay and a notable symbol of freedom. The foreground is cluttered with an assortment of rubbish including wood planks, a torn piece of furniture, scattered papers, and miscellaneous trash, creating a sense of disarray and neglect. Notably, there is a bright red suitcase with a distinctive design, positioned prominently among the debris, drawing the viewer's attention.\n\nIn the distance, the Statue of Liberty stands, visible and isolated on the horizon, centered in the frame and providing a poignant juxtaposition to the chaotic and polluted environment in the foreground. A blue car is parked to the left, partially visible and blending into the background of dry, brown grass and a clear blue sky, indicating a broad, flat expanse that was possibly once a thriving area but is now abandoned and derelict.\n\nThis scene captures the irony and contrast between the ideal of liberty represented by the statue and the reality of environmental degradation and urban neglect in the foreground, suggesting themes of forgotten values, the impact of human waste, and the resilience of iconic symbols amidst urban decay.","title":"A view of the statue of liberty seldom seen by tourists trash-littered dumping ground is proposed liberty state park","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["549761","549763","554359","549781","549803","549760","554350","549768","549769","549958","549782","557283","549767","552043","549764","549307"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["symbol","decay","neglect","suitcase","value","rubbish","forget","disarray","reality","freedom"]}
