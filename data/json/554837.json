{"path":"554837.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural outdoor scene centered around a large, yellow construction vehicle, likely a front loader, positioned on a dirt road. The loader is carrying a sizable pile of rocky debris in its bucket, indicative of land clearing or earth-moving activities. The setting appears to be in a hilly or mountainous area during a season when trees are barren, suggesting late autumn or early winter.\n\nThe background is dominated by a large, smooth and gently sloping hill that stretches across the horizon, devoid of any significant vegetation, giving it a stark appearance. The sky above the scene is overcast, casting a somewhat dull, blue-gray hue across the landscape, enhancing the sense of a cold, sparse environment.\n\nThere are few small, leafless trees framing the right side of the image, further anchoring the scene in a rural, possibly remote location. The ground is uneven and strewn with rocks and debris, suggesting recent construction or excavation work. There are no visible buildings or other vehicles, focusing all attention on the solitary loader and the natural landscape surrounding it. This composition underscores a theme of development or alteration of the natural environment.","title":"A bulldozer prepares a path for one of the huge coal shovels, off route 70 and Belmont, Ohio, and Steubenville","placename":"Belmont (Ohio)","location":"Belmont, Ohio","nn1":["555608","547161","543107","545677","543105","555636","547922","551947","547254","543760","554544","545665","547104","555638","542539","549203"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["loader","construction","alteration","anchor","debris","clearing","strew","bucket","excavation","vehicle"]}
