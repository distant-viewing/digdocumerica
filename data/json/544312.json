{"path":"544312.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph portrays a group of six children and one adult standing on a dirt path. The woman, standing on the left side of the image, is embracing a young girl in front of her. The adult appears somewhat concerned or cautious, while the children show a range of expressions from curious to slightly amused.\n\nThe group is posed against a dramatic natural backdrop, which includes towering red rock formations typical of a canyon landscape. The time appears to be either dawn or dusk, as the lighting is subdued and soft, casting a gentle glow on the faces of the subjects and the surrounding scenery. The vegetation is lush and green, indicating a well-watered area, perhaps a valley floor within the canyon.\n\nThe terrain is rugged and natural, with no visible man-made structures in the immediate vicinity, emphasizing the wildness and remote setting of the location. The path they are standing on is narrow and appears to wind through the canyon, suggesting that this area may be used for hiking or walking.\n\nThe photograph has a grainy quality, possibly indicating it was taken with an analog camera or under low light conditions, adding a nostalgic and timeless feel to the image.","title":"HavaSupai indian children","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["545694","543234","545705","545693","545700","544903","545702","545689","543233","545780","544739","545581","545379","544093","553965","552407"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","analog","adult","path","wildness","embrace","grainy","child","hiking","group"]}
