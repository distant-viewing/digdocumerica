{"path":"550351.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural landscape, largely covered by a mixture of terrain and dense woodland. The primary objects within the scene include a small, narrow water stream running horizontally across the image, surrounded by a field of woodland debris. The stream appears to be situated in a shallow depression flanked by banks cluttered with broken logs, branches, and leaf litter.\n\nThe left side of the image features a rough bank elevated above the stream, scattered densely with wood chips or mulch and several large logs lying parallel to the bank. This area has less vegetation and appears more arid than the surroundings, providing a stark contrast to the lush greenery in the rest of the frame.\n\nThe wooded area beyond the stream is dense with tall, slender trees predominantly marked by their white, peeling barks and green foliage. Some trees show signs of decay. The background shows a thicker forest with a mix of different types and sizes of trees under an overcast sky, hinting at a vast and secluded woodland environment.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph portrays a serene, if somewhat rugged natural setting, possibly indicating a scene of post-forestry activity or natural decay in a wetland area. The atmosphere is quiet and somewhat wild, reflected by the untamed appearance of the landscape.","title":"Waste bark from the Georgia Pacific Paper Co. piled on the bank of a polluted tributary of the St. Croix River.
