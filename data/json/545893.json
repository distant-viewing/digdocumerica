{"path":"545893.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts an agricultural scene focusing on farming activities in a vast field. The primary subjects are two tractors, each equipped with cultivation tools and protective coverings over the drivers. The leftmost tractor has a bright yellow umbrella shielding the operator, providing a pop of color against the predominantly green and earthy tones of the landscape.\n\nThe field is expansive, with newly turned or tilled soil showing dark and rich textures. It appears that the farming is in an early stage, possibly preparing the ground for seeding. The tractors are moving parallel to each other, likely covering more area efficiently. Dust is kicked up around the wheels of the tractors, suggesting dry soil conditions and adding a haze to the background atmosphere.\n\nBehind the tractors, a backdrop of trees and open sky presents a tranquil rural setting. A couple of substantial trees stand out due to their size and the spread of their branches, adding a natural element to the scene that contrasts with the mechanical farming.\n\nOverall, the image captures a typical farming operation with a focus on soil preparation, set against a peaceful, rural landscape. The photograph might be telling about the agricultural practices, the machinery involved, and possibly the environmental conditions of the area.","title":"Tractors plowing field","placename":"Austin (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Texas","nn1":["548903","557521","547297","548898","544319","548950","553665","549104","554202","547436","553048","554204","544888","557753","555879","552577"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tractor","farming","soil","covering","operator","pop","cultivation","spread","umbrella","field"]}
