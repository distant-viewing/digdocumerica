{"path":"547371.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively social or cultural gathering, possibly a dance or festive event, in an indoor setting with subdued lighting that casts a warm, somewhat moody ambiance. The scene is populated with a variety of individuals, primarily adults, engaged in conversation or waiting in small groups.\n\nA number of women are dressed in vibrant, patterned, full-skirted dresses which suggest a theme or uniformity associated with a specific dance style or cultural festival. These dresses have wide skirts, potentially for a type of folk or square dance, and vary in color, with intricate patterns and some featuring ruffled trims.\n\nCentral in the scene is an older man wearing a white shirt and glasses, his head tilted back slightly as if observing something out of the frame or engaging in conversation. To the left, there's a younger girl in a similar styled but smaller scaled dress, facing away from the camera, showcasing the intricate bow and design of her dress.\n\nFurther details include other attendants in the background engaged in distinct, individual conversations or interactions, with no one directly interacting with the camera, adding a candid and immersive feel to the image. The overall composition, with its rich colors and group dynamics, conveys a sense of celebration and community interaction.","title":"The Pershing Memorial Auditorium is the scene of Lincoln's 33rd annual square dance festival.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547317","547387","547403","558286","558284","547358","553304","558285","547334","557794","552624","547386","552646","545384","553275","558295"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dance","conversation","skirt","dress","folk","attendant","uniformity","festival","dynamic","celebration"]}
