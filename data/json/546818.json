{"path":"546818.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts two individuals engaged in maintenance or repair work on a boat or ship. The scene is set outdoors during the day, likely at a dock or similar maritime setting. On the left, one person is actively welding. This person is wearing a welding mask, gloves, and a protective dark-colored jacket, focusing intently on the welding task at hand, which is generating bright sparks. This individual is bending slightly forward while holding a welding torch to a metal component of the vessel.\n\nOn the right, another individual is seen from the back, bending over while working on another part of the boat. He is wearing a light gray long-sleeve shirt, gray pants, and a cap with the text \"MAIL WANFERY BALTIMORE\" visible, implying a connection to a specific service or location possibly related to Baltimore.\n\nThe boat they are working on has a white superstructure with windows, and the hull where they are working is painted in a combination of black, red, and orange, with multiple black tires affixed to the side, likely serving as bumpers to protect the vessel.\n\nThe environment suggests an industrial maritime context, without much detail about the broader surroundings visible in the frame, focusing instead on the immediate activities of the workers. The color tone and grain of the image hint at it being captured on film, giving a dated feel to the photograph.","title":"Repair work at a small boat yard on the shore of Curtis Bay in the Baltimore harbor.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546802","551986","552863","549590","551046","548250","546858","546023","546758","551228","546852","547164","549595","552877","546841","546016"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["boat","vessel","spark","superstructure","mask","bumper","individual","maritime","glove","grain"]}
