{"path":"544685.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a striking and unusual scene of a vivid pink saltwater lake under a clear sky. The shoreline in the foreground is lined with white, crystallized salt, giving way to the deeply saturated pink hues of the water. The coloration of the water likely results from the presence of microorganisms such as algae that thrive in high-salinity environments.\n\nIn the distance across the lake, industrial structures can be seen, suggesting the area may be used for salt extraction or some form of industrial activity related to the body of water. The sky above is bright and clear, contributing to the vibrancy of the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the image with its contrasting colors, the unexpected pink water, and industrial backdrop provides an intriguing look at an industrial yet naturally colorful landscape.","title":"\"water stinks,\" writes the photographer about this scene","placename":"Fremont (Calif.)","location":"Fremont, California","nn1":["544692","550740","544686","545628","555860","544679","545623","544782","548602","548600","552920","546125","545627","544675","553867","550400"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["salt","related","saturate","alga","intriguing","thrive","extraction","coloration","result","vibrancy"]}
