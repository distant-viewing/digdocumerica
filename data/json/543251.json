{"path":"543251.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and powerful scene at the seaside. The focus is on a wave crashing against a rugged rock formation, causing a dramatic spray of water droplets that are illuminated by the sunlight. The background reveals additional jagged rocks, silhouetted against a vibrant and slightly overexposed sky, suggesting a strong sunlight from the right side of the image.\n\nThe composition utilizes dark tones predominantly, with the silhouette of the rocks forming a stark contrast to the white froth of the crashing wave. The textures are particularly noticeable with smooth sea water transitioning into chaotic, foamy bursts as it hits the rocks. The combination of these elements conveys a sense of nature's power and the unpredictability of the sea. The lighting enhances the intensity and the motion captured, emphasizing the sparkle and transparency of the water droplets in mid-air. There are no people visible in the scene, which adds to the wild and untouched feel of the landscape.","title":"California--Garrapata Beach","placename":"Garrapata State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543092","543253","547609","543019","543138","543309","543295","545122","543306","547486","547155","554087","543067","543139","543250","545882"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["droplet","rock","wave","froth","sea","sparkle","burst","seaside","spray","sunlight"]}
