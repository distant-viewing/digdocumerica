{"path":"550825.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque river scene involving two distinct boats, each carrying a group of passengers. On the left, a unique boat with a greenish body features a high-deck structure loaded with passengers. This particular vessel appears to be a specialized tour or riverboat with open sides, allowing for unobstructed views of the surroundings. The boat has large windows or openings and is equipped with two pairs of visible outboard motors at the rear, suggesting it's designed for steady cruising in deeper waters.\n\nOn the right, a more traditional and sleek boat, painted in a muted metallic tone, ferries additional passengers. This boat has a lower profile with enclosed areas presumably for passenger seating; its design is elongated and streamlined, typical of river cruise boats designed for speed and efficiency.\n\nBoth boats are moving on the water amidst a landscape dominated by lush, dense trees typical of a riverside environment. In the background, the steep, forested riverbanks provide a natural backdrop, enhancing the sense of an outdoor adventure or exploration. The lighting and the gritty texture of the film add a vintage, timeless quality to the image, capturing a moment of leisure and travel in a naturally scenic setting.","title":"Boating on the Wisconsin River at Wisconsin Dells, a popular recreation area","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550824","543935","551209","550769","545736","543958","543962","543964","551148","543945","551217","557972","550989","548301","549417","551281"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["boat","passenger","cruise","efficiency","tour","motor","seating","rear","riverside","speed"]}
