{"path":"556068.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a historical moment, likely from early to mid-20th century, showing a large gathering of people within a grand architectural setting. The venue appears to be the entrance hall of a significant public or governmental building, characterized by its high ceilings, monumental columns, and classical architecture.\n\nThe focal point of the image is a huge crowd of people, mostly men, densely packed and clad in formal attire, predominantly suits and hats typical of the era. Everyone in the crowd is facing towards the center where there appears to be some activity or point of interest, though it's not distinctly visible due to the angle and quality of the photograph.\n\nAbove the crowd, on the upper level, a few individuals can be observed watching over the gathering from what seems to be a balcony framed by large columns. An American flag hangs prominently in the background adding a patriotic feel to the setting.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with the crowd gathered between towering columns and under the shadowed overhang of the massive entrance, evokes a sense of scale and formality. The scene is imbued with a historical ambiance, suggesting a significant event tied to governance or public announcement, though no specific details about the event itself can be discerned from the image alone. The photograph serves as a window to the past, capturing a moment steeped in solemnity and the architectural grandeur of the era.","title":"Chicago's Union Station pictured at its dedication in 1925. Note: compare picture #13615, which was taken from the same spot in the summer of 1974. The Chicago terminal is one of the busiest in the Amtrak system, which oversees most U.S. intercity rail passenger service. The station also handles a large volume of commuters from the suburbs.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551852","553322","553311","556243","556694","543482","553287","543925","556451","547320","556272","556684","545384","547442","553273","551814"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Crowds"],"terms":["crowd","column","entrance","formality","gathering","solemnity","era","event","overhang","hall"]}
