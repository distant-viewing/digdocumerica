{"path":"555853.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of environmental degradation featuring a junkyard flooded with water. In the foreground, a large puddle reflects the cloud-filled sky and contains several sunken objects that resemble rocks or debris, littered among submerged, discarded automobile parts. The middle ground of the image shows a variety of old, damaged cars piled haphazardly. These vehicles, mostly with their paint faded and structures twisted, are half-submerged in the water, contributing to a sense of abandonment and decay.\n\nIn the background, the landscape opens up to a more rural or semi-industrial area, with sparse buildings and other piles of discarded materials scattered across a flat field. Beyond this, the scene meets a dramatic backdrop of snow-capped mountain ranges under a vast, cloud-speckled sky, emphasizing a stark contrast between natural beauty and human wastefulness.\n\nThe overall composition of the image—using the reflection in the water, the clutter of neglected cars, and the distant mountains—creates a powerful commentary on pollution and the impact of human activities on nature.","title":"This five acre acid water, oil and sludge filled pond was used as a dumpsite by commercial firms before being cleaned up under epa supervision.
