{"path":"543217.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant nautical scene along a shimmering water body. The focal point of the image is a sailing catamaran with a shining white hull and twin sails that catch the eye. The sails display numbers \"3239\" along with maritime symbols, one of which looks like a stylized figure resembling a fish or similar sea creature, symbolizing a possible club, class, or type designation.\n\nOnboard the catamaran, two individuals are seated, engaged in navigating the vessel. They appear relaxed and focused on their course. They are dressed in casual outdoor gear suitable for a day of sailing.\n\nIn the background, the shore is lined with boulders and a steep incline that is partially covered in grass, leading up towards a large tree and a house visible at the crest of the incline. The house is partially obscured by the tree, but it has a visible triangular roof, suggesting a typical coastal-style architecture.\n\nThe overall composition provides a lovely contrast between the serene aquatic foreground and the more rugged, natural background, offering a snapshot of leisure and interaction with nature with a splendid interplay of light reflecting off the water.","title":"California--Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["549386","544224","544667","548513","548508","548506","544021","548062","552345","551539","549421","548494","552348","547465","549415","548521"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["incline","sailing","sail","club","crest","class","creature","house","course","symbol"]}
