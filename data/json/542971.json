{"path":"542971.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of numerous overlapping clover leaves, predominantly capturing their dark green foliage. Each leaf consists of three rounded leaflets, creating the classic trefoil shape associated with clovers. The surfaces of the leaves are speckled with small, shimmering droplets of water, suggesting dew or recent rain. Some of the clovers display slight variations in hue, ranging from darker to lighter green, which could be indicative of variations in light exposure or inherent differences in pigmentation amongst the leaves. The lighting is soft and diffused, casting subtle shadows and enhancing the texture and natural patterns of the clover leaves. The overall composition fills the frame with dense, organic patterning, providing a textured, verdant vista that conveys a sense of lushness and tranquility.","title":"Clover leaves","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555067","555042","555041","543620","551356","558077","555040","554993","555049","557593","542688","555044","543565","555037","557539","547312"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leave","variation","difference","lushness","dew","vista","droplet","leaf","rain","exposure"]}
