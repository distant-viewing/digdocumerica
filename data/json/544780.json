{"path":"544780.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene dominated by a clear blue sky and a mountainous landscape. In the foreground, there is a prominent wooden utility pole with complex electrical wiring and insulators. Attached to this pole is a slightly weathered sign that reads \"PROPOSED ALBION BASIN CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX\" and includes additional details about the development alongside contact information for a certain Joseph S. Knowlton, highlighting his phone number.\n\nThe background showcases a majestic mountain covered with patches of snow and surrounded by lush green fields. The base of the mountain includes areas of bare soil and sparse vegetation, possibly indicating recent earth-moving or construction activity. The surrounding area is vibrant with wildflowers and grass, hinting at a rich natural ecosystem.\n\nThe composition draws attention to the contrast between the untouched natural beauty of the mountainous area and the impending human development indicated by the sign. The clear sunny day and the unobstructed views give the image a serene yet poignant quality, emphasizing the potential change coming to this peaceful landscape.","title":"Site of proposed condominium construction","placename":"Salt Lake City (Utah)","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","nn1":["557419","545050","544118","543641","547648","545746","543724","544816","557435","546407","552603","553669","553130","543637","557527","557726"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["pole","development","contact","phone","mountain","information","wildflower","come","ecosystem","change"]}
