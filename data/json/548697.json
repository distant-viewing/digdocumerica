{"path":"548697.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene with various activities and details. It appears to be a low tide scene given the wide stretch of exposed sandbank. There are several people and animals engaged in different activities:\n\n1. On the left side, one person is crouching near the water, possibly digging or playing in the sand. This person is wearing a brightly colored yellow shirt and red bottoms.\n\n2. Another individual is standing a bit further to the right, facing the sea, wearing green swimming trunks.\n\n3. Towards the middle and right side of the image, there are two dogs accompanying another person. This person and dogs seem to be exploring the wet sand or shallow water.\n\n4. Far in the background, on the water, there is a moving boat that adds a sense of depth and activity in the sea area.\n\n5. The horizon is clear, showcasing a calm sea that meets a blue sky scattered with light clouds.\n\nThe foreground is largely covered in sandy patches and shallow pools of water, reflecting the sky in some areas, which gives a natural mirror effect. The lighting suggests it might be midday or early afternoon. The overall mood is peaceful, highlighting a leisurely day at the beach with visitors enjoying the natural surroundings in a tranquil setting.","title":"Swimming","placename":"Marathon (Fla.)","location":"Marathon, Florida","nn1":["555402","547009","543072","543225","543395","547877","546397","546982","557507","545081","548695","543070","551931","550930","552341","553951"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["person","sea","dog","sand","sandbank","beach","crouch","tide","dig","swimming"]}
