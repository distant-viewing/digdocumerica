{"path":"544273.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a young individual seated in a casual pose on a boat. The person is wearing a sleeveless striped tank top paired with white pants, which are rolled up to the calf. The tank top is mainly white with narrow horizontal black stripes and a thin yellow trim around the neckline and armholes. One leg is bent with the foot resting on the edge of the seat, while the other leg is folded with the knee upright, supporting one arm that's casually resting on it. \n\nThe person appears to be barefoot and has medium-length dark hair. They have an engaged and expressive facial expression, seemingly in the middle of a conversation or reacting to someone or something off-camera. \n\nThe background shows part of the boat, including a window frame and a steering wheel, suggesting that the person is seated near the piloting area of the boat. The window frame is metallic and partly covered by curtains, and through it, a subdued light indicates either an overcast sky or a setting sun. The overall atmosphere is informal and slightly rugged, typical of a utilitarian boat environment.","title":"Member of shrimp fishing family","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["551309","544269","552869","557242","549331","543949","549373","551228","544199","551255","549363","547023","548527","554196","544973","545219"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","leg","seat","neckline","person","calf","tank","pilot","react","rest"]}
