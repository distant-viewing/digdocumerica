{"path":"558089.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a rural scene with multiple elements contributing to its country ambiance. It features a clear day with a few scattered clouds in the sky. In the foreground, there's a road intersecting with signs that indicate direction and provide local advertisements. On the left, a street sign reads \"AKRON PENINSULA\" and \"ROLAND RD.\" Similarly, thereâ€™s a stop sign next to it.\n\nThree people, possibly hikers or local travelers, are walking along the roadside, carrying backpacks and personal items, which suggests they might be engaged in recreational activities or coming from a nearby trail.\n\nTo the right, a prominent sign advertising \"Szalay's Sweet Corn,\" set against a backdrop of what appears to be a vast cornfield, stretches across the middle of the composition. This inclusion suggests the area is agriculturally active, specializing in corn production.\n\nFurther back, the terrain is filled with lush greenery and trees, typical of a temperate broadleaf forest. There are low-lying hills or ridges in the distance, emphasizing the rural and natural setting of the scene.","title":"Boy scouts hiking the cuyahoga trail which takes them along the edge of the bolanz and Akron-Peninsula road in northampton and Boston townships north of Akron, Ohio.
