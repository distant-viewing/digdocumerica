{"path":"548920.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a large dam and its surrounding infrastructure. The dam is a massive concrete structure arched across a narrow gorge, holding back a large body of water that extends into the distance, reflecting a vibrant blue color. This body of water is surrounded by rugged, brown mountain terrain typical of arid regions.\n\nDirectly downstream of the dam, there is a visible water outflow, and a series of infrastructure facilities, possibly for power generation, are situated adjacent to the dam. There are several large, rectangular buildings and extensive networks of electrical substations and high-voltage power lines, likely indicating the presence of a hydroelectric power plant.\n\nThe entire set-up is nestled in a barren landscape with minimal vegetation, emphasizing the harsh and rocky desert environment. The dam itself, due to its massive scale and the engineering complexity suggested by its visible features like spillways and control towers, stands out prominently. The curved roadways connecting different parts of the facility and the sparse navigable watercraft visible on the reservoir add human elements to what is primarily a scene dominated by engineering and natural geographical features.","title":"Parker dam on the Colorado river forms the eastern end of the 150-mile metropolitan aqueduct which supplies drinking water to Los Angeles and intermediate cities","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548938","548936","548927","548975","548003","548947","548013","548930","548915","548012","548007","549004","548008","544140","548020","548024"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","power","engineering","gorge","spillway","voltage","watercraft","reservoir","generation","infrastructure"]}
