{"path":"547196.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image features a close-up of a light-toned bird, most likely a pigeon, perched on a metal ledge that appears to be part of a larger structure, possibly a birdhouse or a fixture. The bird is facing slightly towards the right, showing part of its profile. Above and behind the bird, there is a deep blue sky that serves as the background, giving the scene a stark, high-contrast look.\n\nTo the left of the bird, there are two vertical poles extending upwards; the pole closest to the bird is relatively taller and thinner compared to the one further left. Additionally, two metallic rectangular flags are hanging from what seems to be a horizontal pole running along the top of the composition; one flag is quite close to the bird, and another is further to the left and looks slightly crumpled or folded over itself, both shimmering under a source of light possibly from above. These elements, combined with the dark sky, create a moody and somewhat mysterious atmosphere.","title":"Chickadee at bird feeder near bass lake","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["544547","557628","557204","547318","542919","555010","543266","548490","548885","544489","546618","544477","545995","553777","543595","548728"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","pole","flag","left","crumple","closest","ton","fold","upwards","ledge"]}
