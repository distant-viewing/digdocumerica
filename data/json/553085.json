{"path":"553085.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a serene wetland or tidal marsh area. The image depicts a body of water, reflecting a clear sky, peppered with numerous small, lush green islands or hummocks, dense with vegetation. It appears to be late afternoon or early evening judging by the soft lighting and calm water surface.\n\nTo the left foreground, there is a sign planted in the ground that reads \"NO BOATING NO FISHING / REFUGE LAGOON,\" indicating that this area is protected, likely for wildlife conservation. The edge of the water is bordered by grass and patches of exposed mud, suggesting varying water levels.\n\nIn the middle distance on the other side of the lagoon, a sand dune or raised sandy area stretches across the scene, which, along with the scattered vegetation, provides a subtle natural barrier to the horizon. The distant background shows what appears to be the further extension of this wetland environment, characterized by similar flora.\n\nOverall, the composition is tranquil, primarily dominated by the natural beauty and subtle tones of the marshland, with no visible human or animal activity at the moment of capture. The image conveys a sense of quiet isolation and untouched natural scenery.","title":"Water standing in flooded fields near fallon -- a result of over-irrigating and poor farming","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["547544","547500","547604","547589","547547","547532","550788","544773","550345","545008","544515","544506","554717","542525","553856","544765"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["wetland","lagoon","marshland","pepper","extension","dune","mud","human","conservation","island"]}
