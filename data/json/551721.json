{"path":"551721.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene focused on a group of people engaging in leisure activities in an urban park setting. The setting is rich with verdant trees that have matured and are lush with leaves, suggesting that it might be spring or summer.\n\nThe forefront of the image shows a dirt area where several individuals are playing baseball. The players, of various ages and presumably mixed genders, are casually dressed in typical relaxed outdoor attire such as jeans, t-shirts, and light jackets. One of the players is in the midst of pitching the ball, while another appears to be batting, and others are positioned as though ready for fielding.\n\nThe park itself is dotted with multiple benches where more people are seated, enjoying the day or watching the game. The park is bordered by a chain-link fence, beyond which a row of uniform brick residential buildings provides a backdrop, repeating the architectural style typical of certain urban neighborhoods. \n\nThis photograph documents an idyllic everyday moment in a community park, showcasing informal social interaction and recreational sports in a city environment.","title":"Boys in Washington square park, greenwich village, lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551768","552024","555947","556296","550074","550075","553903","551713","544808","551769","553065","553512","549318","551771","552036","557780"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["player","park","repeat","gender","ball","baseball","game","midst","pitch","t"]}
