{"path":"552873.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph is a close-up portrait of a middle-aged man. He is wearing a pair of dark sunglasses with a thick, somewhat translucent frame. The reflection in the sunglasses notably shows two figures, suggesting this picture might have been taken outdoors in a public setting. The man has well-combed, slicked-back dark hair and sports sideburns. He is dressed in a light shirt adorned with a detailed, paisley-like pattern, which is slightly open at the neck revealing part of his chest.\n\nThe background of the image is somewhat overexposed, mostly plain and appears bright, hinting that it was possibly a sunny day. The choice of close framing focuses attention on the subject's expression and attire, contributing to the overall vivid and detailed portrayal of his demeanor and style. The man's facial expression is relaxed and slightly smiling, suggesting a casual and comfortable moment caught on camera. \n\nThere is no distinct activity or other objects visible in the image beyond the subject and his immediate appearance. The overall composition highlights the subject's personality and style, evoking a sense of warmth and approachability.","title":"Lake Borgne oysterman","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["557144","556622","552872","551300","557056","556452","557034","557035","552871","547282","556147","556443","556149","547179","546105","548616"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["subject","sunglass","choice","chest","portrait","portrayal","expression","neck","warmth","framing"]}
