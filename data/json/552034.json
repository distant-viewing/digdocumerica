{"path":"552034.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, verdant park setting with two people sitting at a wooden picnic table, engaged in a conversation or activity involving a board game or similar item spread out on the table. The individuals, one male and one female, are focused on the game, and are casually dressed appropriate for a day in the park.\n\nThe background is a picturesque view showing a large body of water with what appears to be a waterfall, possibly a part of a river or a dam, flanked by lush trees on both sides. The waterfall creates a white, frothy appearance where the water descends, and it stands out against the greenery. The horizon is lined with more dense trees, and the overall tone of the scene is peaceful and natural.\n\nIn the foreground, the grass is a vibrant green and sparsely dotted with young trees and small bushes. The scene is bathed in soft, natural light, suggesting it might be late afternoon. The overall setting is tranquil, offering a sense of being away from urban hustle and enjoying a quiet moment in nature.","title":"Goat Island picnic grounds in the early evening.
