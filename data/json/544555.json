{"path":"544555.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This image portrays an aerial view of a water treatment facility surrounded by dense greenery. The plant is enclosed mostly by a road with patches of visible dirt areas that act as pathways or access points around the facility. Several rectangular and circular water treatment tanks are noticeable; these are organized in rows and seem to be in various stages of capacity. The facility includes multiple buildings within its confines, presumably used for operations and administration. One can see some parked cars and small trucks, indicating the presence of staff or visitors. Around the plant, the landscape is dominated by a thick forest, which isolates the facility from nearby urban areas, thereby emphasizing its secluded setting. Notable in the vicinity is a body of water adjacent to the road, adding a natural aquatic element to the scene.","title":"Aerojet general installation near the auhinga trail area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["543574","547239","547260","553837","548216","547262","547257","547252","549636","548151","546895","553900","543571","547681","543573","548212"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["facility","treatment","administration","confines","staff","capacity","trucks","plant","organize","road"]}
