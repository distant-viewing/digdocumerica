{"path":"550245.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image depicts a serene waterfront scene during a time that suggests either dawn or dusk, given the soft lighting and purple-pink tones in the sky. It captures a broad expanse of calm water that dominates the foreground, interrupted only by three narrow, floating barriers, one of which is labeled \"NO SWIMMING\" in bright yellow letters. \n\nOn the closest barrier to the viewer, two individuals are sitting, facing each other in a casual, relaxed pose. They appear to be engaging in conversation. The water itself is speckled with multiple sailboats; notably, one is more prominently visible, with its white sail standing out against the distant skyline.\n\nThe background features a faint, distant cityscape delineating the horizon. The silhouette of the city, including various buildings, is slightly hazed, which contributes to the tranquil and somewhat melancholic atmosphere of the photograph. The overall mood of the image is calm and reflective, underscored by the cool color palette and the stillness of the water.","title":"Lake erie is high, almost covering breakwater","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550758","551960","544669","543951","543885","543143","543119","552226","556190","547217","552263","543956","550240","550039","547595","543059"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["barrier","delineate","interrupt","speckle","swimming","sailboat","sail","stillness","letter","pose"]}
