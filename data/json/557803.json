{"path":"557803.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively street scene at a place called \"Old Street Shops.\" The image captures several people and the vibrant atmosphere of a shopping area. On the left side of the image, there's an older man seated, wearing a light yellow shirt and dark trousers, appearing somewhat contemplative as he looks towards the camera. Behind him is a white wall featuring a large sign listing various shops, like \"Hansel in Gretel candy store,\" \"Heidi's Tea Room,\" and more, suggesting a quaint, possibly European-themed shopping locale.\n\nThe right-hand side of the photo reveals the entrance to the actual shopping street, which is fairly narrow and decorated with various hanging signs of the shops named on the wall. A woman stands in the entrance clutching a white garment and is dressed in a stylish red top and wide-legged trousers; beside her are two young children, one wearing a striped top and one in a plaid shirt. The woman and children are possibly entering or exiting the street, which also has other visitors visible in the background, along with shopfronts and outdoor items on display.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a moment of everyday life, showing a diverse group of people engaged in the casual enjoyment of a shopping day in a charmingly themed marketplace. The atmosphere is casual and reflects a sense of community and leisure.","title":"Visitors to the fifth annual oktoberfest at helen pause on main street where a main street wall identifies shops to be found on old street (right background).
