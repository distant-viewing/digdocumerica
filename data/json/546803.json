{"path":"546803.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a riverbank, where several individuals are engaged in various activities. The image shows five people spaced along the rocky edge of the river. Each person is occupied differently: one is sitting and looking at a small object in his hands, two are bent over possibly collecting something from the ground or water, and two others appear to be engaged in conversation or observing something in their vicinity.\n\nThe setting is naturalistic with lush greenery in the background. Tall grass and dense foliage line the backside of the riverbank. The water is calm with light reflections visible on its surface, and the opposite bank of the river also shows similar characteristics of dense vegetation and a peaceful environment.\n\nIn the background, a bridge is partially visible, hinting at a structured environment nearby. The bridge and a hint of distant infrastructure suggest that this area is not far from a more urban setting. The overall ambiance of the scene is peaceful and reflective, portraying a moment of casual leisure or investigation by the river. The sky is overcast, giving a soft light and muted colors to the entire scene.","title":"Fishing along an inlet near Seneca Creek, northeast of Baltimore","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["551525","551499","558066","554475","551414","551538","546811","551423","550232","542647","545658","545734","551415","555376","551282","543943"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["riverbank","river","investigation","bridge","characteristic","collect","vicinity","bank","occupy","hint"]}
