{"path":"552480.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image depicts Christ's Bakery & Coffee Shop, a street-front business with a distinctive vintage appearance. The building is finished in white, featuring intricate classical detailing at its cornice and detailing around the windows and doors, which suggest a historical era of architecture. The business is clearly identified by a hanging sign above the entrance that reads \"CHRIST'S BAKERY & COFFEE SHOP\" in red and black letters on a white background.\n\nThe entrance displays a traditional wooden door, half-glazed with glass and a brass pull-handle. Positioned on either side of the door are large windows, also half-glazed, reflecting the sunlight and seemingly offering a peek into the interior. The fa√ßade at the base of the windows is adorned with a decorative, raised brick trim adding character to the structure. An exterior air conditioning unit can be seen affixed just below one of the windows.\n\nThe photograph captures a bright sunny day, evident from the shadows cast on the building and the clear blue sky barely visible at the top edge of the photo. The sidewalk in front is mostly empty, emphasizing the quiet and still moment in which the shot was taken. In this stillness, details like a manhole cover on the sidewalk contribute to the urban setting of the bakery. The overall ambiance suggests a serene street view with a nostalgic touch, reminiscent of a small-town business from an earlier time.","title":"Bakery in Princeville","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["549656","542901","557093","557156","543132","546440","545317","557643","558126","544144","557635","545339","552964","552479","558127","550110"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["business","door","window","entrance","sidewalk","conditioning","brass","cornice","handle","front"]}
