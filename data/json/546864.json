{"path":"546864.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph features a view across a body of water, which appears somewhat choppy, toward a distant industrial shoreline under overcast or foggy conditions. The muted, bluish-grey tones suggest either early morning or late evening light, contributing to an atmosphere of obscurity and mist.\n\nThe silhouette of the shoreline is dominated by several large industrial structures, including what seem to be cranes and possibly silos or storage units. These facilities are industrial with a functional architectural style, characterized by straight lines and no decorative elements. The skyline is low and horizontal, consistent with typical industrial port areas.\n\nThe water in the foreground shimmers subtly with reflections of light, suggesting some movement in the water, either from wind or nearby vessel activity. The overall composition and mood of the image convey a sense of quietude and solitude, emphasizing the isolation and functional nature of industrial spaces.","title":"Ships docked at Sparrows Point","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["551954","547667","546083","545979","546876","549300","544527","550937","552717","552249","543004","555731","547575","547147","550910","547702"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["shoreline","quietude","shimmer","silo","port","unit","vessel","mist","crane","skyline"]}
