{"path":"552075.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene featuring several old, worn-out tires repurposed as planters for green vegetation. The tires are scattered on what appears to be dry, sandy soil with sparse patches of grass and weeds around them. Each tire is partially buried into the ground, set horizontally, and filled with soil where various plants are growing. The plants look like small shrubs or perhaps young vegetable plants. The background is minimally visible but suggests a similar outdoor setting with an emphasis on these repurposed materials in a makeshift garden. Natural light, likely from the sun, highlights parts of the scene, casting shadows and illuminating the textured surfaces of the tires and plants. This photo conveys themes of recycling, environmental conservation, and innovative gardening practices.","title":"The greening of a junk pile. These discarded tires might have ended up littering a field or polluting a river. Instead, they have been salvaged by a Linwood farmer, who uses them to divide and support his tomato plants.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["552074","546022","542531","547517","543559","545029","557973","547986","555521","552111","547846","558257","552740","551440","549776","551621"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["tire","plant","soil","vegetable","planter","weed","gardening","recycling","conservation","practice"]}
