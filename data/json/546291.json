{"path":"546291.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man sitting seemingly inside a laboratory. He wears glasses and is dressed in a lab coat, which suggests he may be a scientist or researcher. The background is out of focus but shows racks of laboratory equipment, likely including test tubes or other scientific apparatus.\n\nThe lighting in the image casts a reddish tint over certain areas, particularly noticeable around the contours of the man’s face, glasses, and on parts of the background. This coloration could be from a filter used during the shooting of the photo or from the light sources in the room. The imagery provides a sense of a professional setting, where scientific or chemical research might be performed.\n\nThe focus is sharp on the man's face, capturing his serious facial expression which conveys a sense of deep concentration or contemplation. The way the objects in the foreground partially obscure and frame him adds a layer of texture and depth to the image. The overall composition uses the interplay of light, shadows, and the laboratory equipment to emphasize the subject’s professional environment and possibly his dedication or contribution to his field.","title":"Epa gulf coast water supply research laboratory at Dauphin Island: bio-chemistry lab.
