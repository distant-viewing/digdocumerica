{"path":"555555.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph depicts a modestly sized drainage ditch filled with muddy water, situated in an overgrown grassy area. The ditch, winding through the center of the image, is lined with abundant green vegetation, including grass and various wildflowers. Notably, there are white blooms scattered along the sides, which contrast strikingly against the dense greenery. Yellow flowering plants are also visible, adding a touch of color to the scene.\n\nThe immediate foreground shows a patch of disturbed, darker soil hosting sparse grass and some twigs. This part of the image suggests recent activity or disruption in the area, likely related to the maintenance or formation of the ditch. A red pipe or hose partially buried in the soil and grass intrudes into the frame from the bottom left, introducing a synthetic element to the otherwise natural setting.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of lush, albeit unkempt, natural growth surrounding a waterway, possibly indicative of a rural or semi-wild environment. The cloudy, subdued lighting contributes to the serene yet slightly somber mood of the scene.","title":"Storm drainage ditch near a Pennwalt Corporation chemical storage building, was dammed when chemicals spilled into it after the structure was desTroyed June 20, 1974.
