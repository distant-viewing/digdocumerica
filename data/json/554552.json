{"path":"554552.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image captures a serene lakeside scene dominated by nature and leisurely activity. In the foreground, a wooden dock stretches out into the lake, serving as the central platform for activity in the image. On this dock, there is a single individual, a young person wearing a red jacket, captured in motion as they either arrive at or prepare to leave the dock. The person holds a metal pot or pail in one hand, suggesting engagement in some type of outdoor or camping activity.\n\nOn the dock beside the individual, there is an aluminum boat, hinting at recreational boating or fishing. The boat hosts an outboard motor, indicating readiness for use. Also on the dock, close to the frame's right edge, are several metal canisters lined up, possibly containing fuel or water, arranged beside a red and white plaid fabric which might be a picnic blanket or jacket.\n\nThe background features an expansive lake, calm with a gentle ripple of water, surrounded by dense, green forested hills. A notable hill in the middle distance centers the background, under a sky filled with fluffy, mostly white clouds, suggesting a pleasant, partly sunny day. The overall mood conveyed is one of tranquil engagement with nature, possibly on a camping or fishing trip, at a time when the beauty of the surroundings is highlighted by mild weather and daylight.","title":"Petroleum products are a fact of life in the Adirondack Forest Preserve of New York State.
