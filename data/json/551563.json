{"path":"551563.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene involving a crane on a floating platform on a body of water, likely a river. Prominent in the foreground is the crane and its large arm extending vertically into the sky, surrounded by visible emissions of smoke. Positioned on a barge, the crane seems involved in some sort of construction or maintenance activity.\n\nIn the background various urban and industrial elements are visible. There is a bridge spanning the river, elevated on tall pillars, with light automobile traffic visible. Several other industrial or warehouse-like buildings crowd the farther shore, and the scene is set against a backdrop of a cloudy sky, tinged with hues of pink and purple, possibly indicating either early morning or late evening light.\n\nThe overall composition gives a glimpse into an industrial waterfront area, mingling elements of human activity with the natural environment, under an expansive sky. The photograph has a somewhat dated quality, suggested by the style of the vehicles on the bridge and the general tone and aesthetic, hinting at environmental concerns and industrial activities from a past era.","title":"Working dredge at Farmers Union grain terminal shrouded in smoke.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547113","555807","549308","545655","555796","546833","549800","542999","547579","547102","552015","548559","545858","547223","544268","555808"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["crane","bridge","mingle","tinge","involve","elevate","pillar","pink","barge","automobile"]}
