{"path":"547451.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures two people sailing a small boat. Both individuals are dressed in yellow t-shirts labeled \"YELLOW JACKET\" with dark shorts. The person in the foreground, a man with short dark hair, is wearing a yellow bucket hat and is actively engaged in handling the sailing equipment. Next to him, slightly in the background, is a woman with medium-length blonde hair, also focused on the task of sailing.\n\nThe boat appears compact and well-equipped for recreational sailing. The main sail is hoisted and fills a large portion of the frame on the left, with its white fabric and visible seams. In the background, the hazy atmosphere suggests either a misty or foggy day on the water, blurring the line between the sky and the sea.\n\nBoth sailors show a sense of concentration and perhaps teamwork in navigating or adjusting the sailboatâ€™s course, as they look upward, likely at the sail or the direction of the wind. The overall mood conveys a blend of leisure and active engagement in the sailing experience.","title":"On Chesapeake Bay, the crew of the Yellow Jacket, one of the smaller boats","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547466","548527","548517","549421","549387","549392","547455","549386","549423","548526","548514","549389","549406","548513","544029","547463"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailing","sail","sailor","hoist","boat","course","hair","teamwork","fabric","t"]}
