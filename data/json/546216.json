{"path":"546216.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a bustling market or grocery store from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s, judging by the style of clothing and overall ambiance. The setting is informal, with open fronts to the street, connecting the indoors seamlessly with the outside.\n\nWithin this market, various people are engaged in either shopping or assisting customers. On the left, there's a man wearing a pink polo shirt and sunglasses, closely observing or selecting items from an area that seems to be displaying packaged food and various other groceries. Behind the counter, a young woman with a white top and dark hair, likely an attendant, assists other customers, including a young girl who is barely visible behind the man in pink.\n\nTowards the center, another woman with long dark hair and wearing a red shirt is also facing the counter, possibly waiting to purchase her selection. Next to the food counters, there is a large freezer displaying more goods.\n\nOn the right side of the image, the space opens out, showing more of the interaction between people and the street outside. A group of men are engaged in conversation. Two men, one in a light brown suit and another in casual attire, are talking to each other while another man with a dark blue shirt is interacting with a merchant or fellow customer. This area also shows a glimpse of the outdoor street scene beyond the market.\n\nThroughout the space, shelves and racks are densely packed with an array of food products, showcasing the variety and abundance of items available. The ceiling overhead is simple, lined with bare rafters and fluorescent lighting, contributing to the everyday, utilitarian feel of the place. The floor shows some debris and dirt, indicating a busy day at the market.\n\nOverall, the image captures a lively, everyday scene of community and commerce, typical of the era, with people engaging casually in their routine of buying and selling in a local market setting.","title":"Campers stock up at the Garner State Park grocery store.","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["557763","550040","550064","551837","558249","557686","551838","557131","550041","550036","551749","555651","550045","551832","550320","551691"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["market","customer","counter","grocery","food","street","man","selection","attendant","outside"]}
