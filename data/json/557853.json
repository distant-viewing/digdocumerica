{"path":"557853.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts a vintage red car, possibly from the 1970s, parked in a garage or automobile inspection station. Two mechanics, both wearing blue work uniforms and black shoes, are busy examining the underside of the car. Both mechanics are lying on their backs, one by the rear wheels and the other closer to the middle of the vehicle, each reaching up towards the car's undercarriage. The driver of the car is visible through the rear window, appearing as an older individual wearing glasses and a cap.\n\nThe vehicle itself is a large sedan with notable chrome detailing and a design emblematic of 1970s American cars. The rear of the car displays a license plate marked \"9690 AA.\" The car is positioned on a designated inspection lane marked by yellow and black lines.\n\nThe background features simple garage elements like other inspection lanes, basic structural columns, and a semi-visible tree through a distant archway, suggesting the garage's open sides and offering a sense of the facility’s layout. There is also a visible electrical box and some equipment on the left side.\n\nThe lighting is artificial and direct, typical of such facilities, which helps in highlighting the central subjects—the car and the mechanics. The entire scene captures a moment of everyday work, focusing on vehicle maintenance and the interaction between the mechanics and the car they are inspecting.","title":"Public works department employees inspect the exhaust system for visible leaks at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio. All light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles in the city and Hamilton County must be checked annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. If the exhaust analyzer, left background, lights up it indicates the vehicle has failed the test. In that case, the owner is given a 30-day sticker in which time the vehicle must be repaired and retested.","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["542763","557850","557906","557860","557885","553490","557858","557905","557891","553491","557832","557833","557852","557915","557897","557864"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["mechanic","car","inspection","garage","lane","underside","vehicle","archway","license","facility"]}
