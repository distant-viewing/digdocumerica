{"path":"543008.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial night view of a cityscape punctuated by a dramatic weather phenomenon. The composition captures the dense, textured cloud cover above, glowing with hues of violet, pink, and gray, possibly indicating sunset or stormy weather conditions. Below the heavy clouds, streaks of lightning can be seen, creating a striking visual as they fork and illuminate parts of the clouds.\n\nThe city below is dotted with numerous lights, reflecting a bustling urban area. These lights form patterns along streets and illuminate areas likely to be dense with buildings, showing the typical grid-like layout of many cities. The view suggests this photo might have been taken from an aircraft flying over or near the city during this meteorological event.\n\nThe overall impression is one of dynamic contrast between the serene city lights and the turbulent skies above, offering a snapshot of nature's power juxtaposed against human habitation.","title":"Lumber town late in day","placename":"Scotia (Calif.)","location":"Scotia, California","nn1":["553821","550295","548384","548328","552252","555406","545255","543957","544119","544075","544086","557273","550291","543965","547429","545913"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","cloud","violet","phenomenon","streets","lights","stormy","streak","weather","fly"]}
