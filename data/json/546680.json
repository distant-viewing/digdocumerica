{"path":"546680.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph features a nighttime scene containing two men, likely involved in a conversation. The man on the left, who appears slightly anxious or curious, is of Middle-Eastern or South Asian descent. He has a prominent mustache and is wearing a striped, multicolored shirt. The man on the right is dressed in a security or police uniform, indicated by a badge and patches visible on his right shoulder, which suggests he is an officer or a guard. His attention is focused on something he is holding, possibly a piece of paper or documentation, which the first man seems to be observing as well.\n\nThe setting has a dimly lit ambiance, suggesting this interaction is happening at night or in a poorly lit indoor area. The background is blurred and comprises indistinct linear lights, possibly overhead fluorescent lights, that provide a stark contrast to the darkness surrounding these figures.\n\nThe mood is somewhat tense but also pensive, as the facial expressions and body language imply a serious exchange or inspection is taking place. This image might depict a routine check, possibly at a border, a security checkpoint, or an official facility, where the officer is possibly verifying the identity or documents of the civilian.","title":"Cab driver caught speeding talks himself out of a ticket.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546657","557868","542757","546663","546633","557907","556847","557037","546637","557910","557854","554444","557894","557872","557856","547412"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["security","officer","documentation","guard","descent","exchange","identity","man","happen","language"]}
