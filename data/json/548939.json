{"path":"548939.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a vibrant, dynamic scene along a river bank. At the heart of the image, the river itself is a vivid area of sparkling blues, reflecting sunlight in dazzling patterns. Cutting through these waters, a boat leaves a frothy, white wake as it speeds, indicating motion and activity. The patterns of the wake stretch across the water, suggesting a recent path traveled at high speed.\n\nSurrounding the river, the landscape is rugged and scenic. On one side, a neatly organized campground lines the shore. This area is populated with numerous vehicles and camping units, set in rows and shaded by trees, indicating a popular locale for outdoor recreation. Adjacent to this campsite, a road runs parallel to the river, also flanked by sparse, scrub-like vegetation and rugged terrain. \n\nThe background is dominated by a dramatic ridge of mountainous terrain, providing a stark, natural contrast to the serene waters of the river. The shadows cast by these mountains suggest the photograph was taken during a time when the sun was likely either rising or setting, enhancing the dramatic interplay of light and shadow. Overall, the image captures a bustling, yet picturesque slice of outdoor life, emphasizing movement, nature, and human interaction with the landscape.","title":"Boating on the Colorado River off Parker \"Strip\", a popular recreational spot below Parker Dam","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548935","548921","548916","551218","544749","548934","549458","551208","549088","548926","550524","542701","542700","549532","550542","548933"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","wake","speed","campsite","scrub","heart","locale","camping","recreation","ridge"]}
