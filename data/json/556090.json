{"path":"556090.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays a vibrant scene at a railway crossing during a sunny day with clear blue skies and a few clouds. The foreground prominently features a railroad crossing sign, marked prominently with \"RAILROAD CROSSING 2 TRACKS\". Attached to this sign are crossing gates and lights meant to warn of an approaching train.\n\nIn the background, a passenger train branded in a red, white, and blue color scheme is stationed with its doors open, possibly indicating passengers are boarding or disembarking. Next to the train, on the station platform and across the tracks, a number of people are visible. They appear to be passengers or bystanders, some standing and talking, while others are walking. Their casual attire suggests a relaxed, daytime setting, typical of travel or transit environments.\n\nAdditionally, a station building can be seen in the upper left, which adds to the context of a functional railway station. The overall composition of the photo, with its sharp focus on the crossing sign in the foreground and the active, colorful background, captures a slice of life at a busy rail station.","title":"The Empire Builder passenger train stopped at Fargo, North Dakota, enroute from Chicago to East Glacier Park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington. The Amtrak train was seven hours late because of a bridge washout. Amtrak is responsible for most U.S. intercity rail passenger service, but leases use of the tracks from the nation's railroads.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["558258","556063","556120","556126","556091","556767","548475","556100","555984","556026","548848","556902","556670","556846","556855","556768"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["crossing","station","passenger","train","railway","disembark","warn","mean","sign","gate"]}
