{"path":"556779.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a busy scene at a subway station. Several people are depicted, engaged in various activities typical of a transit environment. In the center of the image, a man with a visible afro and wearing a floral shirt appears to be stepping out from or walking towards a subway train. Directly across from him stands a woman in dark clothing, holding a white plastic bag and another colorful tote bag possibly containing groceries or personal items.\n\nTo the left of the image, an older man in a hat and suit looks at a newspaper, standing aside from the main flow of traffic. A woman in a blue dress holding a purse stands near him, seemingly waiting.\n\nOn the right, two men are engaged in their roles with the subway train; one, possibly a conductor, is partially visible inside the train at the door, while another, possibly an attendant, stands near the train, wearing a light uniform and hat, overseeing the passengers boarding or exiting.\n\nThe background features other passengers moving about, some heading towards the subway entrance, and others gathering near the platform. The overhead lighting casts reflections on the ceiling and illuminates the entire station area. The platform and train itself are typical of an older subway model, reflecting a mid-20th-century design, with metallic and sturdy construction apparent in the design of the subway cars.","title":"Passengers board a Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) train at the 30th Street Station in downtown Philadelphia.
