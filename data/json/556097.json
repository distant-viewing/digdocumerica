{"path":"556097.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts the interior of a train car with passengers engaging in various activities, mostly involving rest. The car is equipped with rows of seating, with the seats upholstered in blue and grey fabric. Each seat pair is separated by a small aisle, and additional overhead storage can be seen above the seats.\n\nOn the left side of the image, two passengers appear; an older woman wearing glasses and a floral shirt is reading a book, while in the next row a young woman and a child are sleeping, nestled together under an orange blanket with a paisley pattern. The next few rows show more passengers, some of whom are sleeping and others who are sitting quietly.\n\nOn the right side, a few rows back, a person wearing a white shirt and blue pants is spread out across the seat, seemingly asleep. Farther down the car, it's possible to see more passengers; one is sitting upright looking towards the aisle, while others rest or sleep.\n\nThe natural lighting from the train's windows illuminates the interior, creating a calm and subdued atmosphere typical of a journey where most passengers are resting. The passengers' relaxed and varied postures suggest a long or overnight travel scenario, indicating the train is likely in motion although the outside view indicates no specific location, just a fast-moving blur.","title":"Sleeping, scenery and reading occupy passenger car travelers on the Empire Builder enroute from Chicago to East Glacier Park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington. Amtrak is responsible for most U.S. intercity passenger train service. It has been working to improve facilities by using some methods employed by the airlines. A steady decline in train travel since the end of World War II has been reversed since the corporation took over in 1971.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["556062","555974","556834","556081","556833","556848","556095","556061","555977","556781","556656","556842","556117","556671","556094","556838"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["passenger","seat","aisle","row","train","interior","car","other","blur","seating"]}
