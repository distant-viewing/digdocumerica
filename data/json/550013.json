{"path":"550013.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures the industrial architecture of old brick buildings under a bright blue sky. The main focus is on two large, multi-storied buildings, likely former factories or warehouses, characterized by their elongated forms, numerous windows lining each floor, and red brick construction. These buildings are oriented such that one runs from the foreground to the background on the left side of the frame, while the other is positioned towards the right.\n\nIn the foreground on the right, there is a tall brick smokestack, a common feature of industrial sites, projecting upwards and partially obscuring part of the building behind it. The smokestack is attached to a structure with a visible slanted roof, hinting at a possible utility or maintenance function.\n\nThe sky above displays wispy, feather-like clouds, adding a bit of texture and contrast to the deep blue backdrop. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, indicated by the angle and the intensity of the sunlight which highlights the texture of the bricks and creates deep shadows in certain areas.\n\nOverall, the image showcases a scene devoid of people, focusing entirely on the architectural elements and industrial heritage depicted through these standing structures. The composition and elements suggest a narrative of past industrial activity, now quiet and possibly deserted.","title":"Waltham Watch Company factory.
