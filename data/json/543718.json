{"path":"543718.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a desolate and rugged landscape, likely depicting the aftermath of volcanic activity or the barren area of a mining site. In the foreground stands a solitary, dead tree with gnarled and bare branches, which strongly contrasts against the bleak background. The tree is positioned to the right side of the frame, and its stark, intricate structure enhances the scene's sense of desolation.\n\nThe background is dominated by large mounds of dark, rocky debris or lava, creating undulating hills that stretch across the scene. These mounds appear rough and are devoid of vegetation, suggesting an environment exposed to harsh conditions. A dirt road curves around the base of the mounds, enhancing the composition's depth and leading the eye through the landscape.\n\nThe sky, visible in the upper portion of the image, is overcast with grey clouds, casting an even light across the scene and contributing to the somber mood of the landscape.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of isolation and the stark beauty of a harsh, uninhabited environment.","title":"Peabody coal company strip mine","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543722","545747","543843","555103","543658","554780","546121","552551","546157","555207","554135","544019","555573","545534","544921","549119"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mound","lava","aftermath","desolation","undulate","mining","expose","landscape","portion","curve"]}
