{"path":"545492.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a residential backyard setting during daytime. A person is in the process of mowing the lawn using a red motorized lawn mower. We see the person from the rear, slightly angled to the side, wearing a pink T-shirt, gray pants, and black shoes. The individual's hair is black and short.\n\nThe yard itself features patchy and unevenly grown green grass. To the right of the person, there is a substantial metallic drum mounted on a pedestal, possibly used for burning trash or as a barbeque setup; clothes or rags are draped over it. Near this barrel, there are two trash can lids resting on the ground. Behind these objects, the siding of a house, painted in a faded blue-gray hue, is visible.\n\nIn the background, there is a tall wooden fence, partially in disrepair, with visible missing planks. Over the fence, smokestacks or industrial chimneys can be glimpsed, puffing smoke or steam into an otherwise clear sky, suggesting proximity to industrial or manufacturing facilities.\n\nThe overall scene juxtaposes a mundane domestic activity against a backdrop hinting at industrial activity, possibly pointing to broader environmental or social themes.","title":"Steel worker's yard. Red-orange smoke from the chimney in the background is characteristic of steel plant emissions. When the wind is right, smoke often penetrates the homes themselves.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["557698","555615","557289","551075","556177","547988","553889","550166","549298","552106","548442","550251","546437","558154","551058","545246"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["lawn","trash","person","fence","pedestal","lid","backyard","drum","barrel","disrepair"]}
