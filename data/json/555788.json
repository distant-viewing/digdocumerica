{"path":"555788.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a busy maritime area, suggesting a shipyard or naval base. It features several large ships, potentially military vessels, docked at various constructed jetties that extend into the water from a shoreline heavily built with infrastructure supporting maritime operations. The water has a dark red hue, possibly caused by the lighting or other environmental factors.\n\nTo the left, there is a small green landscape, likely an island or a separated part of the shore, which contrasts distinctly with the industrial appearance of the right area. Numerous smaller boats are scattered throughout the water, more densely packed near the docks. The overall scene is industrial and functional, focusing heavily on maritime operations, without recreational or residential areas visible in the immediate vicinity. The scale and organization of the ships along the docks emphasize a well-coordinated and significant operation, potentially of a military nature due to the size and type of vessels shown.","title":"Industrial contamination of the Arthur Kill River at Bayonne, New Jersey in the New York metropolitan area. Rivers in the region carry raw and partially digested sewage, and chemical and industrial wastes into the waters of the Bight. Accumulation of these wastes into the waters bordering the Bight present one of the most critical stresses to its environment.","placename":"Bayonne (N.J.)","location":"Bayonne, New Jersey","nn1":["556946","555806","546828","545830","552244","548346","551599","545845","552008","545147","555766","548127","552153","547998","544657","551990"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["ship","vessel","operation","dock","factor","shipyard","jetty","organization","island","vicinity"]}
