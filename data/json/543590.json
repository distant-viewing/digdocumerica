{"path":"543590.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil landscape during twilight or early dawn. In the foreground, silhouetted coniferous trees frame the view, adding depth and natural texture to the composition. The central focus of the image is a vast, serene lake that occupies the middle ground, reflecting a gentle gradation of light from the sky. Surrounding the lake, rolling hills and stretches of dense forest contribute to the sense of peaceful seclusion. In the distance, the horizon is punctuated by a range of mountains, which further enhances the layered effect of the landscape. The overall mood of the image is contemplative and calm, emphasized by the soft, muted color palette dominated by blues and purples, typical of twilight hours.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["554752","543604","543577","552336","557570","552142","554397","557000","550746","554405","557021","554760","552319","550777","557561","542994"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["twilight","gradation","lake","seclusion","stretch","purple","hour","dawn","range","palette"]}
