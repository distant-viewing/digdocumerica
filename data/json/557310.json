{"path":"557310.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a simple and moody composition, consisting of a significant contrast between the silhouetted foreground and the bright, overcast sky. The main focus in the foreground is a silhouette of an object resembling a weather vane or anemometer, comprising multiple cups or blades designed to spin in the wind, which is perched atop what appears to be a simple, flat roofline. This object is centrally positioned in the lower third of the image, underlined by the dark, straight horizon of the roof against the vast backdrop of the sky.\n\nThe sky itself occupies the majority of the frame and is suffused with soft light, suggesting either a foggy or cloudy day. The light diffusion creates a pale glow with subtle variations in brightness and hue. There are no distinguishable clouds or sun, just a gradient of light that fades from a brighter center to darker edges, lending the scene a somewhat ethereal or hazy quality.\n\nOverall, the composition plays with elements of minimalism and suggests themes of solitude and the interaction between man-made structures and natural phenomena.","title":"An anemometer on the roof of the solar heating demonstration project.
