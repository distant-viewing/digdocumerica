{"path":"544654.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a large-scale construction or industrial site, likely related to road building or canal excavation. The image shows a long, straight trench or canal that stretches across the frame, filled partially with water and surrounded by extensive dirt work. The canal, central to the image, cuts through a vast landscape that appears to be a mixture of forested areas and cleared land.\n\nOn the right side of the canal, a significant amount of soil has been piled up, forming a long embankment. The left side also has an embankment but with less height compared to the right. Within the canal, toward the heart of the image, there is heavy machinery, possibly a crane, that seems to be used for dredging or moving earth.\n\nThe surrounding environment is a flat, forested terrain, stretching into the distance under a hazy sky. There are patches of standing water and muddy conditions around the canal, indicative of recent excavation or rainfall. Overall, the scene captures an intense phase of construction with a significant alteration to the natural landscape, highlighting the scale and impact of industrial activities.","title":"New drainage ditches for home sites","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544282","545858","547225","551187","552814","547177","555559","545846","548896","544438","553379","553453","547948","548775","545888","554546"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["canal","embankment","excavation","dredging","phase","trench","heart","construction","alteration","scale"]}
