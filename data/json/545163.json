{"path":"545163.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a scene inside a laboratory or technical facility. There is a man standing to the right of the frame, focused on writing notes on a clipboard. He is dressed in a bright, patterned orange shirt and dark trousers. The room has a utilitarian look, with plain walls and visible conduits and wires.\n\nThe central object of interest in the image is a large, cylindrical apparatus, which extends along the center of the table. This device is covered with transparent material that allows visibility into the interior, where a rat can be seen. The apparatus seems to be part of an experiment or a process being studied or monitored, given the setup and the observation by the man.\n\nTo the left of the cylindrical device, there's a bulky black component that could be part of the operational mechanism of the apparatus. The table on which these elements are placed is sturdy and metallic, supporting various other pieces of equipment, which include gauges, dials, and other adjustment tools.\n\nOverall, the environment suggests a scientific or research-based setting with the focus on studying or testing using the mentioned apparatus. The mood is serious and professional, indicative of a focused scientific inquiry or experiment in progress.","title":"U.s.
