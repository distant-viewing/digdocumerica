{"path":"555571.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photography presents a scenic rural landscape dominated by a field and a rustic red barn. The barn is located slightly right from the center of the frame, surrounded by dense vegetation and a few trees. Its siding is visibly weathered, and a portion of its roof appears to be metal, reflecting a faded red hue similar to its walls. The structure suggests functionality as it features windows, some of which are ajar, and a large door that is closed.\n\nThe middle ground is composed of a wild meadow brimming with various types of tall grasses and wildflowers, predominantly white and yellow in color, creating a textured appearance to the field. In the foreground, the tall grasses and wildflowers appear more prominent and denser, adding depth and layering to the image.\n\nThe background reveals a barren and expansive hilly landscape that rises softly beneath a clear, blue sky. The hills are devoid of vegetation and display an earthy brown color, contrasting starkly with the lush greenery in the middle ground surrounding the barn and the vivid blue of the sky.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a serene and isolated environment, highlighting the contrast between the cultivated land with the barn and the wild, open spaces around it. The picture is likely taken during daylight, given the brightness and the shadows, indicating a time of calm, under the vastness of a clear sky.","title":"Coal companies have strip mined right up to the edge of this abandoned farmstead on route #100","placename":"Morristown (Belmont County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["555577","552462","547128","549237","552537","547305","556963","547307","550019","547304","554782","557946","547291","557991","557183","552515"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","weathered","cultivate","wildflower","meadow","wildflowers","denser","faded","field","brim"]}
