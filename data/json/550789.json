{"path":"550789.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a serene swamp or marshland at dusk or dawn, as indicated by the subdued and dim natural lighting. The view is expansive, showing a large body of standing water that reflects some of the light in its gently rippling surface. Scattered throughout the water are numerous tree stumps and remnants of trees, some taller than others, which create a somewhat eerie yet peaceful atmosphere. These wooden remnants are in various states of decay and have different shapes, adding to the visual texture of the scene.\n\nSmall islands of vegetation, perhaps clusters of water plants or small bushes, emerge sporadically from the water's surface around some of the stumps, suggesting this wetland supports some life forms resistant to waterlogged conditions. The background is dominated by a dense forest line that appears dark against the lighter sky, contributing to the overall silhouetted effect seen in the details of the foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition utilizes the interplay of natural light, water, and remnants of forest life to convey a quiet and mystic wilderness scene, typical of wetlands at transitional times of day. The overall mood is calm and reflective, with a touch of solemnity due to the dark tones and still water.","title":"River flowage (an overflowing onto adjacent land) is a result of destruction of forest cover--in this case by reckless lumbering practices of the 19th century.
