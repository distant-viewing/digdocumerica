{"path":"543877.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene focused primarily on water-based activities. In the foreground, a discarded Coca-Cola can is prominently displayed, partially submerged and surrounded by frothy water waves, highlighting an environmental perspective by showing litter within a natural setting. The can is slightly rusted and weather-worn, bobbing close to the camera lens, suggesting it might have been in the water for some time.\n\nIn the middle ground, a person paddling a kayak is visible. The individual, wearing a red life vest, is partially blurred and appears actively engaged in navigating the kayak through the water. The presence of the kayak and the paddler suggests recreational activities typical of a river or lake environment.\n\nThe background features a calm and idyllic setting with a line of lush greenery that could be trees lining the far shore of the body of water. This provides a natural and serene backdrop, contrasting with the man-made litter in the foreground. The water itself has a reddish-brown tint, possibly indicating sediment or reflections from the environment around.\n\nThis composition cleverly juxtaposes the enjoyment and recreation associated with natural water bodies against the environmental issue of pollution, highlighted by the presence of the soft drink can in an otherwise pristine natural setting.","title":"Litter left in the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["557734","550806","543302","550812","552100","552080","552099","550805","550811","552126","550687","550807","547524","547525","552936","549820"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["kayak","litter","water","lens","tint","drink","recreation","vest","can","sediment"]}
