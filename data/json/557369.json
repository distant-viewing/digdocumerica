{"path":"557369.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph captures a heartwarming moment between an elderly man and a baby. The elderly man is on the left side of the image, holding the baby close to his chest. He appears to be in his 60s or 70s, with prominent wrinkles and grey hair. He wears rounded glasses and a lightweight, light-colored shirt. His expression is gentle and affectionate as he looks directly at the camera with a faint smile.\n\nThe baby, held securely in the man's arms, looks to the side with a slightly furrowed brow, suggesting curiosity or a moment of contemplation. The baby is dressed in a pastel-striped, sleeveless outfit, suitable for warm weather.\n\nThe background suggests a residential setting with a rustic charm, featuring a dark wooden door partially visible on the left and a stone wall on the right, lending an old-fashioned and sturdy look to the surroundings. The focus remains on the interaction between the man and the baby, conveying a sense of protection, family bonding, and generational connection. The overall mood is tender and serene.","title":"Ernest Watkins proudly holds one of his gRandchildren at the new family home. The Watkins were forced to move from their house in the Mulkey Square area of Kansas City, Missouri; (across town) when their dwelling was condemned for a highway project. The new home is larger and cleaner, and Watkins likes it because it has gas heating throughout instead of an oil burning stove in one room of the old place.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["543866","556527","558186","557368","553094","556294","557355","556146","553533","552931","558314","558405","556233","551807","547410","556144"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["baby","bonding","60","wrinkle","70","man","chest","protection","curiosity","smile"]}
