{"path":"554588.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts a single large pine tree under a clear blue sky. The tree stands prominently in the frame, with its trunk leaning slightly to the left. Its bark is rough and dark, indicating some mature age. Branches emerge from the main trunk at various angles, some stretching upward while others project outward or slightly downward, across the frame. These branches are dense with dark green pine needles, giving the tree a lush, full appearance.\n\nThe background sky is smooth and evenly lit in a soft blue, indicating either an early morning or a late afternoon with no visible clouds. The light emphasizes the silhouette of the pine tree, highlighting details such as the rugged texture of the bark and the individual groups of needles.\n\nThere are no other visible objects or activities in the photograph, focusing all attention on the natural beauty and structural details of the pine tree. The simplicity of the background enhances the natural aesthetic of the tree.","title":"Top of virgin white pine (Pinus strobus), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549246","542927","543448","548685","548687","543488","549226","550792","544921","554988","545292","555091","555119","549248","543016","555123"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["pine","needle","bark","trunk","tree","branch","emerge","project","detail","simplicity"]}
