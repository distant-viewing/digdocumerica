{"path":"544846.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures an American Avocet in flight against a clear blue sky. The bird is angled from a sidewards perspective, allowing for a clear view of its features, including its long, thin, upturned bill and distinctive black and white markings on its wings. Its head and neck show a pale rust color, which contrasts sharply with its otherwise white body. The Avocetâ€™s legs stretch out behind it, aligning with its aerial posture, and its wings are downward in mid-flap, showing movement. The blue background is uniform and unobstructed, emphasizing the bird's solitary flight and the grace of its form.","title":"Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Area on east shore of Great Salt Lake.
