{"path":"548495.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This image captures a lively, outdoor scene focused on recreational sailing. A white sailboat, labeled \"STINKER TOO AYC\" on its stern, sails through water under the power of a full, white mainsail and a partially visible green Genoa or jib. The sailboat is occupied by several individuals:\n\n- Four people are visible seated or standing in the cockpit of the boat. At the stern, one man stands commandingly, wearing sunglasses and a dark shirt, while another, sitting, appears shirtless and is turning to look behind the boat. Two women are also visible, seated closer to the middle of the cockpit, casually dressed for a day on the water.\n  \n- In the foreground of the image, a person is swimming in the water, suggesting a relaxed, recreational atmosphere. Their right hand is raised out of the water in a waving or swimming motion, and their head and shoulders are visible above the waterline.\n\nThe background includes a glimpse of other boats, hinting that this scene might be set in a popular sailing area or during a regatta. The water is relatively calm, with small waves indicating a gentle breeze - optimal conditions for sailing. The general mood is one of leisure and enjoyment, typical of a day spent on the water among friends or family.","title":"Underway in chesapeake bay.
