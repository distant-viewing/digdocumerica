{"path":"543121.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features an industrial close-up of a large, robust mechanical gear system, presumably part of a larger machine. At the center of the composition is a large cylindrical gear with interlocking teeth visible, which implies its function in rotational or torque-transferring mechanical actions. Flanking the central gear on both sides are massive spools or reels encased in what could be metal supports with riveted joints, suggesting a possible role in handling heavy loads or functioning as part of a cable or pulley system.\n\nThe gear and associated machinery exhibit signs of wear and exposure, such as rust and discoloration, indicating age and prolonged use in an outdoor environment or under harsh conditions. The background is blurred and nondescript, focusing the viewer's attention primarily on the detailed textures and formidable presence of the mechanical components. The lighting is direct, casting shadows that enhance the three-dimensional form of the gears and metalwork, suggesting that the photograph was taken during the day under natural light. The composition of the photograph emphasizes the gritty, textured nature of industrial machinery, highlighting its complexity and enduring functionality.","title":"Machinery in Bodie state historical park","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["546888","546932","555954","547964","556388","558365","554429","549125","543997","542545","546757","553986","556386","543158","553987","556321"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["gear","function","system","prolonge","metalwork","reel","tooth","encase","discoloration","machinery"]}
