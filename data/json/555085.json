{"path":"555085.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image portrays an aerial view of a heavily forested area showing evidence of logging activities. The majority of the photograph shows a vast expanse of land from which trees have been cleared, revealing dark, textured soil or possibly ground vegetation. The patterns on the ground, characterized by curved and linear marks, indicate the paths taken by logging machinery, possibly for extracting logs or clearing space.\n\nAmidst the cleared area, a single, relatively small clump of trees remains standing. This clump is bright green, contrasting sharply against the darker hues of the cleared ground, and is distinctly isolated from any other forested patches, which adds a sense of vulnerability or resilience of nature amidst human activity.\n\nThe background predominantly features the cleared, dark textured terrain, while the very edge of the photo displays dense, uncut forest, implying the extent of the original woodland before the logging began. The overall composition of the image, with its stark contrast between the green foliage and the impacted soil, vividly captures the environmental impact of logging practices on a forest ecosystem.","title":"Hemlock seedling in a burned clear-cut area of Olympic National Timberland, Washington.
