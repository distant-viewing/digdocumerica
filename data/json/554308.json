{"path":"554308.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph features an urban setting, likely in a large city evident from the tall buildings lining the street. The image captures a scene on a busy street with various elements of city life.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is seen carrying a large traffic light signal on his shoulder. The traffic light has multiple sections, typically indicating stop and go signals, and a green light is visible, suggesting the light is in working order. The man appears to be exerting effort, highlighted by his posture bending slightly under the weight of the traffic light. He is dressed casually in a navy T-shirt and black trousers, with practical shoes. His outfit and activity suggest he might be a city worker engaged in maintenance.\n\nThe street itself is filled with motion, visible from the moving cars and a yellow taxi, typical of New York City scenes, hinting at the image possibly being taken there. The pavement is partly visible with some urban wear and tear, and there are markings on the road.\n\nIn the background, the setting is dominated by tall corporate buildings with a hint of overcast sky, giving a typical metropolitan feel. There is minimal human presence except for the main subject and partially visible vehicles which include a red bus further adding to the city's bustling nature.\n\nOverall, this photograph depicts a moment of urban maintenance and daily life within a cityscape framework, providing a glimpse into the infrastructure and regular activities that support city functioning.","title":"Worker moves traffic light at sixth avenue and 47th street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549874","548373","557276","549849","553845","546743","555782","557256","548410","547666","554314","549886","549867","547240","557278","551478"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["city","traffic","signal","street","maintenance","taxi","navy","light","weight","tear"]}
