{"path":"546636.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an adult male sitting down, facing the camera with a slight, unsmiling expression. He appears middle-aged and has a rugged appearance with prominent facial lines, a noticeable five o'clock shadow, and deep-set eyes. His dark, somewhat greasy hair is slicked back, and his face shows signs of fatigue or sternness.\n\nHe is wearing a dark blue mechanic’s shirt with rolled-up sleeves and a couple of visible pens tucked into a shirt pocket, suggesting he might be a worker or involved in some kind of physical labor. His hands are clasped together, resting on his thighs, and they appear dirty or greasy, which further supports the idea of manual labor.\n\nThe setting includes a blurred background that features a structure with large, square, garage-like windows and white pillars, possibly indicating a commercial or industrial setting like a garage or workshop.\n\nOverall, the image has a candid and somewhat melancholic quality, capturing a moment of rest or pause in the man's day, set against the backdrop of his work environment. The photograph’s composition focuses tightly on the subject, using depth of field to blur the background and highlight the details of the man's expression and attire.","title":"Top mechanic at \"Call Carl\" computerized auto service center.
