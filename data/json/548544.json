{"path":"548544.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid street scene likely from the late 20th century, featuring a colorful food truck and several people in a casual, sunny outdoor setting. \n\nThe central focus of the image is a bright yellow food truck with text advertising various items such as \"KEY LIME FLOAT TRY IT!!,\" \"POOR BOY,\" \"COLD DRINKS,\" \"KEY LIME ADE,\" \"FRUIT JUICES,\" and \"ICE CREAM.\" Each side of the truck displays these offerings in bold, black letters that stand out against the yellow background. Cute smiley faces are drawn next to some of the text, adding a playful touch.\n\nIn front of the truck, three individuals are engaged in different activities. To the left, two women stand at the service window of the truck. One, facing away and wearing a white dress, seems to be ordering or picking up an item. The other, in a light blue outfit with her back partially turned, appears to be waiting or also interacting with the vendor inside. To the right, a man in a white shirt and dark shorts, wearing a straw hat and sunglasses, is walking by, glancing towards the truck.\n\nA large vintage car, possibly a luxury sedan from the 1970s, is parked to the left of the frame. Its rich brown color and sizable grille add a sense of the period's automobile design.\n\nThe background features a view of a calm blue water body, hinting at a lakeside or coastal setting. Further enriching the scene are hints of residential buildings on the far shore, nestled among lush greenery under a clear sky.\n\nThis scene not only captures a moment of leisure and refreshment but also reflects a slice of social and cultural life from its time, emphasizing casual public interactions and the popularity of street-based food service.","title":"On the public beach pier","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548540","554187","547855","558136","554482","551731","556538","542803","550128","554495","554708","549866","548275","551513","547814","544329"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["truck","food","service","text","popularity","luxury","refreshment","try","glance","offering"]}
