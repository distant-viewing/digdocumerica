{"path":"542798.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a breathtaking early morning or evening landscape view. In the foreground, the densely built urban area gradually transitions into a mystical sea of fog that blankets a large expanse, possibly a bay. Two prominent towers of a large suspension bridge rise above the fog, hinting at a significant architectural structure like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. \n\nThe background reveals a sequence of mountain ranges layered one behind the other, further enhancing the depth of the scene. These mountains, along with the sky above, are washed in a palette of soft pinks and blues, indicating the low light conditions typical of sunrise or sunset. The interplay between the fog, the lighting, and the natural and manmade structures creates a serene and almost surreal atmosphere.\n\nThe overall composition and the interplay of natural light, fog, and landscape elements make the image visually striking and evocative.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542807","543050","542804","548335","544713","545012","557575","545022","555131","554647","555126","548339","548415","555536","557519","542923"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["fog","interplay","sequence","suspension","mountain","pink","sunrise","bay","sunset","rise"]}
