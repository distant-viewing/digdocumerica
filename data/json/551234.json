{"path":"551234.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a nighttime scene with several visual elements against a dark blue sky, which gradually blends into black towards the top and corners of the image. The primary source of light comes from a crescent moon positioned in the upper left quadrant, casting a gentle glow and accompanied by a faint star visible nearby. To the right of the moon, obscured partially by dark, silhouetted cloud formations, is a neon sign that reads \"Pizza Barn\" in stylish lettering within an outlined frame. The sign is colorful with red and green text on a white or light-colored background, possibly illuminated from behind to catch the viewer's eye against the night sky.\n\nThe background shows a hint of trees and other vegetation that appear as dark silhouettes due to the low light levels. There's also a gentle bluish tint possibly from twilight or the moonlight softly illuminating the sky and casting shadows across the scene. The atmosphere created is one of a calm and slightly mysterious evening where the artificial brightness of a neon sign contrasts with the natural luminescence of the night sky.","title":"Moon rises over pizza sign","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["544870","557611","554963","557579","557603","542894","545347","551239","554644","544005","551322","547393","544119","544123","549060","551321"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["moon","neon","night","quadrant","sign","tint","black","star","lettering","brightness"]}
