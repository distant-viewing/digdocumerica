{"path":"554435.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely at a processing or manufacturing plant. The image is focused on various machinery and infrastructures characteristic of heavy industry.\n\nKey components of the photograph include:\n\n1. **Cranes and Machinery**: To the left, there's a large black crane towering into the sky, used for heavy lifting and moving large objects. In the foreground, there is another piece of machinery which appears to be a vehicle, possibly an excavator or heavy-duty truck.\n\n2. **Conveyor Systems**: Prominently featured is a metallic conveyor belt system which rises from the ground at an angle before leveling off. It seems to be transferring materials from one part of the plant to another.\n\n3. **Industrial Buildings**: There are metallic, industrial buildings with large walls and rooftops, possibly housing machinery or storing materials. The roofs are slanted, likely for efficient drainage.\n\n4. **Smokestack**: Emitting white smoke against the dark, cloudy sky is a tall smokestack, indicating ongoing industrial processes.\n\n5. **Logs and Debris**: In the lower part of the photograph, there are scattered logs and debris, which might be related to the plant's operations or could be leftover from construction or processing activities.\n\n6. **Lighting and Poles**: To the right, there is a tall pole equipped with multiple lights, suggesting that the facility operates during night hours as well.\n\nThe overall scene captures an active, functioning industrial setting, primarily focused on the processing or manufacturing of materials. The gray, overcast sky adds a moody ambiance to the industrial environment. This could suggest a location that experiences frequent inclement weather, which might impact the operation schedules and procedures of the facility.","title":"The new International Paper Company mill at Ticonderoga cost $90 million, is highly automated, and contributes less to the pollution of Lake Champlain (background) than the mill it replaces.","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["547010","542999","544048","557294","556501","547223","555761","550982","545992","544169","546191","547528","557305","546055","556401","546236"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["processing","machinery","manufacturing","log","material","plant","lifting","schedule","procedure","drainage"]}
