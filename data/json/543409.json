{"path":"543409.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features the exterior of the \"Monterey Boat Works\" building, which is a large wooden structure with a gently sloped roof. The name of the business is prominently painted in large, block letters along the curve of the roof, easily standing out against the building's worn wooden facade. The building has a large, closed wooden double door that is painted in a light color, matching the rest of the structure.\n\nIn front of the building, there are several boats visible, which are presumably under repair or maintenance. The boats are on stilts or support structures, suggesting that this area is used for boat storage and servicing. The boat in the foreground has a white hull with a dark stripe and features a cabin area. Its sail is down, and it has various gear and lines visible, which adds to the busy, industrial feel of the scene.\n\nThe surroundings of the boatyard are cluttered with pieces of wood, tools, and other equipment scattered around the ground, depicting a working, active maintenance area. The light in the photograph is warm, indicating either early morning or late afternoon sunlight, casting deep shadows and highlighting the textures of the wood and other materials in the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of practical activity and maritime industry, reflective of a working boatyard. The image captures a part of maritime culture focused on the craftsmanship and maintenance of boats.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["547012","546802","547941","543035","547955","548543","548229","542873","542914","548235","545005","545155","546939","542912","542911","550293"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","maintenance","wood","stilt","craftsmanship","maritime","repair","building","roof","culture"]}
