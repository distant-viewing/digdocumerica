{"path":"552943.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a young girl closely examining a large starfish, which she is holding in her hands. The starfish is prominently displayed across the frame, taking up the central foreground with its pinkish color contrasted against the girl's bright red sweater. The girl has long blonde hair and appears very intrigued or possibly delighted by the sea creature, as indicated by her attentive gaze and partially open mouth.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, another part of a person's body is visible, likely an adult helping the girl to hold or examine the starfish. This individual's hand supports the underside of the starfish.\n\nThe setting appears to be outdoor with natural sunlight illuminating the scene. The background is softly blurred with hints of greenery and small yellow flowers, suggesting this encounter may be taking place in a natural or possibly a controlled educational setting like an aquarium or marine study center, where children can learn about marine life.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the interaction between the child and the marine animal, highlighting a moment of learning and fascination. The close-up view enhances the emotional and educational aspect of the image.","title":"Open house at Hopkins Marine Institute (Stanford University) (from the Documerica-1 exhibition.
