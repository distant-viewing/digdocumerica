{"path":"543189.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of several fish with distinct, textured scales predominantly covering the frame. The fish scales are iridescent, glimmering with a mix of dark and light hues, primarily in shades of blue and black, exhibiting a high level of detail in their patterns. Some scales have a more jagged, aggressive texture, while others appear smoother.\n\nAmong the fish, different objects and debris are visible, including what looks like small twigs, leaves, and miscellaneous detritus that might have been collected along with the fish or in their natural habitat. Notably, thereâ€™s a prominent circular object that appears to be a rusted bottle cap, introducing a human element to the scene and suggesting environmental impact or pollution. \n\nThe lighting in the photograph accentuates the wet surfaces of the fish and the objects, creating reflections and enhancing the intricate details of the textures. The overall composition is tightly framed, focusing on the textures and forms rather than the broader setting, which remains indistinct and out of focus in the background. The photograph likely aims to draw attention to the natural beauty and diversity of aquatic life while also commenting subtly on ecological concerns through the inclusion of discarded items.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543901","548713","545169","542892","545063","545165","550878","546185","551597","545161","546313","546138","546792","546784","546319","553878"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","scale","object","detritus","texture","inclusion","twig","diversity","bottle","concern"]}
