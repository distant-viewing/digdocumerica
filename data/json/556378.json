{"path":"556378.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image captures a scene set in a dimly lit television studio environment. On the left part of the photo, behind a large glass window, a young woman is handling a camera, aiming it towards the interior of the studio. She wears a short-sleeved dress and her hair is styled long and straight.\n\nIn the main studio area, a man dressed in a light-colored, long-sleeved shirt and dark trousers is engaged in setting up or adjusting equipment related to television production. The room is equipped with several cameras on tripods and other broadcasting equipment. There are wires visible on the floor, and lights are set up overhead to provide adequate illumination for filming.\n\nTo the left foreground of the picture, there are two monitors facing outward from the window through which the scene is viewed. These monitors display a man wearing glasses, suggesting a live feed or playback from the studio's recording. The surrounding decor is simple with plain walls, a thick curtain at the back of the studio, and commercial carpeting. The vibe seems focused and professional, typical of a broadcasting environment.","title":"Modern television studio owned by the Island Creek Coal Company near Richlands, Virginia, which is used in training miners before going underground for the first time.
