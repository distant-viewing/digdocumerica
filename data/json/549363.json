{"path":"549363.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures an oceanic scene involving two men aboard a sailboat. One of the men sits on the edge of the boat, slightly leaning over as he holds onto a rope dipped into the water, seemingly engaged in adjusting or playing with it. He is shirtless, with curly dark hair and white pants, covering his nose and mouth with one hand, perhaps shielding himself from the sun or wind. His demeanor appears casual and relaxed.\n\nThe other man is more in the background, standing near what appears to be the boatâ€™s cabin entrance. He is also shirtless and wearing dark sunglasses, looking off to the side, possibly monitoring the surroundings or watching the horizon.\n\nThe setting is broad daylight with a clear sky, suggesting good weather for sailing. The water around the boat is calm, with light ripples, and a vast open ocean extends to the horizon line. The sailboat itself is mostly in shadow inside the frame, with sunlit highlights reflecting off the sleek, dark hull and some deck fittings.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is one of leisure and sport, possibly during a sailing trip or a day out on the water, with a sense of freedom and tranquility emanating from the open sea setting.","title":"Scientist works on board the research ship, the Vila Velebita II.
