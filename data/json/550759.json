{"path":"550759.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph captures an urban outdoor plaza bustling with activity. The plaza features large open spaces with multiple levels of terraced seating areas made of concrete and red brick pavers. People of various ages are scattered throughout the area, engaging in different activities: some are sitting and conversing, others are walking, and a few appear to be resting or sunbathing.\n\nThe architecture surrounding the plaza is dominated by imposing, modern-style office buildings with a geometric layout, characterized by horizontal windows and flat roofs. The building directly next to the plaza is especially striking with its multi-storied, grid-like facade.\n\nIn the background, there are further indications of an urban skyline, including distant high-rise buildings and two slim, tall columns or towers. The sky overhead is bright and partly cloudy, suggesting a pleasant, sunny day.\n\nAdditionally, the plaza is adorned with neatly arranged flower beds, adding dashes of vibrant color (notably red) to the predominantly gray and red environment. The presence of spherical lamps mounted on poles suggests that the area is well-lit during nighttime. Overall, the atmosphere seems lively yet relaxed, typical of a communal urban space frequented by locals and visitors alike.","title":"City Hall Plaza","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553324","550003","550751","549999","557267","551651","553162","550755","551792","551653","551636","553320","551800","557261","551656","549988"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Transportation Hubs"],"terms":["plaza","sunbathing","local","indication","nighttime","overhead","seating","bed","space","lamp"]}
