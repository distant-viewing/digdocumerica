{"path":"547904.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a striking visual at what appears to be the end of a road or path by a water body. In the foreground, there is a large yellow diamond-shaped sign displaying the word \"END\" in bold, uppercase, black letters. This sign is mounted on a black pole that's slightly tilted. A rope is tied around the middle of the pole, and the sign itself shows signs of wear and minor vandalism.\n\nBelow this main sign, there is a second duplicate \"END\" sign, also showing signs of wear and distress, the paint faded or chipped in places. This lower sign is affixed to a guardrail system that includes both a horizontal steel beam supported by vertical beams. Both of these beams are similarly rusty and weathered.\n\nThe immediate ground around the signs and rail is uneven and littered with debris including rocks, chunks of asphalt, and what appear to be broken pieces of metal or machinery. This scene sets a somewhat neglected or abandoned tone.\n\nIn the background, a calm body of water stretches across the image with a clear sky above it, providing a stark contrast to the worn and deteriorated man-made objects in the foreground. Far off in the distance, the faint outline of structures or industrial facilities can be seen, adding to the desolate feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its combination of natural and industrial elements, arouses a sense of isolation and finality.","title":"An inlet at Broad Channel residential community across from JFK Airport on Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548248","544245","544681","552211","547095","556943","552005","547111","547581","555382","552212","547622","543104","547653","547081","558000"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","beam","end","distress","visual","pole","diamond","affix","chunk","guardrail"]}
