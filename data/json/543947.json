{"path":"543947.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a lively, outdoor scene involving three young people and a vintage blue car in the driveway of a suburban home. The setting features a leafy neighborhood with a prominently displayed traditional two-story house with red brick and white siding, and a garage partially visible on the right.\n\nThe car itself is an eye-catching element of the sceneâ€”it appears to be a 1960s model based on its design, with a distinctive front grille and dual headlights. The vehicle's body is painted in deep blue, contrasting with a creamy white roof.\n\nThe three individuals interacting with the car add dynamic energy to the frame. On the far left, a young boy in a green shirt and darker pants stands by the driver's side door, his left hand grasping the door handle. He seems to be either opening the door or holding it, and his attention is directed towards the other two individuals.\n\nCentered in the image is a young woman with long brown hair, dressed in a red top and blue jeans. She stands by the passenger side, reaching out to a surfboard that is being loaded on the car's roof by another young man. Her gesture and facial expression suggest she is either guiding or assisting with the placement of the board.\n\nOn top of the vehicle, a young man in a blue shirt and jeans is actively involved in securing the surfboard. He is stretching forward, his arms reaching to adjust or hold the surfboard, while his body straddles the car's roof. This adds a sense of action to the scene as he seems to be either tying down the board or ensuring it is properly secured.\n\nSurrounding these central activities are glimpses of quiet suburban life, including lush green trees and a clear blue sky, hinting at a warm, sunny day. A bicycle is also partly visible next to the boy, adding another layer of everyday youth activity to the image.\n\nOverall, the photograph beautifully combines elements of youth, recreation, and suburban lifestyle from a bygone era, suggesting themes of camaraderie, preparation for a shared adventure, and the casual joys of a summer day.","title":"Boaters unload canoe near the Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["543856","546093","551084","557874","551119","548303","556169","557361","550152","557016","547758","547495","552412","552800","555944","551021"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["surfboard","youth","car","door","board","boy","roof","jean","grille","driveway"]}
