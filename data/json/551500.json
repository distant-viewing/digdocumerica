{"path":"551500.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph shows an outdoor scene with a discarded armchair placed beside a body of water, possibly a river shore. The chair is old and worn, having a tufted back and armrests, and is an upholstered model typical of indoor furniture, now seemingly abandoned in a natural setting. To the left of the chair, there is a large, concrete slab, likely part of some discarded construction material with a rusted handle on top.\n\nThe background is lush with dense green bushes and small trees, indicating that the area is rich in vegetation, possibly a wooded or forested area near the water. The ground between the greenery and waterâ€™s edge is covered in assorted small rocks and some other debris, signifying a somewhat neglected or less-frequented location. The light and shadows suggest it is a bright, sunny day, which casts stark contrasts on the objects and surrounding nature.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a poignant juxtaposition between human discard and natural beauty, perhaps invoking thoughts on environmental issues or the incongruity between human artifacts and nature.","title":"On the Mississippi River shore","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["547472","552102","545977","547525","552450","552065","550352","547024","552158","543165","547689","544181","557734","554493","552089","547893"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["chair","armchair","slab","artifact","handle","furniture","thought","issue","model","bush"]}
