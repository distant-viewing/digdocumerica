{"path":"554550.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant, nostalgic streetscape likely dated from the mid to late 20th century, featuring a variety of colorful motel signs and a pedestrian. The scene is set on a sidewalk beside a street lined with numerous signs promoting different motels. Each sign is embellished with eye-catching features like bright colors, arrows, and phrases highlighting amenities such as \"AIR CONDITIONED,\" \"HEATED,\" and \"CABLE TV.\"\n\nIn the foreground, a man walks along the sidewalk towards the camera. He appears to be in his mid-thirties, casually dressed in a light-colored, patterned shirt and jeans, carrying a white cooler. The expression on his face appears calm and neutral as he navigates the sidewalk.\n\nThe background includes a multitude of advertisement signs. Notable among them are signs for \"Terrace Restaurant and Lounge\" and the \"Lake Motel\" which promotes its \"BEACH PATIO\" and \"LAKE VIEW ROOMS.\" The environment suggests a tourist-oriented town, with its clustered signage and offerings directed at travelers. \n\nThe architecture visible includes typical American motel styles from the period, with pointed roofs and simple, functional structures. The lush greenery, possibly indicating a summer season, partially obscures some signs and buildings. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene, which enhances the vivid colors of the motel signs.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of mid-century American travel culture, emphasizing roadside accommodation and the burgeoning allure of road trips fueled by automobile accessibility.","title":"Row of motels at Lake George Village, New York, and plethora of signs creates a non-rustic scene in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549008","549017","554183","549113","553017","545618","557660","549014","554704","554709","551494","545154","548889","549224","550127","551495"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["motel","sign","sidewalk","accommodation","thirty","tv","streetscape","cooler","allure","patio"]}
