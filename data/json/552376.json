{"path":"552376.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor setting on a dusty, rugged terrain, likely a hilltop or mountain area with a panoramic view stretching to hazy distances, likely looking out over a valley or cityscape. The scene is occupied by various vehicles and equipment that suggest a logistical or operational setup for broadcasting or communications. The focal point is a collection of large trucks and trailers, one prominently featuring a blue logo, possibly indicative of a broadcasting company. This central vehicle is a large trailer being hauled by a white truck. \n\nNearby, there are several other vehicles including white vans with roof racks, a sedan, and another large white truck pulling a different style of work trailer. Several large, specialized communications or broadcasting dishes and antennas are visible, extending from the tops of the trailers, indicating that this site may be used for telecommunications or media broadcasting.\n\nA four-person group is noticeable near the center of the image, likely technicians or workers, dressed in casual attire and involved in either setting up, maintaining, or overseeing the equipment and vehicles. The atmosphere appears busy yet orderly, with an undertone of technical activity.\n\nThe landscape is barren with very sparse vegetation, and the ground is rocky and uneven, reinforcing the impression of a makeshift, temporary operation possibly set up for a specific event or function that requires elevated and clear positioning for broadcasting or communication purposes.","title":"Los angeles reactive pollutant program (larpp), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group.
