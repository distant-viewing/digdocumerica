{"path":"549832.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph is taken from a high vantage point, looking down at a city street scene. The street appears wet, likely from recent rain, and is lined with parked cars. These cars seem to be from the 1960s or 1970s, given their design and shape, featuring a mix of sedans in various dark and metallic colors.\n\nIn the center of the image, there is a white utility truck marked with the word \"Sanitation\" on the side, indicating it is possibly a garbage truck. The truck is making its way down the street, which has a double yellow line running down the middle.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, the edge of a building shows. It's painted with horizontal stripes in white, dark red, and green, adding color to the urban environment. There are public trash cans near the curb, and at least two pedestrians are visible. one near the building and another in the distance walking along the sidewalk.\n\nThere's a subdued lighting in the scene, implying it could be an overcast day or a time around early morning or late evening. The general mood conveyed through the muted colors and wet surfaces is somewhat gloomy and quiet. The composition offers a snapshot of daily urban life, likely in a mid-20th century American city.","title":"Sanitation truck, double-parked cars and litter on 172nd street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549837","556681","549829","556709","554309","552077","555782","549831","556724","554299","549886","547651","554331","557278","549853","549830"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","street","subdued","city","curb","parked","garbage","can","pedestrian","rain"]}
