{"path":"548369.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling street scene, likely from the mid-20th century, judging by the vehicles and fashion styles visible. The setting is an urban environment, characterized by tall buildings lining the street. The architecture includes both modern, possibly mid-century buildings with large windows and flat facades, as well as older, more detailed structures that hint at early 20th-century construction.\n\nThe street itself is busy with a mix of pedestrians and vehicles. Numerous cars, which appear to be from the 1960s or probably the 1970s, fill the street. The vehicle models suggest a mix of sedans and a few taxis, indicating a diverse urban traffic scene.\n\nPedestrians, including men and women, are variously dressed primarily in coats and suits, suggesting a cooler weather condition. Many of the men are wearing hats, a common fashion accessory of earlier decades. The street scene is animated and dynamic, with some individuals crossing the street, while others seem to be engaged in conversation or waiting to cross.\n\nIn the foreground, a group of individuals crossing the street draws the eye. They vary in gender and age, adding to the urban diversity of the scene. The overhead traffic lights and street signs are clearly visible, with a \"ONE WAY\" sign in the upper right corner of the frame, helping to contextualize the traffic direction and urban setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph vividly captures the hustle and bustle of an earlier urban period, filled with activity and the stylistic nuances of the time.","title":"Downtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546626","548388","549906","548399","549872","548368","556710","556225","551125","549882","551135","549923","545216","550139","556199","554314"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","traffic","century","fashion","pedestrian","vehicle","taxi","gender","accessory","bustle"]}
