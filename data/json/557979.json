{"path":"557979.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features a striking architectural and natural composition. It captures an industrially styled, covered bridge-like structure, predominantly made of metal, likely part of a larger transport facility or overpass. The bridge is dominating the upper left to middle section of the frame, casting a significant shadow below and framing the left side of the image. A taller and similarly styled vertical structure appears adjacent to the right side.\n\nUnderneath the main structure, there is a dimly lit area through which a road or a path seems to pass. This path is partially visible at the bottom right corner, indicated by the presence of a white car moving along it. The focal point of the image extends beyond the structures to the centrally visible gap where one can observe a gentle, sunlit hill in the background. This forms a natural backdrop, lined with a variety of trees, exhibiting a tranquil ambiance as opposed to the robust and somewhat darker foreground construction.\n\nOptically, the image offers a depth of field with a blend of darkness and light; the viewerâ€™s eye naturally travels from the shadows cast by the structural designs to the open, light-filled meadow with trees. The overall atmosphere casts a semi-industrial tone coupled with natural serenity, framed under what seems to be a clear sky.","title":"Ohio Turnpike bridge over the Cuyahoga Valley and River seen from the base of the bridge on Riverview Road north of Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron. The valley is part of the 30,000 acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located between the metropolitan districts of Akron and Cleveland. The steeply sloped and heavily wooded valley is rich in Indian lore and was an area of heavy commerce on the Ohio-Erie Canal in the 19th century.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["546139","552064","558048","548207","555730","555747","548064","550986","557976","546203","552598","558049","558051","548870","557096","552481"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["bridge","path","overpass","gap","meadow","serenity","darkness","structure","transport","corner"]}
