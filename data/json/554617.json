{"path":"554617.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This vintage photograph depicts a bustling parking lot scene, likely from the 1970s or 1980s based on the vehicle models observed. The lot is full of cars from that era, including a prominent Chevrolet truck in the foreground and various sedans and station wagons.\n\nIn the top center background of the image, there is a strip of commercial buildings with signs indicating various businesses, including an establishment with a large roof sign that appears to say \"ACME FOODS.\" Adjacent to these buildings is a road leading further off into a wooded area, with more cars traveling along it.\n\nOn the right side of the photo is a small building marked \"TOURIST INFORMATION,\" featuring a typical A-frame architecture associated with mid-20th-century American tourist sites. A small group of people, both adults and children, is visible outside this building, possibly gathering information or waiting to speak to someone inside.\n\nProminent features include flags, indicating a sense of patriotism or celebration, and signs throughout the parking lot promoting different tourist-related services. The overall ambiance suggests a popular local or tourist hub, capturing a piece of Americana typical of the time period. The scene is set under a slightly overcast sky, which casts a soft natural light over the environment.","title":"Tourist information center at Old Forge, and a full parking lot on a hot summer day, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556773","556204","546599","546731","556736","557016","558254","547954","548496","556201","556790","546879","547826","554349","546813","547928"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["tourist","lot","information","parking","patriotism","sign","1980","celebration","building","wagon"]}
