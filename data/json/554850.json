{"path":"554850.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a lively scene at a school playground where children are engaged in a game of volleyball. In the foreground, a young girl wearing a white top and red pants is actively hitting the volleyball upwards. Her focused expression and the motion of her arms suggest she is exerting a strong force to hit the ball.\n\nBehind her, a line of children is waiting and watching the game. These children are diverse in appearance, wearing various styles of casual clothing like t-shirts, shirts, pants, and dresses. Their expressions range from attentive to joyful, and they are spread out across the frame, some watching the game and others interacting with each other.\n\nThe playground itself has a dirt ground, and part of a white goalpost is visible on the left, hinting that the area is used for multiple sports. In the background, there are lush green trees and a building, possibly part of the school, with yellow school buses parked in front. This setting suggests an everyday school environment where children are enjoying their break time outdoors. The whole scene is informal and portrays a snapshot of childhood activity and interaction in a school setting.","title":"Youngsters playing tether ball at school in Leakey, Texas near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553096","556437","551128","553512","546527","546453","556136","552755","549318","556287","552024","547176","544354","556301","551769","554072"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["school","game","playground","child","hit","watch","ball","pant","childhood","expression"]}
