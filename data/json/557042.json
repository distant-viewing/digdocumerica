{"path":"557042.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a side profile of two men wearing cowboy hats. The man in the foreground is dressed in a white, vertically striped shirt and a weathered brown cowboy hat. He has a stern expression and gazes forward. The man in the background wears a bright pink shirt and a white cowboy hat, partially obscured due to the angle and focus which centers more on the man in front.\n\nTheir attire suggests a somewhat formal outdoor setting, possibly a rodeo or a country-themed event. The time appears to be during the day, given the bright lighting and shadows indicating strong sunlight.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but appears to be natural with green foliage, hinting that the location could be in a park or a similarly verdant open space. The focus and framing emphasize the contrast in their attire and the rugged, outdoor lifestyle associated with cowboy aesthetics.","title":"Spectators await the parade through cottonwood falls Kansas, near Emporia, which is a part of the flint hills rodeo, a major cultural event of the area.
