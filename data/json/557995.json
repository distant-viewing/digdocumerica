{"path":"557995.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of an old, dilapidated structure in a wooded area. The structure appears to be a bridge or some form of a passageway made of brick and stone. It shows signs of decay and neglect, with parts of the walls visibly cracked, and some bricks missing, creating small openings. The bridge is partly overgrown with greenery including vines, shrubs, and trees, indicating it hasn't been maintained for some time.\n\nThe central part of the bridge has collapsed, leaving debris scattered beneath. The arch of the bridge remains partially intact. Several fallen trees and branches lie around and on the structure, further emphasizing the desolation. Green foliage partially obscures the view, adding a sense of mystery and quiet to the scene.\n\nThe setting appears serene and secluded, with muted light filtering through the leaves, casting soft shadows. The background beyond the bridge is faintly visible, showing more dense foliage, suggesting that the structure is located in a heavily wooded or forested area.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a mood of abandonment and the relentless reclaiming of man-made structures by nature. It has an eerie yet peaceful quality, capturing a blend of architectural deterioration and natural beauty.","title":"Remains of stone used in an aqueduct on the Ohio-Erie Canal over the Cuyahoga River at Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron. The mill once stood at the upper left of the photograph, north of Main Street. The canal connected the Great Lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi River systems between 1833 and 1913 when a disastrous flood and trains put the waterway out of business. It is now a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located between Akron and Cleveland.
