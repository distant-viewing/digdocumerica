{"path":"543900.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This photo captures a dramatic and intense scene of a large fire at night. The main visual element is the massive fireball with roaring flames, which creates a vivid contrast against the dark night sky. Billowing smoke and flames are reflected in the water visible in the foreground, creating a mirror image that adds to the dramatic effect.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a structure that resembles a fuel tank is partially visible; it is illuminated from behind, casting a mysterious and eerie glow. Additionally, there are other industrial structures visible towards the left, suggesting that the scene is likely part of an industrial area or facility.\n\nForeground elements include a railing leading into the bottom of the frame, which seemingly borders the water body catching the flames' reflection. There is also some sort of illuminated pole or tower on the right, adding vertical lines to the composition, which intersects with the diagonal lines of cabled structures visible in the silhouette against the fire.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is intense and hazardous, capturing a moment of significant danger and destruction, likely an emergency situation in an industrial setting. The photograph also paints a scene of solitude with no visible human presence, emphasizing the scale and uncontrollable nature of the fire.","title":"A texaco crude oil tank blazes against the night after being struck by lightning","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["543908","543933","543904","555160","557577","543002","545528","555156","546017","543020","545924","548854","543983","557578","545916","544008"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["flame","fire","night","danger","emergency","fuel","situation","destruction","cable","sort"]}
