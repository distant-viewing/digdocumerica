{"path":"544907.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a natural sandstone rock formation featuring a highly textured surface. The rock is displayed in a variety of warm, earthen tones, predominantly pinks and sandy colors. It exhibits a multitude of crevices, holes, and indentations, forming an irregular grid-like pattern that adds a rich, tactile quality to the image.\n\nThe pattern within the rock is quite intricate. Some of the holes are deep and shadowed, appearing as dark voids, while others are shallower with visible edges illuminated by sunlight. The rock surface between these cavitations varies in texture and relief, showing wear likely caused by erosion, which gives the surface a weathered appearance.\n\nThe rock occupies the whole frame of the image, with no specific focus on any singular point, but rather a comprehensive coverage of this interesting natural structure. The lighting suggests that the photograph was taken during a time of day when the sun was high, given the intensity of light and the depth of the shadows, accentuating the three-dimensional aspect of the rock's surface.\n\nThereâ€™s no visible background apart from the rock itself, ensuring full attention is paid to the textural details of the formation. The composition effectively conveys the natural beauty and geological complexity of sandstone formations, often found in arid or semi-arid regions.","title":"Eroded sandstone, part of indian ruins dating from 1100 to 1300 a.d","placename":"Hovenweep National Monument (Utah and Colo.)","location":"Hovenweep National Monument, Colorado","nn1":["550474","543151","552890","545558","554410","545795","543421","545589","552444","552546","553770","545804","549197","550428","555182","555047"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","sandstone","hole","formation","surface","pay","relief","crevice","multitude","coverage"]}
