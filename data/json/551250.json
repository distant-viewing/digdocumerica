{"path":"551250.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The image appears to display a close-up view of a cracked, dry surface that suggests dry earth or parched ground, with a scattered composition of stones and debris. Prominently in the frame is a colorful dead Gila monster (a type of venomous lizard native to the southwestern United States) lying on its back. The most striking feature of the lizard is its vibrant, banded skin pattern with alternating bands of pink and black spots, highlighted against the duller, brownish backdrop of the earth.\n\nClose to the lizard, there's some kind of matter that could possibly be the internals or remains of an animal, suggesting the lizard may have been predated upon or died from an injury. The textures are raw and organic, providing a stark contrast to the harsh terrain.\n\nThe overall composition, dominated by the natural elements and the presence of death, evoke a somber, perhaps poignant mood, emphasizing themes of nature's cycles and the raw reality of wildlife survival. The cracked ground enhances the feeling of desolation or harshness in the natural environment where the scene is set.","title":"Shell and leg of a box turtle dismembered by a car or truck along route 5 north of gravois mills.
