{"path":"543193.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively beach scene marked by a vibrant natural environment and recreational activities. The foreground consists of sandy dunes covered with dense greenery, including clusters of succulent plants, which suggest a coastal ecosystem adapted to dry, salty conditions. These plants vary in height and density, creating a textured and multilayered landscape.\n\nBeyond the dunes, the middle ground reveals a sandy beach where several people are seen enjoying leisure activities. Some individuals are scattered along the shore, possibly walking or standing, while others are closer to the water's edge. The ocean is visible in the background, characterized by breaking white waves that suggest a moderately windy atmosphere, with the sea extending to the horizon.\n\nThe sky is mostly cloudy with patches of blue, casting a natural, soft light across the scene. This type of lighting condition enhances the vividness of the natural colors in the scene, from the green plants and tan sand to the frothy white waves and subdued sky. The overall composition beautifully layers these elements, offering a sense of depth and openness characteristic of coastal landscapes.","title":"California--Pebble Beach","placename":"Pebble Beach (Calif.)","location":"Pebble Beach, California","nn1":["545280","557459","543192","543389","547592","543303","547697","547015","547607","547596","553952","547603","543254","553765","551554","555400"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["dune","plant","wave","beach","standing","openness","vividness","condition","density","ecosystem"]}
