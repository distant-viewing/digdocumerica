{"path":"545266.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a logging site, likely capturing a moment of industrial activity in a marsh or wetland area. The foreground shows a muddy, waterlogged terrain scattered with debris and bits of vegetation. Patches of water are visible across the muddy surface, reflecting the blue sky above.\n\nIn the middle ground, numerous logs float in shallow water, arranged haphazardly. These logs vary in size and are partially submerged, suggesting they might have been recently cut and are waiting to be processed or transported. \n\nThe background features more organized stacks of logs on what appears to be a wooden or metallic structure, perhaps a temporary storage or sorting area. The background also shows a treeline, indicating that the site is adjacent to an unlogged forest or wooded area.\n\nThe overall scene evokes a sense of heavy human intervention in a natural landscape, illustrating the environmental impact of logging activities with its disrupted and littered terrain. The image is a stark depiction of the interaction between industrial operations and natural ecosystems.","title":"Log storage on the Everett waterfront at low tide","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552161","552178","552162","542824","550326","550346","542827","552163","552204","555143","552170","542852","542940","542921","542850","552199"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["log","site","treeline","marsh","intervention","depiction","wetland","terrain","stack","ecosystem"]}
