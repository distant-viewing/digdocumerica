{"path":"543841.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene featuring three people on horseback. In the foreground, on the left side of the image, two individuals—a younger male with short hair and a female with short, lighter hair, both dressed in casual attire—are sharing a single dark horse, smiling as they ride together on a narrow, gravel pathway. To the right, a young woman with long, flowing dark hair, wearing a dark long-sleeve top and jeans, rides a separate horse. Like the first, her horse is also dark-colored. \n\nThe riders appear relaxed and are enjoying the leisurely pace, surrounded by a pastoral landscape. In the background, there are modest houses and a variety of outbuildings. Several farming or rural elements such as wire fences, leafless trees, and scattered farm equipment enhance the rustic charm of the setting. Notably, the trees and distant mountains suggest that it might be either early spring or late autumn due to their barren appearance. The atmosphere is peaceful and suggests a close community or family ties, enjoying a sunny day outdoors in a countryside environment.","title":"Ranch scene","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["543366","557988","557992","557781","554689","554690","553102","548987","553116","554885","544362","552562","553103","544358","557047","556562"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["horse","ride","hair","horseback","female","enjoy","outbuilding","pace","countryside","rider"]}
