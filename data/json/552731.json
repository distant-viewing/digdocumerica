{"path":"552731.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph portrays a large group of people gathered in what appears to be an outdoor civic or political event. The central focus of the image is a large red sign featuring the word \"HOPE\" in white block letters, prominently held aloft in the background.\n\nSurrounding the sign and filling the foreground are numerous individuals, predominantly young adults, who seem to be active participants in this event. The crowd displays a mixture of expressions, from earnestness to joyful engagement, suggesting a lively, possibly campaign-like atmosphere.\n\nSeveral individuals at the front of the group are wearing sashes, with visible text that includes \"Ms. Jr.\" These sashes give a somewhat formal or ceremonial element to the occasion, likely indicating some form of titled participation or representation within the event. The crowd is diverse, including both men and women of various ethnicities.\n\nThe setting includes a backdrop of simple, traditional architecture and foliage that suggests this gathering might be taking place in a public area or near institutional buildings, possibly a college or community center. The attire ranges from formal to casual, with some individuals wearing suits and others in more relaxed outfits, which further indicates a gathering with a varied and inclusive audience.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a vibrant moment filled with a sense of community and anticipation, centered around a message of hope, during what appears to be a public, possibly politically charged event.","title":"Noontime rally in downtown Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556272","556256","551852","543482","553322","558293","553311","553331","556255","553267","545384","558294","556526","551814","549320","553237"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["event","crowd","charge","public","gathering","campaign","anticipation","title","participation","occasion"]}
