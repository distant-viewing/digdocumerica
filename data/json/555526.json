{"path":"555526.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"The photo captures an outdoor scene in a wooded environment where a man is engaged in a rustic activity. He is an older male with a beard, wearing a worn denim jacket and a baseball cap. The man is concentrated on a taskâ€”a maple syrup production process, commonly seen in rural settings. Directly in his hands, he holds an object over a maple syrup can, possibly checking or adding something.\n\nIn the background and to the side, there's a homemade setup for boiling down sap, featuring a wood-fired evaporator made from metal barrels and scrap materials. You can see flames visible inside a barrel with a chimney pipe extended upward. The area is cluttered with various rustic tools, containers, and firewood, indicating an ongoing production process.\n\nThe setting is quite naturalistic with trees surrounding the area, and the ground is messy with leaves, suggesting the scene takes place in a forest during a cooler season. This depiction showcases a traditional and manual approach to maple syrup extraction and preparation, highlighting aspects of self-sufficiency and rural life. The atmosphere is quite earthy and gritty, emphasized by the practical and functional attire of the man, as well as the makeshift equipment around him.","title":"Resident of Roxbury, Vermont, draws off the finished syrup from a homemade evaporator. Instead of working in a sugar house he sets up a makeshift rig in a new spot each year to use fallen timber and loose brush to fire the sawed-off oil drum.","placename":"Barre (Vt.)","location":"Barre, Vermont","nn1":["555524","555525","554511","553642","554413","549451","554411","554412","554439","553614","558315","550251","553612","557115","545371","552112"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["barrel","production","self","process","flame","approach","scrap","baseball","extraction","beard"]}
