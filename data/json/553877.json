{"path":"553877.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph features a large school of fish swimming in a dark, aquatic environment. The fish are small, with silvery bodies that reflect light, giving them a shiny appearance. They are densely packed together, likely as a defensive mechanism against predators. The background is a deep, dark blue, indicative of an underwater setting with limited light penetration, possibly suggesting that the photo was taken at a considerable depth or in a shaded area. The composition emphasizes the unity and flowing movement of the fish as they navigate through the water. There are no human figures or man-made objects visible; the focus is entirely on the natural marine life.","title":"Dead menhaden in Chesapeake Bay.
