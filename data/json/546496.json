{"path":"546496.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene during what appears to be dusk, given the illumination of the lamps and the dim natural light. The central subject of the image is a large, stylish lamppost with multiple globes. This lamppost has a total of nine spherical lamps, all of which are lit. The lamps are mounted on a dark metal stand with a symmetrical arrangement: a cluster at the top congregated in a circular formation.\n\nThe background reveals a peaceful park setting. Trees with leafy branches are scattered around, dimly lit by the ambient light which suggests that this might be a public or recreational area. The ground beneath the lamp is paved with stones or bricks, contributing to the urban park feel.\n\nThere are hints of a building or infrastructure in the far background, but it is largely obscured by shadows and trees. The sky is only faintly visible and appears clear, adding a tranquil and serene mood to the scenery.\n\nOverall, the composition plays with contrasting elements of light and shadow, with the glow of the lamps providing a warm, inviting spot amidst the cooler, shadowed surroundings.","title":"Lights in front of Cleo Rogers Memorial Library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["551488","557277","550031","553188","546492","549490","549493","549543","553193","551455","553194","547705","553295","551864","551496","555449"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["lamp","lamppost","globe","total","park","stand","illumination","scenery","spot","light"]}
