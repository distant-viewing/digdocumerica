{"path":"548918.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph of a large body of water surrounded by sandy and rocky terrain. It captures a bridge spanning across a narrow portion of the water, connecting two segments of land. The area around the bridge and along the shorelines is developed with parking lots filled with numerous vehicles, and there are small buildings or structures near the edges of these lots. A paved road is visible winding its way through the terrain and leading to the bridge.\n\nOn one side of the bridge, there is an inlet with calm water and small vessels anchored near the shore, indicating a potential recreational or docking area. The background of the image features distant hills and a vast expanse of water extending toward the horizon, suggesting that this location is in a large lake or near a coastal area.\n\nThe landscape is predominantly arid with minimal vegetation, characterized by sandy dunes and rocky outcrops. The overall composition of the photograph provides a blend of natural and human-made environments, highlighting recreational use and infrastructure built to access and enjoy the waterfront.","title":"Diversion dam on Colorado River","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["548945","549504","548401","548941","552846","548632","551989","547828","548928","548413","546724","545024","556966","549469","551186","544761"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["bridge","lot","inlet","dune","docking","outcrop","segment","water","terrain","waterfront"]}
