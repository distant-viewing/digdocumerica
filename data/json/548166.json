{"path":"548166.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts three aircraft partially visible in a close, stacked arrangement at an airport. The foremost aircraft features the label \"City of Minneapolis\" near the front entry door, suggesting this could be the airplane's name or assigned title. This airplane and the one directly behind it are from United Airlines, as indicated by their liveriesâ€”predominantly white with bold red and blue stripes, and stars decorating the section above the passenger windows. The livery is an older design of United Airlines, frequently seen in the past.\n\nThe first aircraft's cockpit is visible and there is a pilot wearing a white shirt; he appears to be organizing or adjusting something inside the cockpit, possibly preparing for a flight or completing post-flight procedures. The windows of the cockpit are open on both sides, indicating the aircraft is parked and stationary. The aircraft has a short, pointed nose typical of older jet models.\n\nIn the background, there is a glimpse of airport infrastructure including what looks like a jet bridge and part of a hangar or terminal building featuring large, dark-colored doors.\n\nOverall, the setting of the image is busy, hinting at the hustle and bustle typically associated with airport operations. The composition of the image, focusing on a tight crop of aircraft parts in a step-like visual arrangement, emphasizes the density and organized chaos of the airport environment.","title":"At Portland international airport","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["554092","548130","553731","548429","548428","547018","542670","548447","548430","547824","548487","549621","547237","547951","547810","542720"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["aircraft","airport","cockpit","jet","airplane","arrangement","pilot","door","procedure","title"]}
