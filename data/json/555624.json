{"path":"555624.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This is a serene rural landscape photograph. The viewpoint is from a higher elevation, looking down into a valley adorned with lush greenery. The composition features a dirt road in the foreground, edged by golden and green vegetation, which appears somewhat dry, possibly indicating the season as late summer or early fall.\n\nIn the mid-ground, the valley is filled with dense trees and shrubs in various shades of green, suggesting a thriving natural environment. Scattered within this verdant valley are a few small structures; a couple of red-roofed and red-walled buildings are noticeable which are typical of rural barns or farmhouses.\n\nThe background shows rolling hills that extend into the distance, hinting at a spacious rural setting. The sky above is slightly overexposed in the photograph, glowing softly through the leaves of the overhanging branches at the top frame, which add a framing effect and a sense of depth to the scene.\n\nOverall, the scene captures the tranquil and picturesque essence of rural life, with a focus on nature and traditional agricultural buildings.","title":"Countryside near Route #800 and Barnesville, Ohio, in the southeastern part of the state.
