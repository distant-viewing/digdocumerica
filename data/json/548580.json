{"path":"548580.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of leisure, featuring three older adults playing croquet in what appears to be a lush, green park. The background shows a serene setting with soft focus trees and a glimpse of a water body, which contributes to a calm and peaceful ambiance.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a woman is standing with her hands on her hips, wearing a floral patterned dress in blues and greens and white flat shoes. She is looking towards the other two people, attentively observing the game.\n\nIn the middle is another woman dressed in a sleeveless, collared shirt and matching shorts in a yellow and white checkered pattern, accessorized with sunglasses and white sneakers. She stands slightly turned towards the man on her right, watching the ongoing action.\n\nOn the right, a man in a light blue polo shirt and striped blue and white shorts is actively playing. He wears a straw hat, dark sunglasses, and knee-high socks with dark shoes. He is in the middle of a swing, focusing intently on hitting a croquet ball with his mallet.\n\nScattered on the grass are a few croquet balls close by and several mallets resting against each other. The scene exudes a sense of casual relaxation and enjoyment typical of a warm, sunny day spent outdoors with friends or family.","title":"On the croquet court at Century Village Retirement Community","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548579","548566","551757","551759","551760","548567","554149","554492","548647","553065","551758","557362","553903","551721","547286","551017"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["ball","shoe","sunglass","short","matching","middle","polo","swing","hip","sneaker"]}
