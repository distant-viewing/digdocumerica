{"path":"546633.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic street scene, focusing primarily on a police officer and a civilian. The police officer, who appears young and Caucasian, is dressed in a standard blue police uniform with a cap, badge, and belt equipped with various tools. His expression is serious and his body language is attentive, making direct eye contact with someone outside of the frame, possibly the person he is interacting with.\n\nThe civilian, a Black man, is captured in motion, slightly blurred as he walks by in the foreground. He is dressed formally in a suit jacket and dress shirt. His expression is not clearly visible, but his posture suggests purpose and movement.\n\nThe background provides an urban context, showing aged buildings with brick facades and commercial signs. One sign reads \"Frank’s Cibmarine\" and another, \"Jim’s Carry-Out,\" advertising quick eats with vintage logos of 7Up visible as well. Beneath these signs, two young women and a man can be seen. The women are engaged in conversation, potentially observing or discussing the interaction in progress.\n\nOverall, this photograph portrays a moment of everyday life in an urban neighborhood, highlighting a public interaction of authority and city dynamics amid signs of local business activity. The scene is filled with tension and narrative potential, urging viewers to consider the stories and circumstances leading up to and flowing from this moment.","title":"Street arrest","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546657","547205","546637","546658","546663","546634","546654","546676","556277","546661","546630","545351","551854","546445","551941","552754"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["police","officer","sign","potential","authority","contact","tension","language","advertising","dynamic"]}
