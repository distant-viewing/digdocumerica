{"path":"548619.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts an elderly man bent over a public drinking fountain on a street. The man is wearing a light floral patterned nightgown and mismatched socks with sandals. His hair is gray and tousled, and he appears to be concentrating on directly drinking from the faucet or possibly washing his face.\n\nBeside him, there is a folded wheelchair with a yellow seat, indicating that it might be used for mobility assistance. The background includes a wall painted in mint green with slight wear showing, which matches the generally unembellished, utilitarian urban setting. The floor is concrete and displays some wear and patches suggesting it is an outdoor public space.\n\nThe image captures a moment that blends daily necessity and struggle with a touch of unsung dignity in the man's simple actions. The elements in the picture—the wheelchair, the nightgown, and the public fountain—integrally suggest themes of aging, dependency, and the basic human right to water.","title":"A resident of one of the many retirement hotels in the south beach area of Miami beach.
