{"path":"547834.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between two people, a man and a woman, on a waterfront viewing platform. The background reveals a vast, calm river with a haze in the sky, which slightly obscures the distant views of a suspension bridge on the horizon. The platform they are standing on has prominent safety features, including a rusty metal railing and chains, marked by a \"NO SMOKING\" sign.\n\nThe man, wearing glasses and dressed in a light grey shirt with dark trousers, stands behind the woman. He is slightly bent forward, with his right arm extended outward, pointing toward something in the distance. His left arm appears to softly hold the woman around her shoulders, guiding her gaze in the direction he is pointing.\n\nThe woman, wearing a pastel yellow top and mustard-colored trousers, stands ahead of the man. Her demeanor suggests she is paying close attention to what the man is pointing out. She has a serene expression and her dark hair is styled in a straightforward manner, tucked behind her ears, which allows her face to be clearly visible as she looks ahead.\n\nThe overall mood seems reflective and intimate, as though the man is showing the woman a sight of significance, or perhaps explaining something about the landscape that lies before them. The setting and attire suggest this photo might be from the 1960s or 1970s, giving it a vintage feel. The image captures a feeling of exploration and shared discovery, against a backdrop that invites curiosity about the wider world beyond the frame.","title":"View of upper New York Bay from the Staten Island Ferry","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543469","549901","548833","551450","551967","549756","549324","551454","554901","545489","554900","545612","551859","543461","551945","547595"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["woman","trouser","platform","man","arm","smoking","mustard","discovery","suspension","ear"]}
