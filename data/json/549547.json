{"path":"549547.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic and dramatic view featuring a significant bridge infrastructure over a large body of water, likely a river or a part of a waterfall system, given the visible mist and water spray. The bridge, a large arching structure, spans from the left to the right of the frame, connecting two land masses. The bridge's construction is notable for its simplistically elegant design, playing a practical role in transportation while complementing the natural beauty of the setting.\n\nOn the left side, adjacent to the bridge's base, there is a high-rise building, which gives a sense of scale to the scene and signifies human habitation or industrial presence nearby. The background includes a visible skyline with other structures and possibly residential or commercial buildings, seen under a hazy sky that may suggest either early morning light or atmospheric pollution.\n\nThe water underneath is calm, and the mist rising from the falling water near the bridge adds a dynamic and powerful element to the scene, highlighting the natural forces at play. Overall, the composition blends elements of human engineering and natural beauty, offering a view that is both serene and potent.","title":"Niagara Falls and Rainbow Bridge in the GRand Gorge area the Canadian, or \"Horseshoe Falls\" in center of frame, the American Falls and observation tower on the left.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["548207","543313","552846","549469","547669","546810","546870","548415","552598","547703","542734","557959","548401","545227","542804","544542"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","mist","masse","spray","waterfall","engineering","force","water","habitation","role"]}
