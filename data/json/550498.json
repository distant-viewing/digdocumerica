It shows a wide valley flanked by steep, rugged mountains, some of which are capped with snow, suggesting this is a high-altitude or polar region. The central focus of the image is a snaking river that meanders through the valley floor, creating intricate patterns and shapes as it flows. The river appears to be wide in some areas and pinched in others, indicating varying rates of water flow.\n\nThe surrounding terrain varies in color from dark greens of low vegetation to the grays and whites of rocky or snowy areas on the mountain slopes. The overcast sky suggests a gloomy or harsh weather condition, contributing to the dramatic and somewhat mysterious ambiance of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a sense of remote, untouched wilderness, emphasizing the raw beauty and scale of the natural environment. The absence of any visible human activity or structures reinforces the isolation and pristine condition of the landscape.","title":"Stream draining into the atigun river on the east side of the atigun valley","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550508","550523","550518","550595","550487","550634","550497","550590","550512","550403","550522","550529","550542","550511","550592","550402"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["valley","rate","flow","snowy","gloomy","pristine","mountain","whites","varies","rocky"]}
