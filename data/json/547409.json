{"path":"547409.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a farm with a focus on an older man who looks to be engaged in his daily farming activities. The man is smiling and leaning on a wooden fence, dressed in work-appropriate attire; he wears a gray zip-up jacket, blue jeans, and rubber boots suggesting muddy conditions. He sports a red cap with a logo, possibly indicating a brand or local affiliation.\n\nThe setting is overcast, contributing to the muddy ground indicative of recent rain. Behind him stands a large red barn, traditional in design with weathered wood siding that adds rustic charm to the scene. The barn features doors and a prominent loft area that are distinctive to farm structures. Additionally, a silo and other farm buildings are visible in the background, typical of a working farm environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo suggests a moment of casual pause in a typically busy farm setting, with the man seemingly taking a brief moment to relax and enjoy his surroundings. The muddy conditions the man stands in reflect the often challenging and messy nature of farm work.","title":"John Dolezal on a rainy day on his farm near Bee, Nebraska.
