{"path":"557888.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features a close-up shot of an automobile, specifically focusing on its driver-side window. The main elements in the image include the arm of a man resting on the open window ledge. He wears a jean jacket and a wristwatch, and holds a folded newspaper or pamphlet labeled with various schedules and routes, possibly for public transportation or an event.\n\nThe man, visible from his profile, appears to be wearing a formal suit and tie, suggesting a contrast between his attire and the casual denim of his outstretched arm. This hints that the arm might belong to another individual outside the car, possibly handing the driver the document.\n\nThe car has a sleek, vintage design with shiny chrome detailing along the window. The background captures reflected light and shadows, contributing to a focused and somewhat dramatic effect, emphasizing the interaction at the window. The lighting and coloration in the shot give the scene a retro and cinematic quality.","title":"Driver holding his car's test card as it proceeds along the safety lane during a checkup at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.
