{"path":"550300.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene during a misty or foggy sunrise or sunset. The main element is a large, radiant sun that appears oversized and luminous, dominating the upper middle portion of the frame. The sun casts a diffuse, glowing light, filling the scene with yellow and orange hues.\n\nBelow the sun, an industrial landscape is partially visible through a haze. The silhouettes of multiple smokestacks and structures, which likely belong to a factory or power plant, form a dark, intricate skyline against the brightly lit background. Smoke or steam can be seen emitting from several stacks, contributing to the misty atmosphere and blending into the sky.\n\nThe lower part of the image shows a body of water, reflecting the sunlight and mirroring the yellow-orange tones of the sky. The reflection on the water is hazy, enhancing the ethereal quality of the scene. Overall, the photograph captures a moment of industrial activity softened by the natural, atmospheric conditions of the setting.","title":"Smog makes distorting lens for the rising sun and obscures the Cleveland skyline.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550304","545418","547539","548851","545438","544708","547090","548886","544696","546384","553847","545421","545425","550821","551030","545414"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["sun","sunrise","stack","steam","smokestack","haze","orange","sunset","factory","skyline"]}
