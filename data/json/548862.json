{"path":"548862.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a person at work in a laboratory setting, adorned with various pieces of scientific equipment. The individual is focused on measuring or checking something within a large cylindrical metal canister they are holding with their right hand.\n\nThe person, presumably a female based on their appearance, wears a white lab coat which is typical attire for laboratory work. Her hair is short and styled away from her face, ensuring safety and unobstructed vision while handling lab materials.\n\nThe foreground of the image includes laboratory gear such as larger and smaller metal canisters, some marked with identifying numbers like “1995”. There are also plastic jugs with transparent, probably liquid contents, and a couple of sealed bags placed on a counter, which seem to contain some samples or substances that are part of the ongoing experiments or tests.\n\nThe background includes more sophisticated equipment, including an apparatus with various dials and controls, possibly related to the processing or measurement of samples. There is also a benchtop with papers, a typewriter, and what looks like a calculator or a small digital device, perhaps used for data tracking and recording findings.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of scientific activity, focused on research and analysis. The setting is typical of a research or quality control lab used in industries like pharmaceuticals, chemicals, or biotechnology. The composition emphasizes a blend of hands-on manipulative work with scientific equipment and the documentation or analytical tasks that accompany such work.","title":"Laboratory at EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549607","548856","546327","555250","547710","542737","555249","548860","546278","549608","549342","546288","549332","548858","555248","546323"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["lab","laboratory","canister","sample","work","research","control","equipment","documentation","jug"]}
