{"path":"551525.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph depicts a riverside scene on a sunny day. Four people appear to be enjoying the environment, mostly engaging in leisure activities. The setting includes a steep, rocky bank leading down to the river, which reflects the blue of a clear sky. The river edge has concrete structures, possibly part of a pier or riverbank fortification. Above this, there is a larger flat area with what seems to be deteriorating industrial debris and logs scattered around.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, three individuals are seated on the concrete edge, casually dressed for warm weather; two of them wear shorts and are shirtless, suggesting a relaxed or recreational atmosphere. On the right side, a young individual is walking along the riverbank, also dressed in shorts and a tank top, moving towards the water.\n\nThe background features lush green trees, indicating a natural or semi-rural setting near the water. The overall atmosphere is peaceful, with elements suggesting that this location might be a popular spot for local residents to enjoy outdoor activities near the water.","title":"West bank of the Mississippi River near 55th Avenue, north, in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["554475","550232","551499","546811","546803","553439","545941","545933","550228","543943","553441","557740","548006","555376","551415","551538"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["riverbank","short","enjoy","deteriorate","resident","riverside","river","edge","pier","log"]}
