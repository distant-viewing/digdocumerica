{"path":"544666.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a single fruit hanging from a branch, surrounded by lush green leaves. The fruit appears somewhat spherical with a slightly textured surface, indicating it might be unripe or a specific variety that maintains such a texture. Its color is a dull green which blends harmoniously with the green shades of the surrounding leaves.\n\nThe leaves attached to the branch are broad and elongated with visible veins, typical of many fruit-bearing trees. The vegetation suggests a dense, possibly tropical environment given the thickness and moisture apparent on the surfaces and the foliage's overall density.\n\nIn the background, the scene is softly out of focus, creating a depth that emphasizes the fruit in the foreground. This background consists of various shades of green, with the silhouettes of other plants and trees suggesting a forest or bushland setting. The composition of the photograph is nature-centric, focusing on the detailing of the subject (fruit and leaves) while giving a gentle nod to the environment in which it is situated, thereby enhancing the naturalistic feel of the image.","title":"Pond apple","placename":"Ochopee (Fla.)","location":"Ochopee, Florida","nn1":["550461","557593","555338","555337","555363","555007","554993","551356","544731","555368","543488","558077","542688","555053","554744","551355"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fruit","leave","thickness","branch","vein","elongate","detailing","moisture","bear","shade"]}
