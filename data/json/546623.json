{"path":"546623.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban street scene with a shallow depth of field that focuses on a woman in the foreground. The woman is clutching a thick bundle of newspapers with her left arm while her right hand either holds onto or adjusts her eyeglasses. She wears a tan jacket with a textured collar that resembles sheepskin, complemented by a crossbody bag. Her outfit is completed with a patterned, light-colored scarf or shirt visible at the neckline, and she sports large, prominent eyeglasses typical of styles from the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but populated with many other individuals, suggesting a busy city environment. The lighting conditions indicate either early morning or late afternoon, giving the image a somewhat moody ambiance enhanced by the rich purple and blue tones.\n\nThis scene likely represents everyday city life, possibly during a commute or at the end of a workday, emphasizing the hustle and fluidity of urban living. The lady's task of carrying newspapers suggests she might be a vendor or on her way to distribute or return unsold copies. Her expression is serious, reflecting a moment of concentration or preoccupation typical of a busy day.","title":"17th street, nw, near white house.
