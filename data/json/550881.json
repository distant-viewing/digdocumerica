{"path":"550881.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a large outdoor scene displaying heaps of compressed bales of paper waste. These square bales are piled in massive stacks that dominate the composition. Each bale is wrapped haphazardly in what appears to be torn and damaged white paper, giving the stacks a patchy, mottled appearance. In the background, to the right, there is a tall, dark, slim chimney that contrasts sharply with the mostly horizontal composition of the paper bales. The sky is a muted blue, possibly suggesting overcast weather.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a sign fixed to a post that reads \"PRIVATE PROPERTY PLEASE DO NOT TRESPASS\", indicating restricted access to this area. The ground in the vicinity looks barren and is likely a paved or hard-packed surface, typical of industrial or recycling facilities. Overall, the image offers a stark portrayal of waste management and recycling processes.","title":"Bales of stock at the Fort Howard Paper Company form paper pyramids on the banks of Green Bay","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550880","550882","554358","548315","547971","544823","547899","549750","547611","550350","548210","542494","544799","543821","547062","550265"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bale","recycling","paper","stack","waste","portrayal","heap","vicinity","property","access"]}
