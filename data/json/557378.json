{"path":"557378.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph presents a panoramic view of a wooded valley with a small industrial town nestled within. The foreground features residential homes surrounded by lush greenery, including numerous trees and well-maintained lawns.\n\nDominating the middle ground are several buildings of various sizes, with the most prominent structure being a large industrial factory from which a white plume of smoke is rising sharply into the sky. This suggests ongoing industrial operations at the time the picture was taken. The industrial area also includes some silos and additional utility buildings that contribute to the functional aspects of the town.\n\nSeveral train tracks can be seen cutting through the town, indicating the presence of rail transportation which is likely critical for both the residents' connectivity and the industrial activities in the area.\n\nThe background is dominated by densely wooded hills in varying shades of green, cradling the town on all sides. This geographic setting likely provides a natural barrier, enclosing the town in a secluded environment.\n\nThe overall composition and the play of natural and industrial elements speak to a classic small industrial town scene, balancing residential life with the demands and impacts of industry within a rich natural landscape.","title":"Union carbide ferro-Alloy plant seen from deep water.
