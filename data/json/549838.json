{"path":"549838.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban scene focusing on a man taking an action on the street. The man, dressed in a plain white t-shirt and dark pants, appears to be controlling the flow of water from a fire hydrant, which is releasing a powerful jet of water onto the street. His stance shows him bending over, with one arm extended towards the hydrant and the other hand firmly gripping the valve or handle to manage the water flow.\n\nThe street itself shows traces of wetness and the water from the hydrant is creating a dynamic splash on the surface, indicating considerable force. The curb is marked with a yellow line that is slightly worn out, suggesting an area with regular traffic or urban activity. There is a trash bin visible and what appears to be a small, possibly electrical, box on the sidewalk.\n\nThe background is less distinct, though a partial view of a pedestrian railing or a fence near the top right corner suggests a boundary or a separation from another section of the sidewalk or possibly a road. The overall scene captures a moment of urban maintenance or emergency response in a highly textured, almost cinematic approach with the focus clearly on the action and the individual involved in it.","title":"\"Super\" flushes litter from 172nd Street with fire hydrant water","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549841","549834","543804","549063","549078","543795","556177","555482","549056","545074","543792","551869","544832","548373","549070","552751"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["hydrant","sidewalk","flow","street","action","wetness","valve","separation","response","bin"]}
