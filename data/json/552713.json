{"path":"552713.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a busy highway scene, likely from the 1970s or 1980s based on the models of the vehicles shown. The view is from an elevated perspective, looking down onto a multi-lane highway bustling with traffic. Several vehicles, including cars of various types and colors, as well as a large tanker truck with an \"EXXON\" logo, occupy the lanes. The cars are predominantly sedans, typical of the era, featuring both light and dark colors, one notable car is the classic Volkswagen Beetle in a bright yellow color.\n\nThe scene is framed by a green highway sign in the foreground, indicating the direction to \"South Jersey\" via Interstate 676, with an arrow pointing towards an exit lane on the left. Another sign above the highway provides additional directions and exits, including \"Exit 1 - 20th Street.\" The surroundings feature greenery on either side of the highway, and there are also various billboards and commercial signs, including one that appears to read \"BERE,\" potentially advertising beer.\n\nThe overall composition gives a sense of active, congested urban transportation from decades past, filled with signs of commercial advertisement and dense traffic, all underneath a clear, slightly clouded blue sky. This scene effectively captures the everyday hustle of highway travel in a bygone era.","title":"Schuykill expressway (i-676) speeds traffic between center city and the northern and western suburbs","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["545455","545463","555437","549877","544723","553019","547811","556785","548084","549890","555505","550089","547569","549278","557230","547369"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","exit","lane","direction","sign","tanker","traffic","car","era","pointing"]}
