{"path":"548299.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a sunny outdoor setting with several individuals engaged in activities that suggest a gathering or a work-related event. The focus is on a man standing in the foreground. He is dressed casually in a white, short-sleeve buttoned shirt and jeans, complemented by dark, sturdy boots. He holds a piece of rope or wire in his right hand and carries a woven basket, possibly a fishing net, over his left arm. The expression on his face is neutral and directed towards the camera, providing a sense of engagement with the viewer.\n\nBehind him, slightly out of focus, a woman in a white top and striped shorts walks away from the camera. Beside her, another man, wearing a yellow top, is bending over, handling what appears to be a bucket. This suggests an activity related to either gathering or maintenance work. The setting is a grassy area with sparse vegetation, and the ground is partly covered in gravel or dirt, enhancing the rustic outdoor feel of the scene. The background is mostly clear sky with no visible buildings, emphasizing the openness of the environment.\n\nOverall, the composition and the attire of the individuals suggest a casual, labor-oriented day outdoors, possibly linked to some form of agricultural or gathering work. The clarity and detail in the man's attire and his direct gaze make him the prominent subject against the more softly focused activities around him.","title":"Crayfishermen on River Road, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552570","545401","546380","552571","542548","545087","543781","551463","553093","545371","544408","549036","552301","549120","549051","545219"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["outdoor","work","gathering","basket","openness","net","camera","gaze","top","attire"]}
