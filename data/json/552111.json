{"path":"552111.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph features a small, vibrant green plant centered and supported by three wooden stakes firmly pressed into the dry, cracked earth. The plant appears young, showing a few pairs of healthy, small leaves branching out. The scene is lit under bright sunlight, evident by the clear shadows cast by the stakes on the ground.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but discernible, showing a scattered assembly of items and a rundown structure, possibly an old shed or similar outbuilding surrounded by trees. The overall composition suggests a focus on reclamation or nurturing growth in what appears to be a challenging or neglected environment. The earthly tones and the rough textures in the image emphasize a rustic and natural setting.","title":"On this island in the Kansas River between the 18th Street and East Kansas Avenue bridges, Warren Freeman, a loner, has built the home in which he lives. Freeman has cleared brush and is planting trees and vegetables.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["555667","555884","553361","548060","543622","544889","542573","544440","555188","552428","544451","558080","545724","542610","544887","552435"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["stake","reclamation","outbuilding","assembly","plant","shed","pair","growth","earth","leave"]}
