{"path":"545963.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph portrays a rural landscape scene with several distinct elements that contribute to its composition. At the forefront, a water body reflecting the sky is noticeable, with reeds partially submerged in it. A solitary white bird, possibly an egret or heron, stands in the water, adding a focal point of life and nature amidst the serene setting.\n\nTowards the middle ground of the photo, the terrain transitions from wetland to a grassy field dotted with sparse, leafless trees, suggesting the photo might be taken in late autumn or winter. On the right-hand side in this middle area, there is a simple, open shelter constructed with a metal roof supported by wooden posts, typical of rural utility structures.\n\nIn the background, the scene is dominated by a large oil drilling rig. It is a prominent industrial structure with its towering derrick visible, suggesting an ongoing operation in extracting resources. The contrast between the natural wetland and the mechanical rig emphasizes a juxtaposition between nature and industrial activity.\n\nThe sky appears clear, and the lighting in the photograph suggests it might be either late afternoon or early morning, contributing to the soft lighting on the landscape. No people are visible in the scene, which gives a sense of solitude and quiet, except for the distant rig, which hints at human activity nearby.","title":"Egret in canal along Highway 306","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544272","553086","544695","545827","554807","546109","545008","552990","545167","546974","549211","544289","544179","555590","542589","546064"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["rig","wetland","egret","heron","extract","reed","shelter","oil","resource","bird"]}
