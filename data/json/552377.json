{"path":"552377.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts two men engaged in technical or scientific work in an office setting. The individual in the foreground, only partially visible, is seated and focused on writing or recording data on a clipboard resting on his lap, using a pen. He wears a light, short-sleeved shirt patterned with dark checks.\n\nThe second man, more fully visible, sits at a work desk equipped with various controls and monitoring equipment. He is also wearing a light, short-sleeved shirt with broader, darker stripes and appears to be writing or adjusting something on paper. This man is seated near a large, square monitor displaying graphs or data grids, which are slightly visible on the screen.\n\nThe room appears utilitarian, with simple, no-frills furniture including the desk and a sideboard with additional papers and possibly other monitoring devices. The ambient environment suggests a focus on functionality over aesthetics, typical of professional or industrial workspaces used for monitoring, data collection, or analysis purposes. The presence of dated computer and electronic equipment indicates the photograph could be from an earlier time, likely before the advent of modern digital interfaces.","title":"Los angeles reactive pollutant program (larpp), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552356","552386","551900","551905","555334","542659","549610","549378","551904","549367","557317","551901","542765","542665","551902","546285"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["datum","monitoring","desk","paper","recording","screen","clipboard","writing","sleeve","interface"]}
