{"path":"552044.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of urban juxtaposition, where natural and industrial elements are intermingled. In the foreground, there is a clutter of rusted, twisted metal pieces and debris that are scattered amongst overgrown green bushes and grass. These remnants might be parts of discarded machinery or vehicles, illustrating a scene of decay and neglect.\n\nIn the background, contrasting sharply with the dilapidated foreground, is a modern elevated highway that stretches across the frame from left to right. The highway is supported by tall, sturdy concrete columns. It appears busy, suggesting functionality and movement, in stark contrast to the abandoned debris in the front.\n\nBeyond the highway, the cityscape includes a number of buildings, which vary in height and architecture, under a clear blue sky. These buildings are relatively modern, with visible rectangular and square windows, and they contribute to the impression of an active urban environment. The scene is bathed in bright sunlight, highlighting the contrast between the neglected fore and the active background, and symbolizing a possible narrative of urban expansion or renewal overshadowing the old and forgotten.","title":"Buffalo skyway near downtown section of city passes over a scrap metal dump","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["552043","558084","549638","549958","545146","557283","545851","553475","545988","551521","549782","550153","550203","546816","546400","549777"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["highway","overshadow","twiste","remnants","expansion","symbolize","debris","dilapidate","functionality","elevated"]}
