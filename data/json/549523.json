{"path":"549523.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph showing a densely packed landscape characterized by industrial and suburban elements. In the foreground, you can see a highway bustling with cars flanked by large commercial buildings with flat roofs. Beside the highway, there are expansive parking lots filled with vehicles, suggesting the presence of considerable commercial or industrial activity.\n\nMoving further into the middle of the image, there's a large cluster of industrial buildings emitting significant amounts of smoke or steam, indicating active production or processing facilities. This smoke contributes to a slight haze over the area, possibly affecting air quality.\n\nAs the view extends towards the background, the landscape is interspersed with patches of greenery, including what appear to be fields, trees, and possibly small water bodies reflecting light. This mix of vegetation amidst the industrial setting adds a contrasting natural element to the predominantly built environment.\n\nThe far backdrop fades into a bluish haze, likely due to atmospheric perspective, which provides a sense of depth to the image. The overall composition is framed by a clear sky visible in the upper regions, suggesting the photograph was taken during fair weather.\n\nThe photograph provides a comprehensive view that captures the intersection of industrial development and natural landscapes, common in suburban areas expanding into previously rural or underdeveloped regions.","title":"Helicopter view of the industrial area south of Buffalo","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["555755","548433","553936","551174","553969","553706","548434","547764","545382","555745","547122","555761","548411","555752","555744","558112"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["highway","haze","expand","smoke","region","affect","production","intersection","amount","steam"]}
