{"path":"543705.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up portrait of an East Asian man holding a small cup with both hands near his lips, as if he is sipping from it or about to sip. The man has a sturdy build and appears middle-aged, with dark, slightly messy hair and prominent glasses speckled with what looks like tiny raindrops or dust. His complexion is textured, possibly with dust or oil, and he wears a light-colored, rugged work shirt that looks worn and slightly dirty, suggesting he might have been engaging in some form of physical labor.\n\nThe background is indistinct and blurred, focusing the viewer's attention on the man's facial expression and the cup. The man's eyes are slightly narrowed, either from the steam of a hot drink or from focusing his attention on the cup. His facial expression carries a hint of weariness or resolve. The photograph captures a moment that feels intimate and candid, showcasing a slice of daily life likely set in a working environment.","title":"'Uranium miner'","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["553053","542784","543713","545974","546636","556443","557035","557034","556524","558268","555532","556563","555297","554846","552871","556540"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["cup","dust","complexion","lip","man","build","drink","portrait","attention","expression"]}
