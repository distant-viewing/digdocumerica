{"path":"555023.jpg","date":"April 1968","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a dense, textured pattern of natural growth that appears to be aquatic in nature. The image primarily features a collection of hundreds of small, star-shaped objects floating closely together across the entire frame. These objects have a bright green hue with tips that are slightly yellowish or whitish, suggesting they could be some type of water plant or algae.\n\nTheir structure consists of multiple slender, radiating filaments that join at a center point, creating a star-like shape. The filaments taper from the center outward, becoming finer at the tips. Throughout the arrangement, different lighting or minor variations in color give the impression of depth, with some stars appearing more vibrant and others more subdued, possibly due to shadow or overlapping.\n\nThe background of the photograph is dark, which enhances the contrast of the green star-like features, making them stand out more prominently. The dark background could be the water or a shadowed underlay that these plants are floating on or over.\n\nOverall, the composition is finely detailed, focusing on the repetitive, closely packed pattern of these natural elements. There is no visible presence of human activity or man-made objects in the frame, creating an undisturbed naturalistic exhibit.","title":"Dry ground moss cover in a Douglas fir forest in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555069","555022","543555","543566","543558","543187","546156","555044","542582","554993","555031","551354","555019","555052","555838","548720"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["star","tip","object","exhibit","algae","plant","pattern","variation","center","collection"]}
