{"path":"554192.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features an elderly couple standing in front of a small, light gray-sided house. The man, positioned on the left, wears a light-colored shirt and dark trousers. He has a slightly solemn expression and sports a receding hairline and glasses. His right arm is bent, and he is leaning slightly towards the woman.\n\nThe woman, to the man's right, is dressed in a long-sleeve flannel shirt with a plaid pattern and light-colored pants. She wears glasses, has short gray hair, and appears to be smiling gently.\n\nThe house behind them has a simple, white door and basic concrete steps leading up to it. Thereâ€™s a chimney visible to the right of the house, and it appears to be constructed with a different, lighter material than the rest of the building.\n\nIn the background, there is a well-kept lawn and a woodpile neatly stacked against a small, dark wooden shed. Trees are faintly visible in the distant background, suggesting a rural or suburban setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a serene and somewhat pensive moment between two elderly individuals, possibly reflecting on their life together in what appears to be a quiet, residential setting. The image has a vintage feel, perhaps taken in the late 20th century, suggesting a moment of everyday life preserved in time.","title":"Mr. and Mrs. Dwight Rogers, a retired couple, live on a small farm near Grygla.
