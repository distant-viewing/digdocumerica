{"path":"542794.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph features an ornate street clock prominently situated in the foreground. The clock face is white with black numerals and has a label around the central axis that reads “G. MATHE’S JEWELER”. The numerals from 9 to 3 are distinctly visible, complemented by two black clock hands indicating a time. The clock has an elegant, vintage look, characteristic of traditional street clocks often found outside jewelers or established businesses.\n\nThe background includes an architectural view of a classical building with richly detailed cornices and decorative elements on the facade. The building is multi-storied, and emphasizes Victorian or Edwardian architectural style with its molding details and a balcony-like feature with ornamented railings visible atop the first story. \n\nThe overall composition of the photograph utilizes perspective effectively, with the clock appearing to emerge from the corner of the building, engaging viewers with a diagonal interaction between the two main subjects. The lighting suggests it is a bright day, casting clear shadows and highlights which accentuate the finer points of both the clock and the architectural features in the background. The sky is lightly colored, suggesting a clear or slightly overcast day. The side of another building partially frames the left side of the image, adding depth to the scene.","title":"California--humboldt coast","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["546490","546557","551447","556128","546499","557084","546508","549974","550062","555379","557635","558030","557074","557631","545870","549997"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["clock","cornice","molding","establish","building","street","emerge","balcony","utilize","detail"]}
