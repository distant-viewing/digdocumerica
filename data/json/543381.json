{"path":"543381.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures three hikers ascending a rugged mountain trail. They are equipped with large, heavily loaded backpacks and dressed in hiking attire suitable for variable mountain climates, including boots and long pants.\n\nThe terrain they navigate is rocky and steep, interspersed with patches of snow, indicating that this hike is taking place either in early summer when snow still lingers, or at high altitude where snow is persistent. The surrounding landscape features more rock formations and sparse vegetation, typical of an alpine environment.\n\nThe sky is clear, suggesting fair weather, which is favorable for hiking. The bright sunlight casts distinct shadows and illuminates the rocky landscape, enhancing the rugged texture of the terrain. In the background, a mountain peak can be seen, which may serve as either their destination or a scenic backdrop for their journey. The hikers appear engaged in their endeavor, focused on the path ahead and the physical challenge of their ascent.","title":"Packing expedition of explorer post 397 of Los Angeles area.
