{"path":"555996.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features an African American man in his thirties seated inside a bus. He wears a white double-breasted suit with a black bow tie and a detailed trim on the jacket cuffs, displaying a red chevron with a white insert. The man has a contemplative expression, resting his chin on his fist while his elbow is propped up on the armrest of the seat.\n\nThe interior of the bus includes rows of soft, cushioned seats covered with a textured fabric, contrasting with a design of wicker-style backings that climb up to the windows. The windows reveal a faint, blurred greenery, indicating the bus is likely in motion or parked in a leafy area.\n\nHis gaze is directed out of the frame, suggesting deep thought or observation. Natural light filters through the windows, casting soft shadows and highlighting his facial features, especially around his cheekbones and eyes, adding depth to his contemplative demeanor. The bus environment suggests a setting from mid to late 20th century, potentially during a significant event or journey given the subject's formal attire and pensive mood.","title":"Waiter in the lounge car of the southwest limited passenger train enroute between Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Dodge City Kansas, takes a brief rest between serving passengers.
