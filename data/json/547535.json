{"path":"547535.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, somewhat eerie rural landscape during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the warm, soft light. In the foreground, tall golden grasses cover much of the scene, interspersed with bare small patches of earth and low vegetation. The focus point of the image is an old, abandoned car partially enveloped by the grass. The car is rusted and decrepit, contributing to a sense of decay and abandonment.\n\nThe background is defined by a line of tall trees, which are silhouetted against a hazy, diffused light. The trees appear leafless, suggesting that the season might be late autumn or winter. Through the haze, a faintly visible fence line can be discerned, hinting at structured land division, possibly for agricultural use.\n\nOverall, the composition evokes a mood of solitude and nostalgia, heightened by the natural palette of browns and the soft, dim lighting. The scene is quiet and devoid of any visible human presence, emphasizing the themes of neglect and the passage of time.","title":"Nearby fields are full of smoke from open burning in city dump.","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["550795","552673","550797","547771","553007","550279","546154","554561","549107","554920","552515","553008","557013","553010","543354","546405"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["division","nostalgia","grass","sunrise","passage","line","car","autumn","winter","abandonment"]}
