{"path":"554033.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint white church with a traditional steeple, set against a vivid background of blue sky and fluffy white clouds hovering over distant mountains. The church, which features classic architecture with a pointed roof and a small front porch, sits amidst a serene landscape.\n\nIn the foreground, vibrant and colorful flowers frame the bottom of the image, with a mix of reds and yellows creating a lively contrast to the muted white and green tones of the church and landscape. These plants include long, spear-like leaves and open blossoms, adding an organic texture to the composition.\n\nA small graveyard can be seen beside the church, with several modest headstones scattered across the area, suggesting a longstanding community presence. The setting is peaceful and isolated, highlighting the church as a focal point in a rural or small-town environment.","title":"St.  Joseph catholic church, built in 1876","placename":"Molokai (Hawaii)","location":"Molokai, Hawaii","nn1":["554035","554208","550287","554207","556480","557088","547333","547346","558024","546455","557758","558019","547440","558023","558034","557951"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["church","hover","headstone","blossom","steeple","yellow","muted","isolate","porch","amidst"]}
