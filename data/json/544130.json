{"path":"544130.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This is a vibrant and detailed photograph capturing activity at a bustling marina during what appears to be late-afternoon due to the warm lighting. The image shows several boats moored in calm blue waters, with a variety of vessels visible including a sailboat with its large boom extended and multiple motorboats. Some of these boats possess distinct features, such as the sailboat named \"CANYON TOURS INC\" and another marked \"DIRA CRAFT.\"\n\nIn the foreground, a small motorboat with two occupants is moored alongside a dock. A person wearing a dark-colored jacket seems to be stepping onto the boat while another individual inside the boat looks on.\n\nOn the dock, three people are engaged in activities; two are walking and one is standing, looking towards the boats. The individuals are dressed casually, suitable for a day at the marina, with one wearing a hat, enhancing the leisurely atmosphere of the scene.\n\nThe backdrop features a large hill or low mountain, suggesting a coastal or lakeside setting with rugged terrain. The lighting casts an intense hue likely indicative of sunset, adding a serene and picturesque quality to the scene. The water reflects the color of the sky, deepening the sense of a peaceful evening setting.","title":"Lake Powell","placename":"Arizona","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554659","542912","542871","545155","552028","544661","542902","548075","548078","543545","557450","543246","546935","546388","546877","548543"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","motorboat","marina","sailboat","dock","occupant","boom","lakeside","vessel","sunset"]}
