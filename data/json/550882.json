{"path":"550882.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph portrays an industrial scene, primarily featuring a large stack of baled and compacted materials, which appear to be waste or recyclables, possibly paper. These bales are piled high, covering much of the lower central and right-hand portion of the image. Their appearance varies from somewhat dirty white to pale yellow, and some of the bales are bound with wire or straps to keep them compact.\n\nIn the background, an industrial building with a tall chimney and several smaller structures accompanies a multi-leveled roof line. The dark red and gray colors of these buildings contrast with the bales in the foreground. There's a crane visible on the right side behind the stacks, implying ongoing work or transport activities.\n\nThe scene is set against a muted blue sky, and there's rubble and small, scattered debris, likely industrial, in the front area before the bales, suggesting a rough, utilitarian workspace. The overall scene communicates a sense of industrial activity perhaps related to processing, disposal, or recycling of materials. It looks to be a waterfront or riverside industrial zone, as evidenced by what appears to be a water line and more natural rocky elements in the foreground, providing a raw environmental context.","title":"Paper by the ton--in yard of the Fort Howard Paper Company on the shores of Green Bay","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550880","550881","554358","547611","550265","548315","546255","547610","550350","547062","546256","545059","547903","549637","547010","557308"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bale","stack","strap","recycling","rubble","disposal","material","riverside","workspace","line"]}
