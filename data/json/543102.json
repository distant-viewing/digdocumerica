{"path":"543102.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The image shows an active construction or excavation site with a prominent yellow backhoe excavator placed towards the center, extending its arm and digger into a mound of soil. The scene is predominantly filled with large piles of red-brown earth, suggesting recent digging or earth-moving activities.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a \"SOLD\" sign with the logo of \"Bodega Land Company” suggesting that the land has been recently purchased and might be under development. The terrain around the site is relatively flat and covered with sparse green grass, implying a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe landscape is overcast, with a grey sky that suggests either an early morning or a cloudy day. There’s no visible human activity directly, but the presence of the operating excavator implies at least one operator. The overall scene communicates active development and transformation of the land, likely for construction or agricultural purposes.","title":"California--Point Arlina","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553378","544812","552814","545665","554544","543107","553382","545652","555608","557479","554837","547254","547926","556939","543114","555638"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["excavator","digging","earth","development","transformation","site","operator","construction","land","mound"]}
