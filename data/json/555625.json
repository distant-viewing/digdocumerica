{"path":"555625.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a view of a large, open quarry. The quarry appears expansive and is filled with heaps of rubble, stones, and dirt in various shades of brown and gray, indicating recent or ongoing excavation activities. The walls of the quarry are steep and layered, showing different stratifications and earth colors, from dark brown soil at the top to lighter, rocky layers below.\n\nThe top edge of the quarry is lined with a verdant forest, suggesting the quarry is located in a relatively secluded or rural area. The trees are thick and lush, indicating a mature woodland surrounding the area. This foliage creates a vivid contrast between the natural green tones and the otherwise barren, earthy colors of the excavation site.\n\nThe sky is slightly overexposed due to the lighting, giving the impression of a bright, clear day. There are no machines, equipment, or people visible in the shot, presenting the quarry in a state of momentary stillness, possibly abandoned or temporarily inactive. This composition highlights the impact of industrial activities on natural landscapes, capturing both the disruption in the foreground and the untouched nature in the background.","title":"Stripped land after companies have dug coal in southeastern Ohio off route #800 near Barnesville","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["555622","555614","554814","554833","555623","545529","550573","552425","543861","552545","543674","553784","557986","549167","554804","552422"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["quarry","excavation","overexpose","stratification","mature","verdant","layer","disruption","rubble","heap"]}
