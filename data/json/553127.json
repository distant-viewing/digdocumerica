{"path":"553127.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph captures a highway scene that blends both motion and a restive landscape set under a clear blue sky. Prominently in the foreground, a multi-lane highway curves gently through the shot, with a metal guardrail separating the oncoming lanes from the foreground lane. On this highway, cars are seen traveling - one black vintage car is notably closer to the foreground traveling downward along the lane, appearing in slight motion blur, indicating the snapshot was taken as it passed by.\n\nTo the right of the highway, there is an expansive wild area where a significant amount of smoke is rising, suggesting a wildfire. The smoke is thick and widespread, partially obscuring the hills that rise steadily in the background. These hills, covered with sparse vegetation, dominate the scene under the vividly blue sky, adding a sense of magnitude to the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively juxtaposes the dynamic activity of vehicle travel with the static yet dramatic presence of the natural landscape, particularly highlighted by the smoke from the possible wildfire. The perspective provided is that of an observer from slightly above road level, perhaps standing on the opposite side of the highway.","title":"Brush fire along route i-80","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["545367","547294","557471","553124","555630","554155","546733","544598","553785","543891","543988","550600","554566","547298","547302","552596"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["highway","wildfire","lane","smoke","travel","magnitude","motion","guardrail","observer","wild"]}
