{"path":"547873.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of five people, including both adults and children, enjoying time together on a sandy beach. The individuals are casually dressed, suitable for a beach setting; some are in shorts and t-shirts, while others wear light tops and pants. They are seated and lying on the sand, engaging playfully and posing for the photo. Various personal items such as shoes and a towel are scattered around them.\n\nIn the background, there are large residential buildings and a partly cloudy sky, indicating that this beach is adjacent to an urban area. The beach itself has sparse vegetation and is littered with driftwood and some debris, suggesting a natural, somewhat undeveloped shore environment.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a moment of leisure and relaxation, with the group clearly enjoying the outdoor setting and each other's company amidst an urban backdrop.","title":"Performing for the photographer on Plum Beach","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543534","548541","556297","547974","543216","547009","550243","546874","544206","550932","555923","543325","543225","547628","550919","545162"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","driftwood","towel","group","company","t","relaxation","shoe","sand","short"]}
