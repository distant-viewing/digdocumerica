{"path":"545173.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a serene coastal landscape, primarily featuring an expansive view of the ocean with rugged rock formations emerging from the sea. The foreground is framed by dark green, dense foliage, likely coniferous trees, which partially obscure and provide a natural frame for the view. These trees add a sense of depth and perspective to the image.\n\nIn the middle ground, several large, dark, jagged rocks rise steeply from the ocean. The ocean itself appears calm, with light reflecting off its surface, suggesting the photograph was taken on a clear day. The rocks are highlighted against the brighter, slightly hazy backdrop of the open water, creating a striking visual contrast.\n\nThe most prominent rock formation near the center has a sharp, peak-like top, and its rugged texture is evident even from a distance. The play of light and shadow on this formation further emphasizes its dramatic and weather-beaten appearance.\n\nThe composition uses natural lighting, and the color palette is rich with dark greens, deep blues, and rocky grays, reinforcing the wild and natural aesthetic of the scene. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and somewhat isolated, capturing the beauty of untouched natural landscapes by the sea.","title":"Rocky coastline","placename":"Port Orford (Or.)","location":"Port Orford, Oregon","nn1":["543068","543307","543060","545130","545122","542917","543250","553805","543080","543289","543243","543297","543295","543291","543061","545126"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["ocean","rock","formation","beat","sea","emerge","reinforce","gray","peak","aesthetic"]}
