{"path":"548357.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial riverbank scene filled with environmental clutter and activity. The main feature in the image is a group of industrial buildings situated along the edge of a river. These buildings appear worn and slightly decrepit, with dark, stained roofs, and a couple of them emitting plumes of white smoke into the air.\n\nIn the foreground and around the buildings, there is a large accumulation of debris and various materials, which include scraps of metal, broken machinery, and other forms of industrial waste. This accumulation suggests that the site may be used for waste processing or disposal.\n\nThe river itself is on the right side of the image. A barge, densely loaded with trash, is moored at a pier jutting into the water. This barge is parallel to the riverbank and is similar in appearance to the waste seen on the shore, indicating it might be transporting trash from or to the site.\n\nThe background shows a wider view of the river bending away, with more industrial infrastructure barely visible through a hazy sky that could be polluted. The overall atmosphere of the photograph conveys a sense of heavy industrial use and environmental neglect. The mood is further intensified by the muddy tones and the lack of vibrant natural color, hinting at pollution and ecological degradation.","title":"Docks at Fresh Kills on Staten Island.
