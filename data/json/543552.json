{"path":"543552.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a lakeside scene with a foreground cluttered with various objects and debris against a tranquil and scenic backdrop. In the foreground, there is a mix of large, smooth stones and scattered pieces of wood. Prominently featured are several black rubber tires and a large black barrel, suggesting a utilitarian or discarded state. Pieces of metal and wiring frame the scene, adding to the sense of neglect or disrepair.\n\nThe wooden planks, possibly parts of a broken dock or pathway, lie haphazardly among the rocks. This creates a stark contrast between the man-made waste and the natural beauty of the setting.\n\nBeyond this littered shore, the lake appears serene and vast, reflecting a clear blue sky. The water extends toward a mountain range in the distance, which is capped with snow, suggesting a cold climate or high altitude. The mountains are backlit by a bright, clear sky, devoid of any clouds, which enhances the visibility and the dramatic impact of the snow peaks.\n\nTo the right, along the shoreline, a line of coniferous trees is visible, further framing the lake and adding a touch of vibrant green that contrasts with the more muted tones of the rocks and debris in the foreground.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes natural beauty with human neglect, creating a powerful visual statement about environmental impact. The image is striking both for its scenic qualities and the environmental narrative it suggests.","title":"Litter-strewn Lake Tahoe shore","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["547689","550687","550352","555388","543600","555383","551519","548034","543547","552080","543816","544042","543769","543687","552900","555079"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["neglect","snow","statement","rubber","lake","piece","impact","mountain","rock","debris"]}
