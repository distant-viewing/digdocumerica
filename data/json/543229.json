{"path":"543229.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene centered around the construction of a large wooden structure, possibly as part of a scouting activity. In the foreground, a young man dressed in a scout uniform, complete with badges and a neckerchief, is engaged in the act of lashing together wooden poles. He is focused on his task, using a rope to bind the poles.\n\nAbove and behind him, a complex and large wooden scaffold structure dominates the scene. Several youths are visible on different levels of this structure. Some are sitting on the higher tiers, actively participating in the construction, while others appear to be climbing or adjusting the wooden poles. The construction is intricate, made up of numerous poles crossed and bound together, forming a sort of temporary building or large piece of installation art.\n\nIn the background of the image, a suburban landscape is visible, with hints of residential homes and well-maintained lawns. The vegetation suggests a park or a spacious backyard setting.\n\nThe sky is clear with some cumulus clouds, suggesting a bright, fair-weather day, ideal for outdoor activities. The overall scene is bustling with energy, collaboration, and a strong sense of community and teamwork among the young individuals involved.","title":"Scout-o-rama","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543176","546018","543486","543441","554450","543594","543228","551677","545311","555931","556536","557943","557775","543230","553424","544829"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["pole","construction","scaffold","collaboration","cumulus","tier","backyard","youth","act","teamwork"]}
