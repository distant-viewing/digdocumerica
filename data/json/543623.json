{"path":"543623.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up view of a delicate flower, capturing its intricate details with precision. The prominent feature of the image is the flower itself, which appears to have small, soft petals primarily in a pale color, possibly white. The petals are surrounded by multiple stamens, each tipped with dark anthers that are sharply in focus, contrasting sharply against the softer texture of the petals.\n\nGlistening droplets, likely dew or rain, adorn the flower, enhancing its ethereal quality and adding a fresh, moist look. These droplets are particularly noticeable, reflecting light and creating tiny sparkles on the flower.\n\nThe foliage in the background is blurred, featuring shades of dark and muted greens, which subtly complements the delicate, light-colored petals in the foreground. This creates a smooth bokeh effect that isolates the flower, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention squarely on the central subject.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a gentle, tranquil, and almost dreamy aesthetic, emphasizing the beauty and fragility of natural flora through a close and intimate perspective. The composition expertly utilizes depth of field to highlight the textural contrasts within the flower.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California.","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["555035","554586","550464","557618","555055","554574","543597","545695","553368","558077","544875","554840","557487","553361","555189","542969"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["petal","flower","droplet","stamen","sparkle","dew","precision","flora","rain","aesthetic"]}
