{"path":"545301.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph offers a beautiful natural landscape, primarily featuring a river in the foreground and rocky canyon walls in the background. The river appears crystal clear with visible pebbles at the bottom, highlighted by sparkles on the water's surface due to the sunlight, indicating some movement in the water, perhaps gentle rapids or a steady stream flow. The color of the river varies from pale blue to brownish, reflecting the colors of the environment.\n\nThe surrounding canyon walls are richly textured and predominantly red, suggesting they are possibly sandstone, a common geological feature in canyon areas like those found in the Southwestern United States. These towering cliffs have various striations and erosion patterns that indicate natural weathering processes.\n\nGreen vegetation sporadically lines the riverbank, hinting at life in this arid region. The sky above is vivid blue with no visible clouds, adding a sense of aridity and clarity to the day when the photo was taken.\n\nOverall, the image depicts a serene and isolated wilderness area, possibly within a desert canyon environment, emphasizing the quiet beauty and rugged terrain typical of such regions. The perspective and composition of the photograph draw the viewer's eye from the flowing water in the foreground to the imposing cliffs in the background, creating a sense of depth and expansiveness.","title":"Escalante river","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["544929","545798","543793","544748","545632","543789","543647","548156","545794","545633","545765","545640","544863","553653","545629","543976"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["canyon","cliff","river","brownish","flow","striation","sandstone","expansiveness","region","sparkle"]}
