{"path":"546406.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph presents a striking and somewhat incongruous scene along a tropical seaside. In the forefront, a severely damaged and abandoned car chassis sits directly on the rocky shore, stripped of most of its features, showing exposed metal and signs of deterioration.\n\nRising prominently behind this derelict car is a single tall palm tree, positioned centrally in the composition. The palm tree stands erect with a full crown of leaves that slightly sway to one side, suggesting a gentle wind might be present. Its presence provides a natural and lively contrast to the decay seen in the car below.\n\nThe background consists of a calm ocean that stretches across the horizon, meeting a clear blue sky peppered with fluffy, white clouds. The seascape and sky together convey a typical idyllic tropical setting, which juxtaposes sharply with the abandoned wreckage in the foreground. This composition might evoke reflections on nature versus human impact or abandonment in a place that otherwise appears like a paradise.","title":"Abandoned car under a palm tree at rincon","placename":"Mayagüez (P.R.)","location":"Mayagüez, Puero Rico","nn1":["548750","553007","548752","547835","546318","547484","549107","553010","547035","546405","543680","547481","547601","546315","553009","547923"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["palm","abandon","chassis","crown","car","pepper","sway","wreckage","seaside","deterioration"]}
