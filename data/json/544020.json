{"path":"544020.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures a sunset backdrop with a vivid orange sky gradually darkening into deeper shades of orange and purple towards the upper and lower parts of the image. Prominently in the foreground, there are multiple electricity pylons, which are silhouetted against the vibrant skyâ€”these tall structures with several crossbars stand out starkly, with power lines faintly visible running between them.\n\nOn the right side of the photo, partially silhouetted against the less illuminated sky beyond the sun, there are two tall buildings under construction; their skeletal frameworks are visible and they are shrouded with construction mesh. These towers are surrounded by various other smaller structures, possibly part of the urban landscape or additional constructions related to the towers.\n\nIn the upper middle portion of the image, slightly to the left, the disc of the sun is seen glowing brightly. It is a large, well-defined circle, slightly overexposed, adding intensity to the sky around it.\n\nThe bottom of the image shows a silhouette of uneven terrain or low-lying vegetation, contributing to the layers of the horizon line that add depth to the scene. The overall atmosphere conveyed in the photograph is one of industrial development encroaching upon natural or rural landscapes, highlighted by the twilight set against human-made structures.","title":"Valley national bank's 35-storey building near sky harbor airport","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["544011","549011","543926","543903","548851","549020","553830","546389","543965","545418","546384","545425","545430","545438","558140","545410"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["silhouet","construction","towers","overexpose","encroach","sun","pylon","electricity","circle","darken"]}
