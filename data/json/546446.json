{"path":"546446.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of maintenance work being done on a two-story brick house, nestled in a lush, green environment. The house is traditional in architectural style, with white-framed windows and a dark roof.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several mature trees with dense, vibrant green leaves, partially obscuring the view of the house. The landscaping around the house includes finely cut grass and some blooming shrubs which add a touch of color to the scene.\n\nTwo people are visible in the photo, involved in the maintenance work. The first person is on the ground, wearing a pink shirt and dark pants, seemingly overseeing the work or preparing to assist. The second person is on a ladder leaning against the building, halfway up the wall near a window. This person is dressed in white, which might indicate that the task involves painting or cleaning. The person is reaching towards the roof, perhaps inspecting or fixing a part of the fa√ßade or the gutter.\n\nA ladder is securely placed against the house, and there's another visible ladder near the chimney, suggesting that the work might involve different parts of the house's exterior.\n\nIn terms of the broader setting, a partial view of a light-colored vehicle can be spotted on the left side of the frame, providing a bit of context to the era or environment surrounding the household activities. The overall atmosphere appears calm and peaceful, characterized by a focus on home improvement in a serene suburban setting.","title":"Restoration of franklin square area","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["548556","557094","556426","546439","555615","558153","553471","546435","546434","546438","557063","558110","546441","546437","551058","549279"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["ladder","house","person","work","maintenance","involve","cleaning","fix","painting","do"]}
