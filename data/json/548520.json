{"path":"548520.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a powerboat cruising at a high speed across a large body of water. The boat, a sleek, white cabin cruiser, is in full motion with visible splashes and waves being churned by its powerful movement. There are at least two people visible on the boat; both appear to be enjoying the ride, sitting near the stern.\n\nIn the background, the calm sea extends to the horizon where it meets a slightly hazy sky. There are a few other boats dotted around the distance, including sailboats with their sails fully hoisted, indicating a breezy day. The overall scene exudes a sense of leisure and recreation typically associated with boating on a clear day. The environment suggests this might be a popular area for boating, possibly near a coast or a large lake. The lighting and color saturation suggest that this could be either late morning or early afternoon.","title":"Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["550840","546049","552050","548525","546317","545156","548736","546912","545057","542697","548080","547685","547708","551308","558234","546348"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","cruiser","boating","coast","ride","recreation","saturation","speed","sail","sailboat"]}
