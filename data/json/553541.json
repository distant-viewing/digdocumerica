{"path":"553541.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts two women sitting side by side on a patterned sofa that appears to be covered with a large, ornate throw. The sofa is situated in a room with a simple, somewhat worn interior, which includes a linoleum floor with visible marks and scuffs. To the left of the sofa, there is a dark folding chair and another chair with armrests placed near the wall.\n\nThe woman on the left appears younger and is holding a beverage can, while looking slightly towards the other woman. She is dressed in a light-colored striped top with dark stripes and matching dark pants. Her facial expression is somewhat contemplative.\n\nThe woman on the right is wearing a bright red dress and has her arms resting comfortably on the back of the sofa. Her pose and facial expression convey a relaxed demeanor. She seems to be engrossed in listening or perhaps in a conversation.\n\nThe setting gives a casual and intimate glimpse into a moment shared between the two, suggesting a relaxed, homey atmosphere. The overall mood is quiet and subdued, with no overt action taking place, but rather an everyday scene of shared space and possibly shared companionship.","title":"Mrs. May Watkins and one of her nine children in the living room of their Mulky Square home.
