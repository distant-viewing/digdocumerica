{"path":"555080.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene aquatic scene, featuring a group of lily pads floating on the surface of a body of water. The lily pads are of varying sizes and their round, waxy leaves are mottled with spots and slightly curled edges, suggesting natural age and exposure to the elements. The leaves shimmer with droplets of water, reflecting sunlight, which adds a glittering effect to the scene.\n\nThe water itself is dark and calm, mirroring the deep blue of a clear sky, and it sparkles with reflections of light, resembling a starry night. This effect enhances the tranquil and somewhat mystical ambiance of the setting. Above the water, the sky is not visible, suggesting that the viewpoint is focused closely on the water surface and the floating foliage.\n\nNo people or man-made objects are visible, emphasizing a natural, untouched environment. The composition of the photograph combines the tranquility of still water with the delicate texture and form of the lily pads, creating a peaceful, naturalistic snapshot. The lighting, primarily coming from above, highlights portions of the lily pads and creates contrasting areas of light and shadow on their surfaces, further accentuating their forms and the overall lushness of the water plant life.","title":"Water lilies in the tin mine lake in Kitsap County, Washington near Seattle","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544592","543598","550809","544588","544474","554583","550808","554584","558095","547639","550775","543561","551352","545387","550786","550784"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lily","pad","water","float","glitter","lushness","curl","effect","surface","sparkle"]}
