{"path":"548636.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph depicting a coastal region with a mix of developed and natural landscapes. The area captured includes sections of land separated by waterways. \n\nTo the left of the image, there's a densely populated area with rows of trees and structures, likely residential houses, aligned along grid-like streets beside a long, straight canal or waterway. The right side of the image shows a strikingly different scene with several rectangular plots separated by water channels, resembling canals or man-made inlets, suggesting an area of land development, possibly for housing or commercial purposes.\n\nThe water around the area looks shallow and clear as we can see the seabed or sand patches through it. There are also a few small islands with dense vegetation scattered within the water body, enhancing the natural beauty of the area.\n\nThe background is dominated by a vast body of water, indicating the proximity of this region to a sea or large lake, with the horizon meeting a clear sky.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph provides a contrast between natural landscapes and human development, depicting how land is being utilized and altered near coastal regions.","title":"Land development at Summerland Key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548779","548780","548643","553945","557451","547508","557452","544635","544670","548638","557504","557462","548628","547629","557453","543015"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["canal","region","waterway","land","development","inlet","plot","housing","channel","island"]}
