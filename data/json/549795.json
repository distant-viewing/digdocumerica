{"path":"549795.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene at a landfill or waste management site, characterized by large piles of mixed garbage. Dominating the foreground is a sprawling mass of debris which includes different colors and types of waste, from apparent household or consumer remnants to segments of larger debris. There appears to be a mixture of mangled metal pieces, plastics, and other unrecognizable refuse mingled together.\n\nIn the background, taking a central position, is a large, heavy-duty yellow vehicle, seemingly a bulldozer or similar type of machinery, often used in such environments for moving large quantities of waste. The vehicle emits slight dark fumes, suggesting it is in operation. The cabin of the bulldozer is visible, showing glass-paned windows reflecting some sunlight.\n\nTo the left of the bulldozer, there is another significant piece of equipment: a large, open-top metal container that is tilted downwards, from which it seems debris or waste is either being dumped out or somehow processed.\n\nThe background displays a bright, clear sky which contrasts with the darker tones of the accumulated waste and the heavy machinery. This combination of machinery, waste, and operations underscores the industrial and utilitarian nature of the setting.","title":"At Staten Island landfill.
