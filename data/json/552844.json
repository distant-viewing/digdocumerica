{"path":"552844.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph presents a dense, verdant forest as viewed from an elevated perspective, possibly from an aircraft or a tall vantage point. The forest canopy is lush, showing a consistent cover of green foliage that extends across the entire image. Several light-colored streaks, which appear to be trails of mist or fog, snake through the forest, adding a mysterious and ethereal quality to the scene. The mist partially obscures the tree tops in some areas, creating a layered effect of visibility with varying shades of green and grey. The photograph has a serene and untouched quality, suggesting a remote and possibly vast woodland area. The overall lighting is soft and diffuse, likely due to overcast or foggy conditions, enhancing the sense of depth and tranquility.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi river reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
