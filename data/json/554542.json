{"path":"554542.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor setting where a large flock of birds, specifically gulls, is seen in mid-flight above a dumpsite. The foreground shows mounds of garbage over which the birds are flying, likely searching for food. On the right side of the image, there is a large yellow bulldozer, indicating active work or management of the dumpsite area. The background is composed of a dense line of conifers, typical of a forested area, and beyond these trees, mountainous terrain can be partially glimpsed under an overcast sky. A sign with the words \"DUMP HERE\" is visible near the bulldozer, providing further context to the function of the area as a waste disposal site. The overall setting suggests a rural or semi-remote location where wildlife interacts with human-affected landscapes.\n","title":"Herring gulls and trash at the Lake Placid, New York landfill, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
