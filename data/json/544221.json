{"path":"544221.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a group of four young boys gathered at what appears to be a lakeside setting. The setting is rural, with a body of water that has floating vegetation, possibly lily pads, and a murky, calm surface reflecting some light from the sky.\n\nThree of the boys are on a rugged, wooden dock or bank that extends into the water, while one is on the grassy shore. The boy on the far left is wearing a blue, rolled-sleeve shirt and dark pants, seemingly occupied with trying to open or fix a small hand-held device. The second boy from the left wears a light blue checkered shirt and is in motion, turned away from the camera, watching something in the distance.\n\nThe third boy, central in the frame and slightly forward, is shirtless and wrapped in a light cloth around his lower body, potentially a towel. He is wielding a spear-like stick and pointing it toward the water, giving the impression he might be aiming at a fish or trying to reach something in the lake.\n\nThe fourth boy, on the right, stands by himself in a dark plaid shirt, seemingly lost in thought or watching the ground. His attention appears directed down toward where the spear is pointed, though his expression and stance suggest contemplation or mild disinterest.\n\nThe mood evoked is one of casual, unsupervised play and exploration, typical of youthful summers spent outdoors. The background, featuring trees and overhanging branches, encloses the scene, creating a feeling of seclusion and a slice of life by the water's edge.","title":"Fishermen's sons practice target shooting in Bayou Gauche","placename":"Louisiana","location":"Louisiana","nn1":["553431","546940","552828","544805","553448","550776","544229","544194","551022","544211","544204","550231","543677","554517","554499","551392"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["boy","try","watch","wield","lily","pad","lose","fix","shirt","cloth"]}
