{"path":"552054.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a water surface, littered with debris and natural materials. The foreground prominently features muddy, brown water, possibly indicative of stagnant or slow-moving water. Floating on the surface and partially submerged are various forms of debris including leaves, sticks, and possibly trash items, which are not clearly identifiable but contribute to a sense of pollution or neglect.\n\nThe composition is mostly filled with these elements, creating a texture-rich scene that highlights environmental issues such as water pollution. The color palette is muted with different shades of browns and darks, suggesting either the time of day being either early morning or late evening, or simply the nature of the stagnant water. There is no discernible activity, suggesting a static, possibly neglected environment. The lack of vibrant life forms (like fish or water birds) further underscores this sense of abandonment.","title":"Sewer outlet on the north side of the 12th street bridge showing oil discharged into the Kansas river","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["555784","550812","548090","543302","547541","550207","550368","547537","555547","546838","552046","549641","552158","547524","550352","544175"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollution","water","neglect","mute","dark","debris","stick","form","issue","bird"]}
