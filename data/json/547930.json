{"path":"547930.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This is a vibrant and colorful photograph capturing a moment on a sunny day, presumably in a suburban neighborhood. The setting includes well-maintained single-family homes with distinct mid-century modern architecture, featuring clean lines and large windows. In the foreground, there is a sidewalk lined with a neatly trimmed grass lawn.\n\nCentral to the image are three young girls walking towards the camera, each carrying colorful Easter baskets filled with eggs and other goodies, suggesting that the photo was taken during an Easter celebration. The girls are dressed in festive clothing; one wears a yellow dress with a floral pattern, another in a purple poncho-like garment, and the third in a pink poncho and white pants. Their expressions are cheerful, contributing to the festive atmosphere of the occasion.\n\nIn the background, other people can be seen, including a glimpse of another child and adults, adding to the communal and family-oriented nature of the event. Additionally, parked cars along the road and a distant yellow school bus add layers to the suburban setting, portraying a scene full of life and community spirit. The overall composition with bright sunlight and shadows cast on the ground enhances the lively, joyful ambiance of this community gathering.","title":"Youngsters going home from school at Great Kills on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["558131","547934","557290","551084","549028","544806","551736","557365","556169","557272","557055","548441","546545","548574","557428","547433"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["family","girl","spirit","garment","occasion","community","basket","school","celebration","bus"]}
