{"path":"552396.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and scenic outdoor setting, possibly taken during a leisure outing. The setting appears to be a public park or garden area, atop what could be a hill or elevated location, as suggested by the presence of a low stone wall along the edge of the area, which seems to overlook a significant drop.\n\nA mix of visitors, dressed in outfits that hint at this being taken in a cooler season or during an event, occupies the foreground and center of the image. People of various ages and genders are seen engaged in conversation or simply enjoying the view.\n\nCentral to the composition is a beautifully maintained garden bed filled with bright red flowers and neatly trimmed yellow and green bushes, lending a vibrant burst of color to the scene. The flowers seem meticulously cared for and are perhaps a focal point for the visitors.\n\nTo the right of the frame, a historical marker on a stone plaque is visible, indicating the areaâ€™s possible historical significance or dedicatory purpose. Nearby, a woman holds a camera, pointing it towards a man standing across from her, capturing a moment of recreational photography.\n\nThe backdrop includes a smattering of trees, and the overcast sky suggests a cloudy day. A section of a red car is visible on the far right, implying the proximity of a parking area and further supporting the idea of a public or tourist-friendly spot.\n\nOverall, the scene is serene and picturesque, with a mix of human interaction, historical context, and natural beauty.","title":"Flower garden in Queen Victoria Park near the edge of the Canadian Niagara Falls","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["557985","552408","549516","557257","552399","551739","551682","552400","551746","544808","551785","551705","558033","557939","551929","551794"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["garden","visitor","plaque","stone","idea","flower","gender","drop","burst","marker"]}
