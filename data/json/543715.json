{"path":"543715.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene featuring a group of boys riding bicycles down a dusty country road. The setting is lush and green, indicating spring or summer. Trees, full in leaf, flank both sides of the road, creating a tunnel-like effect with patches of sunlight filtering through to the ground. The road itself is unpaved, with visible wheel tracks, suggesting it's frequently used despite its rustic appearance.\n\nOn the left side, there is a wooden fence running parallel to the road, which serves as a boundary for a field, hinting at agricultural use, perhaps for grazing or crop cultivation. This fence adds a rustic charm to the scene.\n\nThe boys are spread out along the road. The lead rider looks back towards the others, possibly calling out or chatting, creating a sense of dynamism and interaction within the group. They are dressed in casual, light clothing suitable for outdoor activity, which aligns with the leisurely, carefree mood of the scene.\n\nIn the background, there is a glimpse of a calm body of water, possibly a lake, contributing to the tranquil rural atmosphere. The overall composition of the image, with the road leading the eye towards the scattered group of boys and the distant water body, provides a sense of depth and perspective, making this photograph a charming depiction of youthful freedom and rural beauty.","title":"Bicycling on rural road","placename":"Norwood (Colo.)","location":"Norwood, Colorado","nn1":["543719","551032","551105","557409","547209","546783","544680","548574","552340","557990","545972","545973","544358","546376","551001","547300"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["road","boy","group","fence","dynamism","tunnel","country","freedom","cultivation","rider"]}
