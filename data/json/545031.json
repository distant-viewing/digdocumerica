{"path":"545031.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a natural landscape with a significant presence of water and land elements. A person is captured walking along a narrow path made of rocks beside a body of water. The waterway is relatively calm, with a dark, reflective surface creating a mirror effect of the surrounding areas. The terrain varies in coloration; some areas are sandy, while others have darker soils, and parts of the shoreline are dotted with rubble and larger stones.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there is a foreground detail of green grass and a structure resembling a pipe, which might be indicative of agricultural or irrigation activities. The horizon is vast, showcasing a panoramic view of the body of water stretching into the distance against a clear sky with no visible clouds.\n\nThe colors in the image suggest it might have been taken during late afternoon or evening, given the warm lighting conditions. The overall mood is tranquil, focusing on the interaction of human and natural landscape elements in a sparsely populated area. The person in the image is dressed in casual attire, suitable for an outdoor setting, suggesting a scene of exploration or maintenance activities in a wetland or coastal environment.","title":"The Menasha pulp mill settling pond spills onto the beach and into the bay.
