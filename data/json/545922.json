{"path":"545922.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene outdoor scene with an interesting setup on a wooden platform, likely a pier, over a calm, expansive body of water. In the foreground, there are numerous buckets filled with dark colored material, possibly soil, arranged in grid formations on the platform. These buckets appear functional, used for either an environmental study or plant cultivation. To the right of these buckets, there are several objects including what looks like a motor or pump, and two cylindrical containers, possibly for storage or waste disposal.\n\nThe platform on which these items rest is made of weathered wood planks, some of which are uneven and aged, indicating exposure to the elements over time. The body of water extends to the horizon, merging seamlessly with the sky and reflecting a slight hue from the sky, which adds to the tranquil and flat appearance of the water. There are minimal ripples visible on the water's surface. \n\nIn the distant background, faint mountains or hills are visible, creating a layered effect in the composition and suggesting a secluded location. There are also very thin structures, possibly poles or distant antennas, emerging from the water, barely noticeable against the hazy sky.\n\nThe lighting in the image is soft and appears to be natural sunlight, contributing to the calm and peaceful atmosphere of the setting. The overall composition uses natural lines of the pier and arrangement of buckets to lead the viewer's eye towards the horizon, blending human activity with the natural environment effortlessly.","title":"Truckee River","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["545915","545940","545926","545936","547677","545008","548030","548034","543058","546109","550268","544695","544567","544709","547585","552040"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["bucket","platform","pier","water","antenna","motor","cultivation","disposal","study","horizon"]}
