{"path":"552700.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a young woman exploring a large, ornate fountain. The woman, who has short dark hair and is wearing a red sleeveless top and orange shorts, appears to be carefully standing and balancing on one of the fountain's bronze sculptures. The sculpture she is standing on includes a design that looks like distressed, stylized waves or possibly sea creatures, suggesting a possible aquatic theme of the fountain.\n\nShe is interacting with the piece by looking down, perhaps watching the water flow or examining other details of the sculpture. Her posture suggests she is both cautious and curious as she explores.\n\nThe fountain itself shows detailed, expressive sculpting with parts resembling flowing water or draped fabric, enhancing its dynamic and fluid aesthetic. Streams of water can be seen actively spraying from multiple points of the fountain, hitting the water below and causing ripples and splashes. \n\nIn the background, a soft focus allows for some outlines of trees and what looks like buildings, forming a typical urban park setting, which complements the foreground activity without distracting from it. The lighting in the photograph provides a warm tone, capturing the scene in what might be late afternoon sunlight, which highlights the textures and elements vividly.","title":"Cooling off in one of the fountains around the Philadelphia museum of art","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["550748","551484","551468","553192","549982","551467","553229","551449","553149","553224","550747","551663","552703","549985","551480","552737"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","sculpture","explore","bronze","distress","flow","spraie","stylize","hit","creature"]}
