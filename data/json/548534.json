{"path":"548534.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an interesting display of numerous conch shells arranged in evenly spaced rows on a grainy, dark surface. The shells are predominantly oriented with their openings facing towards the viewer, showcasing their inner pink hues that contrast strikingly against their mostly white, bleached exteriors.\n\nEach conch shell has a distinctive spiraled form with a sharp, pointed tip that resembles a tall spike. Some of the shells are positioned upright, pointing upwards, while others lay on their sides, providing a diversified view of their complex, elaborate structures and the rugged textures of their exteriors.\n\nThe background and floor on which the shells are arranged appear to be made of rough, dark-colored asphalt or coarse sand, adding a rustic feel to the scene. Natural light illuminates the scene, casting shadows behind each shell and highlighting their unique details and colors. The setting suggests an outdoor environment, possibly near a coastal area where these shells might have been collected. The arrangement and presentation give a sense of careful curation, as if the shells are being prepared for display, study, or sale.","title":"Souvenir seashells are lined up for sale here on the southernmost point of the United States.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548530","548538","545082","557605","552941","552866","545186","543264","552867","554094","548282","545310","555552","543191","542738","552304"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["shell","exterior","spiral","arrange","bleach","presentation","asphalt","tip","collect","sale"]}
