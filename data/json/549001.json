{"path":"549001.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a distinctive and colorful directional signpost in a barren landscape. At the top of the post is a sculptural element featuring a white horse on a weathervane-style component, which adds a whimsical touch to the sign. Below this, multiple wooden arrows point in various directions. Each arrow is painted in different colors and inscribed with various names like “The J.C. Kedem’s,\" “The Merry Mahaney’s,\" “Scholl,” “Nagelin’s,\" “Schrell,\" and others. Some arrows also include additional details such as decorative patterns or defining symbols like stars, emphasizing a handmade and personalized appearance.\n\nThe arrows are mounted on a central pole, creating a layered effect that is visually appealing and suggests a multitude of possible routes or destinations, though the actual locations are left to the viewer's imagination. The background of the image is desolate with a clear blue sky and expansive flat terrain, which contains little vegetation, highlighting the isolation of the signpost in this remote setting. The ground is composed of dirt and small rocks, typical of a desert or dry area, which strengthens the rustic, out-of-the-way feel of the scene. The photograph captures a playful yet mysterious atmosphere, inviting curiosity about the destinations and stories behind the names on the signs.","title":"Pointing to homes in the Colorado river area","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["543104","545824","545591","545620","544845","544182","547782","545624","558138","547522","544245","545826","548670","543637","549454","545349"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["arrow","signpost","inscribe","personalize","name","handmade","multitude","destination","star","symbol"]}
