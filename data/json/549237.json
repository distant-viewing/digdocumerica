{"path":"549237.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic rural landscape dominated by sprawling green fields under a clear blue sky. The fields, probably cultivated for agriculture, are meticulously lined with numerous hay bales, arranged in seemingly endless rows that stretch across the terrain. A prominent feature in the landscape is a large, traditional red barn situated towards the center-right of the image, with a roof that appears slightly weathered, indicating age and constant exposure to the elements. The ground around the barn is clear, contrasting with the dense placement of hay bales in the surrounding fields.\n\nIn the background, the fields are bordered by rolling hills dotted with trees and patches of forest. The hills rise gently and are layered in appearance, offering a mix of shades of green and brown, which hints at varied vegetation and soil types. The horizon is defined by these undulating hills, creating a tranquil and picturesque rural setting.\n\nForeground elements include a few wooden fence posts, adding a rustic charm to the viewing perspective and framing the vast agricultural lands. These posts are uneven in height and alignment, providing a natural, unstructured border to the otherwise methodically organized scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its vast open spaces and the presence of agricultural elements, evokes a sense of peacefulness and the productive beauty of rural life. The contrast between the man-made structures and elements (hay bales and barn) and the natural topography (hills and sky) enhances the bucolic feel of the image.","title":"Hay field at the john redding ranch in sarpy basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549137","549252","549138","555571","557946","544481","549256","551333","555577","549257","549149","549222","551305","547428","555635","547304"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["bale","hay","barn","field","hill","post","border","alignment","placement","element"]}
