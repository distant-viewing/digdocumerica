{"path":"548045.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a fragment of amber-colored glass, sharply focused and sitting atop a small pile of rocks. The glass shard has jagged edges and the raised embossed letters \"DEPO\" are visible, suggesting it may be a piece of a broken bottle. The foreground consists of a variety of rounded pebbles in earthy tones, and there are hints of red rust or a similar substance on some of the rocks.\n\nThe background, slightly blurred due to a shallow depth of field, reveals a large body of water that stretches to the horizons, suggesting that the setting might be a beach or lakeside. Above the water, there is a visible skyline where the sky meets the distant horizon, under what appears to be clear or slightly hazy weather conditions.\n\nThe overall composition and focus on the glass shard might imply an artistic or environmental message, perhaps commenting on pollution or human impact on natural settings.","title":"Broken glass from \"no-deposit, non-returnable\" bottles along the Washington shore of the Columbia River in a public picnic area.
