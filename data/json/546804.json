{"path":"546804.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a maritime scene at a dock, showing a large cargo ship, named \"AMERICAN LYNX,\" which is the center of attention. This ship, predominantly gray, is large, with a flat exterior characterized by several layers that suggest it is a container ship. Surrounding the ship are at least two tugboats aiding in its navigation; one tugboat is directly beside the ship's bow, painted red and black with a visible company name that includes \"Moran.\"\n\nThe setting is somewhat overcast, with a hazy sky that blankets the background, spreading a soft, diffused light over the scene. The water is calm, reflecting the gray of the sky and ships. On the right edge of the photo, there are elements of the dock, including mooring posts and other maritime infrastructure, such as a crane or lifting device visible in the distant background.\n\nAdding to the atmosphere, a few industrial buildings or structures can be seen beyond the ships, contributing to the sense of a working dock area. The overall composition and the vintage quality of the photo suggest it may have been taken a few decades ago, given the grain and color saturation typical of older film stock.","title":"Container ship being docked at Dundalk Marine Terminal, a Maryland Port Authority facility.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["551990","546860","546894","548127","544657","546751","555726","551581","548126","553740","552244","546934","552267","546850","549892","546834"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","dock","tugboat","mooring","navigation","grain","bow","company","saturation","film"]}
