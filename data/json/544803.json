{"path":"544803.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape with a body of heavily polluted water in the foreground. The water appears dirty and contains visible debris and pollutants, reflecting a deep metallic blue and mauve due to oil or chemical pollution. Surrounding the water are rocky and uneven ground surfaces covered with patches of waste and scattered rubble.\n\nIn the background, there is a mix of industrial and possibly some residential structures. A large storage tank and a cluster of red-roofed buildings can be seen in the distance. Between these structures, there is a crane, and some industrial equipment partially visible against a clear blue sky. A bridge with multiple arches spans across the scene, adding a more structured element to the otherwise haphazard industrial setting.\n\nThe overall scene conveys an atmosphere of negligence and environmental degradation, likely illustrating issues related to industrial pollution and its impact on the surrounding area. The lighting suggests it might be late morning or early afternoon due to the vividness of the colors and the clarity of light.","title":"Polluted Clear Creek - a tributary of the South Platte River","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["551559","551562","544294","545034","552019","549524","544775","547618","551561","550725","544527","552194","543636","547626","552154","545854"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollution","pollutant","rubble","vividness","degradation","oil","chemical","clarity","arch","issue"]}
