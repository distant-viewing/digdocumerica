{"path":"547167.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a solitary figure engaged in an activity on a sandy beach beside a large body of water. The scene is relatively barren, with few distinguishable features apart from the principal activities occurring in the foreground.\n\nThe central focus of the image is an individual, wearing dark clothing, possibly a uniform, standing on a narrow ridge of sand. The person appears to be digging or manipulating the sand with a tool that resembles a shovel or a spade. The shape of the sand around the person suggests that they have been systematically working on this area, as indicated by the elongated, trench-like pile of sand they stand beside.\n\nThe background features a large expanse of water, which exhibits a muddy brown color, indicating it might be a river or a lake with high silt content. The beach area is cluttered with some debris including what seems to be logs, suggesting either a state of neglect or the aftermath of an event such as a flood or storm.\n\nThe overall composition and muted colors, dominated by browns and blues, add a somber, labor-intensive feel to the scene. The lighting and shadows suggest that the photo was taken during daytime under clear weather conditions. The photograph seems to capture a moment of solitude and significant effort, emphasizing themes of maintenance, labor, or perhaps recovery from environmental impacts.","title":"Digging a channel from Bass Lake outlet to Lake Michigan","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547117","545076","552286","547151","545204","548051","543225","545080","545077","547031","543293","555400","545095","542556","547607","548280"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["sand","labor","beach","silt","recovery","trench","shovel","flood","storm","aftermath"]}
