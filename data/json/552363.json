{"path":"552363.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a clear daytime view of a city skyline. The image predominantly features tall buildings of varying heights in a dense urban setup. The taller skyscrapers are centralized in the composition, displaying modern architectural styles with reflective glass surfaces and rectangular silhouettes. Several smaller, more traditional buildings populate the foreground and middle ground of the frame, indicating a blend of old and newer structures within the city.\n\nThe background shows a wide, unobstructed blue sky that enhances the visibility of the buildings. There appear to be some minor artefacts in the sky, possibly from dust on the lens or film when the photo was taken. There's a distinct lack of greenery or visible natural elements in the immediate scene, underscoring the urban environment. The overall ambience suggests a quiet, undisturbed moment in the city, captured from a distance that allows for a comprehensive view of the skyline.\n\nThis perspective provides a broad overview of the city's architectural landscape and suggests a bustling metropolis during a peaceful moment.","title":"Los angeles reactive pollutant program (larpp), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["549971","545429","552394","557271","548386","548408","545499","549477","552395","553674","550202","551510","555716","548384","551509","548417"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["city","skyline","metropolis","overview","lens","ambience","film","skyscraper","dust","populate"]}
