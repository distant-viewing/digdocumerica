{"path":"545081.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a serene beach scene during a time of low sunlight, likely either dawn or sunset, which casts a soft, moody lighting across the scene. The image captures an expansive beach with glossy, wet sand that reflects the sky, enhancing the deep blues and subtle hues of the setting.\n\nIn the foreground, there are three prominent fishing boats, manned and steadied by individuals equipped for beach fishing. These boats, with their long outriggers and narrow structures, suggest a particular style of fishing or a cultural practice specific to the region depicted. Two of the boats are angled toward the sea, as if preparing to battle the waves, while the third is parallel to the water's edge, likely just returned or preparing to set off.\n\nThe beach stretches widely across the frame, leading towards an impressive rock formation in the distant background. This monolithic, sharply rising outcrop stands solitary among gently lapping waves, creating a focal point that is distinct and imposing. The rock's presence adds a sense of rugged wilderness and natural beauty to the composition.\n\nTo the left in the background, distant mountains fade into the haze, suggesting the coastline is part of a larger, mountainous region. The sky is clear, with only a few wisps of clouds, emphasizing the overall clarity and openness of the scene.\n\nVisually, the photograph is rich with natural tones, and the reflection on the wet sand adds a dynamic quality to the image. The composition balances elements of human activity and natural majesty, creating a narrative of interaction between people and the environment in a tranquil coastal setting.","title":"Cape Kiwanda, site of excellent salmon fishing.
