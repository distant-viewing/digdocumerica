{"path":"545238.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene set in a coastal landscape. The setting sun forms a vivid and luminous orb, partially obscured by rocky coastal formations, casting a warm, orange glow that permeates the scene. Beneath the sunset, the ocean gently touches a sandy shore, reflecting the vibrant hues of the sky.\n\nIn the foreground, a small, silhouetted figure can be seen paddling a canoe across a calm body of water, likely a river or estuary that flows into the sea. The water reflects the orange and pink tones of the sunset, adding a tranquil and reflective quality to the scene.\n\nThe background features rugged cliffs crowned with dense, dark greenery, contrasting sharply with the brightly lit sky. Above the horizon, a few small birds can be indistinctly seen flying, adding a sense of life and movement to the otherwise peaceful tableau.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the interplay between light and silhouette, with the natural elements combining to create a vivid and picturesque scene during the magical hour of sunset.","title":"Fisherman beaches boat at sunset at the mouth of the Quinault River.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550288","552294","550292","547479","543144","550296","552335","545234","557447","543143","543064","545030","545000","543880","544711","553989"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","orb","canoe","tableau","hour","bird","cliff","glow","orange","interplay"]}
