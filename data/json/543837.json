{"path":"543837.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photo depicts a close-up view of a young asparagus spear emerging from the soil. The asparagus spear appears vibrant and fresh, shown in fine detail against a blurred background. The textured scales and the budding tip of the spear are highlighted, with the photo's focus sharpening the natural features and colors of the plant. Differing shades of green and a touch of brown give a strong indication of the plant's natural environment. The lighting is soft, enhancing the intricate details and the delicate structure of the asparagus spear. The background is bokeh, with hues of dark brown and vague hints of a natural setting, possibly soil or undergrowth, contributing to the emphasis on the asparagus in the foreground.","title":"New plant growth after irrigation of the land near the San Miguel River.","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["542573","543622","555053","543852","542687","553361","555004","555548","555048","558077","543620","552111","557593","557625","555184","557617"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["soil","indication","tip","undergrowth","plant","detail","emphasis","photo","brown","touch"]}
