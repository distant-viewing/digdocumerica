{"path":"553386.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The image portrays a wide waterfall cascading over a concrete barrier into a rocky riverbed below. The waterfall is divided into two sections by a small central platform, with both streams falling parallel to each other. Water vigorously splashes and foams at the base, creating a misty ambiance around the fall area.\n\nIn the immediate foreground, a section of rounded, black metallic structures, possibly sections of a pipeline or railing, curves into the frame, adding a structural element to the natural scene. The surrounding landscape includes verdant greenery, mostly small shrubs and trees, which thrive in the moist environment adjacent to the waterfall.\n\nBehind the waterfall, there are buildings visible which appear to be constructed in a simple, utilitarian style with flat roofs; these might be industrial or office buildings. The environment has a sunny disposition with blue skies and full sunlight indicating a clear day.\n\nOverall, the composition seamlessly blends elements of nature and human-made structures, showcasing a harmonious coexistence in what appears to be an urban or semi-urban setting.","title":"Dam on the whitman river below the weyerhaeuser paper mill bears a heavy burden of mill wastes","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["550736","553387","553354","553340","542594","550738","550697","550979","549562","553389","542699","553349","544456","557745","558087","549557"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["waterfall","section","fall","pipeline","riverbed","thrive","cascade","foam","coexistence","splash"]}
