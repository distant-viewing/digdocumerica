{"path":"553697.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a landscape that juxtaposes natural greenery with agricultural development. In the foreground, you can see a dense collection of thick, green plants, which appear to be pineapples growing in a field. The field has rich, dark soil that contrasts vividly with the green plants.\n\nThe middle ground and background reveal a gradual transition from rural to more urban development. Extensive fields, likely used for agriculture, display varying shades of red and dark brown soil, with very few plants visible, suggesting recent tilling or that crops have been harvested. These fields stretch back to a residential area where multiple rectangular, single-story buildings create a grid-like pattern. \n\nBeyond the residential zone, the landscape opens up to a wide, flat area which could be more agricultural land or natural terrain, transitioning into a distant view. The horizon boasts a partly cloudy sky, which casts dynamic lighting and shadow over the entire scene, enriching the colors and textures visible in the photograph. Overall, the composition effectively showcases the blend of agricultural practices, residential life, and natural vegetation, typical of a suburban or semi-rural environment.","title":"Pineapple fields in Mililani Town.
