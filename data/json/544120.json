{"path":"544120.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph presents an industrial scene, specifically a mining operation. In the center of the image, a long conveyor belt loaded with chunks of coal extends into the distance, passing through a tunnel-like structure. The conveyer is flanked by high metal structures, possibly for support and operational purposes, including stairs and platforms with railings. The belt is moving coal from a pile at the base, which is partially visible in the background on the left.\n\nThe background features an expansive industrial landscape under a wide, partly cloudy sky. Piles of other materials and different machinery, including what appears to be a loader and additional belt systems, can be seen scattered around the area. Notably, there is an orange truck parked further to the right-hand side of the conveyor belt, providing a sense of scale and activity in the scene.\n\nThe environment appears dusty and rugged, typical for an outdoor mining operation. The lighting suggests it might be midday, given the brightness of the sky and the shadows cast by the structures and machinery. The image has a stark, functional feel, focusing on the machinery and the process of moving coal rather than human activity or natural landscapes, emphasizing the industrial nature of the scene.","title":"Mining of Black Mesa tableland has given rise to question of whether run-off is destructive of hopi fields","placename":"Black Mesa (Navajo County and Apache County, Ariz.)","location":"Black Mesa, Arizona","nn1":["544124","551035","553013","551037","556466","544386","549168","557403","556520","543169","544048","554764","556387","555591","556602","543642"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["belt","coal","machinery","mining","loader","pile","chunk","tunnel","materials","operation"]}
