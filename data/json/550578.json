{"path":"550578.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph provides an aerial view of a vast, undulating landscape, predominantly covered with dense green forest. Several rounded hilltops emerge from the sea of trees, creating gentle variations in elevation across the terrain. The foreground features some areas with lighter green vegetation, possibly indicating different types of plant life or the impact of light conditions. Towards the middle of the image, the forest appears thicker and darker.\n\nIn the distance, the landscape stretches out with more pronounced hills, some of which might be low mountains, given their distinct shapes and the way they stand out from the surrounding terrain. These hills have a barren or lightly vegetated top, contrasting with the forest-covered areas. The sky is not visible in the photograph, focusing the view entirely on the natural scenery below.\n\nThe lighting suggests that this photo was taken during daylight hours, with shadows cast by the hills hinting at the sun's position. Overall, the image captures a serene and unspoiled natural environment, likely far from urban development.","title":"Typical country in this area of the route: muskeg lowlands taiga forest of spruce, Aspen, birch and willow in the stream bottoms","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550538","553564","553567","557003","556906","550643","550566","553570","552553","550569","550541","555677","548025","556920","556931","557107"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["forest","hill","hilltop","pronounce","undulate","emerge","elevation","vegetate","variation","hour"]}
