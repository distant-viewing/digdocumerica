{"path":"543426.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a rugged and picturesque coastal landscape, where the churning turquoise and white waters of the ocean meet a rocky shoreline. The scene is framed by a densely wooded area, with trees that appear dark and rich in color, suggesting deep greens typically found in a coniferous forest.\n\nProminently featured along the shoreline are various architectural structures that blend with the natural environment. To the left, there is a striking building, possibly a lighthouse or bell tower, with a tall, slender structure topped with a pointed roof. This building stands out due to its unique, slightly European architectural style and its solitary position close to the water's edge.\n\nConnecting the different areas along the rocky coast, a series of pathways or small roads can be seen, some of which are lined by short walls or barriers, potentially for safety given the steep inclines and proximity to the ocean. There are also constructed elements that look like staircases carved into the rock, enhancing access across the uneven terrain.\n\nDespite the evident human constructions, the area largely exudes a natural, untouched aura, with the buildings integrating into the landscape without overwhelming it. The combination of man-made structures and the wild, natural beauty of the coastal environment creates a harmonious and visually striking scene. The photograph likely captures the unique charm and challenge of such a coastal environment, highlighting its beauty and the subtle human adaptations in place to enjoy and traverse it safely.","title":"Houses on cliffs of Pacific Grove overlooking Monterey Bay","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543422","543291","545110","543427","543435","545226","543337","557453","543340","554102","543437","543288","543403","550361","543297","553983"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["shoreline","ocean","lighthouse","churn","incline","traverse","adaptation","bell","aura","coast"]}
