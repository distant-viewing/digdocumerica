{"path":"552330.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene riverside scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, evident from the soft lighting and cool tones of the image. A person, wearing red outerwear and jeans, engages actively in pulling a small, light blue boat towards the shore of a river. The boat is equipped with an outboard motor and contains various items that look like equipment or personal belongings.\n\nThe river itself is expansive and flowy, surrounded by lush, dense greenery, creating a tranquil natural border. In the background, majestic snow-capped mountains loom under a slightly overcast sky, adding a dramatic and picturesque backdrop to the scene. The overall composition of the photograph suggests a moment of preparation or concluding an outing, highlighting a harmonious interaction between human and nature. The distinct elements—water, mountain, green landscape, and human activity—all contribute to the peaceful yet dynamic quality of this landscape.","title":"Salmon fishing on the lower skagit river near la conner","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["550989","550208","549066","543444","550773","549458","550000","551148","546976","551209","550988","551281","557972","555693","545654","553411"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["conclude","belonging","motor","boat","loom","mountain","riverside","outing","preparation","river"]}
