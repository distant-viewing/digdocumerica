{"path":"556017.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of a large, empty room that has an aged and somewhat neglected appearance. The floor is covered with large, square tiles that show signs of wear and discoloration. Several long wooden benches with armrests are arranged across the room. These benches are traditional in design, likely made of dark wood, and they appear well-used.\n\nAgainst the walls, positioned near the edges of the room, there are additional benches of similar design. The walls are painted in a light color with a darker trim along the bottom edge, adding a simple, basic decorative element. The room has several windows, allowing natural light to enter; they are tall and rectangular with multiple panes, typical of old buildings.\n\nNoticeable on the walls are several frames or boards; it’s unclear whether they are decorative or functional, like bulletin boards or simple decor. The doors visible in the image are also wooden and quite plain, consistent with the utilitarian look of the space. The ceiling is not visible in the image, focusing the viewer’s attention more on the horizontal spread of the room.\n\nIn general, the photograph evokes a sense of quiet and emptiness, possibly depicting a waiting area or a similarly functional space in a public building, like a station, school, or municipal facility. The lack of people and activity enhances the stark, tranquil mood of the setting.","title":"Interior of this train depot at Strong City, Kansas, hasn't served passengers in more than five years, but is maintained in good condition.

Although Amtrak is responsible for most U.S. intercity passenger service, it leases use of the tracks from the nation's railroads.","placename":"Strong City (Kan.)","location":"Strong City, Kansas","nn1":["556055","556000","556069","555963","546511","556048","557343","552450","556131","557342","556019","556016","556761","546558","558322","546576"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["room","bench","board","wall","emptiness","waiting","discoloration","pane","tile","decor"]}
