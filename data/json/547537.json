{"path":"547537.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of a polluted water body, most likely a river or lake. The image predominantly shows the surface of the water, which appears murky and muddy in color. Notably, there are several pieces of garbage visible on the surface of the water, demonstrating environmental pollution. The most prominent pieces of trash are two large plastic bags, crumpled and partially submerged, floating among smaller debris and detritus.\n\nThe water itself shows different textures and colors, ranging from a reflective dark upper portion scattered with specks of sunlight, creating a sparkling effect, to a more opaque and dense brownish lower portion that indicates turbidity and possible contamination from sediment or other pollutants.\n\nThe upper section of the photo, where the water is dark and reflects the sunlight, contrasts sharply with the lower section, where the water becomes increasingly clouded and littered with waste. This composition might indicate the movement of water or different depths. The garbage, particularly the plastic bags, are caught in the branches of submerged vegetation, which can partially be seen protruding from the water, indicating the possible degradation of the aquatic ecosystem. \nThis image effectively highlights the pressing issue of water pollution and the environmental impact of human waste.","title":"Outfall from a laundry on the pawtuxet river","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["547524","550812","555784","552811","552127","550807","550352","550800","548090","555848","552080","552098","545945","544175","551077","546898"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["water","garbage","bag","waste","pollution","portion","press","detritus","crumple","contamination"]}
