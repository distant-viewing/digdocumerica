{"path":"552055.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural, muddy watercourse entering a larger, murky body of water. The smaller stream is surrounded by heavily eroded mudbanks. On the banks, various plush green shrubs and a sparse collection of taller, slender trees are visible.\n\nThe point where the stream and the larger water body meet shows distinct color varianceâ€”with the stream appearing darker and the larger body of water having a lighter, muddy brown color. The scene is likely captured from an elevated perspective, looking down on the confluence.\n\nThe soil on the banks looks cracked and dry, suggesting low water levels or recent receding of the water body. There is no noticeable human activity or artificial structures in the scene, highlighting the natural and possibly secluded nature of this location. Overall, the composition focuses on the natural erosive processes and the interaction between the tributary stream and the main water body.","title":"Sewer outlet on the north side of the 12th Street bridge showing oil discharged into the Kansas River","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["545473","552062","553434","550351","544858","553427","555550","551608","552430","545871","545068","552953","552022","551231","549641","547487"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["stream","body","bank","water","erode","crack","enter","collection","meet","shrub"]}
