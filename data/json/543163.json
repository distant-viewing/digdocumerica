{"path":"543163.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a striking scene set on a barren, trash-littered beach. In the foreground, there's a large assortment of discarded items scattered across the sand, including many cans, bottles, and other refuse. Prominently positioned in the middle of the image is a yellow and white car with its hood open, suggesting mechanical trouble or maintenance.\n\nTo the right of the car, a man stands facing away from the camera, holding a rifle and aiming into the distance, adding a sense of tension or action to the scene. Behind him, the beach fades into a dense fog that obscures the background, creating a mysterious or eerie atmosphere.\n\nAdditionally, there is another darker-colored car parked further behind the yellow car, which is partially visible and also contributes to the early-to-mid 20th-century setting suggested by the makes and models of the vehicles. The overall mood is gritty and somewhat desolate, underscored by the combination of fog, litter, and the armed figure.","title":"Parked cars and litter on the beach","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547869","547035","544060","548752","545849","553009","553010","544809","548698","547923","547484","553007","547771","546965","557473","554302"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["fog","car","rifle","beach","make","tension","refuse","litter","hood","assortment"]}
