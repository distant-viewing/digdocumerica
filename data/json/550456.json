{"path":"550456.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a rugged mountain slope composed of loose, dark rocks and soil. The texture of the mountain side appears to be very coarse with various sizes of boulders and debris present, indicating erosion or possibly the aftermath of a landslide. No vegetation is visible, suggesting a harsh, possibly high-altitude environment.\n\nScattered across the middle of the image are numerous white specks; upon closer inspection, these may be a group of animals, possibly goats or sheep, adjusting to the terrain's unevenness. Their distribution across the slope implies they are actively grazing or moving through the area. The scale of the animals in comparison to the environment highlights the vastness and the roughness of the landscape.\n\nThe photograph's perspective is taken from a distance, providing a broad overview of this section of the mountain. The color palette is predominantly dark grays and browns, emphasizing the barren and inhospitable nature of the terrain. The lighting, possibly from a high sun, casts short shadows and enhances the rugged textures of the surface.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of natural, untouched wilderness, showing a stark and possibly challenging environment for wildlife, without any visible signs of human presence or activity.","title":"These high cliffs on the north side of the atigun valley are the wintering grounds of mountain sheep","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550455","550425","543635","550442","546385","550491","550505","550422","550480","550419","550596","550396","544874","555029","550421","543549"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","animal","goat","landslide","slope","comparison","sheep","overview","distribution","speck"]}
