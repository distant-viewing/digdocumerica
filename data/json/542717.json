{"path":"542717.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an airplane in flight against a pale sky, trailing a thick plume of dark smoke. The airplane, which appears to be a small, possibly twin-engine craft, is shown from a rear perspective, slightly angled towards the viewer. Its wings are horizontally aligned and propellers are visible, suggesting it is in motion. The sky backdrop features a gradient of soft pinks and blues, subtly inferring either early morning or late evening light. No detailed landscape or other objects are noticeable in the frame, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the airborne plane and its smoke trail. This composition conveys a sense of isolated urgency, possibly indicating mechanical trouble due to the visible smoke emission.","title":"Fumes from jet takeoff","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542719","542793","542500","542718","548883","542501","547824","548215","549072","542720","553873","548884","544491","548841","542496","544606"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","smoke","propeller","urgency","plane","craft","wing","pink","engine","flight"]}
