{"path":"546749.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures a breathtaking mountainous landscape during sunset. The hills roll gently, one after the other, into the distance where they blend into a hazy horizon. The lighting conditions create a mesmerizing color palette dominated by warm tones of orange, yellow, and hints of red that reflect off the textured surface of the mountains, emphasizing their contours and ruggedness. The sky above the mountain peaks glows with a vibrant orange near the top of the frame, fading into a darker, almost burgundy hue as it meets the earth.\n\nThe mountaintops are bathed in sunlight, highlighting their outlines and casting parts of the valleys into deep shadows, creating a striking contrast. This lends depth and a three-dimensional feel to the landscape. The entire scene is enveloped in a tranquil, almost dreamlike quality, emphasized by the serene gradation of colors and the soft, diffuse light. Visible grain and scratches on the image amplify a vintage feel, suggesting that it might have been taken on film, and these imperfections add character to the photograph, enhancing its emotional impact.","title":"Smoke from copper smelters in the Globe-Miami area drifts toward Phoenix.","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["552927","554634","542681","557560","555131","544047","544070","542676","545860","543023","557519","554402","550646","552896","553816","550421"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["imperfection","gradation","ruggedness","mountain","grain","film","feel","vintage","contour","character"]}
