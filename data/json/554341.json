{"path":"554341.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures the profile silhouette of an elderly man against a plain, nondescript background which fades from a lighter shade at the top to a darker one at the bottom. The man's face is turned to the side, prominently displaying his features in a sharp outline. His hair is long and voluminous, with visible strands and a dynamic texture, predominantly white with slight gradients and shadows that provide depth and detail. He appears to be wearing a dark jacket or clothing which is mostly obscured by the angle of the shot, emphasizing his facial features and hair rather than his attire. The lighting accentuates the contours of his nose, cheekbones, and jawline sharply, while the background remains unobtrusive and neutral, focusing all attention on the subject's profile.","title":"Participant in a citizens' forum held in midtown Manhattan to discuss transportation problems and clean air strategies for New York city proposed by epa's regional office","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554340","556452","557032","543701","553055","552872","556563","556443","552103","548616","557035","545417","552871","547338","554857","557144"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["profile","strand","nose","hair","gradient","remain","contour","shot","turn","accentuate"]}
