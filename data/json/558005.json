{"path":"558005.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene, somewhat overcast scene featuring a small, calm river with a distinctive white wooden pedestrian bridge crossing over it. On the far side of the bridge, there's a two-story house that looks slightly worn and old, with noticeable weathering and a façade predominantly white, flanked by greeneries, slightly obscured by shadows. The house is positioned behind an extended grassy area, suggesting a spacious, rural setting.\n\nIn the foreground, a portion of another structure – perhaps a concrete bridge or barrier – is partially visible, adding a sense of depth and framing to the image. The riverbank is adorned with lush grass and small bushes, contributing to a sense of tranquil natural beauty.\n\nThe composition is balanced with trees and utility poles lining the background, and the sky, although overcast, provides a soft lighting that enhances the peaceful atmosphere of the scene. This setting conveys a quiet, possibly secluded rural area, where nature and human-made elements coexist quietly. The image's overall mood is calm and slightly melancholic, likely due to the overcast conditions and the aging architecture.","title":"Ohio-Erie Canal lock and spillway and Hillside and Canal roads at Valley View, near Cleveland, Ohio. The canal, linking Lake Erie and Akron, was built through the Cuyahoga Valley between 1825 and 1827. Water commerce provided the impetus for settlers to make their homes in the area and for eventual industrialization outside the valley. The canal is now a part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located between Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["558015","549457","555730","542555","553355","557996","551526","552108","551527","545141","547526","552598","557485","552107","546126","557239"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["bridge","crossing","house","weathering","façade","barrier","pedestrian","riverbank","bush","utility"]}
