{"path":"546719.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph depicting a sprawling industrial landscape dominated by railway infrastructure. At the heart of the image, a large railyard can be seen featuring multiple tracks and trains, as well as numerous railway service buildings. The railyard is a nexus of activity with several locomotives and many railcars.\n\nTo the left of the railyard, there is a road that winds through the area, intersecting with other roads and paths that connect different parts of the industrial complex. Additionally, two large overpasses are visible, facilitating vehicular movement above the ground level cluttered with tracks.\n\nOn the right side, parallel to the railyard, there are rows of covered areas that might be used for storage or maintenance of vehicles or equipment. Above these structures, numerous paved areas and parking lots are densely packed with cars, suggesting the presence of offices or commercial buildings.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes patches of greenery and trees, indicating that this industrial area is located close to natural features or less developed land. The background extends into a suburban or semi-urban setting with buildings and vegetation. Several large buildings, possibly factories or warehouses, are evident in the distance, contributing to the industrial feel of the region.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph provides a comprehensive view of a busy and functional industrial sector, emphasizing transportation and logistic facilities.","title":"Railroad yards, n.e","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556464","547140","555779","547999","549479","556477","556382","555754","545889","547265","544664","547050","556692","552063","556783","548353"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["railway","railcar","track","sector","locomotive","heart","overpass","building","sprawl","facilitate"]}
