{"path":"555324.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This image shows an interior view of what appears to be an industrial or scientific facility, likely associated with aerospace or high-energy physics due to the presence of complex machinery and protective measures.\n\nAt the center of the composition, there is a bright, round light source, enclosed within a squared structure. The glow and intensity suggest it might be a lamp used in high-intensity applications, possibly for testing or simulation purposes. It is encased in a framework that seems to support and protect it, potentially meant for adjusting the position or angle of the light source.\n\nOn the right side, a large fan or blower with metallic blades is visible, securely attached to the inner framework of the facility. This equipment could be used to manage air circulation or cooling, which might be necessary given the presence of the powerful light source.\n\nThe surrounding architecture includes heavy-duty metal doors and walls, indicated by their sturdy build and functional design. There is visible wear and tear, such as chipped paint and signs of oxidation, suggesting that the facility has been in use for some time. Safety features like chains and barriers are seen, hinting at the need for strict access control and safety protocols within the space.\n\nWindows on the opposite wall allow for some daylight to enter, contrasting with the artificial brightness of the central light. The overall atmosphere is one of technical precision and industrial seriousness, dedicated to specific research or testing purposes in a controlled environment.","title":"The solar furnace at white sands missile range, Alamogordo New Mexico.
