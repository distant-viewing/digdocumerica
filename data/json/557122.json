{"path":"557122.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene featuring a group of geese in a wetland environment. The most prominent goose in the foreground is white with an orange-pink beak and is partially facing the camera, calmly standing in shallow water. To its right is another goose that is darker in color, possibly gray, with its back turned to the viewer, delineated by its lighter, more visible underparts.\n\nIn the background, there are at least three more geese, variously engaging in activities such as standing and looking around. These geese appear to have darker plumage compared to the white one in the foreground.\n\nThe setting is a natural wetland area abundant with water and dense with brown, wintery reeds and other aquatic vegetation, implying a cool or cold season. The lighting in the photo suggests it might be midday, with bright sunlight casting sharp shadows and highlighting the water's reflective surface. The overall atmosphere is peaceful and portrays a snapshot of wildlife thriving in their natural habitat.","title":"Flocks of blue geese and snow geese stop at the Squaw Creek National Wildlife Refuge near Mound City, Missouri, at the northwest corner of the state.
