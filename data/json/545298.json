{"path":"545298.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a large, beige road sign at the forefront with bold black text that reads \"DEPOSIT LITTER,\" accompanied by a black pictogram of a hand dropping paper into a bin. Beneath this main sign, a smaller one reads \"LITTER BARREL NOT FOR HOME GARBAGE,\" indicating specific use instructions. The sign is mounted on a metal post.\n\nIn the background, a scenic landscape spreads out featuring verdant, rolling hills and expansive flat lands below. A broad river or large lake stretches across the middle ground, reflecting sunlight. Scattered around the landscape are several small buildings typical of rural areas, along with patches of forested areas. The horizon is marked by a faint mountain outline under a light blue sky streaked with soft, wispy clouds. Toward the right, industrial smoke rises distinctly against the sky from a cluster of structures, possibly a factory, indicating some form of industrial activity in the region.","title":"Highway anti-litter campaign.
