{"path":"544179.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene, likely an oil or chemical processing facility. The setting is an open outdoor landscape accessible by water, possibly next to a manmade canal or pond used for industrial purposes. \n\nIn the center and right of the image, there are several large structures that constitute the main part of the facility. These include vertical towers, which could be distillation columns or storage tanks, all made of metal, in varying states of wear and colors such as white, gray, and rust. Additionally, there are cylindrical storage containers, some standing upright and others horizontally positioned on structures that elevate them slightly above ground level. These storage containers are various sizes, with visible weathering and are connected by pipes and valves, suggesting their use for processing or storing chemicals.\n\nForegrounded against these industrial elements are roughly-made, wooden structures at the edge of the water, possibly platforms or docks. In the foreground, tall grass partly obscures the view, adding a natural texture contrast to the metal and concrete of the facility.\n\nThe background is predominantly sky and sparse, flat terrain, which hints at a remote location largely dedicated to industrial or manufacturing purposes. The reflection of the facility in the calm water of the pond enhances the visual depth of the photograph and mirrors the verticality of the structures.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a juxtaposition of nature and industrial activity, highlighting the intrusion of human-made structures within a natural landscape, with a focus on the quiet, solitary presence of the facility in a remote setting.","title":"Petroleum installation","placename":"Grand Isle (La. : Island)","location":"Grand Isle, Louisiana","nn1":["542705","546064","545998","545836","546118","546103","546122","549960","551998","551994","546083","551576","547958","557392","545992","546108"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["facility","storage","chemical","pond","container","processing","distillation","purpose","verticality","valve"]}
