{"path":"544903.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural scene within a canyon or desert-like environment with highly distinct geological formations. The background is dominated by a massive, tall cliff face with stratified rock layers in varying shades of reddish-brown and orange, suggesting erosion over time.\n\nIn the foreground, a winding path curves through the landscape, comprising similarly colored soil. Along this path, two individuals are shown hiking. They are dressed in casual outdoor attire, indicating an adventurous outing in this rugged terrain.\n\nThere are prominent rock formations near the path that resemble large columns or hoodoos, standing out with their vertical structure and textured surfaces, which vary from smooth lower sections to more jagged upper portions. These natural monoliths anchor the scene, emphasizing the erosion and natural sculpting processes of the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its stark natural beauty and the presence of hikers, conveys a sense of exploration and admiration for the grandeur of the natural world. The lighting appears to be natural, with the bright sun casting shadows and enhancing the contours and colors of the rocky landscape.","title":"Rock formations owe reddish hue to traces of iron oxide.","placename":"Bryce Canyon (Utah)","location":"Bryce Canyon, Utah","nn1":["545700","544898","544928","545772","545759","544305","544931","545762","545693","544301","544917","544902","545697","545782","545758","545690"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["path","erosion","admiration","formation","hiker","rock","hiking","canyon","outing","world"]}
