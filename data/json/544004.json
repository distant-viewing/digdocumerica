{"path":"544004.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph showcases a scene from an industrial work environment, possibly a steel mill or foundry. In the foreground, a worker is the main focus. He is dressed in protective work gear, which includes a light-colored long sleeve shirt, dark pants, and a safety helmet with a white fabric or paper cover wrapped around the lower part of the helmet, possibly as additional protection or for hygiene purposes. The worker, whose face is not visible as he is viewed from behind, is engaged in an activity that involves handling a long rod, which he holds with both hands and extends towards the fiery glow in the background, possibly manipulating or checking the metal in the furnace.\n\nThe background conveys the intense heat and industrial nature of the setting. Bright orange and yellow hues dominate this area, indicating molten metal or extreme heat, while greenish flames visible suggest some kind of chemical reaction or combustion process taking place. The environment looks rugged and harsh, with visible debris and uneven surfaces around the workspace. There are structures that likely function as part of the equipment for moving or containing the hot material, emphasizing the industrial scale and nature of the work. The atmosphere is illuminated primarily by the light from the furnace, casting a glow that reflects on the worker and the surrounding area, accentuating the intense conditions and the heat prevalent in the scene.","title":"Refining operations at the Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co.","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["549694","544000","549695","544001","544049","549693","543996","544041","544316","557397","557399","545536","558304","544331","557395","557400"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["heat","furnace","worker","helmet","glow","work","reaction","flame","protection","mill"]}
