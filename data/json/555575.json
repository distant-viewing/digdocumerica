{"path":"555575.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph presents a picturesque landscape featuring a river that gracefully meanders through a bucolic environment. The scene captures the river winding through various bends, bordered by lush greenery and an assortment of trees. On multiple points along the river banks, different structures can be observed, likely residential or small industrial units. One prominent building complex is situated on the left side of the image, near the river, possibly a farm or a collection of industrial buildings.\n\nThe terrain surrounding the river is varied, with patches of dense trees and sections of grass-covered hills. The topography includes both flat areas and rolling hills, creating a diverse and textured landscape. The foreground shows a series of ridged hillsides that lead down to the river's edge, suggesting a region that might be prone to erosion or that has been shaped significantly by water movement.\n\nIn the distance, the landscape flattens and merges into what appears to be a plateau, extending into the horizon under a clear sky. Notably, the sky is virtually cloudless, adding to the serene and undisturbed nature of the scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph depicts a peaceful rural setting where the river plays a central role in shaping the land and supporting the surrounding ecology. The image evokes a sense of tranquility and timeless beauty in nature, untouched by urban development.","title":"Buttes and ponds were created after coal companies finished strip mining this area off Route #519.","placename":"Athens (Ohio)","location":"Athens, Ohio","nn1":["542653","548096","557106","549456","550616","556964","550524","549260","550656","542558","550542","544861","550433","550581","548010","548097"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","plateau","flatten","shape","topography","hill","assortment","merge","meander","unit"]}
