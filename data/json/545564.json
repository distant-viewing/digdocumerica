{"path":"545564.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a small, furry animal, possibly a chipmunk or a similar rodent, perched on a rocky surface. The animal is in profile, facing to the left of the frame with its mouth slightly open as if it is eating or holding something. The texture of its fur is visible, and features light and dark brown tones that blend well with the environment.\n\nThe background is softly focused but shows similar reddish-brown, rocky textures that suggest a natural, outdoor setting typical of a mountainous or desert area. The lighting in the scene is soft and natural, highlighting the animal's features and casting subtle shadows on the rock surface. The overall composition is simple and centers on the animal, providing a clear view of its behavior in its natural habitat.","title":"Chipmunk at campground of Dead Horse Point State Park","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545556","545560","542629","557615","550472","555668","554597","550468","543265","550470","545549","554599","550469","542630","544916","554621"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["animal","behavior","fur","mouth","profile","outdoor","habitat","texture","desert","surface"]}
