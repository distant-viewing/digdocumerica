{"path":"546146.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene engulfed in a thick orange and brown haze, likely indicating a fire or heavy pollution. A large factory building dominates the background, its vast, curved roof partially obscured by the dense haze, which also bathes the scene in a dim orange glow that suggests an occurrence during either sunrise or sunset.\n\nIn the foreground, there's noticeable industrial equipment; prominently, a yellow mobile platform or lift, which is not in use at the moment. Scattered around are various other pieces of equipment and materials that further emphasize the industrial nature of the environment.\n\nThe sky, visible through the haze, displays a dull orange hue, enhancing the sense of urgency or emergency typical of industrial fires or accidents. No human figures are visible in the shot, which focuses on the equipment and the enveloping haze, conveying a sense of abandonment or evacuation.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is melancholic and intense, underscored by the palpable presence of the smoke or pollution and the industrial setting. The photograph likely captures a moment of distress or critical activity within an industrial or manufacturing area.","title":"Le tourneau Marathon ammunition plant","placename":"Longview (Tex.)","location":"Longview, Texas","nn1":["546191","545447","545239","551054","545446","542999","550181","557214","547539","545507","549967","551555","547531","545268","550983","547010"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["haze","fire","orange","equipment","pollution","accident","engulf","distress","urgency","emergency"]}
