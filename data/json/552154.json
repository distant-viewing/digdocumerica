{"path":"552154.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape with a contrastingly natural and waste foreground. In the forefront, there's a large accumulation of various types of debris which predominantly includes twisted metallic materials, discarded woods, and possibly other industrial or urban refuse. This pile of junk is wet, possibly due to recent rain or being partially submerged in water, as it appears to be situated at the edge of a water body.\n\nIn the middle ground, beyond the debris, calm waters reflect the industrial architecture and cloudy skies above. Several industrial buildings, characterized by plain, functional architecture dominate the middle distance. These structures include tall smokestacks from which white and grey smoke billow, dispersing into the sky, portraying a vivid scene of industrial activity.\n\nThe background is composed of a partially cloudy sky with dark clouds mingling with lighter ones, hinting at varied weather conditions. The sky and its reflection on the water give a dramatic tone to the scene, enhancing the stark industrial feel of the photograph. Overall, the image presents a vivid juxtaposition of environmental degradation and industrial enterprise.","title":"Crown Zellerbach pulp mill dumps solid waste in the pond it formerly used for log storage.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550343","545993","552190","547582","544294","552194","550350","546073","548357","551559","546974","545989","546080","545988","545059","547901"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["enterprise","refuse","architecture","debris","accumulation","degradation","water","rain","one","forefront"]}
