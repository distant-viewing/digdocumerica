{"path":"545040.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image captures a serene rural landscape. The photograph predominantly features an expansive field, probably for agriculture, exhibiting hues of golden brown with traces of green, indicating either post-harvest or dormant vegetation. The terrain gently undulates, and a clear path or a dry creek bed winds through the field, adding a natural line that leads the eye across the scene. Scattered patches of low green shrubs and white wildflowers are visible, enhancing the natural, bucolic charm.\n\nThe foreground is marked by taller grasses and some bushy plants, presenting a slightly wild and unkempt appearance, possibly the edge of the field. The composition includes a part of a wooden fence visible in the right-hand corner, subtly hinting at rural human management.\n\nThe background is framed by rolling hills dotted with sporadic trees and underlined by shadows, possibly from clouds not seen in the view. These hills form a darker, more verdant backdrop that contrasts with the lighter tone of the field. The sky above is partly cloudy with hints of blue, suggesting a dynamic, possibly changeable weather situation.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a peaceful and pastoral scene common in rural settings, focusing on the natural landscape and its subdued, earthy colors.","title":"Burnt grass-seed stubble in willamette valley","placename":"Salem (Or.)","location":"Salem, Oregon","nn1":["557087","555567","549142","549156","549236","549181","549146","549261","549141","549182","555537","555603","549157","546154","554027","549222"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["field","creek","trace","situation","hill","agriculture","wildflower","underline","bed","undulate"]}
