{"path":"550332.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene across a body of water, likely a river or lake. The foreground of the image features choppy water with small waves, indicating a breezy day. Multiple logs or debris are floating near the water's edge, adding a sense of industry or logging activity in the area.\n\nThe central and background focus of the image includes a large industrial complex with various buildings, smokestacks, and emitting vapors. The most noticeable features are the tall smokestacks, from which white smoke is billowing into the sky. This smoke blends into the cloudy sky above, creating a somewhat gloomy atmosphere.\n\nThe overall color tone of the image is muted, with dark blues and grays dominating, suggesting either a cloudy day or early evening time. The industrial complex itself appears somewhat dated, possibly indicative of mid-20th century industrial architecture.\n\nScattered across the industrial complex are multiple smaller buildings, all part of a larger facility which could be a factory or plant related to production or processing. The area surrounding the complex appears wooded, indicating that the facility is likely at the edge of an urban or developed area, transitioning into a more natural or rural environment.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of industry and activity, contrasted against nature and the quiet presence of the water in the foreground.","title":"Georgia Pacific paper plant on St. Croix River in Woodland","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["552249","557225","552179","550344","548068","548070","550340","557376","550956","551576","554630","550336","545987","555165","546808","548106"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["complex","smokestack","industry","vapor","smoke","facility","production","water","edge","log"]}
