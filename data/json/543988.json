{"path":"543988.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a landscape dominated by industrial and natural elements. In the foreground, a two-lane highway stretches horizontally across the image, with an open road bordered by guardrails. A road sign on the right side of the highway indicates \"CORONADO TURN OFF 1 MILE,‚Äù suggesting a landmark or junction ahead.\n\nThe middle ground features arid, hilly terrain typical of a desert-like environment. Sparse vegetation dots the hills, which are predominantly rocky and reddish-brown in color. The starkness of the terrain adds a sense of isolation and ruggedness to the scene.\n\nProminent in the background are two towering smokestacks emitting large plumes of white smoke that disperses into the sky. The smokestacks, set against the backdrop of more distant hills and a slightly clouded blue sky, signify industrial activity, potentially a power plant or factory, juxtaposed sharply against the natural barren landscape.\n\nAdditionally, there are various utility poles visible, running parallel to the road, reinforcing the presence of human infrastructure in this remote setting. The overall composition of this photograph contrasts human-made industrial development with the natural arid landscape, highlighting themes of environmental impact and the intersection of technology with nature.","title":"Phelps Dodge Corp. mine and smelter","placename":"Morenci (Ariz.)","location":"Morenci, Arizona","nn1":["543989","544039","548968","543668","548850","543992","543160","549191","551068","545988","546398","551033","554155","545989","546212","545013"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["highway","smokestack","road","junction","starkness","guardrail","ruggedness","landmark","hill","intersection"]}
