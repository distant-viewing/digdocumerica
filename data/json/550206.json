{"path":"550206.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a segment of a river with significant water pollution. The primary feature is a wide, foamy white patch of pollutants floating on the water surface, extending from the foreground into about the middle of the river width. Beyond the polluted area, the water appears darker and slightly clearer. In the immediate foreground, there's a sandy riverbank shown at the bottom right corner with small green plants, and a fragment of fencing visible to the left.\n\nIn the background, the river is flanked by industrial sites and infrastructure. Multiple bridges, including one with a truss structure, stretch across the river, connecting the shores. Several large buildings and industrial equipment, possibly related to manufacturing and transportation, are noticeable along the banks. One building has the inscription \"HALSTED,\" visible on its side, suggesting a location or branding.\n\nThe sky is clear, suggesting it's a bright day, although the water pollution casts a grim aspect on the scene. The overall composition conveys a stark contrast between industrial activity and the natural environment, highlighting environmental degradation in urban-industrial areas.","title":"City pump station discharges sewage into the Cuyahoga River","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550369","544779","550210","550371","545034","544775","550723","552127","545168","549624","551562","552019","550959","545119","550193","548090"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["river","pollution","branding","inscription","fencing","pollutant","truss","width","fragment","segment"]}
