{"path":"546880.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaging in activity by a small watercourse or stream in a wooded, natural setting possibly during autumn given the brown foliage around. The two men are working with a large, wooden canoe. One of the men stands in the stream, stabilizing and holding onto the canoe, dressed in a dark jacket and jeans. The other man is situated at the rear of the canoe, dressed in a lighter shirt and darker pants, appearing to be pushing or adjusting the canoe possibly in preparation to move it or secure its placement.\n\nThe surrounding area features leafless trees and brush scattered with fallen, dry leaves, suggesting a late fall or early spring timeframe. Rocks are visible at the edges of the water, and the stream bed itself seems rocky and shallow. The background hints at a sloped terrain covered with similar dry vegetation.\n\nThe natural lighting and shadows suggest that this image was taken either in the late afternoon or early morning, contributing to the tranquil yet chilly atmosphere evident from the attire of the individuals and the season hinted by the environment. The photograph transitions from bright to shaded areas, creating a strong natural contrast and emphasizing the isolation and serenity of the setting.","title":"Staff members of the Maryland water resources administration take samples of stony run after 4000 gallons of oil were spilled during a delivery","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["549996","554661","551518","550822","550659","553345","544759","553806","550209","550767","553409","553343","554679","558072","546750","550774"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","stream","timeframe","stabilize","brush","rear","fallen","slop","push","serenity"]}
