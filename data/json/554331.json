{"path":"554331.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a busy urban street scene, likely from the 1970s or 1980s, judging by the style of vehicles and overall ambiance. The setting is a city street lined with parked cars and moving traffic. The focus is on a row of yellow taxi cabs, a prominent symbol of urban transportation during that era. These taxis, primarily classic American sedans with long bodies and distinctive chrome bumpers, dominate the foreground.\n\nA single person, seemingly a pedestrian, walks down the middle of the street between lanes of traffic, adding a human element to the scene. This person's presence amidst the traffic might suggest the busy, sometimes chaotic nature of city life.\n\nStorefronts are visible in the background on both sides of the street, featuring signs that are indicative of typical urban businesses. The buildings are multi-storied, with a mix of commercial lower floors topped by what appear to be residential or office spaces above.\n\nThe atmosphere of the photograph is slightly overcast, with a soft, diffused light that hints at either an early morning or a cloudy day. The street and cars have a wet sheen, suggesting recent rainfall, which adds a reflective quality to the surface and enriches the colors.\n\nOverall, this image offers a nostalgic look at city life, capturing the essence of an era through its focus on the iconic yellow cabs and the bustling street environment.","title":"Lineup of fare-seeking taxis on Lexington Avenue and 61st Street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554315","554310","549848","549868","548331","554330","554316","549876","554314","548410","549869","549859","549873","554293","554329","554294"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["street","taxi","cab","traffic","city","era","bumper","sheen","storefront","symbol"]}
