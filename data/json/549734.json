{"path":"549734.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and densely packed crowd of spectators at an outdoor event, likely along a waterfront given the presence of water visible between trees in the upper left corner. The audience is diverse in age and attire, suggesting a casual and festive environment, possibly during a warm season given the abundance of sunlight and some individuals in sleeveless shirts and shorts.\n\nThe people in the image appear engaged and enthusiastic, with some looking up and pointing, indicating they are watching something happening off-camera that is potentially airborne or elevated â€“ such as an air show, fireworks, or a sporting event. The crowd is standing on tiered seating or steps, which maximizes the viewing area and indicates that this is a designated spectator area.\n\nA variety of clothing styles can be seen, including t-shirts, tank tops, hats, sunglasses, and casual summer dresses, reflecting a range of personal tastes and comfort levels. The expressions and body language suggest a moment of excitement or anticipation, contributing to a lively atmosphere. The presence of trees in the background adds a touch of natural setting to the otherwise human-centered scene. The overall composition, with its tight framing of the crowd, emphasizes the communal experience and shared focus of the gathered individuals.","title":"Crowd on shore of Detroit river watching the gar wood trophy race--a contest of hydroplanes","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["547323","551814","553757","547442","553322","553759","553287","553311","551811","551675","551808","558295","543482","551707","551673","554442"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["crowd","spectator","maximize","sporting","happen","anticipation","event","viewing","language","abundance"]}
