{"path":"550387.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a single bird, likely a sandpiper, depicted in a natural wetland setting. The sandpiper is standing near the edge of what appears to be a pond or a puddle. The bird is captured in mid-step, with one foot raised, suggesting movement.\n\nThe foreground consists of small rocks and pebbles, possibly indicating a riverbank or lakeshore. The background is softly focused, contrasting with the clarity of the bird, and appears to be more of the same muddy-water setting with faint reflections and submerged objects.\n\nThe overall lighting of the scene is dim, hinting at either dawn or dusk, which casts a moody, somewhat vintage tone across the image. The birdâ€™s body is speckled, with feather patterns ranging from dark on the top to lighter shades on the belly, providing camouflage with the earthy tones of the surrounding area.\n\nThe composition emphasizes tranquility and simplicity, focusing entirely on the sandpiper and its immediate environment, avoiding distractions and capturing a moment of natural, everyday wildlife activity.","title":"Wading shore bird searches out insects in pond.
