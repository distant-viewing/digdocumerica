{"path":"556455.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene characterized by a mix of natural landscapes and human habitation. At the forefront is a long, white mobile home positioned parallel to a dirt road. The mobile home has multiple windows, suggesting it serves as a residence. The earth around the mobile home appears disturbed, with patches of dirt and scattered debris, possibly indicating recent placement or ongoing landscaping efforts.\n\nThe dirt road curves away from the viewer, leading towards other structures in the background. Further along the road, there is a red-roofed house with an adjacent carport under which a vehicle is parked. A wooden structure, resembling a small, open shelter, is noticeable next to this house. This setup suggests a typical residential setting within a rural community.\n\nThe area is enclosed by hills densely covered in deciduous trees, suggesting the photograph was taken during a season when the trees are lush with leaves. The overall ambiance is of a quiet, secluded rural area with homes spaced widely apart, nestled among the natural terrain of the hills. There are no visible human figures in the scene, emphasizing the calm and solitude of the rural environment.","title":"Alley branch road which leads to a new mine site near chattaroy and Williamson, West Virginia.
