{"path":"549859.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Morgan, Hank","caption":"The photograph captures a busy urban scene, seemingly from a street in a city. The focal point is a bright yellow taxi, likely from the 1970s, parked in the foreground with its driver-side door open. A person is getting out or in the taxi, partially visible from the waist down.\n\nBehind the taxi, there's a variety of street life. Pedestrians of various ages and genders are scattered throughout, either walking or standing in small groups. On the left side of the image is a large gray truck labeled \"J & J TRUCKING CO. Inc. AIR & STEAMER\" with additional contact information visible on its back. This suggests the setting might be near a commercial or business area.\n\nIn the background, various signs are visible, including one for \"Gino Pizza,\" suggesting some eateries in the vicinity. The building facades, visible signs, and the general crowd indicate a bustling, commercial environment typical of a downtown area.\n\nThe image is imbued with a slightly coarse, grainy quality, characteristic of photographic film, adding a nostalgic or documentary feel to the scene. The grey, overcast sky suggests it might be a cold or gloomy day. Everything combined portrays an active urban life typical of a major city.","title":"Traffic congestion and crowded walkways in Manhattan's garment district","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549876","549873","554331","554330","549848","549869","554310","554315","548410","554329","549862","554314","554316","549868","548331","554294"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["taxi","nostalgic","coarse","grainy","get","contact","waist","imbue","city","ag"]}
