{"path":"545950.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor, natural environment where a yellow bulldozer is being operated on a patch of cleared land. The bulldozer, situated on the left side of the image, appears to be actively engaged in either moving earth or clearing debris from the area. A person is visible sitting in the driver's seat of the bulldozer, wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and a safety helmet.\n\nIn the background, several large trees with thick trunks and extensive branches are visible. These trees are dramatically covered in long, hanging Spanish moss, which adds a distinct, almost eerie character to the scene. The moss drapes heavily from the branches, nearly reaching the ground.\n\nThe terrain is rugged and uneven, primarily composed of exposed soil that looks recently disturbed, possibly by the bulldozer's activity. The earth is textured and lumpy, indicating recent excavation or movement.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a rural or semi-wilderness quality with a strong focus on land alteration or development activity, featuring the contrast between mechanical intervention and natural landscapes. The overcast sky suggests an overcast or possibly humid environment, typical of areas where Spanish moss thrives.","title":"Land is cleared for commercial development.
