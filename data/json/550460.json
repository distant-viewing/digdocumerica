{"path":"550460.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of small, red plants growing among green grasses. The plants are characterized by vibrant reddish-pink leaves that have a broad, somewhat rounded shape and are slightly curled. The leaves appear to have a fuzzy texture with fine white hairs visible on their surfaces, enhancing the detail and depth of the foliage. In the background, the focus blends the greenery into a soft blur, highlighting the sharp contrast of the red plants against the subdued green tones. The lighting in the photo is natural, giving the colors a rich and lively appearance. The overall composition of the image focuses on the small scale and delicate nature of ground cover in a natural, possibly wild, environment.","title":"Typical tundra vegetation","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550459","553074","543451","555042","554595","543205","542610","544934","553361","554744","555053","555037","555884","554743","550479","550461"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","curl","leave","grow","blur","subdue","shape","scale","have","blend"]}
