{"path":"550112.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a quiet residential alley, likely taken in the mid to late 20th century. The scene captures a narrow, paved road bordered by similar wooden two-story houses painted in varying colors including green and yellow. Each house features pointed roofs and multiple windows.\n\nUtility poles installed along each side of the alley are linked with multiple power lines that crisscross above the scene, drawing the eye towards the central and upper portion of the image. Bright sunlight illuminates the alley, casting shadows of the poles onto the road.\n\nAt the far end of the alley, distant small figures are visible, possibly children playing near some parked vehicles and other figures seated beside the road. The far background hints at the presence of taller modern buildings, contrasting with the older residential style of the foreground houses. This adds a subtle touch of urban development encroaching on a traditional neighborhood setting.\n\nOverall, the image captures a slice of everyday life in a mid-century urban neighborhood, characterized by its architecture, utility infrastructure, and community activity.","title":"Metropolitan housing building at end of alley crisscrossed with utility lines","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["556170","555940","544072","550145","543360","551131","557288","556435","545361","545546","547433","545542","545398","546525","545372","549287"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["alley","house","neighborhood","utility","road","pole","century","figure","slice","end"]}
