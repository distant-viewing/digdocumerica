{"path":"542943.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image shows an aerial view of a lumber yard situated by a body of water, possibly a river or lake. The yard is filled with numerous logs, both stacked in orderly piles and floating loosely in the water, enclosed by retaining walls. Several industrial structures, likely for processing or storing lumber, are visible. These structures vary in size and shape, including several large sheds with metallic roofs. \n\nThere is visible activity with smoke rising, suggesting either wood burning or an operational process emitting smoke. The surrounding area includes dense forest, and the overall setting appears remote, hinting at a location possibly used exclusively for lumber operations. The composition of the image, with its high viewpoint, captures the vast scale of the lumber operations in relation to the natural landscape. It emphasizes the interaction between industrial activity and the environment.","title":"Lumbermill","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["552140","542921","542944","542940","552163","542945","552214","542941","552199","552176","552198","542584","552170","552162","543541","552132"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["lumber","yard","relation","retain","smoke","storing","burn","operation","emitte","shed"]}
