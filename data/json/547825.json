{"path":"547825.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"The photograph displays a vibrant and intricately detailed religious altar or shrine. At the center of the image is a large, elaborate floral arrangement featuring a variety of flowers and leaves in multiple colors, predominantly red and pink hues. Amidst these floral elements are figures likely representing deities; they are creatively integrated into the design, with some figures appearing to emerge from the flowers themselves. \n\nThe background consists of a sumptuous interior, possibly within a temple or a dedicated worship room. It showcases ornate wooden carvings and a balcony with arches, which are accentuated with decorative motifs and rows of small lights or candles that add a warm illumination to the scene. Lower in the frame and partially reflective is a large mirror that captures the base of the floral arrangement, emphasizing its complex and colorful details.\n\nOverall, the composition exudes a sense of ceremonial reverence, artistic expression, and cultural richness, suggesting that this setting is used for religious devotion and possibly for celebrating significant religious festivals or rituals.","title":"Christmas decorations at Mi Tierra Cafe","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["554209","556237","558384","558383","549585","558026","548288","558398","558406","547752","556318","552473","558400","558027","558389","558239"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["arrangement","candle","altar","reverence","flower","carving","richness","festival","motif","figure"]}
