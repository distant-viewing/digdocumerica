{"path":"545336.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a desert scene, characterized by a deeply rutted, sandy dirt road that extends into the distance, bisecting the landscape. The road appears seldom traveled, with distinct tire tracks marking its path which heads straight towards a distant, low hill under a clear blue sky.\n\nThe terrain on either side of the road is covered with sparse desert vegetation, including small shrubs and scattered dry grasses. The environment is notably arid, and the soil is red, suggesting a high iron content typical of some desert regions.\n\nDominating the foreground is a patch of sand showing clear signs of wind erosion, with a ripple-like texture. In this pathway, a snake is visible, blending with the sandy environment, adding a hint of wildlife to the scene. The snake's presence indicates the natural, undisturbed aspect of this desert.\n\nThis landscape, devoid of any visible human activity or construction, evokes a sense of remote, rugged solitude. The overall atmosphere is quiet and still, with only the signs of natural elements and occasional wildlife disrupting the vast emptiness.","title":"Rattlesnake on the sand dunes of the Rio GRande Valley near Albuquerque, New Mexico.
