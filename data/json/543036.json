Next to her, an older woman is dressed in a dark blue coat over a dotted blouse, with a brooch pinned on her lapel, contrasting with her lighter attire. She also wears white socks with dark shoes, similar to the younger woman’s style. She is gesturing with one hand, possibly emphasizing a point in their discussion.\n\nThe background suggests a quiet residential area with parked cars and a tree-lined street.
