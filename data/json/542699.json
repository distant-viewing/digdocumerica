{"path":"542699.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged natural scene featuring a waterfall cascading through a steep, rocky canyon. The waterfall itself is split into two distinct streams at the point where it passes between a narrow rock divider before converging back into a single powerful jet. This jet forcefully plunges into a turbulent pool below, surrounded by large boulders and frothy white water, indicative of the waterfall's power and the river's swift current.\n\nThe rocky terrain around the waterfall is uneven and rough, with a range of tones from dark browns to lighter shades of gray, suggesting a composition primarily of weathered stone. There are sporadic patches of greenery along the cliffs, possibly small bushes or hardy trees, clinging to the crevices where soil has accumulated. The overall setting is remote and appears wild, untouched by human development.\n\nViewing angles and the composition of the photo give a sense of depth and height, emphasizing the drama and scale of the waterfall and its surrounding cliffs. The photograph's vantage point might be from an opposing cliff or from a height looking down on the waterfall, providing a comprehensive view of the water's descent and the ensuing chaos at the bottom where the water meets the river. The lighting suggests daylight, with enough illumination to detail the textures of the rock and the frothiness of the swirling water below.","title":"One of the waterfalls along the upper Kings River in an inaccessible gorge.
