{"path":"545303.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This image depicts a pile of old, wrecked cars in a scrapyard. The multitude of vehicles, which include sedans, coupes, and possibly station wagons from various decades, are stacked haphazardly on top of each other. The cars show signs of severe damage, including crushed bodies, shattered windows, and missing parts, indicating they are likely destined for dismantling or recycling.\n\nThe colors of the vehicles vary, with visible hues of white, red, rusty brown, and various shades of blue and green. Some car parts such as engines and tires are prominently visible. Notably, the hood and trunk lids of many cars are open or detached, exposing the insides.\n\nThe setting around these cars is filled with clear, blue skies, suggesting the photo was taken on a bright, sunny day. The perspective of the image is from a slightly low angle, giving a sense of the towering stack of cars against the vivid sky. This angle enhances the chaotic and cluttered arrangement of the vehicles.\n\nOverall, this image captures a scene of automotive decay and the final resting place for vehicles that have reached the end of their usable lives, emphasizing themes of obsolescence and recycling in the context of industrial waste management.","title":"National metals junkyard","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["542656","553006","555492","553005","545340","552738","554348","554320","545365","545545","546268","554352","552739","547476","552999","544819"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","vehicle","obsolescence","shatte","stack","angle","coupe","detach","chaotic","inside"]}
