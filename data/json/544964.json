{"path":"544964.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a surfer in action on a bright sunny day. The surfer, a young individual with a lean build, appears to be skillfully balancing on a short surfboard while riding a frothy wave. The surfer is bent at the knees and uses their arms to maintain balance, with one arm extended forward and the other slightly back.\n\nThe ocean is a vivid blue, and the waves are white and foamy, indicating active surf conditions. In the background, the coastline stretches out with visible cliffs or mountains, suggesting that this scene takes place in a scenic, possibly rugged coastal area. The sky is clear and noticeably bright, suggesting it is midday or early afternoon.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the dynamic motion of surfing, with the surfer centrally positioned against the contrasting calm of the deep blue sea and the distant, serene mountainous landscape. The picture appears to be taken from a low angle from the water level, which enhances the dramatic effect of the wave and the surfer's engagement with the sea.","title":"Surfing along Malibu Beach, California","placename":"Malibu (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543393","557424","554066","543073","543876","554065","553687","553690","543215","545086","547609","543019","557481","543391","543397","545179"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["wave","balance","arm","surfboard","sea","knee","midday","calm","ride","coastline"]}
