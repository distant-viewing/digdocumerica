{"path":"548360.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph captures a hazy, atmospheric view of a densely packed urban skyline shrouded in mist or smog. The image predominantly features silhouettes of multiple buildings of varying heights and designs. The most notable structure, standing taller than the others and centrally positioned within the composition, appears to be the Empire State Building, indicating that this is likely a view of Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a significant green space, which is uncommon in such urban settings, suggesting this could be Central Park. A curved outline, possibly a pathway or a small road, snakes through the park area. Alongside the park, the east side is lined with a sequence of residential or office buildings, contributing to the city's dense and layered appearance.\n\nThe lighting suggests either early morning or late evening, creating a soft silhouette effect on the buildings and resulting in a monochrome color palette dominated by blues and grays. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is serene yet somewhat somber, given the fog or smog that blurs details and muffles the usually sharp outlines of the cityscape. The old and slightly worn look of the photograph, emphasized by visible marks and noise, adds to the nostalgic and dramatic ambiance of this city scene.","title":"Skyscrapers of Manhattan veiled in smog","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548345","548337","548386","548378","555735","548319","548408","545499","549620","548385","549970","555741","548421","548384","552394","548383"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["smog","outline","noise","sequence","silhouette","city","result","shroud","fog","snake"]}
