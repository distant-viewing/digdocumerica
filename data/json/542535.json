{"path":"542535.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows a rural industrial scene featuring two men working near a large tank truck. The tank truck, which is prominent in the image, has a dark body with \"MOBILE WATER\" painted on its side in white lettering, suggesting it's used for transporting water. The truck is parked beside a small body of water, possibly a pond or drainage ditch, in an open field with sparse vegetation.\n\nThe two men appear to be engaged in some sort of water management activity, as one of them is handling a large hose that extends from the truck to the water body. Both are dressed in casual workwear typical of outdoor or industrial tasks.\n\nThe background consists of a flat, rural landscape with distant utility poles and another road or pathway tracing through the field, hinting at an agricultural or semi-industrial setting. The sky is clear, contributing to the visibility and brightness of the scene. \n\nThis scene may depict environmental management or agricultural activities involving water distribution or collection in a rural area. The image captures a moment of labor and interaction with the environment in a seemingly remote location.","title":"Oil waste","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["555876","555561","555866","544061","553655","555875","542527","548137","544469","544258","544164","547159","558297","545657","545667","555877"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["truck","management","workwear","ditch","water","tank","drainage","transporting","distribution","trace"]}
