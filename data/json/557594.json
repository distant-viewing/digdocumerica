{"path":"557594.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"The image showcases a dense, vividly colored underwater scene predominantly featuring sea urchins. Each sea urchin exhibits radiating spines in a variety of colors such as yellow, green, purple, and orange, creating a starburst effect across the entire view. The sea urchins densely populate the scene, closely packed across what seems to be a rock or coral surface, perhaps on the ocean floor. The collective appearance of the sea urchins, with their diverse range of hues and tight arrangement, gives a kaleidoscopic impression, filled with natural patterns and textures. There is a beautiful contrast provided by the varying shades of the sea urchins against the darker background, hinting at the depth and richness of marine biodiversity. This type of scene is typically found in a reef environment, suggesting a healthy, vibrant marine ecosystem.","title":"Close-up of moss growing on an old log in the Queets River rain forest in Olympic National Park, Washington.
