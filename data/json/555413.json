{"path":"555413.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph shows a window-mounted sign that states \"NO GAS TODAY\" in bold, handwritten style where the letters are outlined and filled with dark shading, possibly with a black marker. The sign appears to be made of a transparent material, possibly plastic or laminated paper, given its semi-translucent texture and the way it reflects light.\n\nBehind the sign, visible through the glass, is the interior of a store which seems to be a service station or similar retail environment. Various items are faintly visible in the dimly lit background, including what looks to be shelving with merchandise. The store's environment looks relatively cluttered, suggesting a typically stocked service station or a small local shop.\n\nThe photograph primarily captures a moment of resource scarcity, as indicated by the message on the sign, and there's a visible emphasis on this message by placing it at what is presumably the front entrance or main window of the establishment. Such signs were common during periods of fuel shortages. The background elements, while less distinct due to the focus on the sign, set the scene of a business impacted by the lack of fuel availability.","title":"Gasoline stations such as this one at Lincoln City were closing earlier and staying closed longer, including the weekends during the Oregon gasoline shortage in the fall of 1973.
