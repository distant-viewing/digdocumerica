{"path":"554784.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with a rural, somewhat nostalgic atmosphere, featuring a standout old-fashioned gas pump in the foreground and an aged, red-painted building in the background. The gas pump, which is prominently at the forefront, is white with rust and wear visible on its surface, indicating it has been exposed to the elements for many years. It has a clear glass top where the fuel price would typically be displayed and a handle on its side, typical of vintage pumps. There is a word \"OCTANE\" near the bottom of the pump, and other faded text that suggests it has not been in use for some time.\n\nBehind the gas pump, the building, largely painted in red, has a steeply pitched, shingled roof that is grey and looks to be metallic, with signs of rust and degeneration. The architecture suggests it might be a barn or an old store. On its side, several faded advertisements are visible, some of which appear to be for automotive products, adding to the overall old-timey, possibly mid-20th-century vibe of the scene. There are windows covered with wooden panels, hinting that the building may no longer be in use.\n\nThe environment around these central objects is sparse and rural, with a gravel area in front and what seems to be a grassy field in the background. Further in the distance, another building can be seen, which contributes to the sense of a small, perhaps abandoned or scarcely populated rural area. The sky is overcast, casting an even, diffused light over the scene and enhancing the faded, worn-out look of the setting. The tone and composition of the image evoke a sense of paused time and bygone eras.","title":"An abandoned gas station near a stripped area off route 800","placename":"Freeport (Ohio)","location":"Freeport, Ohio","nn1":["546973","555511","555510","547874","544028","555517","546153","555520","555512","550103","556368","549003","557142","555405","547866","555506"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["pump","gas","fade","rust","price","fuel","building","paint","time","pitch"]}
