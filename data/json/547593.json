{"path":"547593.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures the dramatic moment of a large, white bird, likely a heron, in the midst of flight. The bird is centered and spreads its broad wings elegantly as it takes off or lands, suggesting action and grace. The lighting emphasizes the bird's silhouette and highlights details on the wings.\n\nThe background is visually dense and shadowy, consisting of rich green foliage and various plants that seem to thrive in a wet or marsh-like habitat. The environment gives a natural and somewhat secluded setting, exhibiting a mix of dark and light green colors with patches of brighter, illuminated sections possibly indicating areas hit by sunlight.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is serene yet vibrant, capturing a fleeting moment of natural beauty and grace in a wild setting. The composition is balanced, with the birdâ€™s position and the surrounding flora filling the frame to create a full, dynamic scene.","title":"Black-crowned night heron in flight","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["543922","545142","551379","557204","543873","544631","548731","544489","544539","544616","551378","547322","550388","544605","548832","544543"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["bird","grace","wing","heron","marsh","midst","flight","flora","habitat","position"]}
