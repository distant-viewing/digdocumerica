{"path":"546811.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a lively riverside scene likely during a warm day, showcasing a range of outdoor activities. Several people, including both adults and children, are engaged in different forms of leisure at the edge of the river. The group is situated on large, weathered rocks that serve as a natural seating and standing area along the riverbank.\n\nSome individuals are fishing; a young boy in the foreground sits on a rock holding a fishing rod, intently looking at the water, while next to him, another child is reaching toward the water. Behind them, there are more people also involved in fishing, standing or sitting with rods directed at the river.\n\nTo the left side of the photograph, two boys stand near the water, one possibly preparing to cast his line, while the other observes the surroundings. A woman nearby, in shorts and a light-colored blouse, stands with part of her body turned towards her companions, perhaps conversing or supervising.\n\nIn the background, the lush, dense trees lining the opposite bank of the river contribute to a sense of tranquility and seclusion from urban environments. The sky is visibly clear above, suggesting a sunny day conducive to such outdoor activities.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes a communal and relaxed atmosphere, highlighting recreational fishing and possibly picnicking along a picturesque river setting.","title":"A hot Sunday afternoon at Rocky Point Park","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["548737","543164","542647","551499","545933","543943","544223","554475","549935","551350","542564","551430","551525","545941","550848","546803"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["fishing","rod","river","boy","companion","supervise","child","sit","picnic","rock"]}
