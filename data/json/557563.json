{"path":"557563.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, early morning scene on a mist-covered lake. In the foreground, two people can be seen sitting in a small boat, gently rowing through the calm waters. They appear to be engaged in either a tranquil conversation or silently enjoying the peaceful surroundings. The lake's surface is smooth, and the cool mist rising from it creates an ethereal atmosphere, suggesting that the photo was taken at dawn.\n\nAround the lake, lush, densely packed trees in various shades of green frame the scene, adding to the feeling of seclusion and natural beauty. The background shows a softly lit hillside, also densely covered in trees, and there's an indication of a human presence given by a few utility poles with visible power lines stretching across the hill.\n\nOn the left side of the image, slightly obscured by trees, a small structure, possibly a house or a shed, is partially visible, indicating that this area might be near a residential place.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its focus on the two people in the boat surrounded by the natural beauty of the misty lake and forested landscape, evokes a sense of tranquility and a moment of quiet companionship in a secluded natural setting. The muted colors and soft lighting enhance the dreamy, peaceful quality of the image.","title":"Youngsters boating on Malibu lake in the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county.
