{"path":"543510.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a group of four hikers, possibly on a mountain trek, walking atop a snow-covered trail. The setting is picturesque with panoramic mountain vistas in the distance, suggesting this might be a high-altitude environment, possibly alpine or a part of a mountain range.\n\nFrom left to right, the first hiker is seen from the back; they are wearing a red and white jacket, shorts, and are carrying a large white bag over one shoulder. The second, third, and fourth hikers are also viewed from behind, wearing matching white t-shirts with a circular red symbol on the back, black pants or leggings, and dark footwear. All hikers are equipped with walking sticks or poles, which they are using to aid their trek on the snowy terrain.\n\nThe distant background reveals other mountain peaks, some capped with snow, under a somewhat cloudy sky, providing a scenic and possibly chilly backdrop to their activity. At the right edge of the image, part of a pine tree can be seen, suggesting a mixed environment with sparse vegetation in an otherwise open landscape dominated by snow and rock.\n\nThis image beautifully captures a moment of adventure and exploration in a rugged and cold environment, showcasing the hikers' preparedness and determination as they traverse through challenging terrain.","title":"California -- Mammoth Mt.","placename":"Mammoth Mountain (Calif.)","location":"Mammoth Mountain, California","nn1":["543385","543382","554508","543383","543375","543381","554503","554509","554504","545700","554505","554672","544305","543371","543378","545710"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","snow","mountain","determination","footwear","preparedness","walking","vista","stick","symbol"]}
