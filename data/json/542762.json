{"path":"542762.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features an automotive testing scene, likely taken within a laboratory or testing facility that monitors vehicle emissions, specifically complying with California vehicle emissions standards. The focus of the image is a vintage car placed on a testing platform, viewed through what appears to be a large measuring or observation device, likely an emissions testing machine.\n\nThe car's front view is prominent with its headlights turned on and a shiny, clean appearance suggesting a controlled testing environment. Above the car, suspended signs display \"HYDROCARBONS,\" \"CARBON MONOXIDE,\" and \"CALIFORNIA VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS,\" indicating the specific pollutants being monitored and the standards to which the vehicle is being tested.\n\nTo the background right side, partially obscured by the laboratory equipment, a person is visible. This individual, likely a technician or engineer, is engaged in monitoring or controlling the testing process. They appear focused on their task, outfitted in typical laboratory or industrial attire.\n\nThe setting includes various industrial-looking elements such as overhead lights and geometric, metallic structures, all part of the facilities' exhaust system or measurement tools. The textures are predominantly dark and metallic, with a focus on functionality and the industrial aspect, fitting for a technical and mechanical environment.\n\nOverall, the composition blends the technical details integral to emissions testing with a hint of human activity, set against a backdrop that emphasizes the scientific and regulatory nature of the work being conducted.","title":"Emission testing","placename":"Los Angeles County (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles County, California","nn1":["549690","553895","549691","549692","557859","557930","557825","557829","549689","557855","557889","557851","557850","542763","542754","557849"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["testing","emission","laboratory","engineer","technician","car","vehicle","exhaust","measurement","pollutant"]}
