{"path":"557968.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a river running through a lush, green landscape. The river features strong, swirling currents with some areas of white water, likely indicative of rapid movement. The river is bordered on both sides by thick greenery, which predominantly consists of trees and shrubs. A noticeable aspect is a man-made structure visible in the river, possibly a weir or dam, which appears to regulate the flow and create turbulence in the water.\n\nThe scene is captured on a bright sunny day, evidenced by the clarity of the light and shadows cast by trees directly downwards. There is a meandering dirt path running parallel to one side of the river, which adds a linear contrast to the winding river. In the distance, more dense foliage can be observed, extending to the horizon under a blue sky. This setting likely depicts a natural reserve or a similarly protected area, emphasizing the convergence of human engineering with natural water systems.","title":"Ohio-Erie Canal water, center foreground, is channeled away from the Cuyahoga River as seen from Ohio Highway 82 bridge spanning the Cuyahoga Valley near Cleveland, Ohio. Looking south the picture shows the towpath in the foreground and the railroad on the far side of the river. This area is part of the 30,000 acre Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which contains the last major undeveloped land remaining between the metropolitan areas of Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["546351","552838","542701","550616","550542","550658","550623","550527","553452","552925","555753","550885","550524","550580","550622","552953"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","turbulence","reserve","dam","current","engineering","clarity","flow","system","aspect"]}
