{"path":"554877.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph shows a scene that appears to be from a casual, outdoor gathering involving three people and a motorcycle. The setting is a grassy yard with a few trees and part of a small house visible in the background. The focus of the activity is a shiny, black motorcycle that is positioned on the back of a brown pickup truck, possibly being loaded or unloaded.\n\nIn the foreground, a young man with shoulder-length brown hair and sunglasses, wearing a black Harley-Davidson t-shirt paired with blue jeans and brown boots, is straddling the motorcycle. He seems to be carefully handling the bike, possibly preparing to move it. Directly behind him, in the middle ground, there is another young man dressed in a light blue, tight-fitting long-sleeve shirt, and blue jeans. He is watching the central figure intensely as if concerned or interested in the task at hand. Thereâ€™s potentially another person visible at the rightmost edge of the frame, dressed in a dark jacket with a light color top visible at the collar area, possibly assisting or observing as well.\n\nThe overall composition of the image shows dynamic interaction focused around the motorcycle, suggesting a moment of cooperation and outdoor activity among friends, with a somewhat relaxed but attentive atmosphere.","title":"Motorcyclist from Leakey, Texas, loads his cycle on a truck with the help of friends near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554876","545598","554875","556206","554872","546993","554481","558232","554874","556418","547803","551383","545135","545134","553955","548690"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["motorcycle","cooperation","bike","collar","pickup","friend","boot","yard","sunglass","shoulder"]}
