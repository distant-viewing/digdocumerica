{"path":"553682.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a busy urban street lined with lush palm trees on either side under bright sunlight. The street is packed with cars, showing a scene of bustling city traffic with vehicles in multiple lanes heading in both directions. In the visual centerline of the image, a pedestrian crossing is faintly visible, and a few pedestrians can be seen walking near the sidewalks. The surroundings include tall city buildings that enclose the street, adding a metropolitan feel to the scene. The buildings are mostly modern, with large windows reflecting the sunlight, while the prominence of palm trees suggests a tropical, possibly seaside urban environment. The perspective of the image is captured from a high vantage point, looking down the length of the street, which adds a dynamic depth to the composition. Shadows cast by the high sun create a contrast on the street, emphasizing the density and activity in the area.","title":"Kalakaua avenue is the main street of the waikiki beach area","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553688","552379","553301","551478","556195","544013","552710","546730","552711","549874","551471","553681","556807","556729","555450","549886"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["street","palm","crossing","prominence","city","sunlight","walking","pedestrian","lane","density"]}
