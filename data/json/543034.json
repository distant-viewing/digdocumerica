{"path":"543034.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a young man standing on an asphalt road, viewed from behind and somewhat to the side. He is dressed in a distinctive ensemble that features a dark brown jacket with lengthy fringe detailing, particularly noticeable along the arms and back. He also wears a dark hat with a feather tucked into the band, adding a touch of flair to his appearance.\n\nIn his right hand, he carries a large, somewhat worn canvas bag, suggesting he might be traveling or carrying important items. His left arm is extended outwards in a hitchhiking gesture, thumb prominently displayed, indicating he is seeking a ride.\n\nThe environment around him is bathed in the soft, warm light of what could be either early morning or late afternoon sun. Behind him, a line of tall pine trees and dense shrubbery can be seen, possibly delineating the edge of a forest or a well-vegetated area. The road seems quiet, adding a sense of solitude to the scene.\n\nThe overall mood captured feels somewhat adventurous and hopeful, emphasizing a moment in travel and the anticipation of the journey ahead.","title":"Hitchhiker","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["545349","549058","553418","551300","557112","542548","547679","543833","544349","547310","555140","549083","545500","544408","545493","552087"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["travel","arm","carry","seek","ensemble","fringe","flair","anticipation","delineate","canvas"]}
