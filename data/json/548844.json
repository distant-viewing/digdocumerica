{"path":"548844.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and visually striking moment taking place in a body of water, possibly a lake or ocean. The focal point is a person swimming, shown from behind and to the side. They are immersed in the water up to about their shoulders, and their head is turned partially towards the camera, with water splashing around their body which indicates movement, possibly from swimming or diving.\n\nThe water is glistening under what appears to be bright sunlight, creating numerous sparkles and small highlights on the surface. These light reflections add a glittering texture to the water surface, enhancing the visual appeal of the image.\n\nThe background is simple and predominantly dark, contrasting with the bright, sparkling water, which helps in focusing the viewerâ€™s attention squarely on the action of the splashing water and the swimmer. The overall atmosphere evoked by the image is one of vitality and refreshing activity in nature.","title":"Swimming in Havasu Lake","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548835","549103","544347","550237","553444","552227","544351","544343","556295","548842","548834","544196","551285","551165","548683","545882"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["water","swimmer","vitality","diving","sparkle","swimming","appeal","highlight","shoulder","surface"]}
