{"path":"550982.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic industrial scene dominated by heavy smoke and industrial structures. In the foreground, there are multiple utility poles and lines that crisscross the view, creating a lattice of wires against the sky. A small, dark building occupies the lower right, with what appears to be a dirt track leading up to or away from it.\n\nIn the middle ground, the main features include various large industrial buildings, distinguishable by their size, shape, and the thick smoke billowing from their stacks. These buildings appear robust, probably made of concrete or metal, and are designed for heavy industrial use. The presence of smoke suggests ongoing industrial activity, likely involving production processes that emit large amounts of smoke or steam.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a tall metal tower structure, possibly for electrical transmission or telecommunications, standing prominently against the sky. The sky itself is overcast, filled with a bluish and somewhat dark tone, enhancing the moody and gritty feel of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph gives a sense of a busy industrial area, likely associated with manufacturing or energy production, working under overcast conditions that emphasize the impact of industrial activity on the environment. The image communicates themes of industry, pollution, and the stark functionality of utilitarian structures.","title":"Emission from the Union Carbide ferro Alloy plant darkens the sky at Alloy, WV.","placename":"Charleston (W.
