{"path":"549336.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene on a boat where several people are engaged in maritime activities. Key elements in the image include a group of men and women, mostly in swimwear, working together to handle what appears to be a large fishing net filled with catch. One can observe the following details:\n\n1. **People**: The focus is predominantly on a group of adults; the men are shirtless, wearing shorts or swim trunks, while the women wear bikinis or swimsuits. They are physically involved in the task, with expressions and postures indicating effort and collaboration. For instance, in the center, a man wearing a white hat is bending over the net, possibly examining or arranging the catch.\n\n2. **Activity**: The central activity involves handling a large, bulky fishing net on the deck of the boat. The net seems heavy, laden with catch, and requires teamwork to manage. This suggests that these individuals could be engaged in either a research activity (studying marine life) or a commercial fishing operation.\n\n3. **Setting**: The scene occurs on the deck of a boat, surrounded by water, implying an ocean or sea location. The boat is equipped with various maritime gear, including ropes and life rings, indicating preparedness for sea operations.\n\n4. **Background**: In addition to the people and activities on deck, one can see a calm sea and the horizon in the background. The sky is partly cloudy, hinting at fair weather, conducive for sea outings.\n\n5. **Composition**: The photograph is candid, with a dynamic composition that captures motion and interaction among the group. The angle provides a broad view of the deck, allowing viewers to take in both the human activity and the maritime context effectively.\n\nThis image effectively conveys a sense of teamwork and activity, characteristic of a fishing or marine research expedition, set against the vastness of the sea.","title":"Zoology students from the University of Vienna participate in a scientific cruise on the research ship, the Vila Velebita II.
