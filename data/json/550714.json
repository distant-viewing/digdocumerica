{"path":"550714.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene featuring a large paper mill named \"Oxford Paper Company\" situated beside a calm river. The building is substantial, primarily constructed from large concrete or metal panels painted in a muted color. Prominent on the building is the \"OXFORD QUALITY PAPERS\" text in large, block letters.\n\nThere are several tall, narrow chimneys adjacent to the main structure from which thick white smoke is billowing into the sky. The smoke rises straight up before dispersing, indicating minimal wind.\n\nThe surroundings include lush greenery with dense trees visible behind the facility, emphasizing the contrast between nature and the industrial activity. The river in the foreground reflects some of the structures and the gray, cloudy sky above, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon lighting. The overall atmosphere conveys a working industrial site coexisting alongside a natural water body and forested area.","title":"Oxford Paper Company mill at Rumford on the Androscoggin River.
