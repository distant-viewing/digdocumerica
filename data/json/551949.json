{"path":"551949.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"In the photograph, we see two men outside near a waterfront property that appears to have undergone some distress, possibly from a natural disaster or storm. The setting includes a disheveled outdoor area with debris and scattered items like parts of a fence, ropes, and a variety of unidentifiable objects lying on the ground covered in dry mud.\n\nThe man on the left of the image is stepping over what looks like a concrete path, examining a large, overturned barbeque grill. He wears a black coat and dark trousers suggesting it might be a chilly day. His expression appears focused and somewhat concerned as he leans slightly forward while walking.\n\nOn the right, another man, standing on the same concrete path, has his hand over his face, which could signal distress, sadness or overwhelming emotion. He is dressed in a plaid jacket, trousers, and wears a cap. He is turned partially away from the viewer, increasing the sense of his emotional burden.\n\nIn the background, next to the first man, there is a part of a building visible with a block wall and what seems to be a metallic door or window. Beyond them, a calm body of water stretches into the horizon, blurring the line between land and sky due to the overcast weather.\n\nOverall, the scene depicted is somber with a focus on the aftermath of an event that has visibly affected the area and the individuals involved.","title":"Man and wife start cleanup after severe lake storm that ravaged their home and yard.
