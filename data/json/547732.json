{"path":"547732.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric sunset scene dominated by multiple rows of telephone poles stretched across the horizon. The sky is a warm, gradient orange hue, signaling that the sun is setting. The sun itself is prominently displayed in the sky, almost centrally located in the image, casting a soft, orange glow.\n\nThe telephone poles, silhouetted against the brightly lit sky, create a striking linear perspective that draws the viewer's eye towards the horizon. These poles are densely equipped with crossbars and wires, which form intricate patterns against the sky. The repetition of the poles and their diminishing size towards the background adds a sense of depth and scale to the image.\n\nIn the foreground, the details are obscured by the silhouette effect, focusing attention on the play of light and the stark outlines of the poles and wires. There are no visible people or moving objects, which enhances the stillness and tranquil mood of the image. The overall composition is balanced between the natural beauty of the sunset and the man-made structure of the telephone poles, capturing a moment of harmony between technology and nature.","title":"Transmission lines near Salton Sea.
