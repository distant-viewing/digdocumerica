{"path":"548048.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a dense cluster of floating homes. These houses appear closely packed together, predominantly one-story structures with a variety of roof shapes, including flat and gabled roofs. The homes display a mix of different colors and siding materials, contributing to a somewhat eclectic appearance. Some have decks and small balconies, while others have items like patio chairs visible outside, indicating residential use.\n\nThe scene is set against a backdrop featuring a large industrial structure, possibly a bridge or similar large infrastructure, which partially obscures the sky. This juxtaposition emphasizes a contrast between the residential area and the industrial environment in the background. The presence of utility poles and numerous lines suggests a well-established community, likely reliant on typical urban utilities despite its atypical setting on water.\n\nOverall, the image captures a vibrant and tightly knit floating home community, characterized by its unique blend of individuality and compact urban living, all set within an industrialized area.","title":"Houseboats on the Columbia River Slough near the Interstate 5 freeway and industrial area.
