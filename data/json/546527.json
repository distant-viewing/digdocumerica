{"path":"546527.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene of four children playing basketball in an outdoor setting. The kids, who appear to be two boys and two girls, are actively engaged in a game—they're jumping and reaching to either intercept or assist in a shot at the basketball hoop. The hoop is attached to a simple, unmarked white backboard and mounted on a pole, the ball mid-air just below it.\n\nThe backdrop features a large, grey, modern building with a unique architectural style characterized by sharp angles and a series of vertical windows that are partly shaded. It looks like an institutional building, possibly a school or community center. The environment appears to be fairly open, with a wide paved area where the children are playing, hinting at a communal or school playground space.\n\nThe children are dressed casually; their clothing style suggesting a time frame that could be from the 1970s or 1980s—flared jeans, and colorful, layered tops. The vibe is energetic and playful, with a casual, unorganised feel to the game, indicative of a spontaneous play session among friends. The weather seems mild and overcast, and despite the lack of sunshine, the mood is cheerful and vibrant.","title":"Southside Junior High School, built in 1969","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["551128","556162","553096","545490","552755","552011","556287","554850","556136","551031","556437","553512","547176","556159","556160","556431"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["basketball","hoop","school","game","child","kid","sunshine","session","playground","ball"]}
