{"path":"555612.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph shows a rural scene featuring a dilapidated barn and a rundown house. The barn, occupying the left side of the image, is in a state of severe disrepair with much of its structure collapsed, revealing its wooden skeletal frame. Sections of the roof are missing, allowing light to pass through the gaps.\n\nIn front of the barn are piles of hay and scattered debris, including broken wooden planks and overgrown vegetation, suggesting the site has been neglected for some time. The surrounding area is overgrown with tall weeds and grasses, adding to the atmosphere of abandonment.\n\nTo the right of the barn, there is a two-story wooden house, also appearing neglected. The house's paint is faded and peeling, and the overall structure seems worn. A front porch can be seen, along with a couple of windows, partially obscured by the overgrowth.\n\nThe scene is set under a clear blue sky, and it's brightly lit, presumably by sunlight, although no shadows are distinctly visible on the ground. In the background, utility poles and lines are visible, adding a small hint of modern infrastructure to the otherwise rustic and forgotten setting. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of decay and the passage of time, capturing a snapshot of rural abandonment.","title":"Abandoned barn succumbs to the elements, and an adjoining house which is empty off Route #800 near Barnesville, Ohio.","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["552494","552455","554782","555627","552515","554822","557141","552448","554821","543344","554561","550693","552491","554707","547658","545233"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["barn","house","abandonment","overgrowth","hay","weed","gap","time","disrepair","passage"]}
