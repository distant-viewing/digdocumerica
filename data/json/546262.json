{"path":"546262.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a person standing in a large, barren field that seems to be under development or possibly used as a disposal site. The ground is rough and mostly dirt, with patches of grass and scattered debris, including what appear to be pieces of paper or trash. The terrain is slightly hilly, and there's a noticeable amount of disturbance to the soil, suggesting recent heavy activity such as digging or moving earth.\n\nIn the foreground, a man is visible from behind; he stands with his legs slightly apart, looking out across the field. He is dressed in a long-sleeved, light-colored shirt and darker pants, and appears to be wearing a baseball cap.\n\nIn the background, to the left, there are several large piles of dirt and some heavy machinery, possibly related to construction or earth-moving. There are also a few large barrels or containers visible, which could be used for storing materials or waste. The scene is bordered by a line of trees, indicating that the field is on the edge of a wooded area.\n\nThe sky is clear with a few clouds, suggesting a fair weather day, probably quite bright due to the lack of shadows in the dirt area. The overall atmosphere of the image conveys a sense of isolation and focus on the man's interaction or contemplation of the landscape in front of him.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
