{"path":"547282.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph is a close-up portrait of an older man, capturing his expression in vivid detail. The man wears a patterned flat cap tilted on his head, shading his eyes slightly. His facial features are rugged and prominent, with deep-set eyes and visible signs of aging. He exhibits a slightly open-mouthed expression, revealing a few missing teeth, adding character to his weathered face.\n\nHe is dressed in a dark, open-neck shirt layered under a lighter, striped shirt which is also open to reveal his chest. The texture of his skin and the detail in his garments are particularly striking, showing a mixture of toughness and vulnerability.\n\nThe background behind him is blurred, focusing the viewer's attention on him. The lighting infuses the scene with a warm, natural tone, accentuating the contours of his face and the texture of his clothing.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a strong sense of the man's personality and life experiences, encapsulated in the intimate and detailed portrayal of his appearance.","title":"A Nebraskan for more than half his life, Charlie Gross has farmed, boxed, raised dogs and sold hosiery and light bulbs.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["552103","548616","547028","556563","548226","548224","547179","543701","554846","548218","553055","552872","554857","553605","556452","556443"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["tooth","infuse","vulnerability","reveal","eye","garment","chest","portrait","portrayal","expression"]}
