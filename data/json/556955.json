{"path":"556955.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view showing a lush, densely forested landscape interspersed with residential and probably some commercial areas. The scene is dominated by a rich canopy of green trees. Amongst the trees, there are clearings where clusters of houses and roads can be seen. The houses generally have small clearings around them, likely yards, and are connected by a network of winding roads.\n\nIn the larger context of the landscape, there further appears to be an expanse of water, possibly a lake, river, or bay in the background, suggesting that this community is near a large body of water. Beyond the body of water, there are more land areas with a similar lush green appearance, indicating the expansive natural surroundings of the area.\n\nThe lower middle part of the image features a more closely packed community with homes and curving streets. This area is more developed compared to the surroundings, which show a mix of spaced-out single residences and dense forestation.\n\nOverall, the photo depicts a serene and possibly remote setting that balances natural forest areas with human habitation, all located near a significant water body, contributing to the scenic quality of the area.","title":"Aerial view of the flat re-growth Douglas fir land between brownsville and Bremerton.
