{"path":"547893.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a somewhat rugged and undeveloped urban waterfront scene. It features a shoreline cluttered with debris and scattered rocks. The foreground shows a muddy, rocky bank leading into a calm body of water, possibly a river or lake. Along the water's edge, miscellaneous objects such as small boulders and assorted rubbish are visible. Notable are several pieces of wood and random litter floating near the shore.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, the shoreline is lined with lush, green vegetation, thick and overgrown, giving a slightly neglected appearance to the area. This contrasts with the right side, which appears more barren and stony.\n\nIn the background, across the water, urban structures are visible - mid-rise buildings that suggest a cityscape or an industrial area. These buildings help frame the scene, providing a backdrop that indicates the proximity of urban development to this neglected waterfront area. The overall mood of the scene seems quiet and somber, with no visible human activity, highlighting an aspect of urban nature and decay. The color tones are quite subdued, primarily composed of blues, grays, and greens, enhancing the somewhat melancholic and abandoned feel of the setting.","title":"Oil from tankers coming into gravesend bay in south Brooklyn soaks the banks","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547622","547581","551985","548105","547582","550947","546785","551984","549300","547594","552046","547890","547019","547960","547626","544527"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waterfront","shoreline","neglect","rubbish","boulder","help","proximity","abandon","litter","subdue"]}
