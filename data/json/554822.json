{"path":"554822.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene dominated by an aged and weathered two-story wooden house, appearing abandoned and nestled in a natural landscape. The house, with its wood siding and a front porch, is partially obscured by leafless trees and overgrowth, suggesting neglect and the passage of time. To the left of the photo, a dirt road curves towards the house, lined with dry grass and bushes, enhancing the rustic and secluded feel of the scene.\n\nThe ambient lighting and deep shadows suggest it might be either early morning or late afternoon. The sky is clear and blue, contributing to the serene yet somber mood of the photograph. Around the house, the bare trees and scattered leaves on the ground indicate autumn or winter. The natural overgrowth and disrepair of the building convey a sense of abandonment and the encroachment of nature over man-made structures. No people or animals are visible, emphasizing solitude and the quietness of the environment.","title":"The owners of this farm sold out to the Hanna Coal Company in 1972, off Route 800, near Barnesville, Ohio, and Steubenville.","placename":"Barnesville (Ohio)","location":"Barnesville, Ohio","nn1":["555632","554788","554787","558110","552494","552455","549195","552491","546989","545233","558101","557640","555612","554823","556491","546997"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["overgrowth","house","quietness","encroachment","disrepair","passage","siding","autumn","curve","winter"]}
