{"path":"557385.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene within an industrial setting, focusing predominantly on a manufacturing or processing plant. The central foreground features a red and white truck moving towards the viewer, stirring up dust from the unpaved ground. The truck appears to be of an older model, typical of those used in heavy-duty applications.\n\nThe background is dominated by various large industrial structures. To the left, a building with complex machinery protruding from the rooftop and a smokestack releasing fumes into the air can be seen. In the center and right of the image, there are tall, cylindrical towers paired with interconnected metal frameworks, which likely serve as part of the plant's processing facilities. A large conveyor system extends upwards and across the frame, suggesting the movement of materials between different parts of the plant.\n\nThe plant is equipped with several functional pieces, such as cylindrical containers and wide cylindrical chutes, possibly for storage and processing of materials. Smaller details include scattered industrial barrels, a makeshift wooden structure, and metal scraps, indicating the ongoing activity and operations typical to such environments.\n\nThe overall scene is set under a clear sky, hinting at a bright but possibly dusty or smog-filled atmosphere, common in industrial zones. The photograph captures both the activity and the static complexity of an industrial landscape, showcasing the gritty reality of manufacturing or materials processing, with a focus on machinery, transportation, and industrial architecture.","title":"Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant. Smoke from the furnaces passes through the tall cooling towers in the center before going to the bag houses. Furnace emissions were decreased 97.7 percent between 1967 and 1975. Compliance schedule agreement was reached between the corporation and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. EPA stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards. (See fiche)","placename":"Alloy (W.
