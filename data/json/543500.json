{"path":"543500.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene with two adults and two dogs. The beach is expansive with wet sand, indicating it might be low tide. Waves are crashing energetically in the background, giving the scene a dynamic look.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a woman walking a small dog on a leash. She's wearing a casual, light-gray sweatshirt, pale blue pants, and white sneakers, suggesting a comfortable, relaxed outing. Her hair appears to be styled in a short, dark bob.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, a man, probably in middle age, walks another dog of the same breed. His attire consists of a light brown jacket, darker trousers, and black shoes, which contrasts with the casual wear of the woman. He has a grey beard and moustache, and he seems to be walking thoughtfully forward.\n\nThe dogs are small, with light brown and white fur, possibly a breed like Corgis. Both animals look active, walking briskly along the beach, pulling slightly on their leashes.\n\nThe environment conveys a sense of peace and natural beauty, with the powerful, foamy waves in the background and the clean, mostly empty beach suggesting a cool but sunny day. The scene seems to capture a moment of leisure and companionship in a picturesque natural setting.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543083","548695","543395","549928","543070","545133","548697","550924","543463","545218","543390","544191","553072","548292","553089","543394"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dog","leash","beach","breed","walk","sweatshirt","wave","sneaker","companionship","tide"]}
