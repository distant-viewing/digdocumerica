{"path":"555070.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph showcases a breathtaking sunset scene where the sun is partially visible above a soft, undulating horizon. The sun is on the verge of setting, illuminating the sky with a warm, golden glow. The shades vary from deep oranges and yellows near the sun to darker, reddish hues blending into a darker upper atmosphere. The horizon appears slightly uneven, suggesting the presence of distant hills or mountain silhouettes against the radiant backdrop. Clouds are scattered sparsely in the sky, some near the sun appear luminous while others in the upper parts of the frame are shadowed, enhancing the depth of the scene. The overall composition exudes a calm and serene end-of-day atmosphere, largely dominated by the dramatic interplay of light and shadow.","title":"Sunrise in the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["553844","542680","542678","552337","554396","557629","557957","548123","543144","557560","549847","554643","552277","542679","552294","552335"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","horizon","yellow","end","glow","orange","sunset","interplay","silhouette","atmosphere"]}
