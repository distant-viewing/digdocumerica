{"path":"553894.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling highway scene during twilight or evening hours. The image shows multiple lanes of traffic, densely filled with various cars and a prominent bus. The vehicles showcase their headlights, illuminating the wet surface of the road, which reflects the lights and creates a glowing effect. This suggests recent rainfall or wet weather conditions.\n\nThe perspective is slightly elevated, likely taken from an overpass, giving a broad view of the highway curving gently to the right. Overhead, there are green highway signs indicating directions for places such as \"Washington\" and \"Shillington,\" with arrows pointing towards the right lanes for these destinations.\n\nThe ambient light is low, and the sky appears deep blue or black, emphasizing the artificial lights from the street lamps and vehicle headlights. The atmosphere captures the hustle of peak traffic hours, possibly during an evening commute. The overall mood is dynamic yet routine, highlighting a common urban transportation scenario.","title":"Express bus lane on Shirley Highway, a major artery connecting the Northern Virginia suburbs with the city of Washington.
