{"path":"550948.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with multiple layers of activity and background elements. At the foreground, there is a large pile of scattered debris, predominantly concrete blocks and broken pieces, situated along the edge of a body of water which appears to be a river. The debris is extensive, suggesting demolition or aftermath of a natural disaster.\n\nIn the middle ground, a motel named \"Smiley's Motel\" stands across the bank of the river. It is a two-story structure with a darker bottom floor and a light-colored upper floor featuring several visible doors and windows. A sign with the motelâ€™s name in bold and vibrant colors is located on the roof, easily distinguishable against the green hills that form the background of the scene.\n\nThe background features dense trees on a steep hillside, which suggests a rural or semi-rural setting. The natural environment appears lush and overgrown, indicating it might be spring or summer. Additionally, there are a few sedans parked in front of the motel, dating the photo to a period when such car models were prevalent, possibly in the 1960s or 1970s based on their design.\n\nThe overall composition reflects a contrast between human habitation and raw nature, possibly highlighting themes of environmental impact or recovery following an event that caused the debris accumulation. The setting and elements suggest a narrative of resilience or aftermath, making it a compelling scene within a possibly historical context.","title":"The kanawha river behind this motel has become a trash heap.
