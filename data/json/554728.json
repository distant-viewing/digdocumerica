{"path":"554728.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph shows a dense forest seen in early autumn or late summer when the foliage is still lush yet begins to change color. A variety of trees, predominantly with thin, slightly leaning trunks, fill the scene. Their leaves display a mix of greens, yellows, and hints of reddish tones, suggesting a transition into fall.\n\nThe forest floor is covered with a carpet of lower shrubs and possibly early fallen leaves, contributing to the multicolored texture of the image. The canopy overhead is moderately thick, allowing some patches of sky or light to filter through, giving the image a slightly dappled effect of light and shadow.\n\nOverall, there are no human figures or man-made objects visible in this forest landscape; it's a natural and quiet woodland scene evocative of tranquility and the subtle shifts of the seasons. The perspective seems to be taken from within the forest itself, offering a viewer a sense of being surrounded by nature.","title":"Paper birch grove in the Adirondack Forest Preserve at 3,500 feet","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["554718","557821","550603","554425","557822","547643","558012","554715","549234","558088","557127","555133","555120","555114","558103","555216"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","leave","carpet","shift","overhead","fall","yellow","autumn","transition","summer"]}
