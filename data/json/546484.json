{"path":"546484.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features a striking architectural structure, prominently a large pyramid-shaped building with a highly geometric form. The building’s exterior is composed of dark, possibly slate tiles, with a prominent, glossy, metallic stripe descending down its center. This reflective vertical stripe creates a stark contrast with the matte surfaces of the other tiles. The pyramid stands against a light gray sky, and there are no clouds visible.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, there’s a tree with thin, bare branches, indicating it could be either autumn or winter. The tree slightly obscures the view but also adds an organic texture that contrasts with the clean, sharp lines of the architecture. The ground around the pyramid appears to be covered in grass, suggesting the setting is a well-maintained area, possibly a park or institutional grounds. There is a slight elevation around the building area, as the land gently slopes upwards towards the base of the pyramid.\n\nNo people are visible in the photograph, focusing the viewer’s attention primarily on the interplay between nature (the tree and grassy slopes) and the crafted geometry of the building. This composition highlights the striking design of the architecture while setting it in a tranquil, natural landscape.","title":"First baptist church, built in 1965","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546468","546473","546481","546469","546472","546480","546506","546542","546464","546415","555318","544565","546518","546531","548649","556644"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["tile","stripe","slope","grounds","striking","descende","architecture","building","prominent","upward"]}
