{"path":"554452.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene dominated by a tall, metal tower structure, which appears to be a fire lookout tower. The lookout is built atop a rocky outcrop or hill, surrounded by a few sparse trees; it's constructed of metal beams with a small cabin-like enclosure at the top. A ladder leads up to this enclosure. \n\nThe foreground of the image features a rock surface, possibly at the top of a mountain or large hill. The tower stands clear against a dusky sky, suggesting the photo was taken around sunset. \n\nIn the background, undulating hills stretch into the distance, cloaked in a wash of misty blues and purples typical of a sunset or dusk scene. A body of water is visible in the mid-ground, nestled among the hills, reflecting the serene evening light.\n\nThere are long shadows and a feeling of tranquility in the image, with the natural landscape sprawling peacefully around the human-made structure. A single wire, possibly part of a utility or communication line, is seen running into the frame toward the tower, adding a slight industrial element to the otherwise natural scene.","title":"Fire observation tower at bald mountain overlooking the fulton chain lakes near the town of Old Forge","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["544947","542675","546054","553028","553830","544690","549011","556929","555397","544355","543903","549135","544102","549805","549110","549020"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["tower","enclosure","sunset","undulating","cloak","nest","ladder","outcrop","wash","beams"]}
