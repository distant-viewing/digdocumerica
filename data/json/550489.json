{"path":"550489.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a serene landscape that appears to be taken during the low light of either early morning or late evening, giving the scene a soft and moody atmosphere. The image showcases a vast, open terrain covered in tufted patches of grass and interspersed with seemingly barren soil or pathways. The predominant colors in the grassy terrain are shades of deep green, rusty red, and hints of golden yellow, reflecting a rich tapestry of natural hues which may indicate seasonal changes or varying vegetation types.\n\nThere are no obvious signs of human activity or man-made structures, emphasizing the undisturbed and natural state of the landscape. The terrain is uneven, with gentle undulations and small hillocks that suggest a wild, possibly tundra-like or heath ecosystem. The soft lighting accentuates the textures of the landscape and casts subtle shadows across the ground, enhancing the contours and depth of the field.\n\nThe image does not include any visible bodies of water or mountains but instead focuses entirely on the textured ground cover and the natural beauty of an expansive, open wilderness. This simplicity directs the viewer's attention to the quiet grandeur and varied palette of the natural landscape.","title":"The Atigun River near the pipeline crossing point in the Atigun Valley","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556990","550434","552903","557182","549249","549218","551370","555589","545209","546154","550399","550426","550604","557191","545018","550437"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["tundra","terrain","undulation","tapestry","landscape","yellow","grandeur","change","contour","simplicity"]}
