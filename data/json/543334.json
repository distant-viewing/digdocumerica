{"path":"543334.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal landscape featuring a Mediterranean-style house perched on rugged cliffs overlooking a sea. The house, characterized by a light-colored exterior, terracotta roof tiles, and multiple chimneys, sits next to lush trees and overlooks the clear, turquoise waters of the sea below. The cliffs are steep and rocky, contrasting with the well-maintained appearance of the house.\n\nIn the foreground, various types of vegetation can be seen, including grasses, shrubs, and a dense growth of trees, adding to the scenic beauty and natural diversity of the setting. In the background, the image also shows a bridge, hinting at accessibility despite the remote and natural setting. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a bright and sunny day. The entire composition paints a picture of a serene, almost secluded location, ideal for solitude or a peaceful retreat from busier environments.","title":"Southern California -- Carmel Highlands","placename":"Carmel River (Calif.)","location":"Carmel River, California","nn1":["543340","545110","543336","543337","543355","557523","557429","543346","543426","551963","543437","543291","543184","543049","545222","543362"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["house","cliff","sea","retreat","accessibility","tile","ideal","diversity","growth","chimney"]}
