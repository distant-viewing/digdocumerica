{"path":"555129.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph displays a lone conifer tree against a dark, almost black, background. The tree appears to be dead or dying, characterized by its largely barren trunk and sparse branches, which exhibit remnants of thin, needle-like foliage. The branches subtly gleam, catching some ambient light that highlights them against the pervasive darkness of the setting. The image captures a nighttime or low-light ambiance, contributing to the eerie and somber mood. It evokes a sense of isolation, fragility, and the stark beauty of solitary forms in nature.","title":"A western red cedar candelabra in over mature forest in olympic national timberland, Washington.
