{"path":"555129.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph displays a lone conifer tree against a dark, almost black, background. The tree appears to be dead or dying, characterized by its largely barren trunk and sparse branches, which exhibit remnants of thin, needle-like foliage. The branches subtly gleam, catching some ambient light that highlights them against the pervasive darkness of the setting. The image captures a nighttime or low-light ambiance, contributing to the eerie and somber mood. It evokes a sense of isolation, fragility, and the stark beauty of solitary forms in nature.","title":"A western red cedar candelabra in over mature forest in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554994","543722","545747","555002","554973","555112","555071","553572","553580","543718","554981","546121","546065","557598","552551","552433"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["branch","nighttime","needle","darkness","remnant","trunk","form","isolation","ambiance","foliage"]}
