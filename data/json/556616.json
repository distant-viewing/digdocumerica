{"path":"556616.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photo features a collection of six used and empty cans arranged on a wooden surface, possibly a table or a deck. The cans, which appear weathered and a bit rusty, are held together by a metal wire frame designed to organize and carry them. There are at least three visible brand labels on these cans:\n\n1. **Schlitz** – One of the cans bears the label of Schlitz, which is a brand of beer. This can is notably placed in an upright position and located second from left in the front row.\n\n2. **Maxwell House** – Another can, conspicuous with its bright green label with white text, indicates it is a product from Maxwell House, known for coffee. This can is positioned in the front row, at the far right.\n\n3. **Borden's Evaporated Milk** – Displayed on the red and white can turned upside down, this label identifies the content it once had, which is evaporated milk from Borden's, a famous dairy brand.\n\nThe entire setup is outdoors, as evidenced by the natural lighting and shadows cast by the grouped cans. The wooden surface is relatively plain with visible grain, which complements the rustic appearance of the cans. This image could suggest a recycling theme, a study on consumer goods, or simply be capturing a method of storage and transport for empty cans.","title":"Basic building block of experimental housing being built of empty steel beer and soft drink cans near Taos, New Mexico.","placename":"Taos (N.M.)","location":"Taos, New Mexico","nn1":["547506","548755","556630","552529","556631","543616","548758","550805","555257","556614","551246","552512","556640","552937","550806","545822"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["can","brand","label","milk","consumer","coffee","row","beer","method","recycling"]}
