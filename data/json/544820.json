{"path":"544820.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features an old, dilapidated building which appears to be deserted and possibly abandoned. The primary construction material of the building is wood, and much of its exterior is covered with red corrugated metal siding. The building has two visible levels, with an asymmetric and slightly disheveled structure. Four windows are visibleâ€”some are missing their glass, and the frames look worn out and damaged. There is no visible door on the front face, but there is an entryway surrounded by rough, unpainted wooden panels.\n\nA striking feature of the building is the presence of writing in large white letters on the red siding. The letters spell out \"NT TROUT VISITORS,\" although the arrangement and fragmentation of the letters suggest that part of the writing is missing or obscured. Below this text is a white sign with additional writing that reads \"ISH C\" with some characters faded or missing, making the full message hard to decipher. \n\nNear the entryway, there are remnants of what could have been a staircase or support structure, which are now partially collapsed or missing. This area is surrounded by debris and small piles of rocks or rubble, contributing to the building's overall neglected appearance. \n\nThe setting around the building indicates a remote and rugged environment, with no other structures or people in sight, under a clear blue sky. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of historical decay and forgotten heritage.","title":"Abandoned building","placename":"Dumont (Colo.)","location":"Dumont, Colorado","nn1":["544824","554707","543339","543171","543344","545233","547038","551111","552681","552455","556330","557344","549159","544445","543350","557347"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["entryway","letter","writing","siding","building","heritage","sight","rubble","staircase","message"]}
