{"path":"557660.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and quaint motel complex nestled in a lush, hilly landscape. The scene is dominated by a collection of small, cottage-style buildings with red roofs, arranged to form an inviting community-like setup typical of mid-20th century American roadside accommodations.\n\nAt the center, there is a main building with a distinctive white and red facade, presumably serving as the reception or main office of the motel. Branching off from this main office are several identical units, all featuring red roofs, white walls, and small front porches, likely offering a cozy stay for travelers. The architectural style suggests a charming, rustic appeal aimed at providing a homely atmosphere.\n\nThe parking lot is filled with a variety of vintage cars, dating the photo around the mid-20th century based on the vehicle designs. These cars are vividly colored and add a lively contrast to the verdant greenery surrounding the area.\n\nSurrounding the motel is a dense exhibition of trees, illustrating the location's possibly mountainous or rural setting. The background hills are cloaked with dense forests, enhancing the sense of seclusion and retreat from urban environments.\n\nThis photograph not only documents a functional place of business but also captures a slice of historical travel culture, reflecting a time when such roadside motels were crucial oases for long-distance travelers.","title":"Village of helen, Georgia, near robertstown, is seen from unicoi hill, part of a state park.
