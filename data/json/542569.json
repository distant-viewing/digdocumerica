{"path":"542569.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image is a powerful capture of a dense forest primarily consisting of tall, majestic trees that rise high above the ground, likely redwoods or similar species due to their size and bark texture. The perspective of the photograph is from the forest floor looking upward, emphasizing the sheer height and grandeur of the trees as they stretch towards the sky.\n\nThe forest is shrouded in fog, creating a misty and ethereal atmosphere that softens the lines of the trees and diffuses the light. The fog adds a sense of depth and mystique, obscuring the canopy and parts of the trees higher up. The ground is covered with forest debris, including fallen branches and leaves, adding a rugged texture to the scene.\n\nThe lighting is dim and moody due to the fog and the canopy, with the background illuminated softly, possibly by diffused sunlight or a break in the cloud coverage above. The tree trunks are dark and rich in color, contrasting with the lighter fog and sky, adding to the visual drama of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition utilizes the natural vertical lines of the tree trunks, leading the viewer's eye upward and giving a feeling of being small and overwhelmed by natureâ€™s enormity and beauty. The photograph conveys a sense of solitude, tranquility, and the pristine essence of an old-growth forest.","title":"California--Sequoia National Park","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["542575","542930","543442","554966","554990","542745","555125","553576","554967","542725","553574","542845","554968","555051","554969","555128"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["fog","forest","canopy","trunk","enormity","mystique","tree","redwood","drama","coverage"]}
