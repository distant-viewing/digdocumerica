{"path":"544098.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph features a large industrial excavator at a construction or mining site. The excavator is in the foreground of the image, showing its massive metal bucket with large, worn teeth used for digging or scooping earth. The metal is predominantly rusty, adding a sense of age and heavy usage.\n\nOn the underside of the bucket, we can see a person working on it. The worker, wearing dark clothing possibly a uniform, is bending over and seems to be performing some sort of maintenance task or inspection, particularly focused near the teeth of the excavatorâ€™s bucket.\n\nThe background of the photo shows a bright blue sky, suggesting it's a sunny day. There's little else visible in the background aside from the clear weather and distant faint outlines, suggesting a wide, open area typical for such heavy-duty equipment usage.\n\nThe composition of the photo captures a moment of manual labor and industrial machinery, emphasizing the scale and the gritty nature of such work environments. The focus and lighting draw attention to the interaction between man and machine, illustrating a day in the life of a worker in an industrial or construction setting.","title":"Ten cubic yard shovel and front-end loader at work on the live oak pit mine at inspiration consolidated copper co","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["555607","547583","544099","555644","552418","555638","552419","553827","552417","554826","556893","555593","555606","547243","544379","543107"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["excavator","tooth","bucket","usage","worker","underside","scoop","construction","dig","inspection"]}
