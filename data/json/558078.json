{"path":"558078.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set in a lush, densely wooded area. The composition is slightly dark, hinting it might be either set in a shadowed part of the forest or taken during either early morning or late evening, when light is sparse. Prominent features of the background include a variety of green foliage and trees of various sizes and types, some of which let dapples of sunlight filter through their leaves.\n\nThe focus of the image is on two people involved in an activity near a large, dark round boulder or rock at the center of the frame. One person, wearing a yellow shirt, is seen bending down towards the rock as if examining or interacting with it. The other person, dressed in a red shirt, is partially obscured and appears to be either assisting the person in yellow or engaging in a similar task. From their posture and location, it seems they are exploring or studying the nature around them, possibly engaged in activities such as hiking, camping, or a scientific field study.\n\nThis outdoor setting and the activity of the individuals convey a sense of adventure and inquiry into the natural environment, typical of excursions into forested regions.","title":"Boys examine millstones near a trail in Deep Lock Quarry, a part of the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system. The sandstone quarry was a source of material for building the Ohio-Erie Canal more than a century ago. The park is within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which contains 30,000 acres in a 20-mile stretch of largely undeveloped land located between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["545516","545527","557005","553370","554513","544739","554665","545768","558083","554672","545493","543248","551942","553357","542732","553638"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["study","person","inquiry","excursion","let","dapple","rock","camping","hiking","boulder"]}
