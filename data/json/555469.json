{"path":"555469.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an individual standing amidst a large assortment of driftwood on a beach. The person is holding a piece of wood horizontally across their body. The person is dressed in a casual manner appropriate for outdoor activity with a blue long-sleeve shirt, white pants, and dark shoes, and is adorned with a knitted hat.\n\nThe driftwood varies in size and shape, covering the ground extensively. The pieces are strewn haphazardly, suggesting they have been washed ashore naturally. The beach is not visible beyond the driftwood, but there is a hint of the ocean and an open clear sky in the background. This provides a natural, rugged setting, underscoring the mass of logs and the solitary figure interacting with them.\n\nThe image blends elements of human activity—represented by the person—against a natural seaside backdrop dominated by the wooden debris, giving an overall impression of a dynamic yet serene coastal environment.","title":"Conservation of electricity resulted in more people collecting firewood along the beaches as did this person. Near Lincoln City, when this picture was taken in January, 1974, there was a wind-chill factor of minus 12 degrees.","placename":"Lincoln City (Or.)","location":"Lincoln City, Oregon","nn1":["555468","548051","548055","545108","543069","542888","545111","542889","543075","542886","543052","542973","542976","542887","544989","545060"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["driftwood","appropriate","person","beach","seaside","piece","mass","wash","assortment","manner"]}
