{"path":"543470.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals looking into a window of a store or restaurant. The setting seems to be in an urban outdoor environment, likely on a street or sidewalk.\n\nOn the left side of the photograph, there’s a red fire hydrant positioned close to a street corner. Behind it, a mature person and a younger boy, both viewed from behind, are focused on something inside the store window. The mature individual appears to be wearing a light-colored sweater, blue jeans, and has short hair, while the younger person is dressed in a gray long-sleeve shirt, dark blue jeans, and a red plaid bag slung across their shoulder. They are also wearing beige-colored shoes. The body langauge suggests curiosity or interest in the contents of the shop window.\n\nThe shop’s facade has brown stone or wood paneling at the base, and the window seems to display a variety of items, possibly food or goods related to the business. Next to the door of the shop, a poster featuring a man's picture and what might be classifiable as a magazine cover or advertisement can be seen. This setup provides a glimpse into daily life, possibly in a neighborhood context where residents engage with local businesses.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is informal and candid, capturing a moment of everyday interaction.","title":"California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["548242","556214","556226","557803","552859","549291","550132","542814","557763","551342","546672","551816","557767","549285","551829","553202"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["shop","store","window","business","hydrant","jean","magazine","paneling","restaurant","resident"]}
