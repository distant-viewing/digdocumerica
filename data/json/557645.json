{"path":"557645.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene featuring a row of aging, ornate buildings, possibly of Victorian architectural style, with detailed facades including bay windows and elaborate cornices. The buildings appear to be in a state of disrepair with visible signs of weathering and some boarded-up windows. There are commercial spaces on the ground floor of these buildings, though they appear old and somewhat deserted, possibly reflecting a neighborhood in decline or undergoing transition.\n\nOn the street, there are a few people: three individuals crossing the street together, engaged in conversation, possibly pedestrians going about their day. A lone individual walks along the sidewalk across the street. The street itself is mostly empty except for these pedestrians and a parked car partially visible on the left frame of the photograph.\n\nIn the background, there is a contrast between the old, detailed architecture of the foreground buildings and a taller, plain modern building, suggesting an urban setting where different architectural eras coexist. The overall tone of the photograph, likely due to the color processing, contributes to a somewhat somber or nostalgic atmosphere. The setting is overcast, with dull lighting that enhances the aged and weathered look of the scene.","title":"Downtown Galveston, Texas. This is one of a series of 21 black and white photographs. They document the environments remaining from the 19th century in terms of architecture, commerce and lifestyles. The pictures also compare the contemporary city, showing displacement of the unique by the ordinary and noting current urban problems. The pictures show a region and its uniqueness in people and architecture in East Texas, which is still a part of the South.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555902","550108","553550","545326","550138","555900","545351","557634","556225","557278","550118","553472","549267","550285","543360","553552"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","pedestrian","cornice","building","decline","undergo","coexist","go","aging","weathering"]}
