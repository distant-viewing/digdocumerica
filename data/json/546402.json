{"path":"546402.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures a coastal scene where the juxtaposition of industrial elements with natural beauty creates a striking contrast. In the foreground, there is a prominent warning sign painted in red and white, urgently notifying people of a nearby hazard with the texts \"DANGER FLAMMABLE Fuel Pipe Line NO SMOKING\" and \"PELIGRO L√çNEA DE COMBUSTIBLE INFLAMABLE NO FUMAR.\" The sign is mounted on a white pole and placed on a patch of grass and rocks.\n\nTo the left side of the image, a large metal pipeline coated in yellow and black and labeled \"HIGH PRESSURE GAS\" runs horizontally across the frame. The pipeline is supported by metal stilts and protective structures, snaking through the vegetation, hinting at an industrial facility's proximity.\n\nFurther back, there's an inviting beach scene with clear blue skies and a calm ocean visible. A sandy beach stretches along the background, dotted with a few distant people and anchored boats in the sea, enjoying the peaceful setting. Dominating the middle ground is a solitary palm tree, standing tall and providing a natural element that contrasts sharply with the industrial pipeline in the foreground.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph skillfully contrasts the industrial and natural elements, highlighting human impact on nature, and the ongoing balance between industrial development and natural preservation.","title":"Oil pipeline on the beach","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545997","549220","546393","546375","552432","554041","549000","545949","557484","546207","545167","543160","550280","544289","542984","551953"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["pipeline","beach","smoking","hazard","pressure","danger","stilt","preservation","warning","palm"]}
