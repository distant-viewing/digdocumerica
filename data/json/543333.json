{"path":"543333.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene where several young people are engaged in the playful activity of building sand structures. On the left side of the image, a young woman in a pink bikini is kneeling and sculpting the sand with her hands. Next to her, two individuals, a young woman in a blue shirt and a young man in a black tank top, are also focused on shaping a large mound of sand. To the right, a young man in black swim trunks is kneeling at the water's edge, perhaps working on a part of the structure that interacts with the incoming waves.\n\nThe backdrop features a sandy beach stretching into the distance, scattered with various other beachgoers and some umbrellas. Dominating the background is a cliff with sparse greenery, atop which a lighthouse or similar structure is visible. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a sunny day perfect for beach activities.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights a moment of creativity and teamwork, set against the scenic beauty of a bustling beach environment.","title":"California -- Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz County (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz County, California","nn1":["543216","550936","555892","543534","543225","550229","557507","555923","543322","547009","557511","547688","543047","553952","547507","552286"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","sand","creativity","beachgoer","lighthouse","swim","bikini","teamwork","umbrella","woman"]}
