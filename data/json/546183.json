{"path":"546183.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a somewhat rustic and vintage American setting. The foreground presents a parking lot with several older model cars, ranging from sedans to a station wagon, all appearing to be from the 1960s or 1970s. The cars are parked facing various directions, suggesting a casual atmosphere.\n\nAt the center and right of the image is a building with bold red walls and white text that reads \"SMOKEHOUSE\" prominently displayed on its side. This structure has a vintage look, with various elements on its roof such as an old-fashioned cylindrical smoker and what appears to be ventilation equipment. The establishment gives off the vibe of a traditional American smokehouse specializing in smoked meats.\n\nTo the left, thereâ€™s another building that features partial view of a faded painted sign with the word \"SAVE\" visible, hinting it might be a store offering economical options or discounts. This building is simple and utilitarian in style, painted white, which contrasts with the vibrant red of the smokehouse.\n\nThe background is lined with greenery and trees along with some partially visible structures, adding to the sense that this scene is set in a semi-rural or outskirts town area. The overall composition of the photograph captures a slice of Americana, particularly reflecting an era that feels nostalgic, filled with elements indicative of mid-20th-century rural life.","title":"Oil derrick beside restaurant and used car lot","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["556766","554482","549003","555422","550135","557382","548889","556368","552513","554709","549113","544882","545618","547855","551121","550053"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["meat","option","ventilation","outskirt","wagon","establishment","store","sedan","slice","car"]}
