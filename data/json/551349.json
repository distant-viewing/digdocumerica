{"path":"551349.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a serene natural scene centered around a woodland pond or small lake. The image captures a tranquil water body that's noticeably distinct for its clear, reflective surface, providing a mirror image of the lush green trees surrounding it. The colors are vibrant, highlighting the various shades of green foliage and the blue sky peeking through the treetops.\n\nAt the forefront of the image is a small waterfall, where the water spills down smoothly over a rocky edge, creating several thin, shimmering streams that catch the light as they fall into a lower pool or continuation of the stream. This water is bubbly and white where it breaks, contrasting with the calm, glass-like appearance of the main water body.\n\nThe trees are densely packed and reach upward out of the frame, suggesting a secluded or remote forest area. Few sky patches are visible, one at the center top of the photograph showing a soft blue sky. There is no visible human activity or constructed elements, giving a sense of untouched, natural beauty typical of a secluded woodland area. \n\nOverall, this composition encapsulates a moment of peaceful natural beauty, focusing on the interplay of water, light, and forest, with a perspective that partially submerges the viewer's viewpoint at the water level of the waterfall.","title":"An acre of perfect water in the Ha Ha Tonka area.
