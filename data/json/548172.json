{"path":"548172.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph provides a scenic aerial view of a rural area nestled within a valley surrounded by forest-covered hills. The landscape is dominated by various shades of green from both the fields and the forest areas, suggesting a lush environment.\n\nAt several points in the valley, plumes of white smoke are visible, merging with the area's mist, although the source of the smoke is not clearly visualized in the image. This might indicate some form of industrial or agricultural activity.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows closely packed residential areas with small houses and buildings that are scattered around the landscape, interspersed with open fields which are probably used for agriculture. The geometric patterns of the fields suggest systematic farming practices.\n\nTowards the middle and the right side of the image, the land appears to be more openly spaced with fewer buildings and more expansive fields, giving a contrasting sense of openness compared to the denser residential area at the front.\n\nThe background is framed by hills with dense forest cover, which adds a natural border to the scenic landscape. The lighting in the photograph is soft, likely caused by a mix of sunlight and cloud cover, casting gentle shadows and giving the entire scene a serene quality. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is peaceful, underscored by the natural beauty and rural charm of the valley.","title":"Columbia river gorge between The Dalles and the hood river","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["548199","556968","552593","551049","549116","556341","557557","557379","550528","557531","545042","556967","553978","551050","556971","556997"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["valley","forest","field","cover","smoke","fields","hills","denser","openness","farming"]}
