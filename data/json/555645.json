{"path":"555645.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene, featuring an expansive view of a landscape that combines natural and manmade elements. At the top of the image, there's a prominent hill composed of large mounds of earth or possibly mining debris, which suggests the presence of industrial activity, possibly a quarry or waste from industrial processes. Below the hill, a lush green canopy of trees surrounds the scene.\n\nThe middle and lower portions of the image shift to a more peaceful rural setting. There's an open grassy area where several cows are seen grazing or resting. The cows are scattered throughout the meadow, adding a tranquil and bucolic feel to the scene. It appears to be a sunny day, as the lighting is bright and there are no visible shadows that indicate overcast weather.\n\nIn the background, just under the tree line and partially obscured by shadow, there seems to be a body of still water, possibly a small lake or pond. The water body adds a serene element to the overall composition. This setting could be part of a farm or rural area located near industrial operations, providing a stark contrast between the natural and the industrial/manmade environments. The photograph is taken from a vantage point that overlooks this scene, giving a comprehensive overview of the different elements featured.","title":"Cows grazing on pastureland near Chandlersville, Ohio.
