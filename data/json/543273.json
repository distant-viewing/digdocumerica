{"path":"543273.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and busy scene of many terns in flight against a clear blue sky. The birds are captured in various stages of flight, with some having their wings fully spread while others are in different phases of flapping them. The sunlight illuminates the plumage of the terns, rendering them almost translucent and highlighting their graceful forms. The birds are spread across the frame in a seemingly chaotic yet natural pattern, covering the sky and adding a sense of movement and life to the image. The focus and depth of field vary throughout, with some birds appearing sharp and detailed while others are slightly blurred, possibly due to their rapid movement or the focus settings of the camera. The composition of the image and the contrast of the white birds against the deep blue sky create a vibrant and striking visual effect.","title":"California--zmudowski state park","placename":"Zmudowski Beach State Park (Calif.)","location":"Zmudowski Beach State Park, California","nn1":["552238","557125","549772","553347","544605","544609","553875","557208","552146","550903","550889","544500","546759","555554","557209","557123"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","flight","spread","plumage","phase","render","movement","other","wing","strike"]}
