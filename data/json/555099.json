{"path":"555099.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a pine tree branch focusing on several pine buds at its tip. The primary subjects, the pine buds, appear plump and are tinted with hues of pink and red, having a waxy semblance. These buds are surrounded by clusters of sharp, dark green pine needles, which extend outward from the branch, providing a vibrant contrast to the softer colored buds.\n\nThe background consists of a softly blurred natural setting, likely depicting a forest or a densely vegetated area. The bokeh effect in the background enhances focus on the branch and pine buds by isolating them from the surrounding environment. The overall light appears diffused, suggesting an overcast sky or a shaded area, which allows for the rich colors of the pine and its budding flowers to stand out with clarity and depth.\n\nThe composition is straightforward yet effective in highlighting the intricate details and natural beauty of the pine buds, emphasizing texture and color contrasts within a serene natural context.","title":"Closeup of new spring growth on a Douglas fir tree in olympic national timberland, Washington.
