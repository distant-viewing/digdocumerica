{"path":"543196.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic coastal landscape blanketed in vibrant flora. In the foreground, a sloping hillside is densely covered with thick, fleshy, green succulent plants. Interspersed among these succulents are numerous bright pink flowers, adding splashes of color to the greenery. A few clusters of yellow flowers are also visible, enhancing the variety of hues in the vegetation.\n\nTowards the lower edge of the image and further down the hillside, the succulent plants appear to give way to ordinary grass or shrubbery, marking a transition in the botanical landscape. This foreground is rich in texture due to the dense and lush plants, offering a sense of vibrancy and life.\n\nIn the middle ground of the image, the terrain descends further to reveal a tranquil coastal scene. A calm river or inlet meanders gently, surrounded by rugged, rocky shores. The water reflects a slightly diffused sky, which suggests an overcast or cloudy day.\n\nIn the background, the coastline extends into the distance, bordered by a thicker accumulation of trees and undergrowth that climbs up steeply rising cliffs. These cliffs serve as a natural boundary, closing off the scene and adding a dramatic natural framework to the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph is a harmonious blend of florid foreground and serene, rugged coastline, encapsulating the quiet beauty of a coastal ecosystem. The balance between the vivid plant life in the foreground and the more subdued tones of the water and cliffs creates a peaceful yet engaging scene.","title":"California--Point Lobos Reserve","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543401","543202","543188","543404","543399","547592","554082","542917","542968","554081","543066","553805","543419","543389","543297","543199"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["cliff","plant","hillside","coastline","flower","inlet","undergrowth","shrubbery","accumulation","balance"]}
