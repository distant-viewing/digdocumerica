{"path":"551704.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"In this photograph, we see an urban street scene capturing a variety of elements and activities. On the left side of the image, an elderly man with balding hair, wearing glasses and a red and black checked shirt, is watering plants with a hose. He is bent over slightly, focused on his task.\n\nThe setting appears to be a small, enclosed garden area surrounded by a low, black metal fence and lush with green shrubbery and some scattered yellow flowers. The garden provides a small patch of nature amidst the urban environment.\n\nIn the background, to the right, there is a tall vertical sign reading \"PARK HERE\" in red and white, indicating the presence of a parking lot. The sign also lists the parking rates and suggests it has a cashier lift. This part of the street also includes other pedestrians further away; a few individuals observed from behind appear to be walking or standing, engaged in various activities. \n\nThe photograph gives a view along the sidewalk extending beyond the garden, lined with the side of buildings that have a somewhat dated architectural style. There is a slight sense of activity and movement suggested by the distant pedestrians, contrasting with the calm, focused activity of the man watering the plants in the foreground.","title":"Al conly waters garden plot in front of his house on east 30th street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551490","551491","551739","550059","551705","551745","551625","551744","551489","551780","551630","551743","550760","544295","551623","549298"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["pedestrian","garden","parking","rate","list","hose","street","shrubbery","lift","plant"]}
