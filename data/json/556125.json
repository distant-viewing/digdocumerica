{"path":"556125.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a sunny, clear day in an urban railway station setting. The main focus is on multileveled railway tracks foregrounded by a broad platform covered with roofs. These roofs have metal framework structures that are somewhat intricate, casting shade on the platform below which appears devoid of people.\n\nIn the background, thereâ€™s a prominent tall brick building with a clock tower, offering a historical architectural feel and seeming like a significant landmark. The tower features a pyramidal spire. Surrounding the clock tower, other smaller buildings are visible but less distinct, likely parts of the same station infrastructure or related urban buildings.\n\nThe sky is bright blue showing a clear day, which helps in highlighting the details of the station and the architectural styles. The photograph provides a sense of emptiness and calm, possibly indicating a moment captured when the station is not busy. The tracks themselves are empty as well, adding to the quiet atmosphere depicted in the image. The surrounding environment includes a few sparse trees and some greenery, mixed with urban constructions, intertwining city life with a touch of natural elements.","title":"King Street passenger train station in Seattle, Washington has been designated an historical landmark.
