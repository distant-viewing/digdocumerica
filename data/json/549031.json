{"path":"549031.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, somewhat rustic scene near a body of water, possibly a river or creek lined with abundant foliage. The focus of the image is a makeshift structure constructed primarily from wood and metal sheets, positioned very close to the water's edge. The structure appears somewhat worn and weathered, indicating it may have been exposed to the elements for an extended period.\n\nOn the side of the main structure, there is prominent graffiti or painted text that reads \"VIVA LEA MEXICO\" in large, slightly irregular, white letters against a dark background, suggesting a display of cultural or national pride. The exact phrasing might be intended as \"VIVA LA MEXICO,\" a common expression of enthusiasm or support for Mexico.\n\nThe area surrounding the structure is overgrown with bushes and small trees, suggesting a somewhat neglected or natural state. A person can be seen just behind the structure in a white shirt, partially obscured by the foliage, which adds a human element to the scene, hinting at habitation or use of the structure.\n\nThe water reflects the sky and the surrounding greenery, adding a peaceful quality to the image. The image itself, taken during daylight, is well-lit, with natural colors enhanced by the sunlight. The composition and elements in the photo together evoke a quiet, somewhat isolated atmosphere, possibly indicating a rural or less-developed area.","title":"Colorado River at the Mexican border","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["545008","552108","551533","548030","544567","544253","548248","544698","545137","545005","549457","550357","547965","546126","550947","546067"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["structure","enthusiasm","creek","pride","graffiti","sheet","foliage","habitation","support","letter"]}
