{"path":"544533.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a serene aquatic scene presumed to be Pahokee Harbor as indicated by a prominent advertisement sign. The image features five individuals in a small metal boat on a vast body of water. The people, who appear to be engaged in leisurely activities, include four paddling and one actively pointing towards an unknown object or direction.\n\nIn the background, there is a dark, horizontal structure that spans across the frame, perhaps a pier or a low bridge, establishing a distinct separation between the water below and the sky above. Above this structure, towards the right of the image, there is a large sign with a red Coca-Cola logo at the bottom, reading \"PAHOKEE HARBOR\" and advertising amenities such as snacks, bait, gas, and diesel. The background above this sign shows a calm, open sky with very light cloud cover, suggesting a bright sunny day.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the image is relaxed and recreational, capturing a moment of outdoor leisure in a waterfront setting. The composition balances the expansive water with the human element centrally placed, while the industrial-like structure at the back adds a contrasting note to the natural scenery.","title":"Pahokee harbor","placename":"Pahokee (Fla.)","location":"Pahokee, Florida","nn1":["551350","546976","544260","546856","551236","552982","544980","552283","544532","554169","543934","549417","552316","549939","552317","544770"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["clould","paddling","bait","separation","snack","amenity","sign","not","establish","advertise"]}
