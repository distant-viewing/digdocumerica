{"path":"553062.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a vast, urban layout near a sizable body of water, seemingly a river or a large lake. The residential area is characterized by a strict grid pattern of streets running roughly perpendicular to each other, typical of planned urban developments. Small, box-like houses line the streets and are interspersed with abundant greenery, suggesting each plot may have garden space. The streets are fairly uniform and structured, indicative of a suburban setting.\n\nIn the distance, adjacent to the waterfront, the photograph shows denser, possibly commercial developments or public venues, and an industrial area with larger buildings and open spaces that might be used for storage or operations related to the waterfront. There are also some docks clearly visible, suggesting this area might have a functioning port or marina.\n\nFurther into the background, the opposite shore of the water body is visible, much less densely built and covered with dense vegetation, contrasting sharply with the structured urban development in the foreground. The overall view showcases a blend of natural beauty and human organization, with the broad expanse of water providing a serene backdrop to the bustling residential and commercial hubs.","title":"Lake Lyndon Johnson.
