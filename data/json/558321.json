{"path":"558321.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"McTaggart, James","caption":"The photograph shows an elderly gentleman seated outdoors while engaging in the activity of smoking a pipe. He appears relaxed and is dressed in clothing suitable for cooler weather. He wears a dark tweed blazer with a visible shirt and tie underneath, and he is accessorized with a classic brimmed felt hat.\n\nHis expression is mild and slightly introspective, with a soft smile, as he looks directly at the camera. His weathered hands, one holding the pipe and the other adjusting a lighter, suggest a life of rich experiences.\n\nIn the background, there is a glimpse of a building with a brick wall and windows, some reflecting sunlight. The window frames are white, and one of the windows shows a transparent curtain partly visible through the windowpane.\n\nThis setting and his attire provide a timeless, perhaps nostalgic appeal, evoking a sense of calmness and quietude typical of a leisurely day.","title":"Older citizens, retired persons and those unable to take care of themselves physically are cared for in two community centers. This man lives at the Alexander home adjacent to Loretto Hospital, both Catholic supported facilities. New Ulm is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["548251","556478","555529","547313","554858","557708","547329","552648","548458","543030","554678","556457","552523","555532","544232","551397"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["pipe","gentleman","window","quietude","blazer","appeal","calmness","curtain","smile","experience"]}
