{"path":"558321.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"McTaggart, James","caption":"The photograph shows an elderly gentleman seated outdoors while engaging in the activity of smoking a pipe. He appears relaxed and is dressed in clothing suitable for cooler weather. He wears a dark tweed blazer with a visible shirt and tie underneath, and he is accessorized with a classic brimmed felt hat.\n\nHis expression is mild and slightly introspective, with a soft smile, as he looks directly at the camera. His weathered hands, one holding the pipe and the other adjusting a lighter, suggest a life of rich experiences.\n\nIn the background, there is a glimpse of a building with a brick wall and windows, some reflecting sunlight. The window frames are white, and one of the windows shows a transparent curtain partly visible through the windowpane.\n\nThis setting and his attire provide a timeless, perhaps nostalgic appeal, evoking a sense of calmness and quietude typical of a leisurely day.","title":"Older citizens, retired persons and those unable to take care of themselves physically are cared for in two community centers.
