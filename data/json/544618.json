{"path":"544618.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph depicts two butterflies perched on a white, yellow-centered flower. The butterflies exhibit a patterned wing surface, with intricate, splotchy markings ranging from dark to lighter browns. They are positioned in such a way that the one in the foreground has its wings more closed, while the butterfly in the background has its wings spread wider. Both butterflies are facing towards the right side of the frame.\n\nThe flower on which these butterflies are perched is wild in appearance, with multiple petals radiating around a protruding, yellow center. There are additional buds and greenery visible around the main flower, suggesting a lush natural environment.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but primarily features a cool, monochrome color palette that subtly transitions from lighter to darker shades, giving a calm and undistracted focus on the butterflies and the flower. The overall composition beautifully captures the delicateness and vibrant detail of these insects within their natural setting.","title":"Butterflies and wildflowers in Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544619","544614","544479","543603","544553","547818","544514","551381","544517","544603","544566","554839","554842","548283","548284","548281"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","wing","flower","insect","bud","dark","petal","marking","transition","way"]}
