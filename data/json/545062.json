{"path":"545062.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a streetscape scenario in a semi-urban setting, capturing a variety of elements that contribute to a bustling community atmosphere. The image is taken from the perspective of a street looking towards a hilly area covered in smoke, suggesting either ongoing industrial activity or a controlled burn in the background.\n\nThe road itself is occupied by several vehicles, ranging from 1970s sedan models to trucks, indicating a timeline likely around the mid to late 20th century. Each vehicle is distinctly from an era recognizable by their body styles, reinforcing the time period the photo captures.\n\nOn the left side of the road, commercial establishments are visible. Most prominently, there is a building with signage advertising a brewery, and another sign that appears to be for a Volkswagen (VW) used car dealership. These signs suggest the commercial nature of the area.\n\nUtility poles running alongside the road carry multiple lines and have street lamps attached, typical of urban or suburban streets. The overall environment suggests a functional, possibly working-class neighborhood, with residential houses visible on the hilly terrain in the background, shrouded partially by smoke.\n\nThe picture appears shot on a sunny day, as evidenced by the bright lighting and clear skies with no apparent overcast, which contrasts with the smoky backdrop, adding a layer of visual depth to the composition. This photograph provides a snapshot of daily life, commerce, and environmental conditions in a specific historic and geographical context.","title":"Oregon--Astoria","placename":"Astoria (Or.)","location":"Astoria, Oregon","nn1":["545463","557224","547651","551070","551071","542586","545614","550171","545455","550970","546074","548326","547369","550203","550175","555584"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["street","dealership","streetscape","burn","road","smoke","class","advertising","commerce","establishment"]}
