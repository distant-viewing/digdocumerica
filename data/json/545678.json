{"path":"545678.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a collection of red jasper stone fragments, likely tools or shards, laid out on a sandy surface. The pieces vary in size and shape, with some appearing jagged and sharply angular, while others are more irregular and rough. The largest shard, located slightly to the left, has a prominent pointed tip and a fractured base, resembling a possible tool or weapon tip. The color of these stone fragments ranges from deep red to slightly brownish-red, some with visible striations or variations in hue.\n\nThe background is a uniform sandy texture, providing a neutral contrast that highlights the stone shards. The texture of the sand appears fine-grained, suggesting a soft, possibly dusty environment. There is no other object or feature visible in the image, focusing all attention on the stone fragments and their arrangement. The lighting in the photograph appears natural, possibly sunlight, enhancing the vivid red color and casting small shadows from the stones onto the sandy surface, thereby adding depth to the arrangement. The overall composition of the photograph is simple yet evocative, possibly suggesting archaeological significance or natural history.","title":"Arrowhead chips and scrapers found under an overhang in water canyon","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["542974","552546","545558","543617","550474","544907","544815","557117","550475","555170","552543","553582","551233","555200","550606","543421"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["stone","fragment","tip","arrangement","tool","brownish","jagged","red","laid","striation"]}
