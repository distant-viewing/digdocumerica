{"path":"555029.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a natural landscape from an aerial perspective. It captures a rocky surface, mostly covered in shades of dark brown and rust, interspersed with areas of vibrant green vegetation. The greenery consists of clusters of small, dense plants, potentially succulents or low bushes, giving the scene a somewhat patchwork appearance.\n\nAdditionally, there are distinct patches of white and gray vegetation scattered across the terrain, which might be a type of lichen or a similar form of ground-covering flora. These white patches stand out sharply against the darker background, adding a striking contrast to the image.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests that it was taken during daylight with adequate natural light, which highlights the textures and colors of the landscape. The composition is predominantly organic, with no straight lines or human-made structures visible, emphasizing the natural and unaltered state of the environment. The overall appearance is rugged and somewhat desolate, hinting at a harsh climate or conditions unfavorable to lush vegetation.","title":"Moss and lichens on stream edge rocks in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545724","550395","543549","555553","552690","555592","550477","550517","555642","555885","542511","550397","552426","555573","543635","543521"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["lichen","patchwork","vegetation","appearance","flora","patch","rust","climate","daylight","cover"]}
