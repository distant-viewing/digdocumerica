{"path":"557488.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque outdoor scene. Three people are seated at a round concrete picnic table, enjoying a meal together in a lush, green park setting. The two individuals facing the camera are women, one with short hair and the other with medium-length hair, both appearing to be engaged in conversation with a man whose back is to the camera. The table is set with what looks like wine glasses and plates, suggesting a relaxed, leisurely lunch.\n\nThe setting of this scenario is tranquil and scenic. The picnic area overlooks a wide expanse of water, bordered by dense reeds and aquatic plants in vibrant greens and browns, indicating a wetland or riverside location. In the background, the water body extends towards a built-up area featuring modern, mid-rise buildings, blending urban elements with the natural environment. The foreground is framed by overhanging branches and leaves from a nearby tree, creating a natural vignette around the diners.\n\nThis idyllic scene is bathed in bright, natural light, likely indicative of a sunny day, enhancing the calm and peaceful atmosphere of the setting. The composition and framing of the image, with the natural elements encircling the human activity, evoke a sense of harmony between people and nature.","title":"A family enjoys a picnic beside the Buena Vista Lagoon. The body of water is an excellent bird refuge, but is becoming surrounded by freeways and developments, and suffers from erosion and septic tank seePage. It is one of the last lagoons in Southern California. Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900. By the early 1970s that amount had decreased to about 125,000 acres.","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["552032","557955","546134","551682","556298","557935","545228","558188","548568","543631","552036","545738","552034","546224","547756","553065"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["picnic","table","vignette","diner","lunch","round","harmony","hair","meal","reed"]}
