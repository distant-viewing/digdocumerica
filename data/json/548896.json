{"path":"548896.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image depicts an aerial view of a canal running straight through a vast landscape. The canal is bordered on both sides by parallel roads or pathways stretching into the distance. The body of water appears dark and contrasts sharply against the lighter-colored land surrounding it.\n\nThe landscape on one side of the canal is mostly barren and sandy, indicative of a desert-like environment with sparse vegetation and undulating sand formations. On the opposite side, the terrain shifts to an agricultural setting characterized by rectangular plots that are likely farmlands, divided into sections, showing varying shades of earth tones.\n\nNear the foreground of the photograph, a bridge spans the canal, connecting the roads from both sides. The bridge appears to be a simple structure, potentially for vehicles or pedestrian crossing.\n\nOverall, the image captures a sense of isolation and the contrast between natural and human-modified landscapes, emphasizing infrastructure like the canal and bridge that allow for transportation and agriculture in an otherwise arid and challenging environment.","title":"All-american canal feeding thirsty imperial valley with water from the Colorado river.
