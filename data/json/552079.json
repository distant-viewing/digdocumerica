{"path":"552079.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a rural setting, featuring a dusty dirt road that curves gently to the right. In the foreground on the side of the road, there is a pile of debris that includes various discarded items such as branches, leaves, and pieces of trash among other unidentifiable materials. A cloud of dust is seen in the middle distance where an old-fashioned truck or tractor, with a visible framework that could be either for carrying goods or for agricultural purposes, is moving away from the viewer and raising the dust.\n\nThe truck is just turning around the bend in the road, suggesting it might have just passed by the pile of debris. The surrounding environment is lush with greenery, indicative of a woodland or forested area with dense shrubbery and trees lining the road. The light suggesting that it is a sunny day. The scene conveys a sense of rural life, possibly illustrating issues of waste management or rural decline, and evoking a dusty, somewhat neglected atmosphere.","title":"Anonymous driver dumps a pick-up load of trash on a farm road near Bonner Springs.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["556429","556615","543173","553662","554832","544292","556313","554130","544174","547979","543664","552673","549944","558084","554802","543896"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["dust","road","pile","truck","bend","decline","tractor","debris","woodland","shrubbery"]}
