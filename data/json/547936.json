{"path":"547936.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph displays a detailed view of multiple overlapping electricity pylons against a sky background. The pylons, constructed from metal, have a complex lattice structure and are designed to support numerous high-voltage power lines. These lines extend in various directions, creating a web-like pattern across the image.\n\nThe pylons are tall, featuring angular and geometric shapes, and are equipped with several layers of crossbars and insulators. The insulators are visible as they hang from the crossbars and are designed to prevent electrical current from flowing down the pylons into the ground.\n\nThe background is a bright sky with a purple hue, possibly indicating the picture was taken at twilight, adding a soft contrast to the dark, intricate silhouettes of the pylons.\n\nThis composition emphasizes an industrial theme focused on energy transmission and infrastructure, showcasing the engineering and design involved in distributing electrical power over distances. The perspective appears to be looking upwards from the ground towards the sky, giving a sense of scale and complexity of the infrastructure.","title":"Transmission lines of electrical power station built on Staten Island marshland.
