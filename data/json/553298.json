{"path":"553298.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling nighttime scene, likely at an urban street festival or outdoor event. The image is vibrant with the glow of multiple light sources. A large crowd of people gathers in what seems to be a closed-off street or public square, illuminated by ambient and artificial lighting, creating a lively atmosphere.\n\nAt the forefront, numerous individuals are seen standing and looking towards a point of interest not visible in the shot, suggesting a possible performance or attraction out of frame. The crowd is diverse, with people of various ages and dress styles, which depicts a casual, yet energetic setting.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there appears to be a blue-lit venue or structure—perhaps a stage or installation with bright spotlights, adding a dramatic effect to that area of the scene. A curious blend of smoke or mist further accentuates the lights, contributing a hazy, ethereal quality to the atmosphere.\n\nBuildings with classic architectural features—large windows and distinct facades—frame the background, indicating the event is taking place in a city center or downtown area. Some buildings have lights on, evidence of either late working hours or residential occupation. The overall glow from various light sources along with what appears to be street and festival lighting adds to the festive mood of the scene.\n\nThe right side of the image shows another portion of the crowd, thicker and peppered with more shadowy figures, suggesting this part is slightly further from the main source of illumination. In this part of the event, people seem to be moving more fluidly, perhaps walking or mingling.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a vibrant urban night scene filled with activity and illuminated by a combination of artificial lighting and architectural features, suggestive of a community celebration or a significant public event.","title":"D'aug Days (pronounced dog) is a month long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, Fountain Square. \"Sky Blades,\" a sculpture by Oliver Andrews a light show, and dancing--all on the square this Saturday night.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553260","553259","553257","553331","553287","551674","550076","553304","553296","551673","551789","553193","555446","553311","553822","551798"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["source","crowd","event","festival","glow","street","spotlight","occupation","evidence","attraction"]}
