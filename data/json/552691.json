{"path":"552691.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a striking and somewhat eerie display set in a natural environment. The main subject of the image is a large, bleach-white elk skull, adorned with a substantial set of antlers, mounted on a weathered wooden post. The skull looks directly at the camera, creating a focal point against the vivid blue sky dotted with a few fluffy clouds.\n\nThe post to which the skull is attached appears old and worn, part of a fence line that includes barbed wire stretching across the frame. This setting suggests a rural or wilderness area, possibly a boundary along a property or a trail entry.\n\nThe backdrop of the image is primarily a dirt road curving through a natural landscape. This road stretches off into the distance, bordered on both sides by low vegetation and brush under a bright, clear sky. The scenery indicates a somewhat arid region, perhaps a prairie or a high desert environment. The composition's depth is enhanced by the leading lines of the road, drawing the viewer's eye through the landscape. The overall mood is serene yet dramatic, underscored by the stark contrast between the skull and the natural surroundings.","title":"Ranch land in the Piceance Basin","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["550495","545820","550494","552998","552699","547522","542964","550485","545107","544019","543786","543104","545823","556943","543718","545898"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["post","prairie","bleach","antler","road","entry","brush","stretch","property","trail"]}
