{"path":"544642.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a complex highway interchange. The image is composed of multiple layers of roads, featuring both elevated and ground-level roadways. Several vehicles are visible, navigating through the interchange; they are relatively sparse, indicating either a non-peak hour or a location with moderate traffic density.\n\nThe interchange includes a variety of curved and straight exit and entrance ramps connecting different sections of the highway. The roads are well-marked with visible lane lines and traffic guidance signs, suggesting a well-maintained transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe immediate surrounding area of the highways is mostly grassy, with patches of land that appear somewhat dry or barren, likely indicative of recent land alterations or developments. The landscape is relatively flat, and there are no tall buildings or natural formations in the immediate vicinity, which might suggest a suburban or outskirts setting rather than a densely populated urban area.\n\nThe color palette of the image shows shades of grays of the concrete and asphalt, contrasting with the green of the grass. The vehicles are tiny in comparison to the massive scale of the infrastructure, emphasizing the grandeur and complexity of the highway system. Overall, the image conveys a sense of orderly movement within a sprawling transportation network.","title":"Freeway interchange north of Miami","placename":"Miami (Fla.)","location":"Miami, Florida","nn1":["547762","548332","553015","550282","546709","547770","552719","548333","553475","547780","546714","544634","558055","546686","546713","551205"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["interchange","highway","guidance","transportation","traffic","ramp","comparison","infrastructure","suburban","alteration"]}
