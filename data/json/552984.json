{"path":"552984.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph shows a large circular water treatment or settling basin with a highly reflective water surface, capturing a crisp reflection of white clouds and a blue sky. The basin is bordered by a concrete structure with a curved railing, and the basin itself appears to be contained by concrete walls. Around the basin, several lampposts and technical infrastructure suggest the setting is a utility or industrial facility.\n\nIn the background, a lush, dark green forest is visible, contrasting sharply with the bright sky. Beyond the trees, mountain peaks covered with snow can be seen, adding a dramatic and natural backdrop to the industrial foreground.\n\nThe image captures a tranquil yet technically structured scene, juxtaposing human-engineered elements with natural beauty. The reflection of the sky in the water emphasizes calmness and adds depth to the composition.","title":"Waste treatment plant.
