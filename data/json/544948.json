{"path":"544948.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an ancient adobe brick structure, likely located in a southwestern or possibly central American archaeological site such as Mesa Verde or a similar location. The photograph is framed through an open archway, made from unevenly shaped and sized adobe bricks. The archway is missing some bricks, suggesting age and weathering.\n\nLooking through the archway, the viewer can see a distant landscape that includes similar adobe constructions built into the side of a cliff, which is a characteristic feature of cliff dwellings made by ancient Indigenous peoples. Beyond the immediate structures, there is a panoramic view of a wide canyon with dense green vegetation, primarily trees, filling the lower areas, while the upper regions are characterized by barren, rocky cliff faces and plateaus. The sky is clear with few clouds, suggesting a bright, sunny day.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes both the historical and rugged nature of the landscape and the ancient engineering feats accomplished by the builders of these structures. The blend of natural beauty and historical architecture provides a sense of quiet and timelessness.","title":"Cliff Palace, ancient Indian village built between 1100 and 1300 A.D.","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545825","544922","544953","544919","544951","544927","544952","544949","545554","545817","545563","545555","555286","544941","545578","544939"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["archway","cliff","brick","plateaus","dwelling","timelessness","miss","canyon","weathering","engineering"]}
