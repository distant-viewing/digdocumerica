{"path":"548295.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph features a quaint, rural setting with a charming house as the focal point. The house is a small, one-story structure with a reddish-brown metal roof and a covered front porch. The porch is supported by square wooden columns and flanked by white railings, which create a welcoming entryway. Two windows are visible, one on each side of the front door. The house is surrounded by a lush, well-maintained lawn dotted with a few small, colorful flowerbeds visible near the porch.\n\nA prominent feature in the image is the mature tree on the right, which provides ample shade to part of the yard. Behind the house, there are additional trees that suggest a border separating the property from adjacent areas.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows a weathered wire and post fence, possibly indicating the boundary of the property. Part of this fencing includes an interesting detail: a concrete or stone pillar capped with a rounded top, adding a sense of permanence and defining the entrance to the property.\n\nThe overall setting is peaceful and idyllic, typical of a rural environment. There appears to be no immediate neighbors, which suggests a sense of privacy and seclusion. The sky is clear with a few clouds, indicating a sunny day. The environment conveys a tranquil rural lifestyle, possibly in a farming or agricultural community.","title":"Old cottage, acadian style, on river road between New Orleans and Baton Rouge","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["557746","556959","550704","554697","557669","551091","558110","557094","558153","546997","557326","546992","554084","550124","555635","547658"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["property","porch","house","neighbor","flowerbed","entryway","privacy","fencing","lifestyle","seclusion"]}
