{"path":"546972.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving outdoor activities by the water. In the foreground, two individuals are engaging in fishing activities from a sandy shore. The person on the left, dressed in an open button-up shirt and shorts, appears to be steadying a fishing rod, while the other individual, who is shirtless and wearing denim pants, is handling a net or a similar piece of equipment in the water, possibly catching or releasing fish.\n\nIn the background, a large white boat is cruising along the water, moving away from the shore and creating a noticeable wake. The boat is equipped with a spacious upper deck and several antennas or rods extending from its top, suggesting that it may be outfitted for leisure cruises or fishing trips.\n\nThe overall setting is a sunny day with clear skies, with grassy areas and reeds visible along the waterâ€™s edge. The scene evokes a leisurely day spent by the water involving both boating and fishing activities.","title":"Fishing and cruising on the Intracoastal Waterway","placename":"Savannah (Ga.)","location":"Savannah, Georgia","nn1":["545178","552317","552282","554198","546053","549935","546001","546330","548735","546352","546079","548499","552116","545093","552324","548738"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","rod","cruise","shore","water","antenna","boat","trip","reed","wake"]}
