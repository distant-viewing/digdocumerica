{"path":"556064.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor railroad station scene with a focus on an elderly train conductor standing close to the foreground. The conductor, wearing a dark uniform with a badge hat marked \"CONDUCTOR,\" a red tie, and a striped shirt, appears preoccupied or possibly checking a small object in his hand, possibly a watch. The crisp focus on the conductor contrasts with the slightly blurred background, emphasizing his presence and activity.\n\nBehind the conductor, prominently featured is a parked Amtrak train, painted predominantly white with red and blue stripes, matching elements of the conductor's uniform. The train's design suggests a modern or recently maintained vehicle, possibly indicative of a well-funded urban transit system. One open door of the train is visible.\n\nThe setting includes a partly cloudy sky and elements typical of a train station, like concrete platforms and metal structures overhead, possibly for signals or electrical lines. The scene captures a moment of daily operation in public transportation, highlighting the routine yet critical role of the conductor in managing and overseeing the safety and schedule of train services.","title":"Conductor checks his watch to find out how much time remains at the Bloomington, Illinois, stop on the Turboliner run between St. Louis, Missouri, and Chicago. The French built train is capable of speeds up to 125 miles per hour, but normally runs no faster than 79. Many of the Amtrak passenger trains run slower than their capabilities because the nation's railroads need to upgrade track and roadbed.","placename":"Bloomington (Ill.)","location":"Bloomington, Illinois","nn1":["556087","556846","556063","556110","556116","556108","555965","556126","555984","556113","556844","555986","556857","556083","556109","556059"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["conductor","train","uniform","station","schedule","oversee","badge","routine","railroad","signal"]}
