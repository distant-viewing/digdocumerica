{"path":"546084.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a large industrial complex in the background, viewed from across a desolate and barren foreground. The foreground is a wide swath of rough, muddy terrain littered with debris such as wooden planks and scattered refuse. The ground appears uneven and is marked by puddles and tire tracks, suggesting recent activity or disturbances.\n\nThe industrial complex in the background features multiple large buildings with various structures such as silos, large pipes, and chimneys. Some chimneys are actively emitting plumes of smoke, contributing to a somewhat bleak industrial atmosphere. The architecture is utilitarian, with buildings made primarily of concrete and metal, painted in muted colors that blend with their environment.\n\nThe overall scene gives an impression of industrial decay or a neglected suburban area on the outskirts of a manufacturing zone. The air looks hazy, possibly due to pollution, and the absence of vibrant nature or human presence adds a sense of isolation and desolation to the scene. This setting could be indicative of environmental issues linked to industrial activities.","title":"Kaiser aluminum plant behind landfill area used for dumping industrial waste","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["546080","550343","545993","549965","546122","552021","557225","545447","550278","546108","551555","550724","548316","550868","545992","545989"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","complex","swath","refuse","puddle","outskirt","disturbance","silo","desolation","concrete"]}
