{"path":"542883.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft, muted lighting. The main focal point is the word \"love\" written in large, flowing letters in the wet sand of the beach, suggesting a personal or romantic gesture by someone. The texture of the sand around the writing shows patterns of smaller waves and ripples, indicating the recent retreat of tide.\n\nIn the distance, the gentle surf can be seen, with small waves lapping onto the shore under a hazy sky. The horizon is slightly obscured, likely due to mist or fog, which adds a dreamy, quiet atmosphere to the scene. There are several rock formations that emerge from the sea in the background, adding to the natural, rugged beauty of the coastal landscape.\n\nThe upper part of the image shows a slightly grainy sky, suggesting either the natural grain of the film used to take the photograph or age-related degradation of the image. The overall composition, with the written message in the foreground and the tranquil sea in the background, evokes themes of love, nature, and introspection.","title":"California--Moonstone Beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["547600","548088","557509","547607","543091","543493","543078","547612","547492","548757","543244","542890","547483","546982","548221","543287"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["love","write","sand","beach","wave","surf","writing","introspection","retreat","tide"]}
