{"path":"555474.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a man holding and reading a newspaper, focusing particularly on an article with a headline about a gas shortage. The man is partially visible from the side, featuring just his left profile including his nose, mouth, and a portion of his beard. He wears a knit beanie and a sweater with a distinct pattern.\n\nThe newspaper, titled \"Journal,\" includes articles and headlines visible on its page, discussing various topics, notably energy issues as highlighted by the article “Gas Rationing Set Monday.” The paper's layout includes columns of text, photos, and headlines, characteristic of traditional print newspapers.\n\nIn the background, under an overpass or similar structure, there are signs placed on gas pumps that read “SORRY NO GASOLINE,” reinforcing the context of the newspaper headline about the fuel shortage. The environment appears urban with several cars parked under and beyond the overhang, typical of a city landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the image suggests a specific historical context (likely during the 1970s oil crisis in the United States), connecting the content of the newspaper with the real-world implications seen in the background, which effectively communicates a period of energy scarcity.","title":"Gas rationing system (odd-even plan) is announced in an afternoon newspaper being read at a service station with a sign in the background stating no gas is aVailable.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555455","555434","548171","555486","548053","555489","555465","548173","555452","548169","555413","555519","548174","548047","548170","557765"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["headline","newspaper","shortage","gas","energy","beanie","context","topic","crisis","implication"]}
