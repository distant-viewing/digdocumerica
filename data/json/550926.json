{"path":"550926.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This image presents a unique and intriguing composition involving a mix of natural and man-made elements. The foreground features a broken white toilet with a small yellow flower inside it, set in a patch of grass and small green bushes. This offers a stark contrast to the more natural scenery around it.\n\nThe background displays a vibrant coastal scene. A woman stands in the middle distance, dressed in a 1970s style outfit, gazing out over a beautiful beachfront. She is adjacent to a \"Road Closed\" sign and a yellow barricade, suggesting perhaps a restricted area or one under maintenance. The sandy beach leads into the calm ocean under a clear sky, which takes up the upper third of the photograph.\n\nAdding to the scene, several people can be seen near the water's edge, enjoying the beach setting. In the far distance, along the paved area parallel to the beach, two bicyclists are visible, which adds a dynamic human element to the serene landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the broken toilet—an unusual and possibly symbolic object in the foreground—against the leisure and natural beauty of the beach scene, thus creating a thought-provoking and visually striking image.","title":"The life force--west beach","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["550927","542984","546393","548617","547869","544621","546965","549788","544617","545101","553997","553772","548184","554041","547081","553861"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["beach","beachfront","barricade","third","thought","distance","scenery","outfit","bush","ocean"]}
