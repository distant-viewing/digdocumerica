{"path":"550306.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque and active maritime scene, likely at a small fishing port. The primary focus of the image is a large collection of white, oval-shaped fishing buoys, amassed in the foreground. These buoys, marked with identifiers such as \"1-4\" and \"FL-1,\" are attached to dark nets, pointing to their use in large-scale fishing activities.\n\nThe background offers a serene view of a dock extending into calm, reflective water where two boats are moored side by side. These boats, one orange and the other aqua green, both feature small cabins and are typical of small fishing vessels, suggesting their use for local fishing excursions.\n\nAdjacent to the dock, the shore is lined with traditional structures including a small, rustic building that could serve as a storage shack or workshop for fishing gears. Behind this immediate setup, there is a white house with black roofing, standing approximately two stories high, possibly serving as a residence or a business related to the fishing industry.\n\nThe surroundings are verdant, with trees and grass visible around the buildings, enhancing the tranquil and rural ambiance of the scene. The overcast sky suggests a soft, diffused light, typical of a cloudy day, which complements the serene and quiet mood of the setting.","title":"Purse seine (fishing net) at Malloch's Beach, Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["547565","546939","548228","542911","546998","548764","547561","548547","543358","547549","545061","548229","548546","542905","542872","547548"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["fishing","buoy","dock","shack","excursion","residence","use","roofing","boat","net"]}
