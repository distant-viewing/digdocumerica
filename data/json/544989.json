{"path":"544989.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene beachscape, characterized by a wide stretch of sandy shore dotted with a variety of debris such as driftwood, rocks, and miscellaneous litter. Prominently in the foreground, there are two driftwood logs positioned crosswise, creating a strong visual element that leads the viewer's eye into the scene. These logs appear weathered with one having a noticeably smooth and rounded surface, indicative of long-term exposure to oceanic elements.\n\nThe beach extends towards the background, flanked on one side by a dense cover of tall, green trees that seemingly rise up a hill. This thick forest creates a dark green canopy that contrasts sharply with the lighter sandy shore. The shore is littered with small debris and a few larger, unidentifiable objects scattered around, hinting at human activity or recent storms.\n\nThe sky above presents a clear and bright blue, suggesting a sunny day with favorable weather conditions. The overall lighting is natural, casting deep shadows from the foreground objects onto the sand, enhancing the texture and contours of the sandy beach surface.\n\nThis scene likely captures a moment of quietude on a less frequented beach, emphasizing natural beauty and the calm, yet sometimes untidy, interplay between land and sea.","title":"Sunset on the beach, where the u.s.
