{"path":"543447.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene forest scene, predominantly featuring two large, towering redwood trees. These trees stand majestically with thick, textured bark that has deep vertical grooves, indicating their age and size. The foreground shows the massive, bulbous base of one of the trees, which has an irregular, gnarled growth that adds to the rugged beauty of the scene.\n\nThe surrounding area is densely populated with smaller trees and underbrush, indicating a lush, healthy forest environment. The canopy above is thick with leaves, partially filtering the sunlight and casting dappled shadows throughout the image. The light, breaking through the tree branches, creates a soft, mystic quality, enhancing the feeling of peace and tranquility.\n\nThe color palette is rich with various shades of green, brown, and a hint of the bluish-grey sky peeking through the leaves, which further deepens the connection to the natural world. This setting suggests a quiet, secluded location, likely in a forested area known for its old-growth trees, making it a space of ecological and potentially historical significance. There is no visible human activity or artificial structures, emphasizing the untouched and pristine nature of the area.","title":"Redwood stump assumes fantastic shape","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554966","542748","554968","542922","542750","542845","554990","542745","554969","543449","554967","555051","555116","542575","543442","554958"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["growth","tree","redwood","groove","leave","forest","peace","significance","world","bark"]}
