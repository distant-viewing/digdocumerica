{"path":"551542.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph depicts an atmospheric maritime scene. In the foreground, we see a body of water, shimmering and reflecting sunlight. Stretching across the horizon are muted, layered strips of clouds that blend subtly into the sky above, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. Dominating the scene is a silhouette of a tugboat or a similar vessel moving towards the right, emitting a dense black smoke from its stack, which trails behind it. The smoke plume stands out against the lighter background, creating a strong visual contrast. The colors in the image appear subdued, with a palette of grays, purples, and hints of white, contributing to a serene yet somewhat industrial atmosphere.","title":"Ore carrier heads into lake superior from Duluth harbor ahead is a layer of smog hanging in the air over the cities of Duluth Minnesota and superior, Wisconsin, smoke from ore boat stacks contribute to smog","placename":"Duluth (Minn.)","location":"Duluth, Minnesota","nn1":["550894","557219","557522","551990","547061","557818","553991","550913","550901","544234","553826","551210","550304","544655","544701","555798"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["smoke","tugboat","maritime","purple","strip","trail","white","plume","vessel","subdue"]}
