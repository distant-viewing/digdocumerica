{"path":"545260.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial setting with environmental implications. In the foreground, there are large piles of roughly cut logs, stacked haphazardly and ranging in color from dark wet browns to lighter, dry shades. The logs appear well-weathered, suggesting they might have been exposed to elements for a while.\n\nIn the middle ground, through gaps in the piled logs, parts of an industrial facility are visible. This includes structures like buildings equipped with pipes and large cylindrical towers, which could possibly be storage tanks. There are also visible cranes, suggesting ongoing construction or maintenance work.\n\nIn the background, there is a significant amount of smoke or steam emitting from multiple stacks at the industrial plant. This discharge appears thick and voluminous, merging into a hazy sky which might indicate pollution. The sky is a clear blue, indicating that the photograph was likely taken on a clear day.\n\nThe overall composition creates a stark contrast between the natural resource (wood) in the foreground and the industrial activity in the background, possibly highlighting themes of natural resource utilization and environmental impact. The scene is captured in natural lighting, enhancing the vividness of the colors and the stark contrast between the environment and industrial activity.","title":"St. Regis pulp mill","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545256","546236","543749","545244","550340","545910","552162","550876","550349","543005","550350","542942","550716","546141","550711","543009"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","resource","discharge","implication","gap","vividness","amount","stack","pipe","steam"]}
