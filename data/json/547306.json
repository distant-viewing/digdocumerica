{"path":"547306.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image showcases a landscape at twilight, with a muted purple hue dominating the sky, suggesting either early morning or late evening light. In the distance, a small white house with a steeply pitched roof is discernible, standing isolated amidst a vast plain. The land around the house is flat and appears to be agricultural in nature, though details of crops or other vegetation aren't clearly visible. There are no visible human activities or any people in the scene. The surroundings are quiet and empty, emphasizing a sense of solitude. The overall atmosphere of the photograph conveys a serene, almost melancholic feeling, highlighted by the expansiveness of the landscape and the minimalistic composition.","title":"Farmhouse at dusk south of Grafton.
