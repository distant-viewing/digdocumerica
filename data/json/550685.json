{"path":"550685.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene focusing on an old movie theater named \"Princess.\" The theater's fa√ßade features a large, brightly colored yellow and blue marquee with the word \"PRINCESS\" repeated in bold, stylized font, illuminated by bulbs. Below the marquee, the entrance consists of several glass doors topped by transom windows.\n\nTo the right of the entrance, there's a large, white-lettered marquee sign on a brick wall that states \"NOW PLAYING THE CHEERLEADERS\" accompanied by an 'X' rating, indicating the film's adult nature. Multiple layers of painted advertisements from years past are visible on the brick facade surrounding this marquee.\n\nIn front of the theater, a man is seen standing, observing or interacting with a movie poster housed in a display case next to the entrance. He appears engaged in reading or viewing the information on it. The poster features vibrant images likely related to the movie being advertised. The sidewalk around him is empty, hinting at a quiet moment in an urban setting. The overall image evokes a sense of nostalgia and depicts a slice of urban life centered around the cultural venue of a movie theater.","title":"Movie theatre","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["555919","551144","544333","550127","545448","545462","558136","549872","550140","551495","545333","550108","554297","546440","550132","546428"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["theater","entrance","poster","facay","brick","case","font","repeat","stylize","bulb"]}
