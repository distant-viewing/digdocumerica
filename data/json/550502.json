{"path":"550502.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image depicts a rugged mountainous landscape covered largely with snow and patches of exposed rock. The viewpoint appears to be from an elevated position looking down into a valley. The mountains, characterized by steep, sharp ridges and slopes, dominate the scene. \n\nThe valley seems to be a glacial valley shown by the smoothed contours of the surrounding mountainsides, possibly indicating the past movement of glacier ice through the area. The coloring suggests it could be late autumn or early winter as snow blankets much of the scene, though darker patches of bare rock or possibly vegetation are visible.\n\nIn the distance, the mountains continue into the horizon, layered in shades of blue and gray, creating a depth effect that enhances the vastness of the landscape. The sky is slightly cloudy but still provides enough light to illuminate parts of the landscape, offering a contrast between shadowed and highlighted areas.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is one of desolation and natural beauty, typical of high-altitude environments where conditions can be harsh and vegetation sparse. The lack of any visible human activity or structures further emphasizes the wild, untouched character of the landscape.","title":"Dietrich Pass. This is the highest elevation along the route (4790 feet). In the view south from a point north of the pass, the pipeline and road will come north through the V-shaped notch and descend to the Atigun River (just out of the frame beneath the peak in the left center).","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550422","542520","550505","550645","550504","550501","550514","550628","550408","542519","550415","550416","550500","550419","550423","550413"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["valley","snow","smooth","mountainside","glacier","coloring","mountain","rock","ice","desolation"]}
