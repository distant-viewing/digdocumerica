{"path":"550150.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban maintenance involving three workers engaged in waste collection. It prominently features a white and black garbage truck marked with the slogan \"KEEP CLEVELAND CLEAN\" and labeled with the unit number 414. The truck is parked on a residential street, positioned slightly off-center in the frame.\n\nThere are three workers in the image, all dressed in dark blue uniforms and hats, indicating a uniformed service. One is standing at the rear of the truck, lifting a large bag of trash to throw it into the hopper, which is open for the disposal of debris. Another worker is assisting him by holding the other end of the bag. The third worker is bending over to retrieve more trash from a green trash can on the curb, engaging in the same task.\n\nIn the foreground, beside the trash can, there is a collection of refuse piled up waiting to be cleared. This consists of several bags, possibly containing yard waste or other household trash, and a cluster of what appears to be old records or flat, disc-like objects in boxes, and an individual tire lying nearby.\n\nIn the background, you can see a house with white siding, partially obscured by the truck and the activities of the workers. This provides context, suggesting this scene takes place in a suburban residential area.\n\nThe scene is well-lit by natural daylight, suggesting the photo was taken during daytime. Overall, the photo documents a typical moment in urban sanitation and maintenance operations, reflecting themes of community service and cleanliness initiatives.","title":"Sanitation department at work near east 125th street","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550154","549844","550163","549842","550162","550159","550147","550158","549837","544091","549751","549949","545502","546902","547975","549945"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["trash","worker","truck","bag","can","collection","service","waste","sanitation","maintenance"]}
