{"path":"553680.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a striking aerial view of an urban coastal area during early evening or late afternoon, as indicated by the long shadows and warm lighting. The scene is rich with various elements:\n\n1. **Urban Landscape**: Dominated by numerous high-rise buildings, which include hotels and apartment complexes, densely packed into a relatively narrow space between the shore and the foothills of mountains in the background. The architecture varies in height but is consistently modern.\n\n2. **Natural Features**: On the left side of the image, a sandy beach fringes the urban area, curving gently around a bay. The ocean appears calm and expansive, reflecting the sunlight and contrasting sharply with the dense urban area. Dark mountains rise in the distance, adding a dramatic backdrop to the scene.\n\n3. **Light and Shadows**: The lighting casts long shadows from west to east, suggesting a setting or rising sun. This creates dramatic contrasts and highlights the textures of building roofs and the serene water.\n\n4. **Activities and Details**: Though details are small due to the scale, people can be observed along the beach and the nearby promenade, suggesting a leisurely environment. Several piers jut into the water, and there are tiny specks that could be people or objects on the beach and along the waterfront.\n\n5. **Color Palette**: The photograph utilizes a natural color palette dominated by the browns of the buildings, the greenish hues of the trees and landscape, the blue of the ocean, and the dark tones of the mountain range, all set under a sky transitioning in colors from golden near the horizon to a deeper blue above.\n\nThe composition and perspective provide a comprehensive view that blends human-made structures with natural elements, portraying a vibrant city life adjacent to the tranquility of nature.","title":"Waikiki Beach area.
