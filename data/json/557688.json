{"path":"557688.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of a small, densely stocked store. A middle-aged man with a calm expression sits behind a counter. He has a light suntan, is balding, and wears a light blue polo shirt.\n\nThe background is filled with an array of items, finely illustrating a diverse stock primarily consisting of tobacco products and groceries. Numerous brands of cigarettes are meticulously arranged on the wall behind the man, with prominent displays including brands like Winston, Salem, Camel, and Doral. Below the cigarette displays, the counter hosts an assortment of grocery and household items, including boxes of cereal, cleaning supplies, and cans.\n\nTo the left, shelves are seen stocked with more varied items like condiments and other pantry goods. Above these shelves, there is a colorful sign for “Ice Cream” and several hanging objects which seem to be toys and other small merchandise.\n\nOn the counter in front of the man, there’s a cash register, a cup possibly containing pens or pencils, and an ashtray with a cigarette resting in it, emitting smoke. The surface shows signs of wear, suggesting it's a workspace that sees regular use. The overall lighting is soft, perhaps natural light filtered through a window out of frame, casting a relaxed, everyday business atmosphere.","title":"Lanier Chambers in his recently purchased service station and general store at the western edge of the Helen, Georgia, city limits. Chambers is developing land for residential use in Helen and does not live there himself. He bought the business when the former owner refused to remodel it with an alpine motif. The former owner was not required to remodel since the station is located just outside the eastern edge of the city limits. Helen is near Robertstown.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546101","557686","556369","557763","551832","546226","556207","546225","547805","556209","554036","552647","554869","552637","558281","543039"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["stock","counter","cigarette","grocery","shelf","brand","item","condiment","pencil","cash"]}
