{"path":"542790.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial forestry activity, likely in a logging area, highlighted by machinery and natural surroundings. In the foreground, there is a flatbed trailer attached to a truck, loaded with large, cylindrical logs. One log is being moved by a yellow front-end loader equipped with a hydraulic arm and a grasping device, which is currently lifting the log to stack it onto the trailer.\n\nThe loader is actively in motion, as indicated by the dust and mud churned up around its wheels. The background features tall conifer trees, suggesting that the location is in a forested area. The sky is fairly bright, likely indicating daytime work. The environment seems muddy and well-trodden, typical of active logging sites. On the side of the loader, there is a visible logo, partially obscured, which might be identifying the equipment manufacturer or the logging company. The entire scene captures the essence of forestry operations, focused on the transportation and handling of felled timber.","title":"Loading logs","placename":"Shaver Lake (Calif.)","location":"Shaver Lake, California","nn1":["554416","542616","554419","552201","552202","542856","545046","554418","542624","554427","550337","554417","542855","542851","548155","552583"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["loader","logging","forestry","trailer","log","churn","flatbed","timber","identify","lift"]}
