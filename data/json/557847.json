{"path":"557847.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a car captured in a lowered perspective that emphasizes its windshield and dashboard. The photograph is notable for a subdued and somewhat moody lighting setting, which casts the car in soft darkness with highlights offered by nearby artificial lighting, possibly from indoor lights or street lamps.\n\nThe car, a vintage model evident from its design, is prominently shown with a \"California AAA\" sticker and a \"Temporary Seal\" paper with a visible expiration date of \"Oct. 15th,\" though the year is obscured. These items are attached to the interior side of the windshield, right in the viewer's direct line of sight via the photo.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus and overshadowed by the dim lighting, an individual is partially visible. The person appears to be standing, facing away from the camera, engaged in a separate activityâ€”perhaps part of a broader indoor or nighttime environment like a garage or a night event.\n\nThe photograph has an atmospheric quality, visually capturing a moment that hints at narrative possibilities around the car's situation, its location, and the people involved, all underpinned by a certain vintage or nostalgic feel.","title":"Temporary sticker affixed to the windshield of a car that failed an exhaust analyzer test for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions at an auto emission inspection station in Norwood, Ohio.
