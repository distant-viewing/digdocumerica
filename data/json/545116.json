{"path":"545116.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural seascape. The image shows a massive rock arch standing prominently in a body of water, possibly the ocean. The arch, formed by erosion, features a central hole through which the blue sky and distant coastline can be seen. This central arch is flanked by additional rugged cliffs, suggesting that this scene is part of a larger rocky coastline.\n\nThe colors in the photograph have a somewhat muted tone, with deep blues in the water and the shadows, contrasting with the lighter blues of the sky. The sunlight appears to be coming from a low angle, indicating either early morning or late afternoon. The horizon is visible in the background, slightly blurred likely due to the mist or distance, anchoring the scene in a vast, open space. The entire composition feels serene yet powerful, emphasizing the enduring nature of geological formations against the backdrop of time and elemental forces.","title":"Rocky coastline","placename":"Tillamook (Or.)","location":"Tillamook, Oregon","nn1":["553077","545572","544939","545126","545566","545568","544935","545580","545555","545563","545584","543068","545173","543060","543307","545551"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["arch","coastline","hole","blue","seascape","force","erosion","cliff","mist","ocean"]}
