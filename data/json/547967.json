{"path":"547967.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This image depicts a panoramic view of a city skyline across a body of water, likely photographed during the daytime given the bright blue sky and scattered clouds. The skyscrapers, including prominent twin towers, highlight the city's bustling and developed urban environment. The architecture varies from older, ornate buildings to modern, simpler designs, suggesting a mix of historical and contemporary structures. The river or bay in the foreground adds a natural element to the urban scene, while also serving as a clear foreground that separates the viewer from the dense cityscape. The distribution of clouds in the sky enhances the depth and adds character to the otherwise clear weather conditions, offering a serene yet majestic urban scene.","title":"Manhattan skyline from the Staten Island ferry","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557273","548387","552261","552252","552260","552251","555716","552363","545429","552265","548416","548317","556188","549477","557274","548390"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["distribution","city","cloud","bay","daytime","skyscraper","separate","develop","character","cityscape"]}
