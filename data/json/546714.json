{"path":"546714.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a busy highway system surrounded by lush greenery. The image shows several major roads interconnecting, with large volumes of cars either in motion or idling, likely indicating heavy traffic flow or a traffic jam. Multiple lanes on each roadway are visible, filled predominantly with automobiles and a few trucks.\n\nThe area is dense with trees, emphasizing the highway's carving through a forested region. On the left and right margins of the image, smaller roads and possibly parking areas are also visible, surrounded by patches of green lawn and clusters of trees. Some urban structures or small buildings can be seen hidden amongst the trees, possibly residential or commercial properties.\n\nThe overall layout of the highways reveals various ramps and interchanges that facilitate the movement of vehicles between different directions and roads. The day appears to be clear with sufficient daylight enhancing the visibility of the area. The composition of the photo, with its elevated perspective, offers a comprehensive view of the traffic pattern and the natural landscape, emphasizing the juxtaposition of urban infrastructure and natural environment.","title":"Beltway and Route 70, looking northwest.
