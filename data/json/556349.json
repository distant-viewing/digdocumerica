{"path":"556349.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial setting, showcasing a coal mining operation. Centered in the image is a towering green metal structure, possibly a coal tipple, where coal is sorted and loaded. Nearby, thereâ€™s another complex of green buildings, likely used for storage or processing. An array of tracks in the foreground carries several coal cars, some loaded with coal, indicating the active role of rail transport in this operation.\n\nThe setting is in a valley or a basin, as suggested by the wooded hills in the background, which create a contrasting natural backdrop to the industrial activity. There's a slight overcast in the sky, casting soft lighting over the area, which enhances the visibility of details in the industrial machinery and the rocky ground around the structures. The overall composition puts an emphasis on the coexistence of heavy industry with natural environments in possibly a rural or semi-rural area.","title":"The elevator to the main shaft for men and equipment at the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia. The green building on the right contains an office, shower rooms, and warehouses. The small yellow cars behind the elevator fit into the elevator and are used in the mine. A switch engine, used for outside work, is seen between the elevator and the building. Coal cars are shown on railroad tracks in the foreground.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556602","556424","554632","556520","554625","555591","557403","556400","556565","551037","543642","551036","554764","556466","554763","556430"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["coal","load","put","basin","operation","coexistence","sort","rail","emphasis","role"]}
