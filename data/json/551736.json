{"path":"551736.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively outdoor scene in a park, likely captured in the mid-20th century, judging by the clothing styles and color saturation typical of film photography from that era. The setting is lush and verdant, with mature trees and grassy areas that provide a refreshing backdrop to the activity within the frame.\n\nIn the foreground through a natural vignette created by out-of-focus leaves, there's a walkway where a group of children, accompanied by two adults, are engaged in a walking activity. The composition is vibrant and filled with movement.\n\nThe group consists of roughly eight children of diverse racial backgrounds and two adult women. The children are of varying ages, possibly ranging from about 4 to 10 years old. They exhibit a cheerful demeanor, engaged in what appears to be a supervised walk or possibly a field trip. The children and adults are casually dressed suitable for a warm day outdoorsâ€”some children wear bright summer clothes, while others are in more neutral tones.\n\nThe first adult, leading the group, is a woman with long hair, sunglasses, and wearing a long-sleeve shirt with pants. She carries a bag over her shoulder and exhibits a relaxed posture as she walks. The second adult is at the rear of the group. She has her hair pulled back and wears a blouse and pants, looking after the children at the end of the line.\n\nThe path they are walking on curves gently through the park, suggesting a peaceful, leisurely stroll. The setting indicates a well-maintained public park, with managed paths and a visible lamp post in the background that adds to the quaintness of the setting.\n\nThe photo captures a slice of everyday life, emphasizing community, care, and the simplicity of a walk in the park. The mixture of nature and human interaction creates a warm, inviting atmosphere, reflecting a moment of innocent joy and collective activity.","title":"School children on their way home after Dairy Day in Prospect Park, Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["552407","555947","557985","557410","551764","544808","552033","551713","543233","553065","552036","547756","554072","550074","551712","543238"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","adult","park","walk","group","stroll","vignette","walking","path","pant"]}
