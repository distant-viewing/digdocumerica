{"path":"549108.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph portrays the dynamic scene of a young girl riding a pony. The girl, who appears to be in her early childhood years, has her hair dramatically swept by the wind, suggesting a fast pace. She is smiling broadly, which conveys joy and excitement. She wears a patterned short-sleeve shirt and denim pants, typical for casual outdoor activity.\n\nThe pony, of a pale color with a flowing white mane, is equipped with a pink saddle and matching reins. The child holds onto these reins with one hand, suggesting active control and engagement in the riding activity. \n\nThe background is softly focused, indicating motion blur and giving a hint of a possibly rustic settingâ€”likely a farm or fairground. The backlighting from the sun provides a warm, golden tone to the scene, enhancing the sense of a vibrant, joyful outdoor adventure.\n\nOverall, this image captures a moment of childhood exhilaration and the playful connection between a young rider and her pony, enriched by natural lighting and a dynamic composition.","title":"Performer at annual junior rodeo held on Colorado River Indian Reservation at Parker","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["543043","556562","543784","543678","544358","556553","553116","554689","553064","557051","543783","556548","544414","556139","544362","549711"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["rein","childhood","girl","fairground","riding","mane","saddle","pace","backlighting","excitement"]}
