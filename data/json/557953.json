{"path":"557953.jpg","date":"October 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a rustic and idyllic scene. In the foreground, there's a group of people engaged in agrarian activities within a fenced field. The individuals, who vary in gender and age, are either scything or gathering crops, dressed in casual attire that suggests a communal or educational activity rather than professional farming.\n\nDominating the middle ground of the image is a large white house with a prominent chimney and symmetrically placed windows. Its architecture is simple and functional, typical of a rural setting.\n\nIn the background, slightly offset from the center, stands a white church topped with a traditional steeple, indicating a central place of worship and community gathering. The church is surrounded by a lush green lawn and several trees, with a few more people leisurely walking or standing nearby.\n\nThe setting is enhanced by clear skies and the hint of autumnal foliage, suggesting this scene takes place in a temperate climate during the early fall. This pastoral scene might typify a historical or preserved village designed to represent an earlier time period, focused on community and simple living.","title":"Visitors walking through the herb garden next to the salt box house in the hale farm and western reserve village near Akron Ohio.
