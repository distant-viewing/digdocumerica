{"path":"543070.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach setting dominated by a large expanse of sand, flanked by a densely vegetated cliff. The left side of the frame features the dark, shadowy presence of a rocky cliff covered with dense green foliage, which slopes steeply towards the sandy beach. The sand itself appears smooth with patches of debris scattered across it.\n\nThe main focus of the image is a group of dogs and what might be a person interacting in the middle of the beach. Several dogs of varying sizes and colors can be seen either standing or moving around a central figure, possibly a human, who appears to be engaged with them. The individual and dogs are positioned almost centrally in the frame, creating a sense of activity within the calm environment. Their presence adds a lively dynamic against the peaceful and natural backdrop.\n\nThe atmosphere is highlighted by the natural lighting that casts vibrant hues over the entire scene, with the cliff in shadow creating a stark contrast to the illuminated beach. Overall, the composition of the photograph, with its contrast between the shadowed foliage and the bright sand, alongside the interaction between the animals and the human-like figure, evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence within a natural setting.","title":"Horsemen ride in moonlight","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["545133","548697","543395","543083","543500","554159","548695","543072","543252","543287","547607","543463","548220","542890","543493","555400"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dog","beach","cliff","sand","human","figure","foliage","dynamic","coexistence","presence"]}
