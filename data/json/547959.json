{"path":"547959.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph shows an airport scene featuring a large Pan Am airplane parked at a gate. The aircraft, prominently displaying the Pan Am logo on its fuselage, is connected to a jet bridge at the terminal building. The airplane is a quad-engine model, indicating it's a long-haul aircraft from the era when Pan Am was operational.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a variety of ground service equipment scattered around. Visible are a set of mobile stairs pushed aside, a container, and other unidentifiable airport equipment. There is also a classic airport service vehicle parked near the aircraft, likely used for luggage or cargo handling.\n\nThe background features the airport terminal building with a specific architectural style that includes long horizontal windows and a flat roof. There are multiple jet bridges visible, suggesting a busy, well-equipped airport.\n\nThe overall scene captures a typical moment at an airport during the mid to late 20th century, reflecting the operations and environment of the time, including the type of vehicles and the design of the aircraft and airport infrastructure.","title":"Pan Am jumbo jet at John F.
