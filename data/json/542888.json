{"path":"542888.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a striking scene of a weathered and twisted driftwood tree on a sandy beach. The driftwood, predominantly in the foreground, has a prominent, hollowed-out portion creating a natural, arch-like frame through which a small section of the beach and additional rocks can be viewed. The wood displays rich textures and colors, ranging from deep browns to grays, showing signs of aging and exposure to elements.\n\nBehind the arching driftwood, the beach is visible with several large, dark boulders scattered across the sand, partially embedded into it. These rocks add a rugged contrast to the relatively smooth sand around them. \n\nIn the background, a dense, misty forest on a cliff looms over the beach, giving the scene a mystic and somewhat eerie feel. The atmosphere is moody, likely due to overcast or foggy weather conditions, which cast a soft, diffuse light over the entire setting and blend the colors of the sand, rocks, driftwood, and foliage into a cohesive, subdued palette.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its natural framing and the interplay between the elements and textures, creates a compelling and somewhat introspective view that evokes the serene, yet powerful nature of coastal landscapes.","title":"California--Moonstone Beach","placename":"Moonstone (Calif.)","location":"Moonstone, California","nn1":["542889","542886","543075","542887","543069","542884","543078","545111","545108","542890","544989","542973","543153","543052","555468","543081"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["driftwood","beach","sand","rock","embed","loom","boulder","aging","framing","arch"]}
