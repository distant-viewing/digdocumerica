{"path":"553347.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of numerous seagulls in flight over a body of water, possibly a lake or river. The birds are predominantly white with hints of gray on their wings and black tips, characteristic of common gull species. They are captured in various stages of flight, with wings extended in different positions, creating a bustling effect as if they were suddenly disturbed or are collectively taking off.\n\nThe background features a tranquil forest with dense gatherings of coniferous trees along the shorelines. The trees appear to be mostly pine or spruce, given their pointed tops and lush green hues. The shoreline is slightly visible below the treeline, and the water reflects a bit of the sky, enhancing the natural feel of the habitat.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the contrast between the frantic motion of the gulls and the serene, untouched natural landscape. The use of natural lighting seems to illuminate the birds against the darker background of the woods, highlighting the main subjects effectively. The image evokes a sense of freedom and the wild, unpredictable nature of bird behavior.","title":"Canadian geese on the Nashua river","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["552238","554600","549738","544609","552146","557121","557124","557125","557126","549772","549744","544834","557208","549757","545991","557123"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","wing","flight","spruce","shoreline","behavior","disturb","seagull","treeline","freedom"]}
