{"path":"554788.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures an evocative, rustic scene featuring a small, dilapidated wooden house situated beside a calm body of water. The house appears abandoned and weathered, with its wood siding showing signs of age and neglect. Its dark, shingled roof also looks worn, and there are no visible windows, adding to the sense of desertion.\n\nThe setting includes a leafless tree standing next to the house, leaning slightly over it, which contributes to the sceneâ€™s melancholic feel. There are dry grass and brush surrounding the structure, typical of a late fall or winter landscape, in tones that blend with the muted colors of the area.\n\nIn the background, a large barren hill slopes upward, its surface rugged and devoid of vegetation, emphasizing the desolate atmosphere. The water near the house reflects the hill and the overcast sky, which adds a mirror-like quality to the scene, enhancing the stillness and seclusion of the location.\n\nA dirt path or road runs in front of the house, suggesting some access to this isolated place, though no human presence is visible, reinforcing the solitude of the scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a mood of abandonment and calm reflection, set in a remote, natural environment.","title":"This road ends at the site of a hanna coal company strip mine the body of water is an apparent violation of Ohio law which states: \"while mining and reclaiming, he must maintain ditches, dikes, pumps and other drainage facilities...\"","placename":"Steubenville (Ohio)","location":"Steubenville, Ohio","nn1":["554822","555632","554787","557640","552494","545137","554799","554823","545233","552491","552455","558110","546997","556491","548044","556999"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","shingle","isolated","brush","devoid","hill","seclusion","dilapidate","stillness","mirror"]}
