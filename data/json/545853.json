{"path":"545853.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a man and a woman in the ocean, both waist-deep in water. The image captures a serene scene with the man, who is shirtless, and the woman, wearing a light-colored swimsuit. The man is turned towards the woman, and both appear to be engaging in conversation. Surrounding them is the ocean, exhibiting tones of dark blue with subtle waves, indicative of calm waters. The lighting suggests that the photo was taken during the day under natural light, likely with the sun positioned higher in the sky. The background is a soft, blurred transition between the calm ocean and the sky, providing no definitive horizon line, which places full focus on the two individuals and their interaction within the water.","title":"Watersport in Galveston Bay","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["553071","552977","551285","544338","557481","553783","554901","546222","546320","543460","549345","548805","551967","550923","554903","550238"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["ocean","deep","woman","waist","swimsuit","man","turn","transition","water","exhibit"]}
