{"path":"550753.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a striking landscape that features a mixture of natural and man-made elements. The scene is dominated by a dark body of water, which appears vast and is sprinkled with clusters of bright yellow-green vegetation or algae. Running parallel to the water on its right side is a reddish-brown dirt road, bordered closely by lush green trees and underbrush.\n\nTwo prominent features draw attention in the landscape: electrical transmission towers and power lines, which stretch from the upper right-hand corner into the center of the image and down into the scene. These towers stand tall among the trees, visually contrasting with the natural environment through their structured, metallic forms.\n\nThe vivid colors create a distinct palette - the dark tones of the water, the rustic color of the earthy road, the vibrant green of the woodland, and the splashes of yellow across the water's surface.\n\nOverall, the image presents a serene yet somewhat industrial scene, blending elements of nature with human infrastructure in a serene setting, likely conveying messages about either ecological conditions or the juxtaposition of environmental and technological cohabitation.","title":"Algae collect inside bays of the Fox River between Appleton and Green Bay. There are 19 sources of industrial pollution along this 40-mile stretch. The problem is compounded by algae in Lake Winnebago, which die in the lake, decompose in the river, and pass into the bay.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["547098","550757","550638","543767","555752","547227","553086","544675","554724","544695","556913","552243","546054","548001","553454","555684"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["tower","transmission","algae","woodland","water","splash","message","road","yellow","mixture"]}
