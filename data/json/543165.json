{"path":"543165.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene that appears to be an outdoor area cluttered with debris and discarded objects. The focus is on a large pile of various items, predominantly made up of broken wooden furniture and metal pieces. Some recognizable objects within the heap include wooden chair frames, a barrel, and what might be parts of wooden tables or panels. There are also some scattered cylindrical metal objects that could be old drums or barrels.\n\nIn the background, the landscape features a bright blue sky and is sparsely populated with tall, thin trees. These trees are relatively bare with most of their foliage concentrated at the top. The ground around the debris appears to be sandy and is sparsely covered with patches of grass and small flowers, suggesting a somewhat arid region or possibly a coastal area. The surrounding vegetation is scrubby, with low bushes and a few spread out, more mature trees, which add a rugged natural feel to the scene.\n\nOverall, the mood of the photograph might convey neglect or abandonment, highlighted by the contrast between the natural beauty of the area and the jumbled mess of discarded items. The image could be documenting the aftermath of a clearing, perhaps in preparation for development or as part of a clean-up effort in a natural environment.","title":"Trash on beach","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["552102","556640","554536","549774","556324","547906","549307","549750","557307","551247","555086","544823","542549","544468","547901","554346"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["barrel","object","item","drum","spread","debris","heap","furniture","aftermath","preparation"]}
