{"path":"543186.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged coastal scene characterized by rocky shores and a tidal inlet filled with water. The picture is divided diagonally by this inlet, with rocks covered in mollusks and rocky vegetation lining the sides. The foreground shows abundant greenery, possibly seaweed or algae, interspersed with darker rocks and isolated pools of water, reflecting the sky. There is a hint of a sandy beach or finer-grained shore in the distance toward the top right, bordered by water. The top part of the image shows more of the rocky landscape and a tranquil ocean horizon under a clear, bright blue sky. The composition suggests a natural, untouched coastal environment, possibly during low tide, revealing the flora and rough textures that are submerged during high waters. The absence of people or man-made objects emphasizes the beauty and solitude of this natural seascape.","title":"Algae in rock bound water pool","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["543297","543289","547486","547602","545230","545122","543204","543290","542917","545173","543292","549353","543243","543080","543291","545129"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["inlet","shore","seaweed","algae","tide","seascape","rock","grain","water","pool"]}
