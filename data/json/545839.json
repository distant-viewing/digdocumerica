{"path":"545839.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and serene natural scene centered around a waterfall. The composition primarily features a close-up view of water cascading down a large, mossy rock formation. The rock, detailed with a green and brown surface that suggests a slick, moist texture indicative of an environment rich in water, is the main foreground element. The water flows over it smoothly, creating a veil-like effect where it meets the rock, and then breaks into individual streams and droplets as it falls. The background is slightly blurred but indicates a darker, shadowed rock face from where the water might be originating, creating a contrast with the lighter, misty appearance of the falling water.\n\nThe focus and exposure on the water create a sense of movement, emphasizing its fluidity and the natural force driving it. The surrounding darkness adds a mysterious quality, focusing attention on the brilliantly illuminated water streams, enhancing the natural beauty and tranquillity of the scene. There is a palpable sense of moisture in the air, suggested by the mist and the sheen on the rocks. This scene might be located in a lush forest or a secluded part of a mountainous area, accessible to those looking for tranquil and undisturbed natural spaces.","title":"Gorman Falls, a clean, spring water creek.
