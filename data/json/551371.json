{"path":"551371.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This is a close-up photograph of a dark green, slightly glossy leaf, featuring a unique natural pattern of water droplets arranged into what resembles a smiley face. The leaf is in sharp focus against a darker, blurred background, enhancing the visual impact of the droplets and the intricate details of the leaf's surface.\n\nThe leaf itself shows some signs of wear or natural damage, with small holes and translucent areas, possibly due to insect feeding. The arrangement of the water droplets, particularly noteworthy, seems almost symmetrical, with larger droplets forming the 'eyes' and a line of smaller droplets curving underneath to represent a 'smile'.\n\nThis image utilizes natural light that softens the overall ambiance, giving a serene, almost whimsical quality to the photograph. The depth of field is shallow, ensuring that the viewer's attention is drawn primarily to the pattern of droplets and the textural details of the leaf. The composition and the natural elements of the photograph blend effectively to convey both the resilience and the transient beauty of nature.","title":"Waterdrops on a sassafras leaf (Sassafras albidum)--along Rt. 54, five miles north of Eldon","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["555032","558077","555044","557593","551357","543620","551353","542686","546096","544731","543629","543565","543564","542688","551372","557592"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["droplet","leaf","insect","hole","ensure","soften","utilize","resilience","detail","up"]}
