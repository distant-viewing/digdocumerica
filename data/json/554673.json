{"path":"554673.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people enjoying a scenic overlook from a high vantage point. The scene is set against a vast and picturesque landscape of dense forest and distant mountains. The setting appears to be during the fall, as evidenced by the colorful autumn foliage which varies in hues of green, orange, and red.\n\nThe group of people, consisting of both children and adults, are gathered on a large rock outcrop. They are variously engaged in looking out over the scenery, sitting, standing, and interacting with one another. Some of the individuals are wearing hats, and the clothing styles suggest a setting that could be from the mid to late 20th century. There appears to be a map spread out among some members of the group, suggesting that they might be hiking or involved in some form of outdoor exploration.\n\nThe background landscape features rolling hills and a wooded valley extending into the distance under a cloudy sky, which contributes to a serene and slightly moody atmosphere.작성 \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes a sense of adventure and the enjoyment of nature, with the human figures both blending into and standing out from the natural environment that surrounds them.","title":"Adirondack Mountain Club hikers atop Mount VanHoevenberg look out over the High Peaks region to the south in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["554672","554491","545689","557985","558096","553370","543234","545780","553965","543383","545710","554667","549102","544093","545700","554662"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["group","map","standing","member","fall","adventure","enjoyment","vantage","autumn","scenery"]}
