{"path":"555378.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an atmospheric scene in a mountainous region, possibly taken during the late afternoon or evening due to the low light conditions. The image is dominated by layers of mountain ridges that recede into the distance, each fading progressively lighter in shade, creating a deep sense of depth and emphasizing the vastness of the landscape.\n\nThe mountains are enveloped in shades of blue and gray, suggesting either a dusk setting or stormy weather conditions. Above the mountains, the sky is dominated by a heavy, somber cloud cover that appears to be breaking slightly to allow some light to penetrate through. This break in the clouds creates a dramatic contrast between the dark foreboding cloud layer and the bright, narrow strip of light which illuminates the upper crests of the mountains subtly.\n\nThere is a mystical or even somewhat ominous quality to the atmosphere, likely due to the interplay of shadow and light, and the heavy, brooding presence of the storm clouds. No human activity or artificial structures are visible, emphasizing the natural and wild character of the terrain. The overall composition and color palette of the picture lend it an ethereal, almost painted quality, which highlights the majestic and raw beauty of the natural world.","title":"Breakup of a storm over Pike's Peak","placename":"Colorado Springs (Colo.)","location":"Colorado Springs, Colorado","nn1":["543023","546764","544070","542923","542681","554634","550421","552695","542676","557558","557000","552927","550628","557575","554398","543712"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["mountain","cloud","layer","crest","quality","storm","world","break","strip","shade"]}
