{"path":"552523.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features an elderly man sitting on a wooden bench on the porch of a traditional building. The man is dressed in denim jeans and a denim jacket over a shirt, and he wears a straw hat. He has his right arm resting on the back of the bench, and his left leg crossed over his right knee, conveying a relaxed posture. His expression is neutral and he looks directly towards the camera.\n\nThe building behind him is painted red with white trim around the windows. One of the windows to his left has curtains partially drawn, and there's a glimpse of a floral-patterned curtain inside. The porch wall is adorned with decorative, embossed tin panels beneath the windows. A sign is visible in the window next to him, with text that appears to be an advertisement or a notice, though its details are not clear due to the distance.\n\nThe scene captures a peaceful, somewhat reflective atmosphere, possibly in a rural or small-town setting, suggested by the traditional architecture and the man's attire. The image has a timeless quality, evoking a sense of stillness and everyday life in such a locale.","title":"Outside general store in milton","placename":"Springfield (Ill.)","location":"Springfield, Illinois","nn1":["547355","556489","547313","556488","554845","553090","558330","548615","549042","547679","545524","547330","558333","554915","546068","545090"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["curtain","denim","window","bench","porch","tin","notice","locale","straw","knee"]}
