{"path":"544040.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph depicts a large outdoor area dedicated to water treatment or similar industrial activity. In the foreground, there's a body of still dark water that appears to be a segment of a wastewater treatment facility or industrial runoff pool. The surface of this water is heavily covered with floating debris, predominantly dried leaves, which have accumulated in thick patches. A narrow, concrete pathway or divider runs through the middle of the water, partially separating two sections of the pool.\n\nIn the background, we can see more of the industrial setting, including large metal pipes and frameworks that suggest an expansive facility focused on either water processing or some form of environmental management. The area is not well-maintained, as indicated by the presence of heavy leaf debris both in the water and on the pathways and structures around it.\n\nOverall, the scene speaks to an outdoor, possibly neglected, industrial setting focusing on water treatment, where natural and industrial elements are closely intertwined. No people are visible in the image, emphasizing the abandonment or low human activity in this segment of the facility.","title":"Area of copper smelting plant where iron is \"leached\", or separated out","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["550720","547568","549564","544052","552046","548212","548196","551562","548216","545840","550193","543574","543573","550713","546895","549624"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["treatment","segment","pool","water","facility","pathway","wastewater","runoff","debris","leaf"]}
