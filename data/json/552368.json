{"path":"552368.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts four individuals in what appears to be an industrial or workshop setting, engaged in a discussion or briefing. The group is gathered around a large black chalkboard filled with handwritten information, which includes technical instructions and data noted under headings like \"Crew Chief\", \"B Shift\", \"Problems\", and numerical and checkbox lists.\n\nFrom left to right:\n1. The first person is standing while holding a notebook and pen, dressed in a light-colored jacket, dark pants, and a patterned shirt. He seems to be listening intently or noting down information.\n2. The second person is in dialogue with the third, facing him directly. This person is wearing denim jeans, a dark shirt, and he also holds a notebook.\n3. The third individual, in the center, sports glasses and a beard, and is dressed in a light blue shirt with gray-blue pants. He appears to be explaining something important, possibly gesturing towards the board with a chalk or pointer.\n4. The fourth person stands at the right edge, looking at the chalkboard with his hand partially raised towards it. He wears glasses, a light gray suit, and a tie. He also appears engaged in understanding or addressing the information on the chalkboard.\n\nThe background is rudimentarily industrial, featuring wire mesh on parts of the walls, a simple metal shelf with items, and a visible trash bin. Overall, the setting seems to be a workshop or a backstage area of a factory or similar facility, where operational plans or issues are being discussed.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["552392","557727","552616","546628","552388","548277","557883","545537","552387","555233","556028","546299","552617","556383","555234","544022"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["information","notebook","workshop","note","person","dialogue","bin","instruction","datum","list"]}
