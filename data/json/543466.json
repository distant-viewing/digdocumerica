{"path":"543466.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and engaging outdoor scene featuring three young girls at a wooded lakeside area. The setting is richly detailed with natural elements.\n\nIn the foreground, on the left side of the image, one of the girls is stepping off a large, grey rock onto another similar rock, moving toward the lake. She is dressed in a light pink or white frock. The sunlight illuminates the clarity and the ripples of the water near these rocks.\n\nTo the right, the other two girls are interacting with their surroundings on and around a cluster of weathered tree stumps. One girl, with her back to the camera, is in a dark top and red polka dot shorts while standing on a stump and holding onto what appears to be a metallic rod in the center of the stump. She is likely in the process of either climbing up or stabilizing herself. The other girl, facing sideways, is leaning over another stump, her attention directed towards some object of interest that she is holding. She is dressed in a patterned top and dark shorts.\n\nThe general ambiance suggests curiosity and exploration, characteristic of childhood play. The background features the shaded, green tints of the lake, with glimpses of light reflecting off its surface and various sticks and debris floating in the water. The surrounding area is littered with dried pine needles, emphasizing the natural, wild setting of the scene.\n\nThe photo conveys a sense of natural beauty and child-like wonder, set in a peaceful, forested lakeside environment where nature and youthful curiosity meet.","title":"Southern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["553431","543875","544200","547692","551159","543468","546333","550827","554499","551160","553429","544352","555941","547727","545267","546941"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["stump","girl","lakeside","curiosity","rock","short","sideway","wonder","lake","polka"]}
