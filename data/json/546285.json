{"path":"546285.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene in a scientific or laboratory setting. A man, likely a scientist or lab technician, is focused on examining a large sheet of paper that appears to be output from a piece of equipment, possibly a chart recorder, suggesting the recording of some form of data. The sheet shows multiple lines in different colors, which may represent different variables or measurements over time.\n\nThe man is dressed in a white lab coat, indicating a professional or clinical environment, and has short, dark hair. He is partially facing away from the camera, showing his profile as he attentively studies the chart.\n\nIn the background, there's a bench with various types of equipment. Notably, there are multiple bottles, likely containing chemicals or samples, lined up side by side. They are labeled and capped with different colored caps. Behind the bottles, a panel with various dials and controls can be seen, suggesting some type of control system or complex apparatus typically found in scientific laboratories.\n\nOverall, the setting is tidy and structured, reflective of a controlled and precise scientific work environment. The focus of the photograph is clearly on the man and his interaction with the data output, highlighting a moment of analysis or discovery. The color tones are somewhat muted, common in film photography of the era this image appears to hail from.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Chemistry lab.
