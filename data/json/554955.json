{"path":"554955.jpg","date":"October 1968","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural scene characterized by a strong element of light and shadow. The central focus of the image is the brilliant sunlight, which is just visible behind a dense cluster of tall pine trees on the right side of the frame. The sunlight casts bright, radiating beams that pierce through gaps in the trees, creating a visually striking light phenomenon known as \"God rays\" or crepuscular rays.\n\nThe pine trees, silhouetted against the darkened sky, appear along the right edge and dip into a slope towards the center-left of the photo. These trees are dark with only the edges highlighted by the backlighting of the sun, emphasizing a stark contrast between the dark tonalities of the forest and the bright intensity of the sunlight.\n\nThe top-left corner and most of the left side of the photo is consumed by darkness, enhancing the mystery and depth of the forested area. The composition is simple yet impactful, with a balance between the dark mass of the trees and the powerful, almost ethereal quality of natural light. The overall mood conveyed is one of tranquility and the awe-inspiring beauty of an untouched natural world.","title":"Forty to sixty-year-old Douglas fir and western red cedar silhouetted on an east-west ridge at 1,000 feet on green mountain in Kitsap County, Washington.
