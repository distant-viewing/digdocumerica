{"path":"544487.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph showcases a shiny, black turtle positioned on a rugged, gray rock surface surrounded by natural debris and some green vegetation. The turtle's shell is highly reflective, catching light and appearing glossy. Its shell has visible ridges and patterns that suggest it might be a kind of aquatic or semi-aquatic turtle, possibly a species accustomed to swampy or wetland environments.\n\nThe background is filled with dried leaves, twigs, and some patches of grass, typical of a natural, possibly woodland, habitat. There is little visible human interference in the setting, suggesting this image was taken in a wildlife-rich area where such turtles might be commonly found.\n\nThe focus is sharply on the turtle, emphasizing its texture and features like the clawed feet, pointed snout, and lined shell. The lighting is natural, suggesting the photo was taken during daylight, further accentuating the glossiness and detailed texture of the turtle's carapace.","title":"Soft shell turtle","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551366","545553","543778","554602","549145","543264","543152","555552","549459","544908","552867","551362","543183","555066","555065","544630"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["shell","claw","interference","twig","foot","kind","dry","ridge","wetland","wildlife"]}
