{"path":"552022.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph captures a natural outdoor scene featuring an eroded streambed in a semi-urban environment. The focus is on a small, muddy stream flowing through a ditch lined with dense, wild green vegetation. Overhanging grasses and bushes partially conceal the stream, indicative of minimal maintenance and wild growth.\n\nIn the center of the image, a couple of pipes, possibly drainage culverts, lie across the stream, somewhat submerged and partly exposed, disrupting the flow of water. These pipes appear aged and are likely contributing to the erosion of the stream bank.\n\nThe background shows a stark contrast between the natural environment and urban development. A large, gray warehouse-like building with a flat roof is visible, suggesting industrial or commercial use. This building's modern, unadorned architecture differs notably from the disarray of the natural elements in the foreground.\n\nThe area around the stream is overgrown, with no visible paths indicating infrequent human activity. The condition of the stream and surrounding vegetation points to neglected urban water management, often seen on the outskirts of industrial zones. There are no people visible in the photo, emphasizing the lack of interaction between the natural environment and the surrounding industrial activity.","title":"Exposed and corroded pipe in a creek in woodbridge, adjacent to a high school and public health center.
