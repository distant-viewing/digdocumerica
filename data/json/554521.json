{"path":"554521.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man outdoors. He is dressed in a red and black plaid jacket and wears a cap that features a badge, suggesting that it could be a uniform or part of specific outdoor attire. The man carries a wicker creel basket on his right side, indicating that he might be engaged in fishing, as these baskets are traditionally used by anglers to hold fish. The creel is attached by a strap slung over his shoulder.\n\nThe man is shown with a solemn expression, looking off to the left side of the frame, which adds to a thoughtful or contemplative mood conveyed by the image. His attire, including the cap, jacket, and the utility belt around his waist with attached items (possibly tools or fishing equipment), is practical and rugged, suited for outdoor activities.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly focused and shows lush green foliage, suggesting a forested or rural setting. This backdrop enhances the outdoor, naturalistic theme of the photograph and provides a contrast that highlights the man's figure and attire.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the man and his gear against a backdrop of nature, portrays a scene of outdoor activity, possibly fishing, and evokes a sense of a longstanding connection with nature.","title":"Trout fisherman on twitchell creek near big moose, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554522","554677","542613","554520","554926","548302","554523","553418","551397","548236","543484","547679","553090","547179","553341","557115"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["basket","man","fishing","attire","attach","fishe","cap","solemn","waist","strap"]}
