{"path":"547157.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural scene, specifically focusing on eroded terrain likely alongside a river or stream, under overcast lighting conditions, which suggest either a winter or early spring setting based on the presence of snow.\n\nIn the foreground, the composition showcases a steep sedimentary bank with multiple visible layers indicating geological stratification. The bank appears to have partly collapsed, with chunks of mud and soil gathered at the base. There are patches of snow scattered across both the upper surface and the collapsed soil below, reflecting a cold environment.\n\nThe middle section of the bank visibly retains moisture or potentially harbors ice, indicating recent interactions with water, possibly from the adjacent river or rainfall. There are also dried grass and twig fragments caught in the muddy areas, and roots exposed by the erosion dangle over the edge, highlighting the natural processes of erosion and vegetative adaptation.\n\nThe background is primarily made up of a similar eroded landscape and sparse vegetation. Tall, dried grasses dominate the upper edge of the bank, and their golden-brown colors contrast with the dark, wet soil and grey skies, creating a somewhat bleak yet intriguing natural scene. The overall setting and composition suggest an area that is frequently impacted by natural forces such as water flow and possibly freezing temperatures.","title":"Sand dune crumbles in wake of winter storm on lake Michigan","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["545656","543721","551232","551231","543652","551233","557100","551520","550486","555598","552994","545534","552420","550414","552423","552905"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["bank","collapse","soil","dry","erosion","snow","stratification","freeze","dangle","chunk"]}
