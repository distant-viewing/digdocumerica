{"path":"544330.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a gritty, somewhat ethereal scene of two people walking through a dusty or sandy environment. The image colors are muted with a vintage, washed-out effect, suggesting this may be an older photograph or taken with a film camera that emphasizes grain and texture.\n\nThe two individuals, appearing in the center and right of the frame, are walking side by side. They wear long coats and hats, indicative of a need to protect themselves from the environmental conditions, possibly wind and dust. Both of them are carrying items; the person on the left seems to be holding what looks like a camera, while the other might be holding a bag or a similar object.\n\nThe background is notable for its lack of distinct features, obscured heavily by the dust or sand in the air. There are faint outlines of utility poles stretching into the distance, enhancing the feeling of a desolate, expansive space. The horizon is barely visible, blending almost seamlessly with the sky due to the dusty conditions. The muted, washed-out tones and visible particles in the air contribute to a sense of isolation and harshness of the environment.\n\nThe overall composition and atmosphere of the photo conjure a narrative of exploration or journey through an inhospitable landscape, with a strong focus on the resilience or purpose of the figures against a vast, unforgiving backdrop.","title":"Dust storm","placename":"Shiprock (N.M.)","location":"Shiprock, New Mexico","nn1":["544315","544089","545763","549037","544404","545415","548230","543842","553615","543382","545199","545575","543248","545592","545341","545751"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["dusty","wash","dust","air","harshness","mute","walk","particle","conditions","grain"]}
