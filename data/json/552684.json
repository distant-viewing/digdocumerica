{"path":"552684.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a man seated inside what appears to be a rustic, dimly lit workshop or home. The man, appearing middle-aged or older, is dressed in worn blue overalls over a denim shirt, with a dark cap on his head. His expression seems thoughtful or stern as he looks slightly upwards and away from the camera, providing a sense of contemplation or pause in his day.\n\nHe is seated on a metal chair with bent legs crossed, one boot-clad foot resting on the knee of the other leg, suggesting a casual, relaxed posture. The boots are distinctly designed with embroidered decorations, hinting at a personal style or cultural significance.\n\nThe immediate surroundings include various everyday items that give the room a lived-in feel. In the background, there's an open shelf stocked sparsely with several kitchen items, possibly jars and utensils, which contribute to the homey atmosphere. There's a small wooden table next to him, which holds newspapers, suggesting he may have been reading or sorting through them. Underneath this table, there are further indications of a workspace or storage area, including what looks like a storage box and an old, tarnished oil lamp.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the photograph is rather moody and reflective, accentuated by the natural light filtering through, which brightly illuminates his boots while leaving other parts of the frame in shadows. The setting, his attire, and the items around him paint a picture of a rural or traditional lifestyle, possibly depicting a moment of rest in a day filled with manual work or outdoor activities.","title":"De beque, like other small towns in the piceance basin, is barely maintaining itself.
