{"path":"545076.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a person on a beach engaged in an environmental clean-up activity. The individual, likely male, is dressed in practical outdoor attire consisting of navy blue boots, jeans, a striped t-shirt, and a dark vest. He wears a baseball cap and is using a long-handled shovel to scoop up dark sandy material, possibly oil or contaminated sand, into a bright red, wheeled container.\n\nThe setting is an expansive beach with a flat, reflective surface, possibly wet from a receding tide. The horizon is visible in the background with subtle, undulating waves and a faint sky that appears slightly overcast.\n\nTo the right of the person, thereâ€™s a small, square wooden platform supporting an object that looks like a small meter or gauge, potentially used for monitoring purposes.\n\nIn the far distance, barely discernible, are two figures walking along the beach. The environment suggests a serene, albeit affected, natural space requiring human intervention for clean-up or restoration. The overall atmosphere conveys a sense of quiet industry focused on environmental care.","title":"Robert Law, employee of the Quinault Indian Reservation, checks Quinault Beach razor clams monthly for size and quantity.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547530","547117","545077","547167","545080","552085","551421","552286","548191","552951","542655","555868","545032","555867","545663","542657"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["beach","restoration","gauge","meter","shovel","tide","monitoring","baseball","intervention","care"]}
