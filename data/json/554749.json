{"path":"554749.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph showcases a tranquil landscape scene centered around a calm lake. In the foreground, there are dark silhouettes of branches framing the scene on both the left and right sides, casting shadows and adding depth with their intricate branch patterns. These branches introduce a sense of enclosure around the serene water body.\n\nThe lake itself reflects the sky and the surrounding foliage with perfect symmetry, creating a mirror-like effect on the water's surface. This reflection includes vibrant autumn leaves in shades of red, orange, yellow, and green that are typical of a fall setting.\n\nOn the far shore of the lake, the dense foliage is interspersed with visible areas of sky, hinting at a slightly hilly terrain. This foliage is predominantly in autumn hues, signaling the season. The calmness of the lake suggests no wind, and the composition and lighting imply it might be either early morning or late afternoon, based on the softness of the light and the long shadows.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or man-made structures disrupting the natural beauty, offering a scene of pure, undisturbed nature. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and reflective, with a strong emphasis on the beauty of the natural environment during the autumn season.","title":"Hardwood forest and spruces are reflected in Twitchell Lake in the fall.","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554758","554757","554750","554751","554649","554753","554648","550746","554752","546963","554635","543611","554761","557493","551207","554737"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["autumn","lake","branch","foliage","season","symmetry","softness","disrupt","enclosure","introduce"]}
