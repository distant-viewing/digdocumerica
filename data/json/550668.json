{"path":"550668.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph is an industrial scene featuring a lumber facility, Milan Industries, Inc., set against a countryside backdrop. In the foreground, extensive stacks of lumber are arranged tidily, their golden hues contrasting against the more muted colors of the environment. Large printed signs on the facility buildings indicate the name and nature of the business, along with a telephone number.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a towering wooden structure, likely a kiln or similar apparatus, emits a plume of steam or smoke, drifting towards the cloudy sky. This focal element suggests the ongoing processing activities within the plant. Structures with metal roofs, presumably warehouses or production areas, are visible, lending a functional and utilitarian feel to the scene.\n\nBehind these installations, the setting shifts to a more natural landscape, featuring dense forests of coniferous trees stretching across rolling hills, which recede into a hazy distance, possibly indicating the rural or semi-wilderness location of this industry.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a working industrial scene nestled within a natural environment, illustrating the interface between human enterprise and nature.","title":"Oldest industrial plant on the androscoggin river--the lumber mill at milan","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["546236","542584","542860","542945","543749","550349","545260","552162","545256","542942","542944","552140","542941","543009","552163","543489"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["lumber","enterprise","drift","roofs","interface","telephone","countryside","rural","recede","facility"]}
