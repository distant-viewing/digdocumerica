{"path":"552970.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban scene in a dimly lit alley or back courtyard surrounded by brick buildings. Two people, who appear young, are sitting against a worn, red brick wall near the foreground of the image. One individual is wearing a green shirt and pants, with their head tilted down, possibly hiding their face or looking at something on the ground. The other person, sitting close by, is wearing a dark tank top and pants, with their focus directed towards what they have in their hands.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple layers of brick buildings displaying different degrees of wear and age. Two more individuals are seen on an iron balcony, engaged in a conversation or looking out towards the alley. To the right of the scene, a window set in the brick wall shows a tattered curtain and some graffiti on the exterior wall below it.\n\nNear the seated individuals, there's a small, square table that seems to be worn and abandoned. Various pieces of debris and litter are scattered in the courtyard, intensifying the atmosphere of neglect and urban decay. The scene conveys a sense of quiet, everyday life amidst a setting that suggests economic hardship or neglect.","title":"The Chicano area, or Second Ward, is slowly giving way to urban renewal.
