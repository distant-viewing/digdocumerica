{"path":"553739.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a busy industrial port scene. In the foreground, there are multiple large pipes, painted yellow with red end caps, stacked horizontally on the ground. Some of these pipes rest in wooden supports to keep them organized and secure. To the left side, a small wheeled forklift, painted brownish-red, is visible. It's positioned near these pipes but is not actively engaging with them.\n\nThe middle ground of the image is dominated by a large crane. This crane is intricately constructed with visible cabling and steel framework, painted in white or a very light color dirty due to industrial activity. The crane is actively hoisting a bundle of similar yellow pipes, secured together, suggesting the transfer of these materials to or from a ship.\n\nThe background features a partial view of a ship named \"Hawaiian Enterprise\" docked at the port. The ship has a large white hull with docking structures and various equipment visible. Above the scene, the sky is vivid blue with minimal cloud cover, indicating clear weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition and activity in the photograph convey a dynamic industrial operation, primarily involved in the handling and shipping of large cylindrical materials, under a clear sky in a port environment.","title":"Unloading pipes from ocean liner.
