{"path":"543104.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a slightly neglected rural setting with a strong natural presence and minimal human activity evident. In the foreground, tilted prominently into view, is an old, weather-worn road sign pointing in two directions. It bears the inscriptions \"KINGSLEY\" and \"PRIGMORE,\" suggesting possible names of local roads or destinations. The signpost itself is bent to one side, indicating age or damage, possibly from the elements or an impact.\n\nThe background features a grassy field overgrown with wild plants and sporadic shrubbery. Notably, there are a few scattered trees that contribute to the scene's rural character. To the left stands a robust, full tree providing a contrast to a stark, barren tree on the right that appears dead, its bare branches reaching skyward. This juxtaposition perhaps emphasizes the uncultivated and varied nature of the environment.\n\nFurther enhancing the rural feel of the image, beyond the grass and trees, are some indistinct structures â€“ possibly elements of a distant fence or another form of minimal, man-made boundary. The sky above is mostly clear but has mild cloudiness, adding a dynamic element to the atmosphere of the scene. The natural lighting suggests it might be midday or early afternoon.\n\nOverall, the composition gives the impression of an isolated, tranquil location, largely untouched by modern infrastructure, with the signpost serving as a poignant symbol of human presence and direction within a vast natural landscape.","title":"Pacific dunes subdivision","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["547522","544262","547782","547049","555435","549156","556943","556313","549182","552516","544245","555818","552515","549235","548248","554803"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["signpost","direction","tilte","inscription","bent","isolated","poignant","symbol","shrubbery","tree"]}
