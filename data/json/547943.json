{"path":"547943.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a picturesque scene at a shore, probably taken during the mid-20th century given the quality and aesthetic of the image. A man is captured walking on a sandy beach along the edge where gentle waves meet the shore. He is moving toward the left side of the frame, wearing a dark shirt, pants, and appears to be in a relaxed but purposeful stride, possibly enjoying a solitary walk or deep in thought.\n\nThe beach curves gently into the distance, bordered by a calm body of water that gleams under a bright, sunny sky with few clouds. The shoreline on the right stretches far into the horizon, suggesting a spacious and tranquil environment. The ground is scattered with small debris and seaweed, indicative of a natural and somewhat undeveloped beach area.\n\nThe upper right corner shows a distant view of what appears to be a sparse landscape that might include dunes or low vegetation, enhancing the sense of an isolated coastal location. The color tones of the image, with its blues, browns, and hints of purple, give it a serene yet somewhat nostalgic feel. Overall, the photo captures the essence of solitude and the beauty of a quiet seaside setting.","title":"Beach at Great Kills Park on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543293","546953","547600","547607","547612","557509","543078","550826","545195","543244","555402","548088","543237","548051","546970","543287"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","shore","seaweed","seaside","gleam","dune","stride","walk","thought","purple"]}
