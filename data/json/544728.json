{"path":"544728.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and visually striking sunset scene over an expansive rail yard. The sun, in a large, clear, and spherical form, hangs low in the sky, casting an intense orange and yellow light that bathes the entire scene. This light sharply outlines and highlights multiple parallel railway tracks that dominate the foreground. These tracks gleam with reflected sunlight, leading the viewer's eye toward the horizon.\n\nIn the middle ground, there are silhouettes of various rail yard structures and equipment, including stacked freight containers and possibly small buildings or machinery, all dark against the bright backdrop. Overhead lines, likely for electrical power, intersect above the rail yard adding a linear and technical element to the composition.\n\nIn the distance, a complex bridge structure, possibly a steel truss bridge, stretches across the frame. This bridge, along with a few sparse clouds in the sky, adds depth and a feeling of expansiveness to the photograph. The overall mood is one of industrial grandeur, emphasized by the low angle of the sun which adds a warm, almost mystical quality to the lighting. The setting is devoid of any visible human presence, focusing instead on the interplay of natural light and industrial elements. The photograph provides a strong sense of place and time, capturing a moment of tranquility in a typically bustling environment.","title":"Sunset over rail yards","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["544732","544724","547711","556004","549096","547714","545418","545022","558140","548851","545430","544707","550304","545541","547140","551956"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["rail","yard","bridge","track","gleam","sun","expansiveness","truss","freight","linear"]}
