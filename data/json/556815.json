{"path":"556815.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts a bustling underground train station filled with people. The scene suggests a busy, perhaps rush hour time, as numerous individuals are seen walking or standing in various directions, seemingly engaged in their commutes.\n\nThe setting features classic architectural elements indicative of older subway stations, including ornate columns that support the ceiling which has multiple beams running across it. These structural elements are painted white, contrasting with the darker hues of the surroundings. The ceiling is lined with fluorescent light tubes that cast a stark, artificial light on the commuters below.\n\nThe people captured in the photograph display a variety of fashions, suggesting this photo was likely taken several decades ago. Men are seen wearing suits, some with neckties and formal trousers, and women are dressed in dresses, skirts, and blouses - typical of mid-20th century fashion. Everyone appears to be adults, busy with their routines.\n\nTo the right of the frame, there is a cluster of food and drink concession stands under bright, commercial signage. One prominent sign reads \"Frankfurters,\" highlighting the availability of quick meals for commuters on the go. The slightly blurred movement of a few individuals suggests the motion of walking, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise still environment.\n\nThe flooring is plain, likely constructed from tiles or polished stone, reflecting the practicality and durability required for a high-traffic area. Overall, the composition of the image captures the essence of daily city life and public transit usage during a bygone era.","title":"Passengers waiting for Lexington avenue line subway trains operated by the New York city transit authority.  The 232-mile system is the longest in the world and is of crucial importance to the city.  In 1970 it carried 2.1 million persons daily which amounts to 47 percent of the work force.  Despite this importance, New York city voters have refused to authorize new funds for more improvements or to allow the 35-cent fare to be raised to cover operating costs","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["556818","556821","551886","551883","551887","556819","551894","556823","556697","556682","551890","556650","556774","556779","556686","551895"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["commuter","ceiling","station","polish","practicality","availability","commute","flooring","otherwise","tile"]}
