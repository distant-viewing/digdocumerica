{"path":"542730.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an agricultural landscape, showcasing a variety of fields and vegetation, interlaced by a winding river and roads. The picture captures the river cutting through the middle, surrounded by lush, dense tree lines on both banks. In the surrounding areas, there are multiple plots of croplands, each marked by different stages of growth and types of crops, giving a patchwork appearance when viewed from above.\n\nThe fields are distinctly organized; some appear freshly plowed while others are dense with crops. The patterns and alignments of the fields suggest meticulous agricultural planning, likely aimed at optimizing land use and possibly irrigation, as inferred from the presence of the river and its proximity to the fields. On the far left, a long, straight dirt road runs parallel to one set of fields, seemingly providing access to this cultivated land.\n\nThe surrounding vegetation is varied, with areas of denser, possibly older growth and others that look like they are part of managed farms. The color contrasts between different areas highlight the diversity in vegetation and uses of landâ€”from farming to natural vegetation along the riverbank.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph with the river centrally positioned and the surrounding orderly cultivated plots reveal a landscape that blends natural and managed environmental elements effectively illustrating a dynamic rural setting.","title":"Irrigation canal serves citrus ranch","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542713","549260","558414","553668","549081","553661","547995","552858","547724","542708","558044","550392","548817","548908","554027","544768"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["field","plot","river","crop","land","growth","vegetation","managed","infer","cultivated"]}
