{"path":"552384.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a young man engaged in working with a large, oversized plastic bag, which appears to be semi-transparent and possibly designed for containing or protecting scientific or sensitive materials. The individual, likely in his twenties, has short, light-colored hair and is dressed in a light blue lab coat over a darker blue shirt and a patterned tie, along with dark pants. \n\nHe is meticulously examining or preparing the bag with both hands, focusing intently on his task. The setting suggests an indoor, possibly laboratory or storage environment, as indicated by the institutional-looking walls, a metallic door in the background, and a hanging sign visible on the left side that reads \"NO PARKING ANY TIME\". There are some pieces of equipment or fittings hanging from the ceiling that are possibly part of a mechanism or pulley system to support the weight of the bag or its contents.\n\nThe background of the image shows a plain floor, light-colored walls, and wooden cabinetry or paneling that adds a utilitarian feel to the surroundings, hinting that this might be a working area related to scientific research, industrial work, or academic activity.","title":"Los Angeles Reactive Pollutant Program (LARPP), a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the Coordinating Research Council, a government-industry research group","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["555254","552385","546278","549608","555258","546287","543797","546284","551594","546328","549364","555251","546277","555280","546285","542664"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["bag","pulley","fitting","twenty","work","hang","paneling","weight","lab","wall"]}
