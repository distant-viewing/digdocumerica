{"path":"547738.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph is a silhouette shot taken during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, giving the sky a gradient of purple and dark blue hues. Two children are featured prominently in the left half of the image. The older child is standing with a stance that suggests they are throwing something, perhaps a stone or a frisbee, captured in a moment of playful motion. The younger child is standing a short distance behind, seemingly watching the action. Neither child's features are distinguishable due to the backlighting, contributing to their silhouette effect.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a partially collapsed or dilapidated structure, which appears to be an old barn or farm shed. The building's silhouette against the sky shows that parts of the roof and some walls are missing, indicating decay or abandonment.\n\nThe scene overall evokes a serene, quiet mood, possibly in a rural setting, where the vastness and openness of the space around the children and the building can be inferred. This setting and the activities suggest a moment of simple, rural life, possibly capturing the children in a spontaneous playtime in their natural environment. The absence of modern elements helps emphasize a timeless, classic feel in the composition.","title":"Farm youngsters playing at sunset near their home in Ripley","placename":"Palo Verde Valley (Calif.)","location":"Palo Verde Valley, California","nn1":["549642","547293","545400","556166","547716","548222","547193","544183","546021","552226","552331","544187","557987","552220","547292","554072"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","silhouette","backlighting","stance","openness","half","shed","sunrise","barn","absence"]}
