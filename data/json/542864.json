{"path":"542864.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a man standing on a large tree stump in a cleared forest area, conveying a sense of environmental destruction or logging. The man, wearing casual attire with a light-colored shirt and pants, gazes into the distance, appearing contemplative or concerned. His shadow is cast sharply on the stump, indicating bright and direct sunlight.\n\nThe background shows a stark landscape primarily devoid of foliage, with just a few tall trees standing in the distance against a clear sky. The ground around the man is littered with debris from felled trees, including branches and wood chips, highlighting the aftermath of tree-clearing activities. The overall mood set by the composition feels somber and reflective, emphasizing the impact of human activity on natural forests.","title":"Indiscriminate logging has desTroyed timber on slopes of the Redwood Creek watershed, causing silting and erosion damage.","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542938","545258","550348","553611","557590","555092","555150","542771","555098","555136","542865","555208","553468","553584","545060","555107"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["stump","chip","forest","destruction","logging","tree","aftermath","clearing","man","distance"]}
