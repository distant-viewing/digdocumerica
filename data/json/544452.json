{"path":"544452.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph shows a suburban neighborhood situated on a hilly area. The image prominently features several mid-20th century vehicles parked in the foreground, including sedans and station wagons, which suggest a timeframe possibly around the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nThe mid-ground and background are dominated by residential buildings with modern architectural styles indicative of the mid-20th century. These homes have flat or slightly sloping roofs, large windows, and are mostly one or two stories tall. Their design entails a mix of rectangular forms with some homes having extended carports.\n\nThe neighborhood seems lush, with many trees dispersed among the homes, providing ample greenery in the environment. The buildings are set on varying levels of the hillside, with roads winding up the terrain, connecting the homes. Some undeveloped patches of land and dirt roads can also be seen, suggesting either ongoing construction or less developed areas.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, hinting at a fair weather day. Utility poles and lines are visible towards the front of the image, indicating the residential nature and infrastructure setup typical for such a community during that era.","title":"Lakeway development","placename":"Travis, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Travis, Lake, Texas","nn1":["547859","551102","557428","557840","550994","556601","545419","557427","547433","551021","556435","556395","553704","557365","557288","553929"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["home","neighborhood","roads","timeframe","sloping","century","developed","disperse","wagon","hom"]}
