{"path":"555921.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of four young boys in an outdoor, grassy area, seemingly engaged in playful activities. The mood is lively and playful, captured in a candid manner.\n\nIn the foreground, one boy is seen from the back. He is shirtless and wearing light-colored pants. To his right, three other boys are facing the camera. The first boy in the group is holding a baseball bat, shirtless, and sporting a broad smile. Next to him is a boy wearing a red bandana on his head, also shirtless and grinning. The third boy in this group stands out with his Afro hairstyle and is wearing a patterned shirt with sleeves rolled up to the elbows and beige-colored pants.\n\nThe setting includes a lawn area with a road and blurred cars in the background, suggesting this might be in a suburban neighborhood. The lighting seems to be of a late afternoon or early evening, creating a soft and slightly dim ambiance. The image captures a moment of youth, camaraderie, and casual recreation, typical of a warm day.","title":"Puerto rican boys playing softball in Brooklyn's hiland park in New York city.
