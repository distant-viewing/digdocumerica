{"path":"549921.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban scene, depicting various people boarding a city bus. The bus, marked with the route numbers R10X, is headed to Castleton Avenue and Jewett Avenue. It features a blue color scheme with a front advertisement display for The Green Point Savings Bank.\n\nIn the foreground, several passengers are seen in the midst of boarding or waiting to board the bus. Most of the individuals are women, dressed in casual and work attire typical of the era which suggests the 1970s or 1980s based on the clothing styles and the bus design. Their outfits include dresses, coats, and skirts, in a variety of colors and patterns. A man is also visible near the front door of the bus, dressed in a light-colored shirt and dark pants.\n\nThe bus driver is partially visible through the windshield, and another man in casual wear stands near the door of the bus, possibly waiting his turn to board.\n\nThe setting appears to be a city street during daytime with bright sunlight casting shadows on the pavement. There are trees and a modern-looking building in the background, adding to the urban environment. The photograph conveys a sense of everyday city life, emphasizing the common routine of public transportation.","title":"Boarding a bus in the finance district of lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546605","546735","546655","556786","549891","553796","556809","556203","556793","556804","546604","556794","545385","546592","547195","556748"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["bus","board","wait","city","boarding","door","caste","windshield","individuals","routine"]}
