{"path":"550223.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a coastal scene featuring a large body of water, likely an ocean or a large lake, under overcast skies. The foreground prominently displays a warning sign that is planted on a pebbly and debris-strewn shore. The sign reads \"NO SWIMMING ALLOWED WATER POLLUTED NO LIFE GUARD ON DUTY\" and includes identification at the bottom as being under the jurisdiction of the \"City of Rocky River\" and \"Cuyahoga County Board of Health.\"\n\nThe water appears somewhat turbulent, with waves breaking near the shore, suggesting windy conditions. The overall tone of the image is somewhat dim due to the lighting, implying either an overcast day or the photograph being taken during dawn or dusk. The background is comprised almost entirely of the expansive water body, fading into a hazy horizon line that blends with the cloudy sky. There are no visible structures or people; the image evokes a sense of isolation and environmental caution.","title":"Lake--beach--no swimming","placename":"Rocky River (Ohio)","location":"Rocky River, Ohio","nn1":["553860","550276","550272","550280","550688","553861","547836","544971","545014","553859","547992","548741","547493","548063","542984","550215"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["shore","guard","caution","identification","warning","comprise","strew","dawn","sign","allow"]}
