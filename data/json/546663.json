{"path":"546663.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a city street featuring a police officer and a male motorist. The officer is standing beside the driver's side of a blue sedan. We see the officer from the back, dressed in a light-colored uniform shirt and dark pants, accessorized with a black belt equipped with various items including a holster, possibly containing a gun.\n\nThe male motorist is seated inside the car and is visible through the open window. He appears to be speaking to the officer, and his expression suggests a degree of concern or attentiveness. He has a clean-shaven face and is wearing a dark shirt or jacket.\n\nThe setting seems to be an urban environment, implied by the appearance of buildings and a street in the background, which is slightly out of focus, drawing the viewer's attention primarily to the interaction between the officer and the motorist. There is a tranquil atmosphere with no apparent signs of distress or urgency in the interaction, suggesting a routine stop or a casual conversation. The overall mood of the image is somber, enhanced by the muted colors and overcast lighting.","title":"Driver gets ticket for running a red light","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546611","546654","546661","546637","546657","557868","546634","546633","557841","551941","546647","546658","557872","546631","557865","546680"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["officer","male","gun","distress","attentiveness","urgency","degree","accessorize","police","street"]}
