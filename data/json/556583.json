{"path":"556583.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a scene that juxtaposes youthful play with industrial activity. In the foreground, a young boy wearing casual clothing (a light-colored t-shirt, dark pants, and a red baseball cap) is engaged in the act of playing baseball, swinging a bat towards an unseen ball. The boy's dynamic postures suggest action and movement, and he is prominently placed close to the right edge of the frame. \n\nThe background presents a stark contrast, showing an industrial mining landscape. Large piles of coal dominate the middle ground, with various trucks and machinery interspersed throughout the site, indicating ongoing mining operations. There are also several structures resembling storage or processing facilities connected by a network of tracks and roads that wind through the area. This environment is largely devoid of vegetation, characterized by dark, earthy tones that highlight the industrial nature of the site.\n\nTo the left of the image, two large, cylindrical, metal tanks frame the scene, and the sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffuse light across the area. The overall composition of this photograph uses the playful foreground activity to create a poignant contrast against the industrial backdrop, invoking themes of youth, environment, and industrialization.","title":"Youngster takes a hefty swing at a ball while playing in the equipment yard of a coal company (seen in background) at Beckley, West Virginia.
