{"path":"555815.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene inside a large facility, likely a factory or plant. The space is dominated by two massive cylindrical tanks, which are painted in a dark green hue. These tanks are equipped with various attachments including pipes and bolted flanges, indicating their use in processing or storage within an industrial operation.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a worker wearing a typical blue work uniform and a white safety helmet. He appears to be inspecting or operating the equipment, standing on a metal platform that gives him access to the mid-section of the tank. He is holding onto a stair railing, suggesting the platform may extend or lead to other levels within the facility.\n\nThe background and surrounding area include large windows that allow natural light to filter into the otherwise dimly lit space. Metal beams and supports are visible, enhancing the industrial vibe of the setting. Above the tanks, the ceiling is obscured by shadows, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the machinery and worker. The overall composition presents a snapshot of daily operations in an industrial environment, highlighting the scale of machinery relative to human workers and the importance of safety gear in such settings.","title":"Sludge incinerator at the Somerset Raritan Valley Sewage Treatment Plant in the metropolitan New York area.
