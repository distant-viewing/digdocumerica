{"path":"544213.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly man engaged in an activity outdoors. He sits on a background of small, white gravel stones, which cover the ground entirely and lend a rough texture to the scene. The man is shirtless, showcasing his aging skin, and wears a plaid patterned sarong wrapped around his waist.\n\nHe is positioned near a simple, wooden slatted chair with a peeled-off blue paint, giving it a weathered look that corresponds with the rustic setting. A backdrop of a blue house with a white-framed window is evident behind him, suggesting he might be in a tropical or warmer climate area.\n\nFocused on his task, the man is manipulating shells on a wooden board game, known as mancala. His expression shows concentration and perhaps a faint trace of enjoyment or contentment. Nearby, there is a cardboard box visibly labeled \"Product of Company,\" partly filled with similar shells, indicating his use of them in the game.\n\nThis setting and scenario project a peaceful, traditional way of spending time, deeply rooted in the cultural pastimes specific to his environment.","title":"Fisherman of Bayou Gauche sorts shellfish catch","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557115","553090","546155","552628","556219","556489","552871","558320","554523","548609","548564","553291","544232","558191","555532","548458"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["shell","game","contentment","waist","manipulate","root","trace","cardboard","wrap","skin"]}
