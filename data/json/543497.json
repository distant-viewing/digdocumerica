{"path":"543497.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"In this photograph, an adult male is depicted riding a classic bicycle. The scene captures a serene, natural outdoor setting during what appears to be early morning or late afternoon, evident from the soft, diffuse lighting. The man is positioned in profile, facing left, and is silhouetted against a slightly hazy background that suggests a coastal environment. He wears casual clothing: a jacket and pants, suitable for a leisurely ride.\n\nThe bicycle is equipped with a front basket, suggesting readiness for a utilitarian or leisurely trip, possibly involving light errands or exploration. The setting includes shrubby vegetation in the foreground, hinting at a rugged terrain, typical of a coastal area. In the background, there are more pronounced landforms, possibly dunes or cliffs, as well as glimpses of what might be a water body, suggesting proximity to a beach or lagoon.\n\nThe atmosphere is tranquil and suggests a moment of peaceful solitude in nature. Overall, this image has a timeless quality to it, emphasizing a simple, perhaps contemplative experience of riding through a scenic environment.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["548531","547389","557535","557990","546956","547241","551970","544967","550073","547748","547158","548690","555433","545282","555501","547032"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["ride","bicycle","lagoon","pronounced","readiness","dune","landform","basket","facing","trip"]}
