{"path":"548802.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph features a vintage red Volkswagen camper van with its roof extended upwards, suggesting it is equipped with a pop-top for camping. The van is parked on a rugged ground with patches of grass and dirt, possibly near a coastal or lakeside setting. In the background, another car, which appears to be a light-colored station wagon, is also parked near the van.\n\nThe setting indicates a leisurely or recreational environment, potentially a popular spot for camping or picnicking given its proximity to water, visible as a calm blue expanse behind the vehicles. The sky is partly cloudy with more clouds gathering at the horizon, creating a serene yet slightly moody atmosphere.\n\nTo the side and slight forefront, an indistinct blur, possibly an artifact or reflection in the photo, is visible, which does not significantly detract from the main subjectsâ€”the vehicles and the natural environment surrounding them. Overall, the image captures a sense of outdoor adventure and relaxation, typical of road trips or short-term getaways using such camper vans.","title":"Beach at little duck key.
