{"path":"552512.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph displays an outdoor scene featuring an old brick wall, heavily weathered, with faded and peeling paint. Much of the faded paint spells out partial, indistinct words, adding a strong urban decay aesthetic. Against the wall, there is a collection of wooden crates containing glass bottles, presumably soda bottles given the distinctly visible Pepsi logos.\n\nThe crates are arranged in an asymmetrical order, some stacked atop others. Among them are Pepsi, Nesbitt and Coca-Cola brands that can be partially seen—indicating a sort of makeshift outdoor storage or display like one might find behind a store or in a recycling area. A few small plants/weeds sprout from the ground near the crates, and there appears to be a wooden board lying on the ground to the right side of the composition.\n\nAbove the crates, a small, single window—unadorned and functional—is visible on the left side of the brick wall, adding a touch of symmetry against the chaotic stack of crates and empties below. The environment suggests an area not frequently maintained, echoing a sense of neglect or abandonment.","title":"General store wall in browning","placename":"Springfield (Ill.)","location":"Springfield, Illinois","nn1":["552529","547506","544081","556631","546051","556640","549786","550264","544830","551330","543330","544831","553506","552457","547894","552102"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["crate","bottle","wall","stack","sprout","spell","crates","brick","soda","echo"]}
