The background of the photograph is softly focused, but it is possible to discern details like trees and parts of other vehicles, suggesting that the setting might be a street or a similarly open public space.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of solemnity and tradition, highlighted by the detailed and striking uniform worn by the man. The ceremonial elements and military-inspired attire suggest an event or duty of significant formal importance.","title":"Member of the New Ulm battery, a heritage of the german community of New Ulm, Minnesota.  The battery was formed as a self defense measure after the great sioux uprising in 1862.  Indians never attacked again, and the unit now serves only a ceremonial function with cannon salutes on holidays.  Uniforms were copied from that of a civil war officer in New Ulm, 2nd lt.  Richard fischer, who returned home in time for the indian attack.  He became the battery's first commander when it was formed","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558278","558270","558279","549730","556285","558271","557059","553712","556275","556246","555965","558272","553090","557797","551915","549703"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["insignia","uniform","inspire","gold","board","shoulder","cord","affiliation","tailor","solemnity"]}
