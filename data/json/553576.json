{"path":"553576.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a striking upward view of a dense forest predominantly comprised of tall, slender trees, capturing a dramatic perspective from the forest floor towards the sky. The sky, visible through the dense canopy of branches and leaves, appears as patches of deep blue, contrasting starkly with the shadowed trunks and branches. The central focus is a particularly tall and somewhat weathered tree that stretches up from the center of the composition toward the heavens, noticeably more weathered and devoid of leaves compared to its neighbors, hinting at its age and possible damage.\n\nThe trees around it are densely packed, with thin, straight trunks that largely lack branches until higher up where they explode into a network of thinner, intricate branches sprawling outward. These branches are less leafy, suggesting a season where trees are not in full bloomâ€” possibly autumn or winter. The trunks have a dark tone, possibly due to the low light conditions or the natural coloring of the bark, intensifying the mood of the photograph. The use of natural light filtered through the treetops creates an interplay of light and shadow, adding to the ethereal, almost mystical quality of the scene. This view emphasizes the towering nature and grandiosity of the forest, evoking a sense of awe and the smallness of the viewer in comparison to the natural world.","title":"In August 1973, a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora scene within the section of the burn area known as \"Granite Fire.\" This part of the territory has not yet been logged.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["543442","542569","542725","553574","548686","542930","555120","553575","554967","550791","546947","543445","553579","548744","555114","548685"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["branch","trunk","forest","neighbor","comparison","intensify","coloring","awe","leave","sprawl"]}
