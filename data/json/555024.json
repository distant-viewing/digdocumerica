{"path":"555024.jpg","date":"April 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a dense cluster of plants, specifically displaying an array of star-shaped flowers and spiky green leaves. The flowers have rich purple centers surrounded by lighter purple petals, fading out to a tan or light brown at the pointed tips. These blooms are tightly packed together, creating a beautiful, textured pattern across the image. Zestful green leaves, pointy and thin, emerge sporadically between the flowers, providing a vibrant contrast to the purple tones. The background is uniformly filled with these blossoms and leaves, without any distinguishable objects or different backdrops visible. The overall impression is of a lush, floral tapestry, likely documenting a natural or garden setting with a focus entirely on the plant details. There is a rich interplay of color and form, making the composition vibrant and engaging.","title":"Dry ground moss cover in a Douglas fir forest in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["547613","545707","558075","545708","542970","553366","555036","550793","554587","545695","554575","550462","550794","543205","554595","544875"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","leave","blossom","tip","tapestry","star","petal","bloom","plant","garden"]}
