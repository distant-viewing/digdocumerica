{"path":"543015.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal area, captured with what appears to be an early morning or late afternoon light due to the long shadows and soft lighting. The main focus is on a intricately organized network of roads and lots, which suggests a development, possibly for residential or commercial use. The grid layout of the roads ranges from highly structured blocks near the bottom of the image to more irregular shapes as the roads extend farther away.\n\nOn the right side of the image is a coastline, with the waves gently lapping against the shore, visible through the shimmering reflections of sunlight on the water. The sea stretches horizontally across the image, complementing the vertically stretching land grid.\n\nThe terrain itself is a blend of various colors, indicating different types of vegetation or soil - patches of dark green likely represent areas with denser vegetation, while lighter, more muted colors might suggest sandy or less fertile soils.\n\nThere are also small bodies of water visible within the land area, reflecting light and adding to the environmental diversity displayed in the image.\n\nOverall, the image captures a contrast between natural landscapes (the coastline and vegetation) and human impact (the grid-like road development), illustrating the intersection of nature and human planning.","title":"Pacific Shores Development on Lake Earl, one of three principal migratory bird stop and feed areas on the Pacific Coast","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["548643","547508","557452","557504","543427","557451","547629","548636","548779","557453","545918","553945","554156","554057","548629","543084"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["grid","road","coastline","soil","development","vegetation","land","stretch","planning","lap"]}
