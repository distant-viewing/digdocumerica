{"path":"558205.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Laur, George","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene from a school environment during what appears to be a sunny day. In the background stands a large two-story building prominently labeled as \"New Ulm Senior High School.\" The architecture of the school includes symmetric rows of windows and a minimalistic, rectangular design typical of many educational institutions. The color scheme of the building involves red bricks and white trim around the windows and doors.\n\nIn the foreground, a neatly maintained grass lawn sets the stage where several students are seen walking along a paved sidewalk that leads towards the school's main entrance. These students appear to be in casual clothing, suggesting the photo was taken during a regular school day.\n\nTo the right foreground, a man stands facing the school, perhaps observing the students or waiting for someone. He has his hands in his jacket pockets, and his posture is relaxed; he is dressed in a dark jacket and jeans, which along with his hairstyle, reflects typical casual attire of possibly the late 20th century.\n\nThe overall ambiance is peaceful and routine, with no extraordinary activities happening, just the daily flow of students likely between classes or at the start or end of the school day. The lighting suggests early morning or late afternoon, given the long shadows and soft, warm glow, which adds a nostalgic or serene quality to the scene.","title":"Students arriving for school at the senior high school in New Ulm, Minnesota. The town is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe. Several manufacturing firms have arrived since 1950 and have helped the community to grow. The business district was revitalized in the 1960's with community effort.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["557171","546522","546532","558241","558208","549626","558215","546461","546449","552507","552456","546456","546453","553818","558162","546452"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["school","student","institution","class","jacket","pocket","hairstyle","scheme","trim","day"]}
