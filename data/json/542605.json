{"path":"542605.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a wild, natural landscape, primarily composed of lush green coniferous trees visible in both the foreground and background. The central focus of the image is a bear seen standing on a narrow ledge of a deep, eroded gully with steep, rugged walls. This gully seems to cut through the wooded terrain, filled with loose, crumbly earth and sparse vegetation.\n\nThe image captures a moment in a serene yet wild environment, illustrating not only the rugged beauty of this forested area but also highlighting the presence of wildlife, in this case, the bear, navigating its natural habitat. The lighting appears to be natural, possibly filtered through the dense canopy overhead, casting soft shadows and contributing to the rich, textured details of both the landscape and the bear. The overall composition of the photo, with its vertical orientation, emphasizes the depth and steepness of the gully contrasted with the tall, straight forms of the trees.","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["545220","542599","543582","542733","555116","542753","558082","550536","554459","542791","542748","551367","554531","550791","550629","554978"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["gully","bear","case","orientation","erod","ledge","navigat","rug","wildlife","habitat"]}
