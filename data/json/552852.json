{"path":"552852.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The image shows an aerial view of a large body of water, seemingly a flooded area, with a single building and part of another structure submerged in the water. The main building visible is a house or large shack, whose roof and upper sections are the only parts not submerged. Adjacent to this building are two extended structures that appear to be sections of a walkway or dock, also partially submerged. \n\nThe water is relatively calm with a slight texture indicating mild current or wind. In the foreground, part of what looks like a submerged fence or power line is visible, which suggests the extent of flooding in this area. The surrounding region can't be seen, indicating that this photograph focuses solely on this flooded area, providing a clear and somewhat serene yet somber view of the effects of the flood on human-made structures. The tones in the image are mostly muted, with the dominant hues being the blues and grays of the water against the dull colors of the submersed architecture.","title":"In the spring of 1973, the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years. Unprecedented flooding occurred throughout the river basin. Particularly affected were the marsh area below New Orleans and the entire Atchafalaya River Basin. Only the roof of this farmhouse in the Jonesville area of the Atchafalaya Basin remains above water.","placename":"Alexandria (La.)","location":"Alexandria, Louisiana","nn1":["552849","552843","552857","547036","552436","547266","552848","552850","552851","552853","552845","552855","547077","552854","547212","552840"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["shack","extent","section","flood","current","part","water","walkway","wind","gray"]}
