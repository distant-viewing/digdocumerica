{"path":"545486.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene involving two individuals, likely in a medical or health-related setting. The primary focus is an elderly man and a younger woman standing beside him, possibly a nurse or a caretaker.\n\nThe elderly man, seated and shown from the side profile, is using a respiratory aid. He is holding a small, round green device with a white mouthpiece to his mouth, which is attached to a green flexible tube. His expression is serious and focused, and his age is apparent through visible wrinkles and age spots on his skin. He is wearing a light beige or tan shirt.\n\nStanding beside him and slightly in the background is a young woman, likely in her twenties or thirties, with a concerned or attentive expression. She has voluminous blonde hair styled in a manner reminiscent of the mid-20th-century beauty trends, specifically the 1960s or 70s. She is wearing a white uniform, suggesting she may be a medical professional or a nurse.\n\nThe background is minimal and nondescript, with a plain off-white wall which ensures the focus remains on the subjects. The overall mood of the photo is one of care and attention, highlighting the interaction between the caregiver and the patient in what appears to be a moment of medical treatment or health monitoring.","title":"Former machinist Mr. Wilbur Shuff uses a lung function testing machine to measure his breathing capacity.
