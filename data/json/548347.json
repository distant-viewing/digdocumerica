{"path":"548347.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a large city bordering a wide river. The view captures a densely built urban landscape characterized by numerous high-rise buildings, including some iconic skyscrapers that suggest this might be a well-known city. The river running through the image is busy with boat traffic, showcasing at least three ships that are moving along the water, creating visible wake trails behind them.\n\nOn the left side of the river, there are extensive industrial areas with warehouses and docks, indicating a commercial port presence. The river itself is a major waterway, broad and navigable, enhancing the city's role as a hub for commerce and transportation.\n\nThe overall tone of the image is somewhat subdued with overcast skies and a pale, almost melancholic light, which gives the scene a vintage or historical feel. The color saturation is low, possibly due to the age of the photograph or the atmospheric conditions when the picture was taken. The murky weather conditions add to the dramatic urban environment depicted.\n\nThis photo captures both the bustling activity of a major metropolitan area and a snapshot of its infrastructure and architectural grandeur. It emphasizes the city's scale and the vital role of the river in its economy.","title":"Photograph of the Hudson River with Manhattan on the left","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548320","548390","548407","548416","549814","551178","553865","555758","546690","553213","552715","548365","546669","551181","549825","548344"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["river","city","role","economy","commerce","wake","saturation","hub","port","condition"]}
