{"path":"555171.jpg","date":"September 1970","photographer":"","caption":"This image is a microscopic photograph showing a magnified view of plant cells. The cells are organized in a structured, grid-like pattern, with each cell appearing as an individual, elongated polygon. The cells vary slightly in shape and size but predominantly have an oblong or rectangular form.\n\nThe cell walls are clearly visible, highlighted by brighter lines, creating a network of interconnected compartments. Within each cell, you can see varying degrees of light and dark shading, which could indicate the presence of different cellular components or the thickness of the cell wall.\n\nThe photograph displays a high level of detail, capturing the texture and structure of the cellular layout. The colors in the image range between shades of purple, violet, and hints of white possibly due to staining techniques used to enhance the visibility of the cells under microscopic observation. The overall composition of the image is well-balanced, focusing uniformly across the entire field of view to provide a comprehensive look at the cellular structure of the plant material.","title":"Magnification of phloem or xylem tubes in Douglas fir wood taken through a microscope in New Westminster, British Columbia near Bellingham, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551616","555172","551615","551614","555837","555175","555173","557625","555176","555840","555022","545713","557582","557311","545707","555039"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["violet","thickness","degree","compartment","technique","wall","plant","observation","purple","grid"]}
