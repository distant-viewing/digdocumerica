{"path":"555840.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph appears to have been taken through a microscope, showcasing various microscopic particles or organisms against a deep blue background. The main features include:\n\n1. **Large circular object on the right side**: This is the most prominent feature, likely a microorganism or a cellular structure. It is almost completely translucent with a distinctive bright spot on one side, possibly reflecting some light source. The inside of the circle features some finer granular details, suggesting internal structures or contents.\n\n2. **Cloud-like formations**: There are two notable formations that resemble white clouds. One is at the top center and another towards the left side of the image. These formations are irregular in shape and have a fluffy appearance, which could be clusters of smaller particles or another type of microorganism.\n\n3. **Numerous small particles**: The background is speckled with countless tiny dots and particles spreading across the entire field of view. These could be suspended particulates, smaller cells, or chemical precipitates.\n\n4. **Overall composition**: The arrangement gives a sense of depth, with the larger forms appearing to be on different focal planes from the smaller particles. The dark blue background provides a stark contrast that highlights the forms and particles in the image.\n\nThis kind of image is typical in microbiological studies or biochemical experiments where microscopic agents are observed and analyzed. The details visible here depend heavily on the quality of the microscope and the technique used for preparing the slide.","title":"Fragment of a diatom, a coscinodiscus (upper left), detritus and bacteria photographed at the atlantic marine fisheries laboratory at Sandy Hook, New Jersey.
