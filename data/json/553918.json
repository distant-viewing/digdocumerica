{"path":"553918.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an exuberant moment of a mature woman engaged in what appears to be a celebratory or cultural event. Her arms are raised high, and her hands are open, adding to the expression of joy or exultation on her face. She is adorned in a brightly patterned red blouse with floral designs, enhancing the festive atmosphere of the moment.\n\nAdding to her traditional or cultural attire are multiple strands of lei around her neckâ€”these leis are made up of yellowish-white flowers, densely packed and draping heavily around her neck and extending down to her mid-waist. Her hair, though mostly obscured, is adorned with a cluster of pink-yellow flowers positioned on the left side of her head, giving a beautiful accent to her appearance.\n\nThe backdrop is indistinct due to the depth of field used, putting the focus intensely on her. This blurring effect isolates her emotionally charged expression and emphasizes her gestures, making the image a powerful portrayal of joy and cultural expression. The lighting in the photograph highlights her facial features and the textures of the leis, adding a vivid sense of realism to the scene.","title":"Hawaiian shows tourists how to do the hula dance.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553916","553708","553760","553917","553915","556150","553737","556134","553711","556151","553709","553178","556244","557157","556142","556143"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Religious Imagery"],"terms":["neck","joy","expression","realism","flower","strand","waist","portrayal","gesture","accent"]}
