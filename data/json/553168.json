{"path":"553168.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph depicts a young boy, likely in his early teens, standing in front of a wooden background, possibly a fence or wall. The boy is slightly turned to his left, with his face profiled, and a soft, content smile on his face. He has short, dark hair and is dressed in a black jacket adorned with white and purple diagonal stripes across the chest. Underneath, he appears to be wearing a blue shirt.\n\nThe young boy holds a small red container with a white label in his left hand, the specifics of which aren't clear, but it might be a beverage. His posture is relaxed and casual, contributing to the peaceful and contemplative atmosphere captured in the image.\n\nThe background consists of a wooden surface, providing a textured contrast to the smooth and simplistic clothing of the boy. Above this wooden structure, there is a glimpse of a green bush, which introduces a natural element and adds a bit of brightness and life to the composition. The lighting in the image is subtle, emphasizing the subject's facial features and the details on the jacket, while casting the rest in softer shadows, enhancing the tranquil and somewhat introspective mood of the photograph.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: a drink in hand","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["556606","553494","553170","543870","543476","553147","549299","553553","556138","558394","553505","544357","552744","556142","552942","545307"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["boy","teens","specifics","bush","jacket","beverage","introduce","softer","chest","face"]}
