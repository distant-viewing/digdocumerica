{"path":"543174.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene from an industrial setting, focusing primarily on a structure that appears to be part of a grain elevator or processing plant. In the forefront, there's a dark, wood-paneled building with a stark contrast between its faded black panels and some white metal parts that appear damaged or worn. A prominent feature on this building is a sign that reads \"STOP Trainmen must not operate beyond this point,\" indicating a safety protocol for workers. Attached to this building, there is a metal chute or conduit, possibly used for transporting materials.\n\nIn the background, more complex parts of the industrial plant are visible. This includes several large, metallic structures with cylindrical and conical shapes typical of industrial storage or processing tanks and silos. Some of these structures are topped with what look like fans or ventilation systems. The plant's multi-level nature is marked by stairs and platforms, suggesting access points for maintenance or operation.\n\nThe sky is clear and the lighting suggests it is either midday or early afternoon. No human figures or movement are noticeable in the image; the focus is entirely on the industrial equipment and buildings. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet industriousness, typical of such facilities likely involved in the processing or storage of agricultural products.","title":"California--Big Sur coastal area","placename":"Big Sur (Calif.)","location":"Big Sur, California","nn1":["547528","545992","558141","557387","554936","546752","545998","546122","545445","542705","543258","546085","553013","556390","557412","547014"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["plant","processing","elevator","industriousness","protocol","chute","fan","storage","conduit","ventilation"]}
