{"path":"548910.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking landscape during what seems to be either a sunset or sunrise. The scene is dominated by a spectacular view of a river system, which reflects the sun's light vividly, creating vibrant and shimmering paths of gold and silver on the water's surface. These water bodies are irregularly shaped, snaking through the landscape and surrounded by land contours that are silhouetted against the sky.\n\nThe top portion of the image shows the sky transitioning in colors from a deep blue to lighter, warmer hues of orange and yellow, suggesting the sun is positioned just below the horizon. The silhouette of jagged and uneven mountain ranges stretches across the background, adding a layer of depth and ruggedness to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition and ambient light give the photograph an ethereal quality. The contrasts between light and shadow, as well as the organic forms made by the natural landscape, create a serene and almost mystical atmosphere. This image emphasizes the beauty and tranquility of natural settings, highlighted by the gentle interplay of sunlight and water.","title":"Colorado River at sunrise--30 miles north of Yuma","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["553816","548909","548904","557447","554762","548182","548181","542994","552350","549446","550560","550562","557095","547731","552927","542653"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sun","gold","ruggedness","silver","sunrise","contour","light","system","orange","sunset"]}
