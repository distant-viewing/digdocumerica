{"path":"554725.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph beautifully captures the vibrancy of autumn with an up-close view of maple tree branches filled with richly colored leaves. The leaves are a brilliant red, with varying shades from deep burgundy to bright crimson, highlighted by sunlight that permeates some of the foliage and makes the colors even more vivid. The branches span across the image, creating a dense, textured canopy against a clear, deep blue sky. The contrast between the fiery red leaves and the azure sky adds to the striking visual impact of the image. The photo composition primarily focuses on the natural elements, emphasizing the change of season with the brilliant autumn colors.","title":"Red maple in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["554726","554727","554736","554730","558074","554735","554636","554737","546011","552693","557168","554751","554711","554758","554641","554637"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["leave","autumn","burgundy","branch","vibrancy","change","canopy","season","red","impact"]}
