{"path":"547649.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene dominated by a wide field of lush vegetation under an overcast sky. The field is filled with tall, dense greenery that includes various types of plants and wildflowers, which add subtle white accents to the verdant landscape.\n\nA solitary, towering tree stands prominently in the background slightly to the left. This tree has a somewhat sparse canopy, suggesting it may be in a transitional seasonal state or affected by the environment. Its branches stretch out widely, forming a striking silhouette against the gray, cloud-filled sky.\n\nThe horizon is lined by a dense thicket of shorter trees or shrubs, forming a natural boundary that encircles the field. The overall ambiance is quite somber due to the cloudy sky, which casts a diffused light over the scene, muting the colors and creating a calm, introspective mood.\n\nThe image likely depicts a natural, possibly rural setting, focusing on the beauty and tranquility of an everyday landscape. The absence of any human activity or artificial structures highlights the untouched and serene nature of the environment captured in the photograph.","title":"Pasture in tiverton on the sakonnet river east of Narragansett bay","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["552484","545040","549227","550667","557013","552541","549142","556990","550536","549158","550604","552520","555537","557099","551370","552903"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["field","thicket","encircle","mute","affect","wildflower","form","accent","absence","boundary"]}
