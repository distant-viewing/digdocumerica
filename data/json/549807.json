{"path":"549807.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a waste management facility or landfill. In the foreground, a yellow bulldozer equipped with tracks is actively pushing a large cart filled with heaps of trash, which appears to be mostly domestic waste given the mixture of materials visible. The cart is heavy and overloaded, marked with the number \"603.\"\n\nThe landscape around the bulldozer and cart is littered with vast amounts of garbage, extending far back into the scene. The surface under the trash appears uneven and rough. In the distance, the background reveals industrial buildings, including low-rise structures likely used for managing the landfill operations. Multiple cranes and other heavy machinery are visible, suggesting ongoing construction or expansion work.\n\nThe skyline is industrial, with tall smokestacks visible far back, suggesting that the landfill might be located near an industrial area. The scene is devoid of vegetation, reinforcing the stark, utilitarian nature of the setting. Notably, no people are visible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on the machinery and the environmental impact of the waste.","title":"The landfill at Staten Island exceeds its capacity.
