{"path":"556270.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph depicts a professional meeting or conference scene, probably from the 1970s or 1980s, based on the fashion and hairstyles observed. It takes place in a room with plain walls and ceiling, illuminated by fluorescent lights. The room features a long, rectangular conference table around which numerous participants are seated. The people, who appear to be a mix of men and women of various ages, are dressed in business attire. \n\nIn the foreground, a woman with a large, styled afro and glasses is seated, attentively reviewing some documents. She is dressed in a patterned blouse and has a pair of sunglasses and rolled up papers on the table in front of her. Adjacent to her, we see other participants, some of whom are also looking at papers or taking notes. A few individuals are visible in further detail: a man to her right is actively writing in a notebook and wearing a dark suit and tie; another older man, partially visible, is also focused on his papers. \n\nTowards the left side of the image, the focus fades slightly, indicating more participants, all of whom are engaged in similar activities such as writing or reading documents. Everyone is seemingly serious and focused on the task at hand, contributing to a sense of an important professional gathering or discussion. The overall atmosphere is subdued and formal, typical of a professional or governmental meeting environment of the time.","title":"Black members of the Chicago city council during a budget hearing in the fall of 1973","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557027","546299","556028","557704","552616","552617","548237","547284","547368","552618","555234","547407","555247","552387","547367","547365"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["participant","meeting","paper","document","room","table","afro","review","notebook","writing"]}
