{"path":"545422.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial scene at dusk, characterized by a dramatic skyline dominated by multiple smokestacks emitting thick, orange-tinged smoke against a darkening sky. This scene gives a stark visual representation of industrial pollution.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a gas station with a somewhat dated appearance, suggesting the photo might not be recent. The station has a large \"Parade\" sign featuring prices and promotions, and gas pumps that are visible under the stationâ€™s canopy. Adjacent to the price sign is another sign advertising \"Parade Super Wash.\" \n\nThe area around the station appears semi-urban with some sparse green foliage and asphalt surfaces, contrasting heavily with the industrial backdrop. The lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late evening, enhancing the orange and brown hues of the smoke and giving a moody overtone to the image.\n\nThis photograph might be exploring themes of environmental impact, the intersection of daily life with industry, or contrasting natural and man-made landscapes. The setting appears somewhat desolate and quiet, adding an element of loneliness or neglect to the urban environment depicted here.","title":"Fairfield plant of U.S. Steel operates 24 hours a day.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545426","544173","545425","551140","557381","545447","551033","545507","551054","550181","550175","545239","555737","546042","551030","547539"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["station","price","gas","promotion","smoke","sign","tinge","pump","asphalt","darken"]}
