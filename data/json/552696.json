{"path":"552696.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a camouflaged bird, possibly a nightjar, sitting on the ground in a natural environment. The bird’s plumage features a complex pattern of mottled browns, whites, and dark spots, providing excellent camouflage with the surrounding earthy tones.\n\nThe bird is positioned in profile to the left, with one eye visible, looking slightly upward. The background and foreground feature dry, cracked soil which enhances the impression that the bird is closely connected to the earth. There are small patches of sparse greenery nearby, which suggest this scene is set in a semi-arid or desert region.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph casts a warm tone over the scene, highlighting the textures of both the bird’s feathers and the rough ground. The focus is sharp on the bird, while the nearest parts of the ground are slightly softened, drawing attention to the bird as the main subject of the composition. The use of depth of field and natural lighting accentuates the bird's stealthy appearance in its environment.","title":"Along East Rifle Creek","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["549115","550387","555010","544489","547043","544547","548885","544477","557628","554601","557614","557495","557576","550471","550388","555011"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["bird","camouflage","plumage","feather","ground","profile","white","spot","tone","desert"]}
