{"path":"544932.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a wildlife scene featuring a porcupine in its natural habitat. The porcupine is nestled within a cavity of a tall tree, which appears to be a birch due to its characteristic white and rough bark texture. The image captures the tree with a multitude of thin, bare branches extending outward, indicating it is likely a cold season as there are no leaves on the branches. The setting gives a natural feel with a focus on the porcupine, which is partially visible as it occupies the dark hollow of the tree. The background of the sky is overcast, suggesting a possibly chilly or overcast day. The photo composition effectively uses the natural lines of the tree branches and the trunk to draw attention toward the porcupine, which is the main subject of this image.","title":"Porcupine in tree great sand dunes national monument","placename":"Colorado","location":"Colorado","nn1":["554599","558103","543595","554601","554989","543488","550472","550703","549226","542791","550468","555668","542605","558368","555116","544547"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["branch","birch","multitude","tree","bark","habitat","wildlife","nestle","trunk","season"]}
