{"path":"543325.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"In the photograph, three people are situated on a sandy beach setting up a windbreak. Two individuals stand holding opposite corners of a pink fabric, evidently struggling with the wind to keep it steady. The fabric is partially unfurled and fluttering. A third individual, a young child, is seated on the sand nearby, surrounded by several items that look like a cooler, a bag, and possibly other beach essentials.\n\nThe environment captures the essence of a sunny beach day, characterized by the sandy terrain and towering dune grass in the background. The dunes behind the individuals are covered with grass, indicating a natural beach habitat. The sky is strikingly clear and blue, suggesting good weather conditions.\n\nThe individuals are dressed in casual summer clothing, appropriate for a day at the beach. The scene captures a moment of active preparation and recreation, embodying a typical family or group outing at the beach.","title":"Sunbathers at little sun river","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["547974","543225","543534","547877","547873","543216","547009","547503","543499","543372","550243","544206","550932","556297","550936","555402"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","fabric","embody","struggle","cooler","dune","individual","out","individuals","towere"]}
