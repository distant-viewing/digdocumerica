{"path":"549432.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph depicts a dynamic maritime scene involving two types of vessels in contrasting settings. There is a sailboat and a large freighter close to each other on choppy blue water.\n\nThe sailboat, positioned on the left side of the image, is a striking red-hulled sloop under full sail. The boat is heeling significantly to the starboard side due to the strong wind, with its white sail taut and catching the breeze efficiently. Aboard the sailboat, several individuals in casual attire can be seen actively managing the boat, suggesting a scene of teamwork and navigation skill.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there’s a large, industrial-looking freighter painted in dark colors with a visible chimney marked with a large \"T\" on a white background, indicating the vessel's company or owner. The freighter appears substantial and sturdy, equipped with various structures on deck possibly for loading and unloading cargo.\n\nThe background of the scene is slightly overcast, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light. This setting gives the scene a somewhat muted yet dramatic atmosphere, emphasizing the contrasting aesthetics and functions of the sailboat’s recreational activity versus the freighter’s commercial operation.\n\nOverall, the composition beautifully captures the encounter between leisure and industrial maritime activities, highlighted by the contrasting sizes, colors, and purposes of the two vessels.","title":"Coming about on Chesapeake Bay in the early hours of the Annapolis-Newport Race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547452","552010","544717","544667","552347","549396","549394","549403","549426","547456","548513","549413","549404","548203","549421","547467"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sailboat","vessel","sail","encounter","owner","skill","unload","boat","teamwork","navigation"]}
