{"path":"543601.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene, predominantly bathed in cool, silhouetted tones. Two people are sitting on the sandy shore of a large lake. They appear relaxed, one person leaning back on their hands, the other sitting with knees up, possibly talking or enjoying the view. They are positioned on the left side of the image, creating a sense of intimacy and quiet contemplation.\n\nThe lake itself glistens with reflected light, the surface dotted with numerous bright spots suggesting either the sun's reflection or some floating objects. A long pier extends into the lake on the right, equipped with several benches and lamp posts, hinting at the pierâ€™s use for walks or fishing. The pier is in silhouette, which contrasts sharply with the bright reflections on the water.\n\nIn the background, densely wooded hills rise up, partially obscured by a haze that adds a sense of depth and distance to the landscape. The overall atmosphere is calm and peaceful, with a palette that suggests this scene takes place during early morning or late afternoon, where light is limited, possibly due to the angle of the sun or cloud cover.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["543951","545229","554477","553440","551280","557563","552319","553396","550299","543535","543579","551207","550822","552978","554760","554759"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["pier","lake","reflection","sun","intimacy","walk","lakeside","knee","lamp","bench"]}
