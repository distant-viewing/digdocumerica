{"path":"558211.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Rees, David","caption":"This photograph presents a high-angle view of a public, modern architectural structure possibly within a campus or a corporate setting. Two women are seated toward the center of the frame on a solid rectangular bench located in what appears to be an outdoor courtyard or a semi-enclosed plaza. The women are engaged in a conversation, with multiple books laid out on the bench between them, suggesting they may be students or colleagues taking a break or discussing their studies or work.\n\nThe setting is characterized by its strong geometric and minimalistic architecture. Large, bold square and rectangular columns support upper levels that frame the view, while ample natural light washes over the area. The floors are tiled with large square slabs, contributing to the orderly, grid-like aesthetic of the space. Shadows cast by the columns add a dynamic visual element to the scene.\n\nAbove, reflecting off the upper floors’ glass windows, are more shadows and reflections that depict the angular structures and open skies, adding a layered dimension to the composition of the image. The edges of the photograph suggest it was taken from behind a window, as evidenced by a slightly obscured view and smudges that frame the photograph’s edges.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures a quiet, reflective moment in a distinctly structured, urban educational or professional environment, emphasizing themes of study, discussion, and modern architecture.","title":"Students in the courtyard of senior high school at New Ulm Minnesota.
