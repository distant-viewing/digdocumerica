{"path":"550257.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in an urban environment showing deterioration and neglect. A man stands to the left side of the image, his body partially leaning against a brick wall. He is dressed in a light pink long-sleeve shirt, dark blue jeans, and brown leather shoes. He has glasses and his pose is relaxed, with one leg raised and resting on the brick barrier.\n\nThe environment around him is in a stark state of disrepair. He is standing next to a doorway that bears a bright yellow \"CONDEMNED\" sign, indicating the building is unfit for use. The interior visible through the door frame is dark and severely damaged, with debris and refuse strewn all around. The ground is littered with a variety of discarded items including boxes, bottles, papers, and other unidentified rubble.\n\nJust beside the man, the scene spills out with even more garbage covering the ground extensively, suggesting long-term abandonment and neglect of the property. A small portion of the sky is visible in the upper right corner of the image, contrasting the otherwise gloomy and cluttered scene. Overall, the photograph depicts a poignant contrast between the composed demeanor of the man and the chaotic decay surrounding him.","title":"Vacant and abandoned homes in inner city invite arson vandalism and dumping","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550253","552751","553506","553476","555897","549786","557351","550246","550129","545520","553555","552724","552748","556164","552457","557345"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["neglect","brick","deterioration","leather","discarded","spill","gloomy","pink","rubble","refuse"]}
