{"path":"550658.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and dynamic river scene. The river, appearing strong and wild, courses through a landscape surrounded by dense forests. The water is tumultuous and frothy, indicative of a rapid or section of white water, where the river's flow is accelerated by a descending gradient and obstructed by rocks and boulders.\n\nThe riverbanks are lined with lush green trees, suggesting a location that is rich in vegetation and likely secluded from urban developments, providing a natural and serene environment. These trees are densely packed, stretching toward the edges of the image, framing the river with shades of green and hints of shadow under a bright sky.\n\nIn the background, gentle hills or low mountains can be seen, rising against a clear sky. The mountains, covered with forests, add an additional layer of depth to the scene. The image captures a moment in nature that emphasizes the raw power and beauty of a river in a predominantly untouched setting.\n\nThe composition of the photograph is balanced between the rushing water in the foreground and the peaceful forestry and hills in the distance, creating a visual contrast between movement and stillness. The color palette features primarily natural greens and blues, enhancing the feeling of an undisturbed wilderness area.","title":"Magalloway River below Aziscohos Dam in the mountains of western Maine","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["553653","553855","550698","542743","549550","548156","553416","549442","550682","542537","544871","550742","550700","544861","542523","550605"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","obstruct","green","rush","course","forestry","mountain","forest","boulder","hill"]}
