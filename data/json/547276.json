{"path":"547276.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive, soft-textured, dark brown surface which is likely an area of water based on the reflection and ripples visible. At the top of the image, there is a small, white boat leaving a curved wake in the water, indicating its motion. The curvature of the wake suggests the boat has recently changed direction. The overall atmosphere of the image conveys a sense of isolation and tranquility, emphasized by the vast empty space around the boat. The lighting in the photograph is subtle and diffused, adding to the calm and serene mood of the scene. There are no other distinguishable features or objects in the background; it is a minimalist scene focused on the boat and its movement through the water.","title":"A small power boat makes a U-turn on the Potomac just above Mt.
