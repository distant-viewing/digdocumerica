{"path":"543791.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This image captures a serene, nostalgic moment of childhood. It features a young child, who appears to be a boy, climbing a large, sturdy tree. The boy is hugging the tree trunk tightly with both arms and has his face turned upwards, likely looking towards the top of the tree or the sky. He wears a striped sleeveless top and shorts, typical of warm-weather play attire.\n\nThe photograph is taken during what appears to be sunset, given the warm, golden light that bathes the scene and creates a silhouette effect on the child and parts of the tree. The setting is a rural one, indicated by the expanse of grass, a dirt path, and the glimpse of a simple, solitary building in the background. The sky is clear, adding to the peacefulness of the setting.\n\nThe composition utilizes the elements of nature effectively, with the sunlight filtering through branches dotted with spring or summer foliage. The tree's textured bark is a prominent feature, indicating its age and strength. The light also creates a lens flare effect, which adds a dreamlike quality to the overall atmosphere of the image.\n\nThis photograph evokes a sense of freedom and exploration, common to childhood experiences of playing outdoors in natural settings.","title":"Colorado--Nucla","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["549274","552035","550830","543688","551735","557410","548965","549642","544207","554099","542767","547188","543479","549674","545307","554423"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["childhood","boy","strength","tree","flare","child","effect","freedom","lens","peacefulness"]}
