{"path":"549823.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph presents a striking contrast between urban development and waste management challenges. In the foreground, there is a massive pile of trash dominating most of the view. This heap is composed of various discarded items like paper, plastic bags, and other refuse, suggesting a large-scale waste disposal or collection site.\n\nIn the background, contrasting sharply with the trash in the foreground, there are multiple high-rise buildings, densely packed and rising many stories high. These buildings appear to be residential apartment complexes, and their architecture is typical of modern urban environments, featuring balconies, numerous windows, and a reddish-brown exterior.\n\nThe sky is clear and blue, highlighting the sharp contours and colors in the image. The overall scene conveys an impactful message about urban waste and its proximity and relationship to human living spaces, inviting reflection on environmental management and urban planning.","title":"Part of the 26,000 tons of solid waste that New York City produces each day.
