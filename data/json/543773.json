{"path":"543773.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental scene, likely a polluted area. There are several industrial pipes lying in a disorganized manner across what appears to be a contaminated field. The ground is uneven and covered in patches of dirty, yellowish water mixed with various pollutants creating a mottled appearance.\n\nThere is no visible vegetation immediately around the polluted area, suggesting that the contamination may have adversely affected local flora. In the distant background, however, there's some sparse vegetation and a little greenery that appears less affected. The sky is not visible in the image, which focuses more on the ground and the immediate effects of the contamination.\n\nThis scene likely represents either the aftermath of an industrial spill or poorly managed waste disposal. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of neglect and environmental degradation.","title":"Waste material from Union Carbide settling ponds seep into San Miguel River.","placename":"Uravan (Colo.)","location":"Uravan, Colorado","nn1":["545312","550193","543762","551562","551561","550259","547907","544810","552019","547925","547485","551559","546913","555544","549118","549307"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["contamination","spill","pollutant","disposal","aftermath","degradation","manner","flora","pipe","waste"]}
