{"path":"548501.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph features a marine setting with a close-up of a red navigational buoy numbered \"2\". Atop this buoy is a large nest made from an assortment of twigs and branches. A bird with speckled plumage is perched on the edge of the nest, which is positioned just below a small, beacon-like light that forms part of the buoy's structure.\n\nIn the background, the calm sea stretches out, meeting a hazy, clear sky on the horizon. On the sea, two sailboats can be seen in the distance; one is closer to the left and features a white sail, while another is further away to the right. The sea appears tranquil, suggesting a peaceful maritime scene. The overall composition balances the artificial structure of the buoy and natural elements like the bird and its nest, against the expansive backdrop of water and sky.","title":"Nesting on top of a chesapeake bay channel marker","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["548493","548490","542919","548497","548505","550306","544513","543329","547008","549896","548728","548788","543283","553876","543260","547937"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["buoy","nest","sea","bird","marine","plumage","twig","perch","assortment","sailboat"]}
