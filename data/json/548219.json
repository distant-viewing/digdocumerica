{"path":"548219.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor scene at a bookstore or a shop dedicated to books and possibly other printed materials. The setting is characterized by warm lighting and a cozy atmosphere. \n\nIn the foreground, there's a wooden counter where two men are present. The man on the left, likely a staff member, stands behind the counter. He wears glasses and a vest over a lighter shirt, appearing ready to assist customers or manage transactions, and he leans slightly forward with an attentive posture. The man on the right is also behind the counter, seemingly engaged in an activity that involves paperwork or sorting materials on the counter. He has a beard and wears a dark sweater. \n\nThe counter itself is littered with various notes, flyers, and a sign clearly stating that the shop is a non-profit organization and that proceeds from sales go to environmental groups. Among the flyers, several activist or informational topics can be discerned, advocating for feminist and environmental causes.\n\nBehind the counter and spread throughout the background are numerous shelves filled densely with books, which suggest a wide range of topics likely catered to readers interested in social, environmental, and possibly academic subjects. The presence of large windows suggests natural light complementing the inside lighting, creating a welcoming ambiance for reading and browsing.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the people and the setting, portrays a scene of quiet industriousness and a space dedicated not just to commerce but to a community cause, emphasizing environmental and social advocacy.","title":"The Essex County environmental group runs this bookstore in Rockport.","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["553763","554380","552647","556207","556209","557763","549337","549361","555233","553187","552592","546549","557765","546560","557809","555290"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["counter","topic","dedicate","cause","book","shop","industriousness","paperwork","transaction","staff"]}
