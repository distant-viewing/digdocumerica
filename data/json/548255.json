{"path":"548255.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set within a subway car. In the foreground, a woman is seated, facing left, and is slightly off-center in the frame. She has a composed expression with a hint of contemplation or distant thought. She is dressed in a light beige or cream shirt, accessorized with several bracelets on her wrist and what appears to be a watch. A leather bag is slung over her shoulder.\n\nThe background is a wall of the subway car, heavily vandalized with graffiti, scribbles, and tags in various colors including black and red. These markings seemingly give a snapshot into the urban environment of the subway system during this period. Through the window behind the woman, another subway car can be seen, featuring more graffiti on its surface.\n\nThe lighting within the car casts a soft glow upon the woman, enhancing the thoughtful ambiance of the scene. This photograph seems to capture a quiet, introspective moment amidst the chaos and disorder suggested by the graffiti-ridden surroundings, giving it a poignant contrast between the individual and the environment.","title":"Interior of graffiti-marked subway car","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548260","553823","554325","548273","556665","554370","548258","548261","555975","548253","554326","556811","556653","554327","548257","556814"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","graffiti","car","bracelet","scribble","sling","woman","disorder","wrist","accessorize"]}
