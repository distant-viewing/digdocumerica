{"path":"551953.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image captures a dramatic scene along a turbulent coastal area. In the foreground, fierce waves are crashing against a rocky shore, where large, irregularly shaped boulders and debris are scattered. The water is choppy, with white foam visible at the peaks of the waves.\n\nToward the left side of the image, a small, weathered building appears directly on the water's edge. This structure, possibly a shed or a small house, has a dark exterior and seems to withstand the force of the splashing waves which come dangerously close.\n\nIn the background, under a clear blue sky, a large industrial plant can be seen spanning the horizon. Smoke or steam billows from multiple tall smokestacks, suggesting ongoing industrial activity. The presence of this facility creates a stark contrast between the natural ruggedness of the shoreline and the man-made industrial landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph portrays a scene of natural power and resilience, set against the backdrop of human industrial influence, capturing a moment where nature and industry coexist.","title":"Storm tossed waves pound lake side home at beverly shores","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547118","543288","543405","543298","543364","547155","552167","544527","543320","552955","548079","543359","543242","543092","550710","554064"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["wave","withstand","crash","coexist","ruggedness","boulder","foam","force","influence","shed"]}
