{"path":"549458.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene featuring a river surrounded by rugged, hilly terrain. The river runs from the foreground to the middle distance, reflecting a cloudy sky. On the left side of the river, there is a rocky shore with sparse vegetation, including several small bushes and trees. The background features a series of overlapping mountain ridges, showing various shades of gray and blue which suggest distance and add to the depth of the scene.\n\nDominating the middle of the frame is a boat speeding on the river, creating a visible wake in the calm water. The boat, likely made of metal, appears to be painted in dark and light shades, possibly grays and whites, with a closed cabin and several windows. The scene evokes an atmosphere of remote, natural tranquility interspersed with human activity, conveyed by the boat's rapid movement through the wild landscape. The image has a serene yet dynamic quality, with the mountains providing a stark contrast to the motion of the boat.","title":"Jet boat on the snake river delivers mail to scattered ranches between Lewiston and hells canyon","placename":"Lewiston (Idaho)","location":"Lewiston, Idaho","nn1":["549066","550989","555693","545043","550988","548934","548939","551148","552330","545654","551217","547685","550208","551208","544749","548921"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","river","gray","overlap","mountain","wake","speed","cabin","ridge","shade"]}
