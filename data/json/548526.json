{"path":"548526.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic sailing scene on a body of water, likely during a regatta or a sailing event. In the foreground, a sailboat manned by two crew members is tilted to its side, sailing swiftly through the water. One of the crew members, a man, is positioned at the stern focusing on steering the boat. The other, a woman, is leaning outward at the bow, actively adjusting the rigging on a white sail. The expressions on their faces show concentration and enjoyment.\n\nThis sailboat features a large, predominantly blue spinnaker at the forefront, billowing out with white and red patches. The hull of the boat is white, which contrasts with the deep blue color of the water.\n\nIn the background, several other sailboats can be seen, each with its own colorful spinnaker—ranging in hues from green, white, red, and orange—creating a vibrant spectacle against the more subdued water and sky. These boats are also in action, with their crews similarly engaged in navigating and controlling their respective vessels.\n\nThe overall composition is dynamic, with a clear focus on the sport and skill of sailing. The waters seem calm despite the activity, and the atmosphere conveys a sense of peaceful competition. The overcast sky suggests it might be an early evening, contributing to the serene yet focused ambiance of the scene.","title":"'Sailboat race on Chesapeake Bay'","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549421","547450","548203","549424","548513","549426","548522","549388","549425","549394","549404","549389","549082","549386","549406","549400"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["crew","sailing","sailboat","member","boat","regatta","competition","spectacle","skill","water"]}
