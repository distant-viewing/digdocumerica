{"path":"545218.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and playful scene at a beach. The image shows three young people engaged in an activity with a dog near the water's edge. Two of the individuals, one wearing a light-colored shirt and dark pants, and the other in a striped shirt and dark pants, are positioned in the middle of the frame. They appear to be interacting or playing with a mid-sized, light-colored dog, who is partly submerged in a frothy wave and seems to be splashing or jumping.\n\nTo the right of the image, another person, wearing a blue shirt and lighter trousers, is running toward the water, possibly to join the others or chase after the dog. The setting is a sandy beach with a richly textured surface, wet from the wash of previous waves.\n\nThe background features active, foamy waves of the ocean, which indicate a windy day at the beach with possibly cool weather. The colors in the image are rich, highlighting the textures of the waterâ€™s surface and the wet sand on the beach.\n\nThe photograph exudes a sense of spontaneity and joy, capturing a moment of youthful exuberance and playful interaction with nature.","title":"Oregon coast","placename":"Oregon","location":"Oregon","nn1":["543463","543395","553072","544191","543396","543390","543458","548695","548292","543500","543397","543225","553951","548697","543070","543072"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dog","beach","wave","spontaneity","join","jump","shirt","pants","wash","individuals"]}
