{"path":"554922.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural setting where a group of four people are seen engaging in outdoor activities near a rustic, corrugated metal structure, which is partly sunlit and partly shadowed. There's a large pile of grain on the ground that covers a significant portion of the area. One of the individuals, a man wearing jeans, a green shirt, and a cowboy hat, is leaning on a wheelbarrow filled with the grain. Another man, older and also in a hat, stands nearby observing the scene. \n\nToward the right of the image, two more individuals, a younger boy and another man, are also engaged in a discussion or observation. Both wear cowboy hats and are similarly dressed in casual jeans and shirts. The boy is looking up towards the man, suggesting a moment of learning or conversation.\n\nIn the background of the scene, there are trees and a clear blue sky. Additionally, one can see a couple of tanks and vehicles, indicating that this might be a working farm or ranch environment. The scene captures a moment of daily life or work in this rural setting, showcasing activity centered around the grain, possibly during a harvest or feed preparation time.","title":"Workers from Mexico at a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552575","546380","543686","549036","555819","549050","553108","554936","553106","552581","549259","551158","557751","544406","553104","543779"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["grain","hat","boy","jean","ranch","man","learning","feed","harvest","cowboy"]}
