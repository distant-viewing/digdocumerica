{"path":"543556.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph depicts a large \"For Sale\" sign in a natural woodland setting. The sign is positioned prominently in the foreground and is bright and noticeable against the backdrop of dense, dark green pine trees. The sign indicates that the land available totals 5.38 acres and is located in a multiple dwelling zone with a 600-foot highway frontage. It advertises M.F. Jones Realty as the exclusive agents and provides contact information with a phone number and address in Carnelian Bay, California.\n\nThe background is a forest environment, with a variety of pine trees filling the scene. Despite the natural beauty, no people or animals are visible; the focus is solely on the real estate advertisement. The soil beneath the trees appears dry, and there's a layer of fallen pine needles covering the ground, suggesting late summer or autumn as the season. Sparse undergrowth and occasional rocks can be seen around the area, emphasizing the setting's rustic and undeveloped character.","title":"North shore development","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543557","554133","543115","557553","543528","552988","545049","543100","549039","554123","547648","543724","556989","554034","543101","544136"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["estate","total","dwelling","contact","sign","phone","address","undergrowth","needle","woodland"]}
