{"path":"542626.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene of a herd of cattle grazing in a field. The cattle, predominantly dark in color with some showing mixtures of brown, are scattered around the frame. The foreground features several cattle looking directly at the camera, while others are seen grazing or resting on the lush green grass that blankets the ground. \n\nThe backdrop of the image reveals an expansive pasture stretching into the distance, dotted with more cattle and groves of trees. These trees are sporadically placed across the field, casting shadows and contributing to the serene and natural atmosphere of the setting. The tree line follows the contour of gentle hills that rise subtly in the background. The sky, filling the upper section of the photograph, appears bright and clear, suggesting a sunny day with optimal conditions for grazing.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes a sense of tranquility and the idyllic qualities of rural life, with the cattle at ease in their natural environment. The lighting, likely from a sun positioned behind the camera, enhances the vivid greens of the grass and the rich, dark tones of the cattle, creating a vibrant contrast. This scene likely depicts an aspect of agricultural life, emphasizing livestock farming and the pastoral care of animals.","title":"Black angus cattle at ranch","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["550833","548984","542627","546102","542628","552566","557022","545153","543318","554071","544535","554560","555822","542960","552465","553105"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["cattle","graze","ease","herd","grazing","pasture","livestock","field","camera","farming"]}
