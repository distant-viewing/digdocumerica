{"path":"555040.jpg","date":"July 1969","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, natural scene dominated by plant life. The image shows a close-up view of various types of flora in what appears to be a densely vegetated area. The focus is on the lush, vivid green leaves and small white flowers that speckle the lower half of the image. The leaves are large and broad, shaped like maple leaves, with well-defined veins and a shiny surface that indicates they may be slightly wet, possibly with dew. Interspersed among these leaves are clusters of tiny white flowers, which dot the scene with little bursts of light color, contrasting against the dark green and blueish hues of the background.\n\nRising slightly above this undergrowth is a plant with narrow, elongated green leaves, bending gracefully under their own weight. The background is shadowy and indistinct, contributing to the focus on the greenery and flowers in the foreground. The overall atmosphere is one of tranquility and richness in nature, potentially a forested or shaded area where these plants thrive under a canopy that filters light sparsely onto the forest floor. The lighting is subdued, suggesting that this might be an early morning or a shaded area, where sunlight subtly pierces through, illuminating parts of the plants and highlighting their fresh, wet surfaces.","title":"Forest floor cover of vanilla leaves and grasses in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554993","555037","543615","554991","557098","555093","550536","557099","555192","555054","555042","546205","551356","554743","547635","543581"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leave","flower","plant","dew","pierce","richness","weight","burst","vein","speckle"]}
