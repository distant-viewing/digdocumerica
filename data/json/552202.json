{"path":"552202.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a logging operation, capturing a moment where logs are being loaded onto a transport truck. On the left side of the image, a large yellow industrial vehicle, labeled as \"FWD Lumber Jack,\" operated by the Port of Olympia, is in the action of lifting a bundle of logs with its hydraulic grapple loader. The loader features large tires, a robust frame, and a somewhat weathered appearance indicative of frequent use in rugged conditions.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a transport truck with a green cabin and gray trailer, marked with \"Harold Hill, Toledo, WA,\" is positioned to receive the logs. The truck is partially loaded, and the trailer has multiple axles to support the heavy load of timber.\n\nThe setting is an industrial or logging site with a ground surface that looks muddy and filled with gravel, typical of such operational environments. The background features piles of logs and woodland, suggesting a location close to logging activities. The sky above is partly cloudy with patches of blue, indicating fair weather, which is favorable for outdoor industrial operations.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on the machinery and the task of moving timber, emphasizing the scale and the physicality of the logging industry.","title":"Log loader at work at port of olympia's log storage site","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["542616","542790","542856","542855","554416","554419","550707","554420","545046","542854","555154","552201","552583","553631","550337","554418"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","loader","load","timber","trailer","truck","transport","bundle","receive","operation"]}
