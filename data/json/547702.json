{"path":"547702.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene likely captured at twilight or in low light conditions. A complex array of industrial structures dominates the view. These structures include towering blast furnaces, interconnected pipes, and large cylindrical tanks, potentially for storing industrial gases or chemicals. Some of these structures are intricate, with visible ladders, walkways, and external piping.\n\nThere's visible smoke or steam emanating from various parts of the facility, contributing to a somewhat hazy atmosphere that blurs the details of the distant structures. Notably, there's an area where bright orange flames are visible, suggesting active combustion or a controlled burn-off of gases.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a body of water reflecting the dim light, enhancing the industrial atmosphere of the scene. Along the water's edge are rocky embankments, and a low-slung pier or dock runs parallel to the shoreline. The water has ripples, possibly due to wind or the operation of nearby machinery.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image captures the gritty essence of industrial operations, highlighting the complex machinery and the environmental impact of such facilities. The lighting and smoke add a moody, somewhat foreboding quality to the scene.","title":"Foundry on channel in east Chicago leading to lake Michigan.
