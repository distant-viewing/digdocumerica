{"path":"551310.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a leisurely moment at a lake, featuring a group of people on a shore next to a boat. We see a small blue and white speed boat partially docked along a pebbly shoreline. The boat is situated on the right-hand side of the image, with its bow pointing towards the viewer. It appears well-maintained and sports a shiny finish with some equipment visible on the bow.\n\nTwo individuals are prominently visible at the stern of the boat, preparing or organizing for a departure or arrival. These two individuals, both wearing swimsuits, are seen from the backside. One of them, with long dark hair, is leaning into the boat, possibly adjusting something inside or speaking with someone. The other, also with dark hair, is standing on the shore, closely assisting the first person. Their attire and posture suggest a casual, warm weather day possibly spent swimming or boating.\n\nThe background features a tranquil body of water that stretches to a tree-lined shore opposite the photographed shore. The sky is partly cloudy indicating it's probably a sunny day with some overcast. The overall atmosphere is serene and recreational, characteristic of a day spent enjoying nature and water activities.","title":"Steadying a runabout along a rocky beach at horseshoe Bend.
