{"path":"556730.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene on a city street. In the foreground, there is an elderly woman bent over as she talks through the window of a large, brown, vintage car. She is holding a colorful umbrella that is predominantly red, with shades of orange and pink, matching her bright pink raincoat. On her arm hangs a patterned bag, suggesting she might have been out shopping or running errands.\n\nThe woman's grey hair is visible under her coatâ€™s hood, and she stands slightly hunched, possibly indicating a gentle, engaging conversation with the person inside the car. The car itself appears to be a model from the mid-20th century, noted for its large size and distinctive styling. Its window is halfway down, allowing for the interaction.\n\nIn the background, there are barriers that look like part of a road construction site, marked with black and white stripes and bearing signs or cautionary signals, which suggest some kind of street maintenance or construction activity going on. A brief glimpse of another pedestrian and another car on the street suggests a typical urban setting.\n\nThe atmosphere conveyed is somewhat gloomy, possibly overcast or rainy given the presence of the umbrella and the woman's raincoat. The overall composition of the image captures a moment of everyday urban life, marked by personal connection in an otherwise busy and possibly chaotic environment.","title":"Some 250,000 persons who normally rode the buses in Washington, district of Columbia, in may, 1974, were forced to find alternate forms of transportation during a strike which lasted several days.  Particularly vulnerable were people who did not own an autoMobile.  Many of them were forced to rely on friends or even attempt to hitchhike.
