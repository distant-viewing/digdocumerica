{"path":"544369.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"In the photograph, an older man is seated atop a small tricycle, which seems to be a custom or modified vehicle designed for adult use, possibly for work-related tasks. The man is wearing a vibrant red hard hat which bears a logo and the text “The Tony Lama Co.” across the front. He is dressed in a plaid short-sleeve shirt and dark trousers, and he appears to be engaged in an activity or is posing for the camera while stationary.\n\nThe tricycle itself is painted bright red and features a large front sign that reads “B&D Trucking EXP. #1.” The bike is equipped with a large wire basket on the rear, suggesting it might be used for carrying items around a large facility or warehouse area.\n\nThe background is straightforward and industrial; it consists of a large, corrugated metal structure which provides a neutral backdrop, emphasizing the subject in the foreground. The lighting in the image is natural and highlights the features of the man and the tricycle effectively, creating a vivid and engaging scene focused on this unique moment of work and mobility.","title":"Arizona","placename":"Arizona","location":"Arizona","nn1":["549042","557354","542782","548570","547817","554441","555989","556155","544835","557844","544349","546092","545965","556187","553090","542783"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["tricycle","mobility","modify","bike","basket","rear","bear","work","warehouse","man"]}
