{"path":"557947.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural setting with two prominent wooden structures, which appear to be traditional log cabins or barn-style buildings. These buildings are characterized by their rustic log construction and large, triangular roofs covered with shingles. \n\nIn the foreground of the image, there is a wooden fence that runs parallel to the bottom edge of the frame, enclosing a grassy area that leads to the buildings. A dirt pathway is visible along the bottom of the fence. The scene is lush with trees surrounding the buildings and dotting the landscape, contributing to a serene, pastoral atmosphere.\n\nTo the left side of the image, near one of the buildings, there are several individuals gathered. They seem to be seated and enjoying the outdoors, suggesting a leisurely or communal activity, possibly a picnic or informal gathering. \n\nThe structures themselves are situated within a well-maintained grassy area, and the background is dominated by green hills and trees under a clear sky, suggesting a peaceful, remote location distant from urban environments. The overall composition of the photograph reveals a picturesque, tranquil countryside scene.","title":"Re-creation of an old Ohio glassmaking plant at the hale farm and western reserve village near Akron, Ohio.
