{"path":"547939.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts a large, red bulldozer on a construction or earth-moving site adjacent to a body of water. The bulldozer has a prominent front blade and is positioned on a flat area that appears to be partly dug-up, with mounds of dirt piled around it. The vehicle is on tracks, which have left deep impressions in the sandy soil, indicating recent activity in reshaping the landscape.\n\nBehind the bulldozer, the ground is uneven with various newly formed hills and valleys from the excavation works. The landscape directly around the work area is barren, with no vegetation visible, suggesting a rugged and possibly coastal terrain.\n\nIn the distance, a vast body of blue water (likely a sea or ocean) stretches across the horizon, meeting a clear blue sky above it. This provides a stark contrast to the reddish-brown earthy tones of the construction site. There are no other machines or people visible in the image, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the lone bulldozer and its interaction with the natural environment. The scene captures both the industrial activity and the scenic, natural backdrop, highlighting a moment of human impact on a natural landscape.","title":"Widening the beach at great kills park on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547254","551262","547151","551947","543114","547186","547926","543105","555608","554544","545652","543760","545665","544138","549950","555601"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["bulldozer","positioned","site","blade","construction","mounds","work","excavation","machine","meet"]}
