{"path":"550840.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and lively scene on a body of water, presumably a river or lake. The focus of the image is a white speedboat in motion, producing a strong wake as it cuts through the water at a high speed. The boat is occupied by multiple people, although exact numbers are hard to discern due to the speed and angle of the photo.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred, presumably due to the motion of the boat, but visible are lush greenery and the structures typical of a waterside environment. There appears to be a large building, possibly a warehouse or storage facility, nearly central in the background, painted in a subtle, faded color that blends with the serene environment. The water surface reflects the brightness of a clear day, enhancing the appearance of speed and adding a vibrant contrast to the darker tones of the background.\n\nThis scene evokes a sense of leisure and excitement, with the boat and its occupants enjoying a fast-paced ride across the water, creating an engaging and action-packed moment captured in the photograph.","title":"The width of the Fox River as it meanders toward Lake Winnebago varies greatly. Some areas are passable only by canoe; others are wide and deep enough for high speed boating.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542697","548520","547685","549731","550879","547708","548058","546317","546049","548525","545740","545156","548736","546912","549062","556911"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["speed","boat","speedboat","motion","occupant","excitement","ride","wake","water","brightness"]}
