{"path":"542526.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene focused on a small water body, possibly a pond or a slow-moving stream, surrounded by dense, leafless shrubbery that might suggest it’s either winter or early spring. The water appears calm but features multiple swirling patterns of a thin, oily substance on its surface, creating a complex array of white and dark blue streaks that reflect the light unevenly.\n\nOn both sides of the image, the shrubs densely pack the frame, their branches thin and interwoven, presenting a rough texture that contrasts sharply with the smoothness of the water’s surface. These bushes are largely barren of leaves and have a light, possibly frost-touched coloring, which gives them a slightly whitened appearance that stands out against the darker water and shrubs reflected in it.\n\nThe sky is not directly visible but the bright light and blue tones reflected on the water surface suggest a clear sky. There are also hints of debris or plant material floating in the water, including what appear to be twigs and some dead plant matter, which add a touch of untidiness to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes tranquility and a somewhat cold atmosphere, likely due to the season and the lack of active wildlife or human presence. The capture of still water with dramatic natural oil patterns offers a contemplative quality, inviting onlookers to ponder the interaction between natural elements in quiet, secluded settings.","title":"Oil sump","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546963","551352","545923","554776","554603","546896","543611","554623","549641","550341","550750","546066","554608","544765","553465","554775"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["water","smoothness","shrub","frost","matter","coloring","onlooker","surface","twig","streak"]}
