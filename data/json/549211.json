{"path":"549211.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic yet serene rural landscape, predominantly featuring a classic windmill upfront, standing on a slight elevation. The windmill, characterized by its metallic structure and distinctly patterned vanes, is an iconic element often associated with rural settings. It is set against a vast, cloudy sky that dominates the backdrop with several shades of blue and gray, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nIn the mid-ground and slightly to the right in the distance, there's a pumpjack, also known as a nodding donkey or oil pump, commonly used in oil extraction. This inclusion of both wind and oil extraction technologies speaks to the utilitarian use of the land. The ground is covered in lush green grass, indicating either a well-watered region or a season of growth.\n\nThe horizon is broad, with only minimal undulation, characteristic of open plains. On the right edge, structures that appear to be storage tanks or small buildings further suggest agricultural or industrial activity. The overall composition of the photograph, with these man-made objects set in a wide-open natural landscape, evokes themes of energy, resource extraction, and the intersection of human industry with the natural environment.","title":"Windmill on the rolling ranch lands near Powder River, Wyoming","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544868","545832","549210","549216","555291","545828","549212","552462","547347","549217","549209","557439","542589","549213","549207","547293"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["extraction","oil","windmill","undulation","plain","inclusion","pump","know","intersection","resource"]}
