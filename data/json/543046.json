{"path":"543046.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene maritime scene, characterized by its rich, deep color tones and shimmering effects of light on water. The central focal point of the image is a large, distinctly shaped rock formation situated in the middle of the water. This formation is dark and silhouetted against the sparkling silver-blue surface of the ocean, which reflects the sunlight in a dazzling display.\n\nThe background features what appears to be a distant shoreline or mountain range, largely in shadows which make it difficult to discern details, contributing to the mystery and depth of the image. The ocean is bustling with activity as multiple boats, also silhouetted, are scattered across the sea. These boats vary in size and are likely engaged in fishing or leisure activities, invoking a sense of daily life continuing in harmony with nature.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its play of light and shadow, and the minimal yet impactful use of shapes and silhouettes, creates a peaceful and somewhat moody atmosphere. The photograph could be invoking themes of solitude, the vastness of nature, or the interplay between humanity and the natural world.","title":"Fisherman net smelt off Gold Bluff Beach","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553852","547638","548247","545173","545120","554147","544383","555694","557510","557813","543329","545081","542808","542877","547556","545277"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["invoke","silhouette","ocean","formation","harmony","shape","boat","mystery","discern","world"]}
