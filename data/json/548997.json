{"path":"548997.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast agricultural field that has been meticulously tilled into long, straight rows stretching towards the horizon. The soil is dark and irregularly textured, with visible clumps and small plant growth scattered across the rows, indicating early stages of crop growth or a recent planting. The perspective is from a low angle, capturing the length of the rows, which gives a dramatic sense of depth.\n\nA person is squatting in one of the rows, examining the soil or plants. The person is dressed casually in a shirt, jeans, and possibly a hat, blending practically with the rural setting. Their presence adds a human element to the scene, illustrating active agricultural management or inspection.\n\nThe background shows a flat landscape under a bright, clear sky that fades into a calm gradient of blues. There are distant trees or bushes visible on the horizon, subtly marking the boundaries of the field. The light casts long shadows across the field, indicating that the photo was taken either in the early morning or late afternoon, which enhances the texture of the soil and rows with a raking light effect. This lighting adds to the overall dramatic and serene atmosphere of the agricultural scene.","title":"Irrigated by water from the Colorado river, newly planted cotton field near needles will produce fast results in the hot desert climate","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["554056","555541","544548","548296","557478","554046","554015","549104","554202","554017","544552","557696","548907","554055","548902","555618"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["row","soil","growth","field","till","clump","planting","squatt","inspection","plant"]}
