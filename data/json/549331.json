{"path":"549331.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a man engaged in an activity on a boat. The man, who is shirtless and wearing sunglasses, appears to be in his thirties or forties with dark hair and a beard. He is focused on his task, looking down towards the bow of the boat. He is dressed in white pants and is barefoot, suggesting a casual, warm setting.\n\nThe man is handling some equipment; with one hand, he is adjusting or using a device that is possibly a navigation or fishing tool, and with the other hand, he is holding onto a thin rope or line. The device looks somewhat dated, potentially an older model electronic unit with buttons and a display screen.\n\nThe background shows a vast, calm body of blue water that stretches to the horizon, implying that the boat is out at sea. This setting suggests that he might be conducting some form of marine research, fishing, or is simply navigating the vessel.\n\nThe light and atmosphere suggest it is daytime with clear skies, conducive for marine activities. There are no other people visible in the immediate area, focusing the scene solely on the man and his interaction with the equipment and the environment.","title":"Scientific work in progress on the adriatic sea aboard the hydrobiological research ship, the vila velebita ii.
