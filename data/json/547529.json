{"path":"547529.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a scene featuring industrial architecture along a canal. In the center, there is a large building with a long façade extending along the right side of the image. This building has multiple stories, lots of windows, and appears aged, with a slightly weathered look and some climbing plants or ivy partially covering it. On the left side of the building, there’s a distinctive tower with a round top, adding a notable architectural feature to the scene.\n\nSpanning the canal are two bridges. The nearest bridge is a footbridge with simple, utilitarian metal railings and supports. Behind it, a higher bridge is visible, though details are obscured due to the perspective.\n\nThe canal itself, taking up the lower part of the photograph, mirrors the sky and the surrounding structures, creating a tranquil water surface shimmering with reflections. The edges of the canal are reinforced with stonework, visible on the left side.\n\nThe background shows a partly clouded sky casting natural light, contributing to a balanced exposure of the scene. No people are visible in the image, emphasizing the industrial and somewhat deserted feel of the place. The atmosphere conveys a sense of quiet and historical weight, possibly suggesting disuse or a shift from the industrial bustle it might have once experienced.","title":"Textile mill on Pawtuxet River","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["553428","550853","547890","547519","547948","550189","549303","550013","553393","546876","555730","553352","546865","549555","545979","558016"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["canal","bridge","climbing","stonework","round","weight","bustle","shift","disuse","façade"]}
