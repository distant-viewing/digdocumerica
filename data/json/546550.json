{"path":"546550.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a dimly lit room, possibly a lecture hall or theater. In the center, there is a large conference or seminar table, oriented lengthwise from the foreground to the background. The table is illuminated from above, casting light primarily on the surface and directly around it, creating a glowing effect in the otherwise dark environment.\n\nAt the table, there appears to be various papers and materials strewn about, likely indicating a session of work or discussion. Seated at one end of the table is a lone figure, possibly a man, who seems to be engaged in speaking, reading, or presenting, as suggested by his posture and the microphone visible near him.\n\nThe background and surroundings are swallowed in darkness, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the lit area and the person at the table. The atmosphere conveyed is one of serious, contemplative work or discourse, isolated from any distractions outside the circle of light. The setting suggests a moment of academic, scientific, or professional activity, characterized by solitude and concentration.","title":"North Christian Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["557703","557027","557038","546580","546572","554322","554337","554342","552616","555233","554333","557704","555290","552647","544314","546299"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["table","theater","session","microphone","distraction","circle","hall","reading","work","discussion"]}
