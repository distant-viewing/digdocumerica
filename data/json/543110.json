{"path":"543110.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a construction or building site overlooking a coastal area. In the foreground, we see several construction materials and equipment scattered around. To the left, there is a mechanical part that appears to be either a plow or some part of heavy machinery, resting on the grassy ground. It features rusted metal and wood components.\n\nThe central and right parts of the image show various building supplies. There are multiple white pipes or columns stacked together, accompanied by wooden boxes that likely contain additional materials, as suggested by labels visible on some of the boxes. Near these materials, there is a small sign with the word \"SOLD\" clearly marked, along with additional text \"Bolger Snicket San Diego Harbour,\" suggesting the location or possibly the project name.\n\nThe setting is grassy with a clear delineation of a dirt path running towards the right-hand side of the image. The background of the photo reveals a broad, flat coastal landscape with what appears to be a water body in the distance under a foggy or misty sky, giving the scene a somewhat muted and overcast appearance. A fence is partially visible, hinting at some segmentation of the area possibly for construction or other activities. The overall mood is serene yet busy with evident human activity preparing the land for building or industrial purposes.","title":"California--Bodega Bay harbor","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["548361","546833","547259","553375","548774","555796","545070","547970","545631","544639","555795","550273","547171","556940","547216","549204"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["construction","box","material","delineation","plow","sell","supply","accompany","overlook","part"]}
