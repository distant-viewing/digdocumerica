{"path":"544933.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, rural scene featuring a dirt road winding through a hilly landscape. The road is populated by a large flock of sheep, scattered along and beside the pathway. Some sheep are standing on the road while others are grazing on the sparse vegetation on the roadside.\n\nThe setting is expansive, with rolling hills in the foreground leading the eye to a breathtaking view of distant mountains, which feature patches of snow suggesting a higher elevation or cooler climate. The sky is partly cloudy with light and shadow playing across the landscape, adding to the depth and richness of the scene.\n\nIn terms of color, there is a contrast between the reddish-brown of the dirt road, the greenish-brown vegetation, and the blue of the distant mountains under the pale blue sky. This creates a natural, peaceful vibe, emphasizing a remote, pastoral environment away from urban settings.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the interaction between the natural environment and the livestock, capturing a typical moment in a rural, possibly high-altitude area. The picture could be illustrating themes of agriculture, rural life, or natural landscapes.","title":"Grazing sheep, near blue mesa reservoir","placename":"Gunnison County (Colo.)","location":"Gunnison County, Colorado","nn1":["554928","543269","557747","549235","555820","554779","552556","549236","549257","544384","554887","549261","552557","549142","549182","557087"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["sheep","road","flock","bry","richness","dirt","graze","mountain","livestock","reddish"]}
