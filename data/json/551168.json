{"path":"551168.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The image unfolds in a pastoral setting that captures a moment of agricultural activity. The foreground prominently features a large stack of hay bales, appearing densely packed and arranged vertically on a trailer. These bales are bound by twine and exhibit a golden-brown hue typical of dried hay.\n\nIn the middle ground, there is a red tractor pulling another trailer loaded with more hay bales. The tractor displays traditional design elements characteristic of farm machinery, such as sturdy tires and a visible engine hood. Attached behind the tractor is a flatbed trailer which holds several people alongside the stacked bales. These individuals, dressed in casual farm work attire, seem to be involved in either loading or securing the hay.\n\nThe background showcases an expansive field, trimmed down after what appears to be a recent harvest. The field's remnants present a stubbly appearance, with short stalks protruding from the soil. This expansive agricultural landscape is set under a vast sky, where large, fluffy clouds float against a deep blue backdrop, suggesting a clear, sunny day.\n\nThe entire scene depicts a combination of human labor and mechanical assistance in farm work, illustrating a typical hay collecting process in a rural environment. Elements such as the tractor, hay, and the open field collectively convey a strong sense of agrarian life and activity.","title":"Farm on route 35 near pt.  Pleasant.
