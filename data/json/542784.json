{"path":"542784.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an up-close portrait of a man who appears to be engaged in an intense physical activity. The scene is focused mainly on his face and upper part of his body.\n\nThe man is likely middle-aged, with dark, wet, tousled hair and a clear sense of wear on his face which gives him a rugged, weary expression. His facial features are sharp, with focused, intent eyes and a slightly furrowed brow, suggesting he might be in the midst of exerting effort or deep concentration. There are traces of either sweat or water on his face, emphasizing a possible physical exertion or exposure to elements.\n\nHe's wearing a dark, somewhat dirty, button-up shirt which is practical and nondescript, hinting that he might be involved in manual labor or some form of outdoor activity. The shirt is complemented by dark suspenders that have a repeating pattern and brand name visible, adding a bit of character to his otherwise utilitarian attire.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, emphasizing the man's face, with natural tones that suggest an outdoor setting, potentially somewhere damp or misty given the visible moisture on his clothes and hair. There's a sense of immediacy and intimacy in the composition, with the man seemingly caught in a moment of brief rest or hesitation during a demanding task.","title":"California--Big Creek","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["554846","556443","546636","556563","557035","552872","547282","556540","543713","543701","557034","547028","553055","552103","552871","548616"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["face","immediacy","exertion","suspender","repeat","man","intimacy","trace","hair","portrait"]}
