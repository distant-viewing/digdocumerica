{"path":"548685.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a dense and vivid forest scene under a clear sky. Dominating the composition is a large, robust tree, centrally located, which towers above the surrounding foliage. The tree has a thick trunk and sprawling branches that are lush with clusters of bright, green leaves. But some branches, especially at the lower parts, appear sparser, suggesting either seasonal changes or natural variation in foliage density.\n\nThe backdrop and the lower frame are filled with a tapestry of various other trees and undergrowth, presenting multiple hues of green and brown. This dense undergrowth seems somewhat tangled and wild, indicating an undisturbed or minimally disturbed natural environment. The canopy is thick in some areas, blocking much of the sky, though light still manages to filter through, highlighting patches of the vegetation and parts of the treeâ€™s trunk and limbs.\n\nThe sky that is visible in the frame is a deep blue, suggesting either a late morning or an early afternoon timing for the photograph. There is no visible human activity or any man-made objects, underscoring the natural and possibly secluded setting of the scene. The overall ambiance is serene yet vibrant, typical of a healthy forest ecosystem.","title":"During the 18th and 19th centuries, English cabinet makers used the mahogany trees of Key Largo for their finest furniture. Numbers of the trees have fallen to the developers' bulldozers, but many can still be found by persistent seekers with a good knowledge of the area.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546947","554425","548686","547634","558088","555116","542958","555114","545488","550537","558012","543542","554978","550791","555133","555054"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["undergrowth","trunk","timing","limb","branch","tapestry","forest","foliage","tree","variation"]}
