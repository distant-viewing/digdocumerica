{"path":"542541.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts a desolate and cluttered scene that seems to be a discarded dumpsite. The ground is barren, with dark soil and sparse vegetation, mainly consisting of small bushes. Central to the image, there is a deceased dog lying on the ground, contributing to a sense of neglect and decay.\n\nSurrounding the dog are numerous pieces of debris and garbage. The most noticeable items include large broken pieces of white foam or insulation scattered across the dirt. Additionally, there are assorted household items and waste materials strewn about, such as a rusted drum, ceramic fragments, a discarded basketball, and parts of broken containers.\n\nIn the background, the terrain remains barren with no sign of immediate human habitation; only the vast deposits of garbage are visible. The setting suggests a remote or abandoned area, giving the image a strong sense of isolation and environmental neglect. The overall composition is impactful, highlighting themes of abandonment and ecological disregard.","title":"California--San Joaquin valley","placename":"San Joaquin (Fresno County, Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin, California","nn1":["548305","548307","556640","544823","552102","547039","551122","557307","542954","543165","547527","544640","550801","547983","545816","550798"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","dog","disregard","basketball","neglect","dumpsite","piece","item","discarded","drum"]}
