{"path":"552611.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly woman standing in a cozy, dimly-lit room adorned with multiple paintings. The woman is wearing glasses and a black dress with a classic double-breasted design, featuring gold buttons. Her hair is styled in a neat, short manner, typical of older women. She stands with one hand folded over the other, giving off a calm and composed demeanor.\n\nBehind her, the room is decorated with three large framed paintings hanging on a cream-colored wall. One portrait appears to show a man in a suit, another features a couple, possibly dancing, and the third portrait is of another man with a beard. The paintings suggest a personal or family significance.\n\nTo the right of the woman is a small bed or couch with a striped pattern, upon which a small, light-colored dog is resting. The dog looks calm, lying down comfortably with its gaze possibly directed towards the camera.\n\nOverall, the scene gives an impression of a quiet and serene living space filled with personal memories and comfort. The presence of the dog adds a feel of domestic warmth to the setting.","title":"Inside the NNA home in Rifle.
