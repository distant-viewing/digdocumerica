{"path":"545524.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man sitting on a covered porch outside a house. He appears relaxed, seated on a metal chair, and holds a cup, possibly containing a drink. The man is dressed in a patterned, long-sleeve shirt and dark pants. He is wearing dark shoes and his facial expression is thoughtful, perhaps smiling.\n\nThe setting includes a porch with railings, and a view into the street where a car is parked amidst green, leafy trees that line the roadside. The background features a part of the house, showing weathered wooden siding, and a window with white paint.\n\nOn the porch floor beside the man is a rectangular box of Reese's candy and a small, yellow toy truck, adding a casual, homely touch to the scene. The overall mood is serene, capturing a moment of daily life in a residential setting.","title":"Resident of \"little korea\", a low income area in south Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["556489","552523","545232","547792","556488","555532","556484","555580","547355","544219","548609","552648","553090","545974","557672","558330"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["porch","toy","house","cup","drink","roadside","man","siding","shoe","box"]}
