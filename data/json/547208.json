{"path":"547208.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a disposal site in a wooded area during a colder season, as indicated by the lack of leaves on the majority of the trees and the presence of some snow patches on the ground. In the image, the foreground features muddy and slightly snowy ground, possibly hinting at recent weather conditions.\n\nThe central focus of the photo is a red dump truck, equipped with a large, dark-colored container on its bed. This truck is in the midst of an operation, with its bed tilted back and a garbage bin attached to a mechanical arm, suggesting it is in the process of emptying the contents of this smaller bin into the larger container on the truck. \n\nTo the left of the dump truck, two industrial-sized metal garbage bins full of debris are visible. One bin seems to have its top open, filled with various types of waste, visible from the distance.\n\nThe background shows a sloping, forested hill, which rises behind the scene. A few trees on this hill appear to be coniferous, maintaining their foliage, whereas the deciduous trees have shed their leaves, implying that the season is either late autumn or early winter.\n\nThere is one person visible in the scene, standing near the operational dump truck, possibly overseeing or controlling the waste disposal process. This worker is dressed in casual outdoor workwear, blending with the natural and industrial setting.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a functional moment in waste management within a rural or semi-rural environment. The photograph possibly highlights themes of environmental management, human impact on nature, and the mechanisms of waste handling in less urbanized areas.","title":"Bass Lake sanitation truck removes the area's solid waste from a centrally located pickup point.","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["549936","546902","549949","549940","549749","549743","549945","546257","543828","546238","543821","542549","553041","546761","549795","549792"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bin","truck","waste","dump","disposal","garbage","bed","container","management","season"]}
