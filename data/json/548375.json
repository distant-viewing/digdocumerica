{"path":"548375.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph features an urban waterfront scene that captures a mixture of industrial and transportation elements. In the foreground, a weathered wooden railing runs parallel to an unkempt concrete sidewalk. Just beyond the railing, there is a pier that extends into a body of water, hinting at the location being near a harbor or river.\n\nThe middle ground of the photo is busy with various transportation and industrial equipment. There are multiple vehicles, including white trucks and trailers, and at least one crane is visible, indicating ongoing loading or construction activities. This area also features several railway cars, suggesting the proximity of a freight terminal or warehouse district.\n\nThe background of the image is dominated by the imposing structure of a suspension bridge, which spans the water body and connects two urban areas. The bridge has two large towers from which cables extend to support the roadway. This infrastructure element adds a significant architectural interest to the scene, and it also implies a connection between various parts of the city.\n\nThe sky is cloudy, giving the overall scene a muted, somber tone, which complements the industrial feel of the environment. The overall composition successfully encapsulates a moment of urban industrial life, framed by the notable architecture of the suspension bridge.","title":"The Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges seen from the Marine and Aviation Terminal","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555731","549300","551989","555758","550189","547586","549303","550955","551954","551980","547890","546112","546865","550214","550964","549304"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["suspension","bridge","railing","transportation","terminal","freight","loading","harbor","district","trailer"]}
