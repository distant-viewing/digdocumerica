{"path":"547186.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a coastal construction or maintenance scene. The focus is on a large yellow bulldozer on the beach, which appears to be actively engaged in work involving large rocks or boulders. The bulldozer is equipped with tracks instead of wheels and features a large front-mounted scoop, which is raised at the moment of capture. The machine is positioned near a pile of big, uneven rocks that seem to form a partial barrier between the beach and the sea.\n\nThe scene is set against a backdrop of a calm ocean and an overcast sky, which casts a soft, diffuse light over the entire scene minimizing shadows. The beach itself is broad with visibly wet, compacted sand, evidenced by the tire tracks and patterns left by the bulldozer. The overall mood is industrious yet solitary, emphasizing the interaction between human activity and the natural coastal environment. No people are visible in the photograph, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the machinery and the landscape.","title":"Placing a wall of Boulders to curb lakeshore erosion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547151","547939","551262","547926","543113","551947","547254","547031","544138","549950","545652","543114","545665","555601","555608","545662"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["bulldozer","beach","scoop","track","capture","rock","boulder","tire","wheel","machine"]}
