{"path":"557191.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a natural landscape scene, primarily focusing on tall grasses and wildflowers in the foreground. The view is vibrant with various flora having slender green stems and some white blooms. The grasses are slightly swaying, suggesting a mild breeze. Beyond this immediate foreground, the landscape opens up into a broad, open field.\n\nThe background consists of gently rolling hills, giving a sense of expansive, open space. In the distant center, there is a smattering of trees grouped together, possibly indicating a small thicket or copse. Beyond the greenery, the hills seem to be covered in a lighter, straw-colored vegetation, maybe indicative of agricultural use or natural grassland.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the image is serene and evocative of a quiet, rural setting, possibly in late spring or summer given the growth of the plants and the overall warmth suggested by the sunlight brightness. The shot appears to be taken in soft, natural daylight without harsh shadows, indicating either a cloudy day or a time when the sun is not at its peak, providing an even, soft illumination over the entire scene. The sky isn't visible, focusing the viewer entirely on the expanse of natural terrain and vegetation.","title":"View of tallgrass prairie plants seen on the Konza prairie, 1,000 acres of virgin tallgrass prairie near Manhattan, Kansas. Although the picture was taken in August during a summer of extreme drought, the prairie remains green because the roots of the grasses grow so deep.","placename":"Manhattan (Kan.)","location":"Manhattan, Kansas","nn1":["557098","551370","557104","549232","557189","549229","557099","556990","549158","549251","557190","549218","545040","549233","545069","553084"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["thicket","grassland","stem","straw","breeze","hill","bloom","illumination","warmth","grass"]}
