{"path":"546375.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"The photograph presents a striking contrast between natural and industrial elements. In the foreground, a single, prominently curved coconut palm tree is featured, leaning towards the right. It frames the composition, and the leaves fluttering in the wind add a dynamic element to the scene. The background captures a tranquil yet lightly choppy sea, the waves softly breaking onto a sandy shore.\n\nBeyond the natural foreground, the middle to distant background introduces an industrial setting on the coastline, visible across the water. This includes a large industrial plant with several tall structures, including smokestacks and possibly processing facilities, indicating a possibly heavy industrial activity. The industrial complex is dense and occupies a significant portion of the shoreline visible from this perspective.\n\nThe sky is clear with few clouds, suggesting a sunny day which casts a vivid and natural light over the entire scene, enhancing the blues of the water and the varied greens of the palm. Overall, the photograph juxtaposes the serene, tropical beach environment with the imposing, somewhat discordant presence of industrial development.","title":"Palo seco electric power plant in the background","placename":"San Juan (P.R.)","location":"San Juan, Puero Rico","nn1":["546393","546409","543160","546402","545854","551959","545035","550995","557484","544670","554120","546974","545989","545112","556908","545996"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["palm","flutter","introduce","coastline","wind","occupy","smokestack","wave","break","juxtapose"]}
