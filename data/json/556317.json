{"path":"556317.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"In the photograph, a miner is observed closely examining a large, detailed wall-mounted map or blueprint. The map appears to represent the layout of a mining operation, labeled \"Virginia Pocahontas Mine No 3\". It features several overhead and vertical sections marked with different symbols and lines, primarily in red and blue hues.\n\nThe miner, a Caucasian male, appears to be in his mid to late 30s. He is dressed in practical mining attire: a dark, grubby work coverall and a hard hat adorned with various stickers, indicating perhaps safety certifications or union affiliations. The helmet is labeled with \"W.M.L.\" at the front. His face shows a focused expression, suggesting deep scrutiny or decision-making about the mine layout.\n\nThe background behind the map and the miner is plain and muted, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the interaction between the miner and the map. The photo captures a moment that seems critical for understanding or planning within the mining environment, highlighting the importance of such detailed mappings in operational safety and efficiency.","title":"Harold Stanley, director of safety for the Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company, looks at a map cross-section of mine #3 at the 1,250-foot level in his office near Richlands, Virginia.
