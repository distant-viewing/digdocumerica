{"path":"549625.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph depicts an older man engaged in the operation of several pieces of electronic equipment outdoors. He is standing next to a wooden table on which rests at least three different electronic devices. These machines are somewhat bulky, featuring various dials, switches, and display panels, indicative of technology from mid-to-late 20th century.\n\nThe man is dressed in a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt and darker trousers, complemented by suspenders. He appears focused, looking down at some papers or manuals he is holding, possibly configuring the equipment or taking notes.\n\nIn the background, thereâ€™s a combination of natural and urban elements. Several palm trees dominate the scene, suggesting a warm, sunny climate, possibly in a region like California. In the far distance, mountainous outlines can be seen beneath a hazy sky, likely due to the heat or smog. Below the mountains and among the palm trees, the roofs of buildings can be seen, indicating that this setup is on the outskirts of a town or city.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of technical activity, possibly related to communication or measurement, set in a tranquil outdoor environment juxtaposing nature and technology.\n","title":"At the statewide Air Pollution Research Center, University of California at Riverside, scientist works with machine for the detection of sulfur compounds in the air.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["542663","542661","552380","553907","552112","542765","542659","542662","549378","548879","550192","552367","544499","548855","549367","557317"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["palm","technology","switch","suspender","smog","measurement","heat","dial","note","communication"]}
