{"path":"544473.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a severely damaged road, likely due to natural causes such as an earthquake or erosion. The surface of the road is extensively cracked and broken with large segments of asphalt pushed up, creating uneven surfaces and gaps. The damage extends across the entire width of the road, suggesting significant underlying disruption.\n\nThe setting is a suburban area, as evidenced by the presence of residential homes visible in the background. These houses are a single-story and feature typical suburban landscaping with lawns and trees. Along the side of the road, there is a grassy area and some sparse wildflowers or weeds growing.\n\nOn both the left and right sides of the road, vehicles are parked, including what appears to be a classic red truck, indicating that despite the road damage, the area is still inhabited and used by locals. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting that the photograph was taken on a sunny day, which provides ample natural light that vividly captures the chaos of the cracked road against the serene suburban backdrop.","title":"Raging floodwaters of Guadalupe River washed away parts of concrete roadway.","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["555597","555613","544583","554548","547130","544080","544466","544459","547653","551971","553124","552083","557993","544458","547095","555199"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","damage","local","weed","chaos","gap","disruption","width","asphalt","landscaping"]}
