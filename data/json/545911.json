{"path":"545911.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat mystical scene at dusk or dawn. The image features a body of calm water that reflects the colors of the sky and the structures built on it. A central focus of the image is a small, seemingly makeshift dock or pier that extends into the water. On this dock, there are visible silhouettes of at least two people engaged in an activity, possibly fishing or simply enjoying the tranquility of the environment.\n\nThe dock is crudely built with visible posts and a platform, and there's a railing that runs along its length, enhancing the rustic charm of the scene. There's a faint glow, likely from a sunset or sunrise, that illuminates the water and the sky in hues of deep blue and purple, interspersed with glistening points where the light reflects off the water's surface.\n\nCloser to the foreground, the silhouette of rocky terrain borders the water, creating a natural frame for the scene and adding a sense of ruggedness to the calm waters. The composition balances elements of human interaction with nature and the overwhelming presence of natural beauty in a moment of quietude. This creates a contemplative atmosphere, inviting the viewer to reflect on peace and simplicity.","title":"Truckee river","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["547052","552311","552225","545149","551280","543143","551312","547027","554477","544266","543553","554404","547230","545000","550296","544306"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["dock","build","water","silhouette","quietude","reflect","peace","ruggedness","glisten","sunrise"]}
