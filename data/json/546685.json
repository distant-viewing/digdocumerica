{"path":"546685.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of a densely packed car parking lot. The lot is filled with numerous cars, primarily older models which suggest the photo may be taken a few decades ago. The cars vary in color, with notable hues of blue, white, red, and black. The lot appears to be partially paved and partially unpaved, with several muddy patches visible where cars are parked.\n\nIn the center of the image, there is a small, square building, possibly a garage or small office, surrounded on two sides by parked cars. The composition includes a hint of urban presence as evidenced by buildings lining the lot's perimeter, although they are mostly cropped out of the frame.\n\nThe top part of the image shows two rows of trees providing a natural border on one side of the parking lot. The general condition of the lot, combined with the building styles and the models of the cars, gives the scene a somewhat dated and utilitarian feel, typical of an urban car parking area not designed for public display but rather for functionality.","title":"Downtown car jumble","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547826","556721","553303","546879","548432","546813","556722","554349","547480","556773","550100","546900","556204","548496","556790","549875"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["lot","car","parking","model","perimeter","garage","muddy","functionality","park","decade"]}
