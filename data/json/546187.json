{"path":"546187.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor setting featuring three large chalkboard signs propped against a building with light siding and a window. The chalkboards are filled with hand-written advertisements about various real estate opportunities such as homes for sale and scenic sites in a river park area. The descriptions list details like the number of bedrooms, scenic features, prices, and additional amenities.\n\nOn the leftmost board, the properties described seem to focus on homes with features such as large trees and proximity to town or scenic springs. The middle board highlights \"Beautiful River Sites\" with \"No Park Estates,\" along with a contact number. The board on the right introduces an art show called \"7th Annual Frio Canyon Art Show and Sale\" scheduled for a specific date, located at Pecan Grove Camp. Additionally, there's a poster featuring a mountain lion mounted on the wall next to the rightmost chalkboard, likely symbolizing a local wildlife or natural theme. Below the mountain lion image, there's a modest, hand-written sign inviting visitors to \"Come in and Browse.\"\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph offers a glimpse into local commercial activities, focusing on real estate and local events, possibly in a community with notable natural attractions and wildlife.","title":"Mayor Casey's chalkboard hangs outside his office.
