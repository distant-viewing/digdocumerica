{"path":"544458.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph portrays a scene of extensive destruction, presumably following a natural disaster such as a tornado or hurricane. The foreground prominently features a street corner with a signpost at the intersection of \"HOUSTON\" and \"E. EDGEWATER TER.\" The ground is muddy and water puddles reflect the cloudy sky overhead, suggesting recent heavy rainfall.\n\nScattered across the scene are large amounts of debris, including uprooted trees, fallen utility poles, and scattered garbage which suggest powerful winds have passed through here. These materials are spread widely across what appears to be a residential area, with damaged homes and belongings visible in the background.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the road leading into the scene and the presence of dramatic sky and environmental wreckage, conveys a mood of aftermath and desolation. The absence of people in the shot emphasizes the focus on the disaster's impact on the physical environment. This photograph captures a poignant moment, encapsulating both the immediate aftermath of a catastrophic event and the resulting mood of quiet despair.","title":"Guadalupe River flood damage","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["544463","547888","544464","544583","547868","557993","547130","552829","544797","547079","544467","544466","548742","557350","544461","555872"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["disaster","aftermath","signpost","wreckage","belonging","destruction","puddle","rainfall","garbage","desolation"]}
