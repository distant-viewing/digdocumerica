{"path":"546196.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a striking and somewhat ironic scene of a cemetery juxtaposed against an oil pump jack in the background, emphasizing a contrast between the themes of life's end and industrial activity.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several tombstones varying in shape, material, and size. Some headstones are simple and vertical, while others are more elaborate, including an angel statue and a rectangular tombstone adorned with floral designs and what appears to be etched portraits. These tombstones are weathered, suggesting they have been there for some time. At least one tombstone has fresh flowers placed on it, indicating recent visitors.\n\nThe middle ground distinctly features a rusty oil pump jack enclosed within a chain-link fence, symbolizing ongoing industrial activity. The pump jack itself is set on a grassy patch, and no active workers are visible in the scene, giving it a sense of stillness.\n\nThe background is dominated by a row of densely packed trees under a bright sky, providing a natural boundary that contrasts with the human-made structures and the serenity of the cemetery.\n\nThe composition of the image reflects a narrative of contrastâ€”between nature and industry, and between finality (cemetery) and ongoing operations (oil field). The framing positions the cemetery in the lower part of the image and the oil equipment towering over it, potentially to reflect on themes of life, death, and the ever-present march of progress or industry.","title":"Oil derrick in cemetery","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["546179","546168","546204","554825","546379","546038","547397","554791","550731","546147","545363","552735","547337","554824","545322","554792"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["tombstone","cemetery","oil","pump","industry","headstone","theme","link","statue","serenity"]}
