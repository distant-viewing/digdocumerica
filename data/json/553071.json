{"path":"553071.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features two individuals, a woman and a young child, submerged approximately up to their shoulders in ocean water. The lighting in the image suggests it might be either dawn or dusk, given the dimness and the bluish tint over the entire scene. Both individuals are facing each other, possibly engaged in a conversation. The ocean around them is relatively calm, with small, gentle waves visible in the background, which fades into a dusky, indistinct horizon.\n\nThe overall mood of the image appears serene and intimate, emphasized by the subdued lighting and the vast, empty space around the two figures, enhancing their isolation and the closeness of their interaction. The photograph captures a moment of quiet connection in the vastness of a natural setting.","title":"Water sport in Galveston Bay. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
