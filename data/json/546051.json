{"path":"546051.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene of urban decay featuring a dilapidated building, presumably an abandoned lounge, as indicated by the signage. The structure's front is plastered with several advertisements, including prominent Coca-Cola signs, and has names like \"The Go-Go Girls Lounge\" displayed across the top. The general state of disrepair includes boarded-up and broken windows, overgrown vegetation, and visible wear.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a significant amount of debris and litter scattered around, which includes various discarded items and trash, indicating neglect. A prominent feature in the scene is an old, rusted pickup truck loaded with what appears to be more garbage, contributing to the overall atmosphere of dereliction. The truck is parked in front of the building, partially on what seems like a non-functional loading dock or platform.\n\nAdditionally, the scene includes a reflection in a puddle of water in the foreground, which adds a sense of depth and captures some of the building's facade and signs in its mirror image. This reflection emphasizes the grim ambiance of the location.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a strong sense of abandonment, disuse, and societal neglect, possibly suggesting economic downturn or the passage of an era. The photograph captures a stark, somewhat poignant snapshot of a place left behind, with a moody and slightly desolate atmosphere.","title":"Litter outside a closed and deserted bar-room along highway 61","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["552997","545295","549785","547587","550264","549786","544809","552457","550279","553555","556640","547927","557345","556330","550263","554561"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["plaster","truck","abandoned","reflection","lounge","disuse","front","pickup","puddle","dilapidate"]}
