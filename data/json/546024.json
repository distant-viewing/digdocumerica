{"path":"546024.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a large freight ship navigating a wide river. The ship, primarily filling the upper half of the image, has a dark hull with visible structure details like railings, deck fixtures, and a large chimney stack marked in red. On the side of the ship, letters partially visible suggest it is named \"MINNES-\" presumably short for something longer. The ship's deck features some small structures and possibly some equipment.\n\nThe river water dominates the foreground, reflecting a murky, brownish tone commonly associated with many rivers. The water has visible ripples and swirls, indicating movement either from the ship’s own propulsion or from the river’s natural currents.\n\nIn the background, a line of thin, bare trees and a clear sky suggest a rural or semi-rural setting. The sky is mostly clear with a hint of light blue color, not taking up a significant portion of the image focus.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph places the viewer as if they are on the water level, slightly behind and to the side of the moving ship, possibly from a smaller boat given the angle and proximity to the water surface. The perspective captures an everyday moment of river transport, highlighting the interaction between human-made, industrial elements and the natural environment.","title":"Oil spews from a damaged Liberian tanker after the tanker collided with a barge on the Mississippi River.
