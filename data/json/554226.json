{"path":"554226.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures three adults sitting in a hot tub or outdoor spa. The environment appears steamy, which suggests the water is hot, adding a misty, somewhat blurry quality to the image.\n\nOn the left, there is a man with medium-length hair and a beard, sitting slightly submerged in the water and leaning towards the center person. The center individual, also a man, has a mustache and short hair. He is holding a cocktail glass with a stirrer in it, seemingly enjoying a beverage while he relaxes in the hot tub. His body is more submerged in the water compared to the person on the left.\n\nTo the right, a woman with her hair tied up in a bun, wearing a floral swim top, sits more turned away from the camera, facing the center man. Like the others, she is partially submerged in the water.\n\nThe background and surroundings of the hot tub are obscured by the steam and the edges of the tub, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the individuals and their relaxed, leisurely interaction in a warm, comforting setting.","title":"Members of the ski club of Washington, D.C. soak out muscle fatigue at the Continental Inn pool.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554225","544198","548550","553449","551271","551273","552972","551972","548585","543511","557779","548548","553122","551279","552975","544339"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["hair","bun","center","swim","mustache","beverage","beard","person","water","man"]}
