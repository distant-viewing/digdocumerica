{"path":"546724.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph is a high-angle aerial shot of a busy multi-lane bridge spanning across a body of water, likely a river. On the bridge, traffic flows in both directions, with numerous cars visible in distinct lanes. The scene captures a mixture of light and dark-colored vehicles, which are densely packed but moving, as evidenced by the spacing between them.\n\nAdjacent to the bridge on both sides are large, partly submerged pier-like structures, hinting at either ongoing maintenance or old sections of a previous bridge. Directly next to one side of the bridge are industrial barges, heavily loaded with what appear to be containers or cargo, lying stationary in the water. A small tugboat is also visible next to one of the barges.\n\nThe water surrounding the bridge has a ruffled texture indicative of a gentle current or breeze. On the far left of the image, a small section of green land and a curved road trace the perimeter of the water, adding a natural component to an otherwise industrial scene. The overall mood suggested by the murky water and the industrial activity is somewhat sober, enhanced by the overcast weather conditions as indicated by the lighting in the photo.","title":"Bridge traffic leading into Washington","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["548401","548413","549861","549878","550954","549469","546689","548341","546588","551186","546870","546569","550955","547703","551989","550965"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","barge","perimeter","water","section","trace","tugboat","breeze","current","cargo"]}
