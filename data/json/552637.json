{"path":"552637.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph shows an elderly man standing behind a display counter in what appears to be a small shop. The man wears glasses, a striped short-sleeved shirt with a tie, and has a serious expression. He is holding a small, intricate item which looks like a mechanical part or a crafted piece.\n\nThe counter in front of the man is filled with various items, possibly for sale. These include several boxes, some open displaying what seem to be watches or jewelry, and some closed. The layout is neat, with items symmetrically arranged on a black surface, reflecting softly under the lighting.\n\nBehind the man is a wooden wall, richly textured and adorned with various items hanging or displayed on shelves. Visible items include clocks, framed pictures, a plush toy, and what looks like a calendar and some other informational signage.\n\nOverall, the setting suggests a cozy, well-organized workspace, potentially a watchmaker's or jeweler's shop, where precision and attention to detail are paramount. The mood is calm and orderly, reflective of a traditional and meticulous craft.","title":"Jewelry store owner, mike cross, makes tie tacks, earrings and paper weights from polished chunks of oil shale","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["548252","558356","548231","547427","557809","554945","546101","547353","557807","542664","547366","555533","557688","546105","557808","556207"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["item","counter","shop","plush","jewelry","organized","boxe","toy","man","framed"]}
