{"path":"556266.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of African American men gathered in a room that looks semi-industrial, perhaps a workplace or a training facility. There are ten men in total, wearing various outfits that suggest different roles or ranks. Eight of these men are adorned with metallic bowl-shaped helmets, which along with their attire, gives a sense of a uniformed service, potentially firefighters or factory workers.\n\nThe man in the foreground, slightly to the left, is older than the others, dressed in a suit with a striped tie, and holding a clipboard or a document, suggesting he may be in a supervisory or managerial position. He has gray hair and a serious expression. The younger men around him are mainly looking towards the camera, showing expressions ranging from serious to mildly amused.\n\nThe environment is dimly lit, with what appear to be metal fixtures and equipment in the background, possibly machinery or part of a large vehicle. The overall mood of the photograph combines professionalism with a sense of solidarity among the men.","title":"A class of Black student welders with their instructor at a former grade school in the heart of the Cabrini-Green housing project on Chicago's Near North Side.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557867","545537","547320","556271","546824","552617","558262","547365","549073","552616","556336","552368","557883","552752","556339","547407"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["man","professionalism","training","total","workplace","clipboard","bowl","fixture","expression","document"]}
