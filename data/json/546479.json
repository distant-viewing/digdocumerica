{"path":"546479.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph captures an indoor scene with a muted color palette, featuring a woman engaging in an activity at a small desk or stand. The woman, who is partially viewed from behind and in profile, has long, brunette hair and wears a white sweater paired with a red skirt and a beige cardigan or vest.\n\nShe stands near a desk that holds a classic black rotary telephone, a brass desk lamp with a green shade, and scattered papers, hinting at a workspace or study area. In her hands, she holds what looks like a clipboard or a thin book, and she appears to be reading or inspecting a document.\n\nTo her left is a tall, portrait-oriented painting or printed image of a tree, set against a sky and possibly a distant townscape, evoking a sense of calm and nature. The setting is tranquil, illuminated from light coming from the left side, possibly hinting at a nearby window out of view. To the extreme left, a corridor stretches back, bordered by a doorway with red curtains, adding a pop of contrasting color to the otherwise restrained color scheme of the space.\n\nThe environment conveyed is one of quiet contemplation or study, with personal and possibly professional undertones. The aesthetic suggests a time period that could range from the mid-20th century to early contemporary, given the style of the office equipment and the fashion of the woman. Overall, the photograph embodies a serene and introspective moment, captured in a personal space.","title":"Interior of cummins corporate building.
