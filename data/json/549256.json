{"path":"549256.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a serene rural landscape featuring undulating hills covered in lush grass. A few clusters of dense trees are scattered across the hills, predominantly framing the right side of the image, providing a contrast to the open meadows. In the middle ground, there is a small farm settlement consisting of several buildings, including what appear to be a long white barn or storage facility and a couple of smaller red and white structures. A variety of dirt roads meander through the landscape, leading to and from the farm and extending out towards the foreground of the image. The sky above is partly cloudy, lending a soft light to the green landscape below. This picturesque setting evokes a sense of tranquility and isolation, typical of a pastoral countryside environment.","title":"The Redding ranch in Sarpy Basin is adjacent to and threatened by the Westmoreland Coal Company strip mine.","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["557748","555603","557946","554819","549142","551305","549222","554801","554767","555635","551304","549257","557749","557087","549236","555577"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["farm","countryside","meadow","hill","settlement","barn","couple","cluster","landscape","storage"]}
