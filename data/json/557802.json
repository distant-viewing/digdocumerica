{"path":"557802.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an outdoor gathering, possibly a festival or community event, highlighted by elements of traditional German attire. In the foreground, two individuals are engaged in drinking and conversation. On the left, a man with a jovial expression is wearing a decorated hat adorned with pins, a red vest, and traditional Lederhosen. To his right, a woman, seen in profile, is drinking from a plastic cup. She is dressed in a folk-style outfit complete with a red bodice, white blouse with detailed lace along the neckline and arms, and a black skirt with white and red floral patterns.\n\nThe setting is partially shaded by a wooden overhead lattice, suggesting an outdoor patio or beer garden ambiance. In the background, there's an architectural structure with large windows and a decorative roofline, indicative of a communal or public venue, like a festival hall or dining pavilion. Other patrons, visible in less detail, are seated around, further emphasizing a social or celebratory event. Gray overcast skies contribute to a subdued lighting that enhances the intimate and casual atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Visitors of German ancestry attending the fifth annual Oktoberfest at Helen, Georgia, near Robertstown, sip beer at the outdoor courtyard of the Wurst Haus restaurant on the town's main street.
