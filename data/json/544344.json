{"path":"544344.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural scene featuring a tall, majestic waterfall. The waterfall is centrally located within the image, cascading forcefully down a rocky cliff into a serene, azure pool below. Surrounding the waterfall are rugged cliff faces, exhibiting a variety of textures and colors ranging from deep browns to reddish hues. On one side of the waterfall, a sparsely vegetated cliff edge can be seen, with a few trees adding touches of green to the otherwise barren rock surfaces.\n\nThe scene is set in a secluded, canyon-like environment where steep, rocky walls enclose the waterfall on both sides, enhancing the feeling of a hidden oasis. The top of the image shows a clear blue sky that suggests the photograph is taken on a sunny day, contributing to the vivid contrast of shadows and sunlit areas on the rocks. The overall composition emphasizes the raw beauty and scale of the natural landscape, showcasing the waterfall as a powerful and tranquil element within this rugged terrain.","title":"Havasu Falls","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["544348","544350","542699","542698","548021","544456","544346","554113","550697","555073","555699","558087","542594","554409","545878","545874"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["waterfall","cliff","oasis","rock","canyon","pool","feeling","brown","touch","face"]}
