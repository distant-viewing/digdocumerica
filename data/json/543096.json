{"path":"543096.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph features a close-up of a sandy terrain with pronounced ripple patterns. A sizable, dark rock is centrally positioned, casting a pronounced shadow on the sand. Surrounding the rock is a pool of water which appears to be caught in the hollow formed by the rock's presence, reflecting sunlight and creating a slightly shiny surface. The water also creates a contrasting surface texture around the rock, distinguishing it from the dry, rippled sand. This image captures an intimate and detailed interaction between natural elements: rock, water, and sand, emphasizing textures and the interplay of light and shadow. The lighting, coupled with the angle of the shot, adds a compelling dramatic effect to the scene.","title":"Tidal pools with reflected light","placename":"Crescent City (Calif.)","location":"Crescent City, California","nn1":["543152","545855","550726","544907","543142","550475","550474","545589","543151","552546","543097","543421","547486","544992","544790","545804"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","pronounce","sand","distinguish","pool","close","up","shot","texture","couple"]}
