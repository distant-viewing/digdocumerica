{"path":"542721.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph displays a natural and historical outdoor scene featuring a large tree stump named \"Mark Twain Stump\" in a forested area. In the foreground, there is an information sign slanted toward the viewer, providing details about the tree stump with text and images under protective covers. The sign is labeled with the name \"MARK TWAIN STUMP\" and captions explaining its significance as a site of historic logging.\n\nThe main focus, the Mark Twain Stump, appears to be a giant sequoia tree stump, large and weathered, with a considerable portion of its cylindrical body intact. An interesting feature of the stump is a set of wooden steps built into the cut side of the stump, leading to its flat top, indicating that visitors can walk up for a closer view or perhaps to observe its rings and scale.\n\nThe tree stump is located in a clearing surrounded by fir and pine trees that form a dense forest backdrop. The area around the stump is covered with bare dirt and some sparse grass, suggesting frequent visitation by tourists or researchers. The natural environment suggests an emphasis on conservation and education, given the setup for public engagement and learning.\n\nOverall, the composition underscores the historical and natural significance of the stump while inviting interaction and reflection on human impact on nature.","title":"The Mark Twain stump; felled in 1891.","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["542724","557590","557589","552453","544628","543479","542728","553468","555384","555092","555098","555090","544332","542723","544913","542789"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["stump","significance","researcher","fir","education","tree","learning","ring","logging","pine"]}
