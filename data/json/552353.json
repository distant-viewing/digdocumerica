{"path":"552353.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of several sailboats spread out over a textured, dark water surface, likely a lake or sea. The demeanor and positions of the boats suggest that this may be a casual sailing or a regatta-type scene. There are a total of eight sailboats, variously colored and each equipped with sails that include hues of red, blue, white, yellow, and green. The sails are filled with wind, indicating a breezy day, suitable for sailing.\n\nThe composition of the photograph gives the impression of a peaceful yet active nautical scene, captured from a considerable height, giving the water an almost textured, fabric-like appearance. The overall mood is serene, underscored by the vastness of the water and the small size of the boats, highlighting their graceful navigation through the expanse.","title":"Sailboats at sunset on Spinnaker run in race on Commencement Bay.
