{"path":"547395.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a man standing in the doorway of a rustic building, possibly a barn or a farm storage shed. He appears to be middle-aged, dressed in a casual, somewhat dirty grey sweatshirt and dark pants, suggesting he may have been working. He has a serious expression on his face and is looking directly at the camera.\n\nThe man is holding a large basket filled with eggs, indicating that he might be involved in egg production or some sort of farming activity. The doorway where he stands is framed by white wooden panels, some of which are slightly worn and aged, adding a rugged charm to the image.\n\nThe ground outside the door is muddy, reflecting a natural, outdoor working environment typically found on a farm. There are few visible elements in the background aside from the buildingâ€™s exterior, focusing attention on the man and his activity. The image has a natural, understated color palette that conveys a raw, authentic feel of rural life.","title":"With a full basket of eggs, John Dolezal comes out of his hen-house into drenching rain on his farm near Bee, Nebraska.
