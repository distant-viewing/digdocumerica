{"path":"554157.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal area featuring a diverse mixture of natural and man-made environments.\n\nStarting from the coastline, there is a beautiful curved beach with white sands bordering the clear blue waters of the ocean. Adjacent to this beach on one side are several large rectangular structures that appear to be industrial, perhaps part of a water treatment facility. On the other side of the beach, closer to the inland, there is a spread of well-maintained green areas divided by paths or small roads - this section is likely a golf course given the visible fairways and greens.\n\nMoving further inland, the landscape transitions from the lush green of the golf course to a more arid, rough terrain with patches of greenery and brown earth, suggesting less fertile soil or perhaps a natural reserve area.\n\nThe backdrop of the image extends into a vast panoramic view of more rugged terrain under a vast sky with a few clouds scattered about. The horizon shows distant mountains faintly visible, adding depth to the scenery.\n\nThis photograph captures a blend of recreational, industrial, and natural elements co-existing along the coastline, providing a comprehensive glance at the interactions between human activities and natural landscapes.","title":"Maunce Kea Beach Hotel, near Kamuela, is located on one of the few sandy beaches in all of Hawaii.
