{"path":"549115.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This image features a single bird, likely a type of grouse, prominently positioned in the foreground with a focus on detailed plumage. The bird displays an intricate pattern of brown, white, and black feathers, appearing very textured and overlaid in a way that suggests excellent camouflage against forest debris. The head is marked by a slight crest that adds to its wild appearance.\n\nThe background is slightly out of focus and dark, suggesting a well-lit foreground with a shaded or distant back. This effect brings the bird sharply into focus. The ground upon which the bird stands is a mix of gravel and dirt with sparse low green vegetation, possibly small leaves or grass, emerging sporadically. This setting implies a natural, possibly woodland or forest edge habitat, commonly associated with grouse species.\n\nThe ambient lighting suggests daylight conditions but with a soft overhead exposure, which highlights the bird's unique feather patterns while casting gentle shadows. This enhances the textural feel of the image, emphasizing the bird’s adaptation to its environment. The overall composition balances simplicity with a compelling natural subject, drawing attention directly to the details of the bird’s plumage and stance.","title":"Gamebird in the brush","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547043","552696","555010","544547","550387","544477","548885","557628","544489","550471","543595","554601","557576","547318","553777","557614"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["bird","plumage","feather","camouflage","crest","adaptation","forest","stance","woodland","pattern"]}
