{"path":"549704.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph depicts a large, densely packed industrial railway yard bustling with an array of automobiles. The cars are loaded onto multiple tiers of railcar transporters, which are specialized flatbeds designed specifically for transporting vehicles by train. These transporters are stacked up to three levels high and are filled with automobiles neatly arranged in rows.\n\nThe cars showcased vary in color, with hues ranging from whites and beiges to blues, reds, and greens, reflecting a typical color palette of mid-20th-century vehicles. They appear to be several models of sedans, coupes, and possibly station wagons from that era.\n\nThe setting indicates the photograph was taken during daylight, given the strong shadows cast under the cars and railcars, suggesting late afternoon. The background features other railway lines, additional transporters, and industrial infrastructure that are typical for a railway freight yard.\n\nA striking aspect of this image is the meticulous organization in the placement of cars on railcars and the sheer volume of vehicles being transported, illustrating the scale and efficiency of automotive logistics and rail transport from a bygone era. The image captures the essence of automobile distribution in the mid-20th century, providing insight into the methods of mass transport of consumer goods.","title":"Fob Detroit--New cars are loaded onto railroad cars at Lasher and I-75","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["549688","546848","547265","551007","542639","547140","542633","547050","552063","542635","556692","546719","546627","556900","556382","547469"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["railcar","automobile","railway","car","yard","transport","coupe","consumer","vehicle","era"]}
