{"path":"547265.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a vast railway yard filled with numerous freight cars. The view is aerial, providing a high-angle perspective that captures a plethora of boxcars and tank cars neatly arranged on multiple tracks. The cars exhibit a variety of colors, including red, green, yellow, blue, and grey, adding a mosaic-like aspect to the scene.\n\nTo the left of the image, there is a strip of greenery that separates the rail yard from a recreational area, which includes a park with what appears to be sports fields, notably visible due to their organized, green turf and white boundary lines. Beyond the park, there's a hint of water, possibly a river or lake, bordered by what seems to be a residential area with houses.\n\nIn the background, trees sporadically dot the landscape, and there is a bridge visible in the far background, spanning over the water body, reinforcing the industrial and transportative thematics of the scene. The day is moderately clear with some clouds, casting natural light that highlights the vivid array of rail cars and the lush surrounding greenery.","title":"Aerial view of railroad yards and in the rear, national airport and the potomac river","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["552063","547050","547140","544664","551007","556464","546719","556692","556411","548167","545541","556900","556783","556382","556407","549704"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["rail","car","yard","arran","det","mosaic","bordere","freight","spann","strip"]}
