{"path":"552813.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a view of a flood control embankment during daylight. On the left side of the image, there is a swollen river with brownish water, surrounded by lush green trees that line the far bank. The embankment itself features a concrete slope with evident signs of wear and vertical grooves, possibly for water control or structural stability.\n\nThe top of the embankment, where the photograph is taken, is covered in grass, though patches of the ground show through, suggesting either wear or dry conditions. Notably, there are clusters of white blooms or debris scattered along the grassy pathway, adding a visual contrast to the green and brown surroundings.\n\nOn the right side of the image, across a road that runs parallel to the embankment, there are suburban houses with visible roofs, nested among mature trees. The road appears quiet, with no visible traffic, enhancing the calm yet somber mood suggested by the overcast sky.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights the relationship between human habitation and natural waterways, emphasizing flood management infrastructure amid a residential area.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
