{"path":"549937.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts an active landfill or waste disposal site with heavy machinery in operation. In the foreground, a large yellow bulldozer with a ribbed front blade is prominent, actively working to maneuver or compact garbage. Beside it, there appears to be a compactor vehicle with large metal wheels, designed for crushing and flattening waste.\n\nThe ground is uneven and covered with dirt tracks indicating frequent movement of heavy vehicles. Scattered all around are heaps of mixed waste including plastics, textiles, and other debris, creating a landscape of clutter against the natural environment.\n\nIn the background, the terrain gently rises with more piles of waste. Slightly obscured by the distance and the activities, some structures or additional machinery can be seen, possibly related to the operation of the landfill. The backdrop features a clear sky with a hazy horizon where a mountain range can be faintly observed, suggesting a remote or rural setting. This outdoor scene underlines environmental concerns, showcasing the impact of human activity on natural landscapes.","title":"Garbage is covered by one foot of earth in Croton landfill operation along the Hudson River.","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["546247","546235","549943","546246","546251","546250","546239","546231","546257","549938","543828","550252","549795","549807","548322","549936"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","landfill","compactor","flatten","machinery","clutter","blade","crush","operation","disposal"]}
