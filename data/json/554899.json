{"path":"554899.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor scene centered around a large, sturdy tree with multiple branches, providing a natural playground for a group of young people. The environment appears to be a park or a similar natural setting, characterized by an expanse of grass, additional trees in the background, and a sense of tranquil greenery.\n\nThe tree itself is quite massive, with a thick trunk and extensive branches that some individuals are climbing and sitting on. The activity centers on both the tree and its base. On the branches, there are at least four young adults—both men and women—clinging, climbing, and sitting. Their casual clothing, including jeans, t-shirts, and simple footwear, suggests a relaxed, possibly spontaneous gathering.\n\nOn the ground, there are more individuals gathered around the base of the tree. These individuals, primarily young women, are seated or standing, engaged in conversation or observing the activities of those in the tree. Their expressions and postures indicate enjoyment and comfort in each other's company.\n\nAn energetic, fluffy, golden-colored dog is also part of the scene, interacting with the group by standing on its hind legs and placing its front paws on a fallen branch, possibly in play with one of the seated individuals.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its blend of human activity, interaction with nature, and the verdant, peaceful environment, conveys a sense of youth, camaraderie, and the enjoyment of a simple, unstructured day outdoors. The attire and style suggest the photograph could be from the 1970s or 1980s, capturing a moment of carefree leisure and connection with nature.","title":"Area young people gather in the cedar woods by the frio canyon river near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["551734","545311","544406","552033","555947","557985","551735","551736","543440","553065","556522","543234","542728","542732","544743","543441"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["branch","climb","enjoyment","individual","tree","footwear","carefree","playground","base","youth"]}
