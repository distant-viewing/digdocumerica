{"path":"543558.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a natural aquatic scene, likely from a shallow body of freshwater. The dominating elements in the image are a slew of green aquatic plants, possibly algae or pondweed, which blanket the majority of the frame. These plants have a lush, vibrant appearance, creating a carpet-like effect on the water's surface.\n\nAdding contrast to the primarily green tones, a bleached, sun-bleached piece of driftwood lies across the frame. This driftwood, with its pale color and jagged branches, provides a textural element to the composition, standing out starkly against the darker, green backdrop of the aquatic plants.\n\nThe water itself seems clear, allowing visibility into the shallow bottom where more of the green plants can be seen submerged, adding depth to the scene. Interspersed among the green plants are sparse patches of other vegetation, which are slightly darker and might suggest another species or variation of water plants.\n\nIn terms of composition, the photo is dynamic, with the lines of the driftwood leading the eye through the image, while the textures and shades of green create a dense, organic pattern. The lighting, possibly coming from a low sun, enhances the textures and depth of the scene, highlighting details in the plants and wood. The overall atmosphere is tranquil and naturalistic, depicting an undisturbed wetland habitat.","title":"Berkeley marine area","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["542554","542582","558009","550834","543561","546875","550750","545008","551352","550341","551604","547541","544524","550786","547509","544765"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["plant","driftwood","sun","carpet","algae","majority","specie","term","variation","depth"]}
