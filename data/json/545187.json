{"path":"545187.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is a photograph that captures a serene silhouetted scene featuring a group of pelicans on water, viewed through an elegant arched structure. The foreground shows an architectural detail, which is likely part of a bridge or pier, characterized by multiple arches with rounded tops supported by square columns. These arches are dark against the lighter background, providing a strong contrast and a frame through which the scene is observed.\n\nIn the middle ground, a group of pelicans appears in various postures—some standing while others are floating. Their figures are also silhouetted, making them dark shapes against the light background of the water, which reflects the sky.\n\nThe background displays a vast, tranquil body of water that meets the horizon beneath a sky lightly shaded, suggesting early morning or late evening light. The horizon is nearly flat with a faint outline of distant land, which helps in providing depth to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition utilizes the contrast between the dark, detailed foreground and the softer, more muted tones of the natural elements in the middle and backgrounds. This juxtaposition emphasizes tranquility and the natural beauty, directing the viewer’s attention to both the grandeur of the architectural structure and the simplicity of the wildlife and landscape.","title":"Pelicans beneath rogue river bridge","placename":"Gold Beach (Or.)","location":"Gold Beach, Oregon","nn1":["548728","545302","550388","547726","548832","547744","552911","543063","555554","545991","547027","550903","544597","542992","553776","544611"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["pelican","arch","group","utilize","horizon","grandeur","pier","wildlife","simplicity","column"]}
