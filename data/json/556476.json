{"path":"556476.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a large mobile home park. The setting is nestled in a valley surrounded by lush, dense forests. The park is arranged in several blocks with mobile homes aligned in neat rows along paved roads. Each block is separated by grassy areas and small patches of land, possibly for individual gardening or landscaping.\n\nThe mobile homes are predominantly white and appear uniform in size and shape, suggesting a standardized housing solution, possibly for a community of workers or a similarly organized group. The roads within the park are curving and neatly arranged, optimizing the space and providing access to each mobile home. There are various vehicles parked alongside the homes and on the streets, indicating the presence of residents and daily activity.\n\nAdjacent to the park, a river or large stream can be seen, adding to the scenic nature of the location. There are also additional roads that lead in and out of the park, connecting it to broader transport networks. The overall setting conveys a sense of organized, communal living in a remote, yet picturesque area.","title":"Aerial view of clustered Mobile homes used by families whose housing was wiped out in the early 1970's when an earthen dam gave way on Buffalo creek near man and Logan, West Virginia, and created a tidal wave that killed 104 people.
