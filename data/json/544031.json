{"path":"544031.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene natural setting with a large body of water surrounded by densely wooded areas. In the center of the image is a canoe, small in scale compared to the expansive lake, paddled by two individuals. The water is calm, reflecting the overcast sky and the lush, tree-lined shores that encircle the lake. The trees appear to be coniferous, suggesting a location in a northern or mountainous region. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, giving the scene a peaceful, muted tone with soft purples and blues predominating. The far shore is visible, forming a slightly curved line that suggests the vastness and secluded nature of the lake. The overall composition invites a sense of tranquility and isolation from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.","title":"Arizona--Lynx Lake","placename":"Lynx Lake (Ariz.)","location":"Lynx Lake, Arizona","nn1":["550822","554609","554474","550674","543579","557563","545229","543522","557571","551207","550324","557562","550493","547550","552319","553440"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["lake","shore","predominate","encircle","canoe","hustle","paddle","purple","woode","compare"]}
