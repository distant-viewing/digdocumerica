{"path":"551678.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph features a serene park setting during spring. The dominant elements are lush green trees heavily dotted with white blossoms, highlighting the vibrancy of the season. In the foreground, the branches of blooming trees slightly obscure the view, adding a natural frame to the scene.\n\nIn the midground, a group of people can be seen enjoying the outdoors. They are casually seated on the grass, which is a rich green and well-maintained, suggesting a well-kept urban park. The group appears engaged in a relaxed social gathering, possibly a picnic, as they are gathered around what seems to be a blanket or a similar spread.\n\nThe background shows further expanses of the park, with other visitors visible at a distance, enjoying the park ambience. The terrain gently rolls, and additional trees line the area, providing abundant shade and adding to the picturesque environment. This setting not only captures a moment of leisure and community interaction but also beautifully showcases the bloom and growth typical of the spring season in such a tranquil urban green space.","title":"Central park, 840 acres of wooded and landscaped grounds and lakes in midtown Manhattan, is a masterpiece of outdoor art and the model for american landscaped parks.
