{"path":"556784.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a mid-20th century passenger train, standing on tracks at what appears to be a station or rail yard. The train is composed of multiple cars, characterized by their streamlined design and metallic, ribbed exteriors. The foremost car visible in the image is marked with the number \"213\" near the top of its front, just under the window-lined cockpit area, suggesting it could be an electric or diesel-powered model.\n\nThe train features a prominent corrugated stainless steel body, with horizontal sliding doors towards the ends of each car for passenger boarding and alighting. The windows along the side of the train are uniform and rectangular, extending most of the length of each car, indicating a design that prioritizes passenger comfort and views.\n\nThe setting includes multiple rail tracks that lie parallel to the train, reflecting the typical infrastructure of a busy train depot or station environment. Overhead, there are electrical wires, possibly for powering electric trains, supported by large metal structures that span above the tracks. The surrounding area has a few visible trees and a part of what might be a platform or another railway structure can be seen in the upper left corner, partially shaded and constructed of dark materials which could be wood or steel. \n\nThe overall mood of the scene, captured in natural light, conveys a quiet moment in rail transportation, potentially between busy periods of passenger movement or at a less frequented time of day.","title":"Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) train stopped at a station in suburban Philadelphia improvements in transportation, service and fringe parking were responsible for an increase in ridership from 273 million in 1971 to 293 million in 1974.

The remainder comes in subsidies from state and local governments.","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556857","556782","556759","556022","556058","556670","556059","555986","555985","556692","556111","556850","556778","556063","556772","556119"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","passenger","rail","track","car","steel","boarding","depot","station","power"]}
