{"path":"556866.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of an outdoor work environment, focusing on two workers engaged with heavy machinery. The setting appears to be an industrial or railway-related area due to the presence of what looks like sturdy machinery and railroad tracks visible in the blurry background.\n\nThe main focus of the image is a male worker in the foreground. He is wearing a bright orange safety helmet, a long-sleeve blue shirt, and denim overalls covered with patches of dirt or grease, suggesting a labor-intensive activity. His attention is concentrated on controlling or adjusting a part of the machinery with his gloved hands, manipulating what appears to be levers or hydraulic controls that are interconnected by a series of hoses and pipes. The machinery itself is painted in red and is heavily worn, with visible rust and grease.\n\nIn the background, another worker, possibly a middle-aged white male, is seen operating similar machinery. He is wearing analogous safety attire. This second figure adds depth to the scene, providing a sense of the broader setting and emphasizing the industrial atmosphere.\n\nSurrounding the workers are various other elements of the machinery including dials, valves, and rugged metal frames that characterize the harsh working conditions typically found in such environments. The weather appears overcast, casting soft, natural light across the scene, which somewhat mutes the colors but enhances the gritty texture of the surroundings.\n\nOverall, the photograph is a vivid portrayal of industrial labor, highlighting the concentration and physical involvement of workers amidst complex and potentially hazardous equipment.","title":"Southern railway right-of-way repair worker on a machine used to position the rails that are being replaced. The company had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working throughout Southern's 10,531-mile system. On a good day, when a crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of quarter mile long sections of track.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["546036","546023","556893","544331","556391","556903","544161","544018","556315","556861","544171","556871","558379","555561","556901","542989"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["worker","machinery","safety","labor","control","lever","valve","interconnect","manipulate","dial"]}
