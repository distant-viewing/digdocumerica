{"path":"546783.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph captures a tranquil, sunlit scene of a country road meandering through a lush natural landscape. Three people are seen walking away from the perspective of the camera, heading down the road, suggesting a casual, leisurely stroll. They appear to be young adults or teenagers, two of whom are walking side by side, while the third trails slightly behind. The individuals are dressed in summer casual wear, appropriate for a warm day. \n\nThe road is surrounded by dense trees that fill the backdrop with various shades of green, contributing to a feeling of being enveloped by nature. On the left side of the road, there is a rustic wooden fence that follows the curve of the path, enhancing the rural character of the scene. The sunlight filters through the trees, casting patches of light and shadow onto the road, which adds a dynamic and vibrant quality to the overall composition. The atmosphere evoked is peaceful and idyllic, typical of a serene summer day spent in the countryside.","title":"Exploring a side road","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549247","553464","545512","552407","558097","558090","553373","557659","543044","555821","553755","557985","544860","547045","543719","547300"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["road","summer","teenager","stroll","country","countryside","walk","spend","meander","envelop"]}
