{"path":"552214.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of an industrial waterfront area. The image is dominated by large quantities of stacked lumber, which are predominantly in the foreground but also continue into the surrounding water body. These stacks of wood are extensively packed and appear to be organized into various clusters, possibly for shipping or further processing. The water around these wood stacks has several floating logs and loose timber.\n\nIn the background, multiple industrial buildings, warehouses, and cranes are visible, suggesting a busy, functional port area. Thereâ€™s also a glimpse of a town or city in the far distance, where residential or commercial buildings can be seen. The layout of the port includes open storage spaces and paved areas for vehicle movement and cargo handling. This scenery gives a clear indication of a bustling industrial and shipping operation, focusing on lumber and possibly other goods. The photograph likely captures the essence of commerce and industry, with a focus on the timber trade.","title":"Rafted logs in Bellingham bay, puget sound","placename":"Bellingham (Wash.)","location":"Bellingham, Washington","nn1":["552215","552132","552140","552170","552200","542921","552153","552207","542943","546914","547998","546901","542944","542941","552163","551609"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["lumber","shipping","timber","port","stack","wood","quantity","trade","indication","commerce"]}
