{"path":"542816.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts an elaborate Victorian-style house. This architectural beauty features a multi-story design with a complex, detailed facade. The most striking part of the house is a tower with a conical roof on the left side, adding a distinctive charm typically seen in Victorian architecture. The tower includes a small ornate balcony with intricate woodwork.\n\nThe house's main body has a cream-colored exterior with wood siding, accented with darker trim around the windows and roof lines. Multiple windows punctuate the facade, with some showcasing a bay window design that provides extra interior space and allows more light to enter the rooms.\n\nIn front of the house, there is a small, well-maintained garden with a few bushes and ornamental plants. The garden adds a touch of greenery against the elaborate wooden structure, enhancing the house's appeal.\n\nThe setting appears residential, with hints of other houses or structures nearby out of the immediate frame, suggesting the house is in a neighborhood rather than isolated. The overall condition of the house, while showing some signs of wear, reflects a maintained and cherished property. The blue sky in the background indicates a clear day, which casts natural light on the house and emphasizes its architectural details.","title":"Controlled development and thoughtful restoration make this old farming town an attractive place to live.","placename":"Ferndale (Calif.)","location":"Ferndale, California","nn1":["555578","558150","542818","558156","557069","558148","558159","557092","557067","558160","548666","555579","548663","548662","546439","557072"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","garden","facade","woodwork","window","maintain","tower","cream","appeal","enter"]}
