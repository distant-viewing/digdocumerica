{"path":"545924.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph shows a dramatic image of dark, voluminous smoke clouds billowing in the sky. The intensity of the scene is enhanced by the deep, dark hues of the smoke which dominate the frame, contrasting starkly against a dimly lit sky that has subtle gradients of orange near the horizon, suggesting either a setting sun or the reflection of intense fire below. The thick smoke appears tumultuous and expansive, suggesting a large fire or a significant burning event.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, the silhouette of the upper sections of a building or industrial structures can be discerned, hinting that the smoke could be emanating from an urban or industrial area. The rest of the image foreground is obscured by the sheer density of the smoke.\n\nThere's a subtle appearance of very light clouds in the sky which are visible through the haze of smoke, introducing a natural element that contrasts the seemingly man-made disaster unfolding below. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of urgency and bleakness, emphasizing the scale and potential severity of the incident depicted.","title":"Smoke from armco steel on a sunny afternoon","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["545916","544704","550984","547204","557578","549634","545975","550987","546237","545990","547137","548595","545048","553841","550983","555166"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","fire","incident","severity","urgency","disaster","introduce","burn","emanate","discern"]}
