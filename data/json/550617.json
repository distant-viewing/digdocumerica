{"path":"550617.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph shows an expansive aerial view of a vast, flat landscape predominantly characterized by its numerous water bodies and wetlands. This terrain is dotted with many small ponds and lakes of varied shapes and sizes, noticeable by their dark to light blue colors, contrasting against the browns and greens of the surrounding land.\n\nThe land itself appears to be a mix of shrubs, low vegetation, and patches of forested areas, suggesting a possible tundra or boreal forest environment. There is a visible lack of significant mountains or elevated features, emphasizing the flatness of the terrain. Some shadowing from clouds above hints at a partly cloudy sky, which also casts patches of shadow on the ground, adding a dynamic texture to the landscape.\n\nThe overall colors in the photograph - blends of earth tones interspersed with the vibrant blues of the water bodies - along with the expansive view, radiate a sense of untouched, natural wilderness, likely indicating a remote location far from urban areas. This image captures a sense of solitude and the expansive scale of the natural environment.","title":"Swampy ground near mile 648 is typical of marshy areas in this intermontane plateau","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["550611","550644","550541","550399","550569","550598","550642","555683","550544","550397","550402","542882","550403","550426","556931","550620"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["tundra","radiate","land","dark","wetland","pond","patch","terrain","lack","wilderness"]}
