{"path":"548242.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"The photograph captures a quaint, rustic setting with two buildings clad in weathered shingle siding, typical of coastal or historical towns. Both structures have a charming appearance, featuring windows with small panes and wooden frames. One building has a sign labeled \"Weathervane\" and an office appears to be situated inside it, as indicated by another sign marked \"OFFICE OFFICE.\" On the side of this building, a large shop window displays various small items, possibly crafts or home décor, illuminated by light bulbs that add to the quaint ambiance.\n\nIn terms of human activity, there are two individuals in the image. The first individual is a man standing outside the building, peering inside the shop window with evident interest, leaning slightly forward as if captivated by the items on display. He wears a light jacket and dark pants. The second individual is a woman, exiting the building through a door that remains ajar. She is dressed in a plaid garment that adds a touch of vivid pattern against the otherwise subdued tones of the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is quiet and leisurely, suggesting a peaceful moment during a day likely spent browsing and shopping in a small town setting. The buildings and attire hint at a cool or mild climate, and the photo exudes a sense of relaxed exploration or tourism.","title":"Sunday tourists at the weathervane pewter shop, owned by rockport's harbor master.
