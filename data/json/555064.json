{"path":"555064.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a detailed close-up view of a dragonfly perched on a branch. The image is primarily focused on showing the intricate details of the dragonfly, which includes its shiny, bulbous eyes, its long, segmented body, and its delicately veined wings, which have a clear, glass-like appearance. The wings are decorated with an elaborate pattern of yellow and black markings, enhancing their delicate structure. The body of the dragonfly is primarily brown with lighter stripes.\n\nThe background is softly blurred with gradations of dark blue tones, highlighting the dragonfly as the primary subject and giving the image a very serene, isolated feel. The lighting appears to come from above, casting gentle reflections on the dragonflyâ€™s wings and creating a slight glow on parts of its body. This selective focus and lighting method draws the viewer's attention directly to the detailed textures and patterns on the dragonfly. The overall composition emphasizes the beauty and elegance of this insect through close observation.\n","title":"Dragonfly from Tin Mine Lake on Green Mountain, Kitsap County, Washington, near Seattle.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["549144","557585","544619","544479","544896","543603","544514","544521","544603","544553","555066","557544","544517","553872","544618","551381"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["wing","insect","gradation","elegance","method","body","marking","pattern","observation","stripe"]}
