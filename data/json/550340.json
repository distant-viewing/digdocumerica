{"path":"550340.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph features an industrial landscape with various manufacturing and processing facilities emitting smoke against a cloudy sky. In the foreground, a large accumulation of logs floats on the water, suggesting the presence of a lumber or paper mill nearby. The scene includes several large buildings, one notably taller than the others, and tall smokestacks discharging white smoke. The architecture of the buildings is utilitarian and industrial, with various pipes and structures visible. The overall environment appears busy and polluted, indicative of heavy industrial activity. The weather is overcast, contributing to a somewhat grim and gray ambiance. This composition effectively contrasts the natural resource (wood) in the front with the industrial backdrop, highlighting the interaction between natural resources and industrial processes.","title":"Paper mill of Georgia Pacific Paper Company on the St. Croix River in Woodland","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["550332","545244","550876","545260","555165","546236","550716","545256","552249","543749","545910","548068","550875","542944","548107","546808"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["resource","smoke","lumber","mill","accumulation","manufacturing","pipe","log","smokestack","paper"]}
