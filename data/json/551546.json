{"path":"551546.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This image captures three people joyfully engaged in a canoeing activity on a sparkling water surface. The photograph is taken in daylight with the sun creating numerous bright speckles and streaks of light that reflect off the rippled water, enhancing the luminosity and festive mood of the scene. \n\nIn the center of the image, there is a gray canoe occupied by three individuals. The person at the rear stands energetically, paddling with a single oar, and has an expressive posture, with both arms raised—one holding the oar—and a wide, open-mouthed smile. This individual is shirtless, wearing only shorts, which adds a relaxed, summery vibe to the image. The middle passenger is seated, engaging casually with the activity, though less visible than the others. A third person, seated in the front of the canoe facing forward, is partially obscured by the standing person but appears to be either paddling or resting their arms.\n\nThe canoe is mid-sized, typical of recreational models, and the water around it is textured with ripples and light reflections, suggesting gentle movement. The background is indistinct, primarily overshadowed by the dazzling effect of the sunlight on the water, emphasizing the primary focus on the people and their activity in the canoe. The overall atmosphere is one of leisure, joy, and the simple pleasure of a day spent on the water.","title":"Canoeing on cedar river, a short stream that connects cedar lake and lake of the isles","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["547213","550309","549996","550774","550767","544980","553806","554469","558072","550659","554468","553691","554465","554661","553403","553343"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","paddle","luminosity","person","arm","models","summery","overshadow","oar","pleasure"]}
