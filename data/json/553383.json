{"path":"553383.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph captures an extensive construction or excavation site. The site is characterized by a large, open, and rugged terrain, with various areas of activity evident. Here is a breakdown of the elements visible in the image:\n\n1. **Equipment and Machinery**: There are multiple pieces of heavy construction equipment, including at least one red digger visible in the right-hand side of the image. Another prominent piece of equipment is a large, bowl-like structure, possibly a component of a cement mixer or a similar device, located towards the center-left of the image.\n\n2. **Construction Frameworks and Materials**: The foreground and central areas of the scene show partially constructed concrete or metal frameworks. These structures are likely the foundations or early stages of larger constructions. There are piles of construction materials scattered throughout the site, such as metal rods, wooden planks, and large stones.\n\n3. **Natural and Modified Landscapes**: The site is surrounded by a dense tree line, suggesting a location either on the outskirts of a forested area or in a heavily wooded region. The terrain of the construction site is uneven and muddy, with various levels of elevation and dug-out areas, indicating recent heavy machinery use.\n\n4. **Personnel**: There is at least one person visible, standing among the construction frameworks in the central part of the image. This individual appears to be involved in the construction activities, possibly inspecting or directing work at the site.\n\n5. **General Ambiance**: The sky is clear and the environment suggests a sunny day, contributing to the visibility and sharpness of the details in the photograph.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a major construction or engineering project in its early stages, involving significant earth-moving and structural groundwork, set in a semi-rural or natural environment.","title":"Sewage treatment plant for Fitchburg under construction this is an EPA-assisted project","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["556939","549169","553378","550274","547225","552814","544167","553391","547591","556940","553382","547220","548431","547235","544812","546252"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","stage","framework","breakdown","cement","like","sharpness","bowl","foundation"]}
