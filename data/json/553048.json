{"path":"553048.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases a large agricultural field with uniform rows which give it a textured appearance. The field appears to be receiving some form of treatment, as two tractors are visible, each equipped with spraying equipment. These tractors are emitting plumes of spray, likely some form of pesticide or herbicide, to treat the crops. The photograph is taken from an aerial perspective, enhancing the graphic pattern of the neat rows extending across the frame.\n\nThe lighting in the image is direct and bright, casting clear shadows to the left of each tractor row due to the position of the sun, which suggests it is either morning or late afternoon. The colors in the photograph are rich and natural, dominated by the golden-brown hues of the earth and the darker tones of the crops or soil amendments.\n\nThere's no visible presence of any buildings or people beyond the tractors, emphasizing the scale and the agricultural use of the land. The image beautifully captures a common farming practice in an artistic manner, blending the industrious scene with a strong aesthetic appeal due to its linear patterns and symmetry.","title":"Fertilizing in the imperial valley.
