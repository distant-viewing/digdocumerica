{"path":"547206.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an urban landscape during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the lighting conditions and shadows. The foreground features a row of parked cars along a street, partially covered in snow, indicating a winter season. Adjacent to the street is a series of old residential buildings with a slightly dilapidated look; they are darkly lit, possibly due to the time of day.\n\nThe middle ground is densely populated with similar old brick buildings, many equipped with chimneys visible against the skyline. The area has a somewhat bleak or cold feel, emphasized by the bare trees and patches of snow.\n\nIn the background, the sky dominates the upper half of the picture. It is dramatic and moody, with large, fluffy clouds colored in shades of blue and gray under a lighter, more vibrant blue sky.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its focus on the contrast between the dark, shadowy buildings and the brightly lit sky, creates a somber yet dynamic urban scene. The vertical orientation of the photo emphasizes the expanse of the sky above and the density of the urban environment below.","title":"Lakefront apartment buildings on the far Northside","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547103","548384","547107","547207","553821","545499","549310","548328","549846","549620","545255","553845","549970","548396","549971","547051"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["snow","orientation","street","half","density","populate","chimney","winter","dawn","building"]}
