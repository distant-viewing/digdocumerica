{"path":"542698.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning natural landscape, prominently featuring a series of waterfalls cascading down a rugged cliff. The cliff is composed of gray and white rock formations, which appear stark and somewhat angular, suggesting they are part of a mountainous region. The waterfalls themselves flow through these rocks, carving out narrow channels and dropping from one level to another in a tiered fashion, before finally settling in small pools or continuing their path downward.\n\nThe setting includes sparse vegetation, such as small bushes and scattered trees, which cling to the crevices and ledges of the cliff. These plants appear to be well-adapted to the rocky environment, with some greenery looking slightly more lush near the water sources, indicating a possibly moist microclimate around the falls.\n\nThe overall composition of the image emphasizes the verticality and rugged texture of the landscape, with the waterfalls adding a dynamic element of movement. The lighting in the photo suggests it might have been taken during daylight with enough light to highlight the textures and contours of the cliff and the shimmering flow of the water. Overall, the scene depicted is one of dramatic natural beauty, showcasing the power and serenity of a mountainous waterfall landscape.","title":"One of the waterfalls along the upper Kings River in an inaccessible gorge.
