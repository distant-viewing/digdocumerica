{"path":"548772.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial crane at a coastal work site. The crane, which is large and predominantly red, has black accents and features the name \"Jos. S. Moretti, Inc.\" labeled on its side. It is equipped with a long, extending metal boom that is angled upwards, with several cables and hooks hanging from its end.\n\nIn the background, one can see a calm sea and a blue sky with minimal cloud coverage. The ground near the crane consists of mounds of sand, suggesting possible construction or dredging activity. Some sparse green vegetation is visible in the foreground, indicating undeveloped land close to the water’s edge.\n\nThis scene captures a moment in an industrial or construction operation, possibly related to maritime or shoreline engineering, set in a coastal environment. The crane’s massive scale contrasted with the serene sea and sky suggests the scale of human industrial activity in natural settings.","title":"Dragline doing some dredging and filling near Long Key in the central Florida Keys","placename":"Florida Keys (Fla.)","location":"Florida Keys, Florida","nn1":["548773","545655","547216","549308","544157","548559","547171","554545","545648","555285","548775","547615","546833","547113","548774","550874"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["crane","dredging","sea","hook","construction","coverage","boom","scale","engineering","accent"]}
