{"path":"546962.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a rural scene featuring an unkempt yard occupied by several individuals and cluttered with various objects. At the center of the image is a small, weathered wooden house with a tin roof, partially obscured by a large tree to the left. Several weathered cars, possibly abandoned or in disuse, litter the scene, including one in the foreground draped with a dirty cover. This car acts as a platform for two people; one stands on the roof taking a photograph while the other, a child, sits beside him.\n\nTo the left of the house, a person, partially obscured, appears to be engaged in some type of activity by the trunk of a car. Scattered around the yard are numerous objects such as barrels, spare car parts, various containers, and a scattered array of debris. The background includes clothes hanging on a line, suggesting domestic life amidst the disarray. The terrain is grassy and uneven, with trees partially framing the scene. The overall impression is one of rustic disrepair and active use of the space despite its chaotic state.","title":"Nine persons live in this house on St. Helena's Island.","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["547775","547988","551115","551002","546960","556491","553538","557701","551100","557670","551001","546958","550144","547957","553489","551091"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["car","yard","tin","disarray","house","disuse","object","barrel","roof","disrepair"]}
