{"path":"544271.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a riverside scene where a large barge, marked with the number \"HT 549,\" is moored along the bank. The barge appears heavy and industrial, featuring a flat top covered with what could be cargo, wrapped and lined up in rows. The scene is depicted in natural, subdued lighting, suggesting it could be either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nIn the foreground, a rough, textured concrete path or slab leads toward the water, narrowing as it reaches the grassy edge of the riverbank. A thick, coiled rope stretches from the foreground down towards the water, serving as a mooring line for the barge. This rope lies partially on the concrete and partially on a grassy strip that borders the river.\n\nThe river itself has a calm surface, reflecting a hint of light and surrounded by a lush environment that suggests a peaceful, somewhat secluded location. The opposite bank of the river is lined with dense trees, enhancing the sense of a natural, undisturbed setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with the industrial element of the barge contrasted against the natural riverside environment, creates a dynamic visual balance. The perspective taken from the riverbank gives a sense of being right there on the scene, observing a moment of quiet industry in a natural landscape.","title":"Barge cable","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["550951","551148","548187","551038","557235","551515","550952","556481","551524","545909","548186","557309","555807","550900","555401","548161"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["barge","riverside","rope","riverbank","bank","river","slab","mooring","balance","strip"]}
