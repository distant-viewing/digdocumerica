{"path":"544783.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph captures a city skyline set against a mountainous backdrop, likely taken during the day with a haze that might suggest either early morning or pollution. The mountains in the distance are significant yet appear somewhat obscured due to the atmospheric conditions. The skyline features a mix of architectural styles, from modern high-rises to buildings with classical detailing, indicating a city that has grown and developed over several decades.\n\nIn the foreground, trees and greenery suggest that the vantage point might be from a park or a similarly verdant area. The various buildings are mostly commercial in nature, as indicated by visible signage such as \"Security Life\" on one of the taller skyscrapers.\n\nOne distinctive building near the center has a gold dome, reminiscent of state capitol buildings, perhaps hinting at some governmental function. There is ongoing construction visible on the right side of the image, with cranes atop unfinished structures, illustrating a city in the process of expansion or redevelopment.\n\nThe overall muted color palette—dominated by blues and grays—gives the scene a somewhat somber tone, potentially reflective of the weather conditions or the photographic technique used. The image provides a snapshot of urban life backed by natural grandeur, suggesting a blend of human achievement and natural beauty.","title":"Salt Lake City, 9:20 a.m.","placename":"Salt Lake City (Utah)","location":"Salt Lake City, Utah","nn1":["544791","545429","545499","549971","551138","552186","544073","542683","552363","557271","548384","548385","552394","544787","548334","552231"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["city","skyline","achievement","expansion","technique","gold","dome","building","detailing","condition"]}
