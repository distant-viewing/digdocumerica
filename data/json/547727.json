{"path":"547727.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tender moment of a child interacting with nature by a pebbly lakeshore. The child, likely a toddler based on their small size and proportion, is crouched down engaging closely with the water's edge. The child, who is dressed appropriately for a day by the water, wears a light-colored cap, a striped red and white t-shirt, and dark shorts. They are barefoot, which suggests a sense of freedom and ease typical in such natural and playful contexts.\n\nThe scene is focused on the child, with the beach and water serving as an immediate background. The beach is covered in small, rounded pebbles and stretches into the distance where it meets a body of waterâ€”possibly a lake given the absence of waves typically found in ocean scenes. The water gently laps against the shore near the child.\n\nThe light seems fairly bright, indicating possibly a sunny day, which is softened by the overall pastel-like quality of the photo due to what could be an aging of the photograph or a specific type of film used in the camera. This quality lends a timeless, almost dreamy feel to the image.\n\nThe background beyond the water body is blurred and not detailed, which keeps the viewer's focus primarily on the child and their interaction with the environment. Above, the sky seems clear, contributing to the luminous effect surrounding the scene. The overall composition of the photograph, with its soft focus and captured moment of curious innocence, evokes a sense of nostalgia and simplicity.","title":"Testing the water","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["552940","549105","544380","550241","555398","544200","552279","551544","554499","545539","543875","552341","550233","550244","546333","553431"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["child","water","beach","ease","innocence","toddler","freedom","crouch","nostalgia","pebble"]}
