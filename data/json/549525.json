{"path":"549525.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of an industrial area situated alongside a river. Prominent in the forefront are three large spherical storage tanks, likely for gases or liquids, adjacent to various low-rise industrial buildings characterized by flat roofs. A large warehouse-like structure with a distinctive peaked roof and green walls is adjacent to these tanks.\n\nTo the right of these industrial facilities, the river runs horizontally across the image, spanned by a bridge that connects two separate parts of the industrial zone. On the bridge, a small vehicle is visible.\n\nBehind the bridge, the riverbanks are lined more densely with industrial and commercial buildings, showing a mixed environment of factories, warehouses, and parking lots teeming with cars and trucks. Roads intersect the industrial blocks, creating a grid-like pattern that suggests organized urban planning.\n\nThe overall scene is bustling with the typical trappings of an industrial district, with no visible vegetation except for a narrow strip along the riverbank, which offers a slight contrast to the otherwise urban landscape. The area is bathed in bright sunlight, highlighting rooftops and casting shadows that give a sense of depth to the structures and open areas.","title":"Industrialized section of the heavily polluted Buffalo River oil slick, visible on the surface, will eventually flow into the Niagara River.","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["555754","551995","552009","551172","550886","552025","555774","550890","547214","545889","550855","548423","547994","550856","549526","552131"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["bridge","warehouse","riverbank","tank","liquid","rooftop","planning","roof","district","river"]}
