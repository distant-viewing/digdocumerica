{"path":"554672.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people on a rocky outcrop overlooking a vast expanse of forest with a view that stretches to a distant horizon where flat plains can be seen. The environment suggests a cool or perhaps autumnal season, echoed by the interspersed hues of green, orange, and brown trees below them.\n\nIn the foreground, one individual, outfitted with a yellow hat and khaki-colored outerwear, is kneeling on the rock, appearing to be unrolling or examining a light-colored map or document. Surrounding this person are several others engaged in various activities. A few are looking out at the view, possibly discussing the landscape, while others seem to be readying or adjusting their hiking gear.\n\nSeveral in the group wear colorful and practical outdoor garments; brightly colored jackets in red and yellow are prominent. Two individuals on the right wear white headscarves and carry bags, suggesting a degree of preparation for hiking or an outdoor excursion.\n\nHere, there's a contrast between the intimacy and casual demeanor of the group against the grand, sweeping backdrop of the natural landscape, highlighting a moment of adventure and exploration shared among companions. The use of color, the direction of their attention, and their varied stances convey a dynamic yet serene outing in the wilderness.","title":"Adirondack mountain club hikers atop mount vanhoevenberg look out over the high peaks region to the south in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Lake Placid (N.Y.)","location":"Lake Placid, New York","nn1":["554509","543383","558096","554673","543234","553370","545700","545780","557005","544093","554513","543233","545776","545710","554508","554491"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiking","group","excursion","companion","plain","echo","headscarf","khaki","degree","intimacy"]}
