{"path":"552478.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image features an old, faded advertisement painted on a brick wall. The text reads \"Peckham Bread,\" although some letters are partially obscured or eroded, which makes the text appear vintage and rustic. The wall is built from bricks showing various aging signs, including different hues from tan to brown, spots of wear, and remnants of other painted-over ads or signs that have since been worn away.\n\nCentrally positioned on the wall is an air conditioning unit. The unit looks relatively modern compared to the aged appearance of the wall, with a white and gray exterior and positioned in a way that it directly overlaps some of the letters of the advertisement.\n\nThe overall composition depicts a contrast between old and new, highlighting how contemporary elements (like the air conditioner) are incorporated into historical or aging urban environments. The image captures a texture-rich scene that tells a story of changing times and uses.","title":"Sign and air conditioner on wall in buda","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552459","544081","552512","552463","545355","552511","547005","552498","553479","552533","547894","550141","549047","551754","544088","544720"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["wall","advertisement","unit","letter","ad","text","bread","pain","air","conditioning"]}
