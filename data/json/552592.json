{"path":"552592.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a library or study area where several people are engaged in academic activities. The room is adorned with wooden furnishings and fixtures, lending it a scholarly ambiance.\n\nIn the foreground, there are two adults, a man and a woman, seated at a round wooden table. They are intently involved in a collaborative task, possibly studying or reviewing documents together. The woman has long hair and is wearing headphones, while the man appears to be speaking to her or pointing something out on the paperwork.\n\nFurther into the background, individual desks arranged in rows accommodate students of various ages engaged in solitary study. Most of these students appear to be young, likely high school or college age. These desks hold numerous books and notepads, suggesting a concentrated study session.\n\nOn the right side of the room, there's a unique display of several large boards that seem to house collections of minerals or biological specimens in a grid format. This display adds an educational and scientific touch to the setting.\n\nThe overall environment is quiet and studious, with a classic wooden bookshelf adding to the academic vibe. The lighting appears to be natural, possibly supplemented by artificial sources to maintain a bright and inviting study space. The scene effectively conveys a moment of learning and intellectual engagement amidst a serene and traditional educational setting.","title":"Rock school, built in 1897, still serves the children of the piceance creek area.
