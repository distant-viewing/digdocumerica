{"path":"555284.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures an industrial scene at a container port. The central focus of the image is a large, steel gantry crane typically used for loading and unloading shipping containers from cargo ships. This crane features a prominent, complex network of steel beams forming an A-frame structure, painted in black and likely other colors too muted to distinguish in this view. Various mechanical components and pulleys, essential for crane operations, are visible on the upper parts of the structure.\n\nOn the right side of the crane exists a horizontal beam, known as a spreader, which appears to extend over a stack of cargo containers. These containers are tightly packed and organized in rows, and they display various identifying codes and an array of colors like red and blue, which add a touch of vibrancy to the otherwise metallic and industrial palette.\n\nDangling from the crane is a cabin, intended for the operator, descending towards the cargo area. The cabin is supported by thick cables that are part of the crane's lifting mechanism. Clearly visible are additional cables and wired arrays that contribute to the industrial complexity of the scene.\n\nIn the background, juxtaposed against a clear blue sky, are other structural and mechanical elements of the port, creating a layered visual of functional industrial elements. Below the main gantry crane, there is a visible placard that reads \"PASSE PARTOUT 30 T\", possibly indicating some operational specifics of the crane.\n\nThis photograph not only showcases the intricate machinery used in harbor logistics but also the engineering prowess in managing and moving large quantities of goods efficiently in a port setting.","title":"Machinery at the port of Newark, New Jersey, is used to load containers aboard ships for transport to various destinations","placename":"New Jersey","location":"New Jersey","nn1":["555283","555285","555261","555273","555269","546915","546881","546910","546934","547615","553741","547223","555270","546755","555260","555271"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["crane","container","port","cargo","cable","cabin","steel","beam","array","code"]}
