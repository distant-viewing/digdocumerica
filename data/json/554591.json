{"path":"554591.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil outdoor scene centered around a small pond situated in a lush woodland environment. The pond is relatively small and appears dark in color, reflecting the dense foliage surrounding it. The bank of the pond is thickly bordered with various greenery, including patches of tall, narrow-leaved grass and larger flowering plants.\n\nMost prominent in the foreground is a cluster of bright yellow flowers growing well-with their broad, green leaves offering a stark contrast against the darker tones of the pond water. There's a semblance of an old, brown foliage that lies cast aside near the flowering plants, giving a natural, somewhat untamed look to the scene.\n\nThe background is densely packed with various shades of green trees, primarily conifers, indicating this scene might be set in a temperate forest. Light filters through the trees, suggesting either a sunny day or a break in the foliage allowing a spotlight effect on the pond and its surrounding flora. The image imparts a quiet and serene mood, typical of a secluded natural spot, away from human activity. The overall composition emphasizes the beauty of natural, undisturbed landscapes.","title":"March marigold (caltha palustiis), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["542554","558094","543561","550784","554603","555229","554776","553410","554623","557783","544525","547536","550779","551349","551352","558009"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["pond","flower","foliage","spotlight","impart","conifer","plant","grow","flora","spot"]}
