{"path":"555617.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting with a predominantly rustic aesthetic. The image shows a large structure believed to be part of a facility, possibly a mill or a factory involved in material processing, given the presence of a conveyor belt and various chutes. Central to the photograph is a substantial steel tower, featuring a large cylindrical section painted in a weathered green hue. Emanating from this tower and a smaller neighboring structure are thick white plumes of smoke or steam, suggesting active operation.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by a flat, dirt-covered surface with tracks imprinted, likely from heavy machinery. No human figures are visible, placing the emphasis on the equipment and the facility's operation. The sharp contrast between the man-made industrial components and the lush, tree-covered hills in the background invokes a strong environmental or rural-industrial theme. The scene is bathed in bright natural light suggesting a clear day, enhancing the vivid colors and industrial textures of the setting. The overall composition underscores the impact or integration of industrial activities within a natural landscape.","title":"Gravel preparation plant in southeastern Ohio off route #800 near Morristown","placename":"Morristown (Athens County, Ohio)","location":"Morristown, Ohio","nn1":["551056","546236","557374","557375","550997","543011","557220","551026","550998","557225","551059","543009","554630","551060","544958","557373"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["tower","chute","integration","invoke","operation","facility","conveyor","underscore","belt","emphasis"]}
