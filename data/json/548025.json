{"path":"548025.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph is a scenic landscape depicting a lush, forested area with a background of distant mountains. The foreground is dense with both deciduous and coniferous trees, which are rich in shades of green, suggesting the view is taken in late spring or summer. Some trees have lighter, possibly flowering, foliage adding contrast and visual interest.\n\nThe mid-ground is a clearing that gradually rises to a distant rolling hillside, with darker toned vegetation suggesting a natural rural setting without apparent human development. The mountains in the background stretch across the horizon, with several peaks visibly overlapping each other, bathed in a bluish hue that indicates distance and atmospheric perspective.\n\nThe sky, occupying the upper third of the image, is dramatic, with large, elongated clouds that have both shadowed and brightly lit areas. The clouds appear dynamic, hinting at changing weather conditions. The overall lighting in the scene is soft, possibly due to the time being either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the warm but subdued light.\n\nThere is no human activity or built structures visible, enhancing the sense of a natural, untouched landscape. The overall composition of the photograph, with its layers of forest, hills, and mountains under a vast sky, conveys a serene and expansive natural environment.","title":"The Columbia River Gorge near Corbett.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["550602","550604","550537","557003","554459","545001","554531","543582","554398","554647","549139","550629","554400","552903","556906","550356"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["mountain","third","cloud","clearing","hillside","interest","spring","peak","summer","mid"]}
