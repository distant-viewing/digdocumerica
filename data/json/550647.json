{"path":"550647.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lively and rustic scene in a natural setting. It features a powerful, frothy river flowing prominently through the composition. The river is white and turbulent, indicating strong currents, possibly due to melting snow or recent rains.\n\nTo the left side of the image, there is a large wooden building with a peaked roof that extends over the water, possibly serving as a cover for a fish ladder or as part of a logging facility. This building has a utilitarian appearance, with weathered gray wood siding.\n\nIn front of this building, and occupying much of the middle ground, are numerous large, rectangular wooden crates or fish traps neatly arranged in several rows. These structures appear to be part of an aquaculture facility or a setup for managing natural resources, possibly involving fishing or fish rearing.\n\nThe background is densely forested with coniferous trees, underscoring the remote, wilderness setting of the scene. The sky is not clearly visible but suggests a bright sunny day, contributing to the vividness of the green trees and the stark white of the churning water.\n\nOverall, the photograph suggests an intersection of natural beauty and human industry, capturing a moment that blends environmental elements with practical human uses.","title":"Errol dam at lake unbagog on the Maine-New Hampshire boundary--source of the androscoggin river","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["548061","553392","547238","553416","550742","553855","550222","553420","549442","550658","553380","542743","550367","553389","544795","548091"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["fish","churning","aquaculture","crates","melte","trap","arran","peaked","ladder","rear"]}
