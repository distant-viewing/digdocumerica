{"path":"546171.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque natural setting of a river or stream with various features. In the foreground, the water appears shallow and flows over a rocky bed, creating small ripples and white foam that suggest gentle rapid movement. Some areas of the water surface reflect the sunlight, adding a sparkling effect to the scene.\n\nThe middle part of the river gets deeper and calmer, showing a darker shade of water, bordered by banks lush with abundant greenery. The trees are dense and rich in color, predominantly shades of deep green, indicating a healthy woodland environment possibly in the late spring or summer season.\n\nIn the background, the river continues its course, meandering slightly and flanked by more thick foliage that suggests an undisturbed natural area. The composition of the image, with its focus on the flowing water transitioning from rocky shallows to a tranquil stream, surrounded by a verdant forest, creates a peaceful and secluded atmosphere, typical of a woodland stream environment. The lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, enhancing the vividness of the green foliage and the textures of the water and rocks.","title":"Roadside drainage canal","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["554406","555076","544861","551348","542844","542557","542523","554762","555075","558085","550656","554407","555077","545861","550658","550845"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["stream","river","water","course","foliage","foam","vividness","bed","shade","ripple"]}
