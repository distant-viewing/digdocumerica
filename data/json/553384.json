{"path":"553384.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This image shows a construction setting, possibly within a mining or heavy industrial site, characterized by rough and rocky terrain. At the center, there is a large, bowl-shaped object resembling the rotor of a turbine. Its structure is intricate, featuring multiple radial divisions similar to spokes within a wheel, and appears to be made of wood or a composite material.\n\nNext to this object are three men, likely construction workers or engineers, wearing work attire that includes helmets and rugged clothing. One of the men is shirtless, perhaps indicative of warm weather or strenuous physical activity. They are standing on uneven ground covered with small stones and earth, suggesting an outdoor setting.\n\nThe background is a sloping hill composed of similar rocky and barren soil, hinting that the location could be a temporary construction or extraction site, possibly prepped for further industrial activity or machinery installation. There are no prominent structures or vegetation, emphasizing a focus on industrial development in the area. The environment and the attire of the individuals support the interpretation of an active, hands-on work scene in the energy, mining, or construction sector.","title":"Sewage treatment plant for Fitchburg under construction this is an epa-assisted project","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["556903","554426","544320","556893","556643","553827","545635","556503","551983","556350","545657","553385","554930","545631","556320","544048"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","mining","rotor","sector","interpretation","bowl","site","engineer","division","extraction"]}
