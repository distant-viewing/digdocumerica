{"path":"554203.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a mature man standing on a piece of farming equipment, possibly a plow, in a field. He is dressed in a long-sleeve shirt, trousers, a vest, and a cap, suggesting a cool weather or protection from the sun. His attire is practical and worn, suitable for manual labor. The farming equipment attached to a John Deere tractor is likely used for tilling the soil. The ground around him appears to be freshly plowed, with dark, fertile earth visible.\n\nThe background is a flat, expansive landscape typical of rural farmlands. The sky is overcast, casting a soft, even light over the scene which hints at a cool or temperate climate. Distant features such as small buildings or vegetation suggest the area is used for agriculture. There is a minimal presence of trees or other tall structures, emphasizing the openness of the space.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of rural work life, highlighting the relationship between a farmer and his machinery, set against the broad scope of agricultural land. The image conveys a sense of solitude and the magnitude of the task of farming, as well as the rugged perseverance of those who work the land.","title":"On a farm near Grygla, a retired farmer supplements his income by working land belonging to another man.","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["547734","544250","549259","554204","549036","555619","549051","548876","546986","547436","549042","542533","553665","555878","555528","544888"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["farming","plow","magnitude","farmer","scope","till","relationship","farmland","land","tractor"]}
