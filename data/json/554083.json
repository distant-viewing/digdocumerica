{"path":"554083.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil tropical scene, most likely in a coastal or island setting. Three prominent palm trees dominate the foreground, extending vertically across the frame. The palm trees are tall and slender with robust crowns of large, feathery leaves that catch the sunlight, casting subtle shadows and gleams on their trunks.\n\nIn the background, a modest single-story house with a reddish-brown roof and darker walls sits amidst lush greenery. The house appears to be of simple, traditional design, likely a residential home. It is nestled within a well-kept lawn that is bordered by various other tropical plants and shrubs, enhancing the feel of a garden oasis.\n\nThe sky above is a deep, clear blue, indicative of a sunny day without visible clouds, which suggests a peaceful and serene atmosphere. The presence of power lines on the right side of the frame adds a hint of human infrastructure to the natural setting.\n\nOverall, this photograph exudes a calm and relaxing vibe, typical of a quiet, tropical area where nature and simple living coincide. The orientation and lighting suggest that the photo was taken during the day, possibly in the late morning or early afternoon given the intensity of the sunlight and the shadows cast.","title":"House in rural district along Highway 36 near Hana.
