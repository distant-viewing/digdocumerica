{"path":"549615.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph shows a person actively engaging in scientific or marine research. The individual, wearing a bright red jacket, is standing on a large red boat, operating a cylindrical contraption that resembles a water sampling tool or plankton net. This tool is being lifted out of the water, where we can see water cascading from its structure, which is comprised of a metallic ring at the top with a series of bars forming a cylindrical shape that holds a white, tapered net. The net collects and filters the contents from the water.\n\nThe scene occurs in a maritime environment, suggested by the deep blue water surrounding the boat. There is direct sunlight which casts shadows and enhances the brilliancy of the colors, and the water appears relatively calm based on the lack of large waves or choppy surfaces visible. The focus of the image is on both the person and the scientific apparatus, indicating the activity of marine or aquatic research. This setting and activity suggest a context of scientific exploration or environmental study, taking place on a sunny day with clear skies.","title":"The \"martin karlsen,\" a canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in lake superior.
