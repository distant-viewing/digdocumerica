{"path":"551380.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph focuses on a striking cluster of vibrant red flowers with prominent yellow centers. They are densely packed, offering a lush visual texture. Among the flowers, two bees are noticeable; they appear busy, likely collecting nectar. One bee is positioned towards the left side of the frame amidst the petals, while the other is slightly towards the top right area. A green leaf or stem, significant in size compared to the small blooms, diagonally crosses the photograph adding a contrast in color and a dynamic line that breaks the uniformity of the floral background. The depth of field is shallow, keeping the central portion of the image sharp while gently blurring the periphery, which helps to isolate and emphasize both the insects and the flowers in the center from the darker, indistinguishable background.","title":"Butterfly weed (asclepias tuberosa) has a fragrance that attracts butterflies throughout the summer.
