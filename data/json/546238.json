{"path":"546238.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive outdoor landscape dominated by a large landfill. The main activity in the scene is centered around heavy machinery, specifically a large yellow front loader, which is in the process of managing waste. The vehicle is maneuvering through piles of rubbish that include diverse materials such as paper, plastics, and various other discarded items. The operator of the loader is visible, wearing what appears to be standard safety attire.\n\nThe foreground of the image is artistically framed by the dark silhouette of tree branches and leaves, which arc over the top of the photograph, partially obscuring the sky but focusing the viewer's attention on the scene below. This natural framing contrasts with the man-made waste and machinery, highlighting a juxtaposition between nature and human environmental impact.\n\nIn the background, the terrain of the landfill rises into small hills, covered with more layers of discarded materials. The sky above is slightly overcast, casting a diffuse light over the scene and adding to the somber mood set by the visible environmental degradation. A few additional elements such as containers and smaller machinery or vehicles are scattered across the background, indicating ongoing operations and the scale of waste management efforts at this site.","title":"City sanitary landfill operation.
