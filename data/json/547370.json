{"path":"547370.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor flea market scene under a bright sky dotted with fluffy clouds. The setting seems to be a grassy area with some sparse shrubbery in the background and overhead power lines visible. Several people are milling around, examining various items laid out on tables.\n\nAt the forefront, two women are engaged in conversation. The woman on the left, who is wearing a white beret and sunglasses, holds her hand to her chin, suggesting a gesture of interest or contemplation. She is dressed in a white jacket and a patterned dress. The woman on the right, wearing glasses and a purple blouse under a white jacket, holds a framed picture or tray, showing it to the other woman.\n\nThe tables are cluttered with a variety of objects that suggest a typical flea market assortment. Visible items include a large red and white lampshade, some decorative plates, a wooden barrel possibly used for decorative purposes, and what appears to be a children's toy or model airplane in the foreground. Other smaller items and trinkets are scattered across the table, adding to the busy and eclectic atmosphere typical of a flea market. \n\nThe image captures a typical moment of weekend leisure where individuals browse and shop for unique finds in a communal, informal setting.","title":"Saturday auction near hickman, Nebraska, 15 miles south of Lincoln","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557135","557131","557132","551749","551696","547378","551695","551694","551752","551750","551691","547374","551690","557161","557163","557130"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["flea","market","table","woman","item","browse","tray","toy","ching","jacket"]}
