{"path":"550242.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil lakeside scene. A young woman is at the forefront, walking through shallow water near the shoreline. She is dressed in a floral print bikini and her attention is directed downward, possibly watching her steps as she treads on the uneven lakebed. The water appears clear, reflecting light and creating small ripples around her legs.\n\nIn the background, another person, seemingly male, is lying face down on a large flat rock, sunbathing. This person appears relaxed in a casual posture, enjoying the sun. The surrounding area is natural and a bit rugged, with scattered rocks at the water's edge and thin branches or twigs partially submerged in the water.\n\nBehind, larger trees and lush foliage are partially visible, suggesting a secluded, natural setting. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is serene and leisurely, typical of a pleasant day spent by the lake.","title":"Hazardous walk off Huntington Beach on lake erie through algae and uprooted trees.
