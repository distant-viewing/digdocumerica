{"path":"544885.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a vibrant red flower with yellow accents blooming prominently at the center. The flower has rounded petals and a robust green stamen at its core. It is part of a cactus, which is covered in dense clusters of sharp, thin spines. Surrounding the flower, there are multiple buds in various stages of opening, some appearing more reddish and others more yellow, suggesting a variation in the stage of bloom.\n\nThe background is a blur of similar cactus plants, contributing to a cohesive, natural desert setting. The lighting in the photograph is bright, highlighting the vivid colors of the flower against the more muted, earthy tones of the cactus and its spines. The overall composition nicely captures the harsh yet beautiful essence of desert flora, focusing on the delicate yet striking appearance of the cactus flower amidst a thorny exterior.","title":"Barrel cactus.
