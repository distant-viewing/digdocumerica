{"path":"554856.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a work scene, focusing on two workers within an industrial or agricultural setting. The image is vibrant and colorful, depicting an outdoor environment.\n\nForeground: The immediate foreground shows a large pile of rich, reddish-brown earth occupying a large portion of the frame. This seems to be a type of soil or possibly raw material such as bauxite.\n\nMiddle ground: In this area, two men are present. The man on the right is wearing a yellow hard hat, a light long-sleeve jacket, and dark pants; he is actively using a shovel to scoop material into a bright red wheelbarrow held by the other man. The second man is wearing a white hard hat, a white long-sleeve shirt, and lighter pants. Both are engaged in manual labor, transferrring materials.\n\nBackground: Dominated by a dark, possibly wet surface that contrasts sharply with the brown soil. Various large pieces of light-colored, possibly wooden debris or construction material are heaped in the distance. The scene appears to be part of a larger excavation or mining operation.\n\nOverall, the scene depicts active, physical labor within an industrial/agricultural environment, characterized by open, rugged terrain and piles of material indicative of site work or resource extraction.","title":"Working from Mexico at a cedar mill near Leakey, Texas, near San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554937","547498","556893","556903","544154","548761","553138","556866","556939","555561","544138","557735","543785","544828","552545","555866"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["material","labor","soil","pile","scoop","sleeve","man","shovel","pant","hat"]}
