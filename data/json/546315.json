{"path":"546315.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a burnt-out car partially submerged in a body of water. The car appears to be an older model, greatly deteriorated, with its paint charred and peeled off, exposing the corroded and rusted metal beneath. All of the carâ€™s windows are missing, and its structure is severely damaged, indicating it has been abandoned and exposed to the elements for a significant period.\n\nThe vehicle is situated in a shallow part of a lake or river, with the water level reaching midway up the car doors. The water around the car is slightly rippled, suggesting either a gentle breeze or movement within the water. Green aquatic plants are visible near the car, indicating relatively healthy aquatic life despite the presence of the wreckage.\n\nThe background of the photo shows a skyline of dense trees on a distant shore, spanning from one edge of the photo to the other under a broad, partly cloudy sky. The clouds appear fluffy and mildly overcast, suggesting a calm, possibly humid day.\n\nThe photograph's general atmosphere evokes a sense of abandonment and the enduring impact of human objects on natural environments. It also serves as a stark contrast between the resilience of nature and the decay of man-made materials.","title":"Abandoned auto off the beach of santa rosa island","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["547839","547911","547835","546318","547605","547597","547481","547132","555850","546173","547484","547601","546405","555849","547024","548751"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["car","expose","missing","charr","wreckage","deteriorate","endure","beneath","spann","out"]}
