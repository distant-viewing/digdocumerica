{"path":"552182.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This aerial photograph features an expansive industrial area situated along a river. The dominant structures are part of a large industrial complex, characterized by multiple large buildings, smokestacks, and some emitting white smoke which blends with the foggy sky. A noticeable circular building with a unique spiral design sits prominently near the waterfront.\n\nAdjacent to these industrial facilities are large open areas that seem to be used for storing materials such as brown heaps that could be minerals or another raw material, which are both enclosed and uncovered. The infrastructure supporting this industrial zone includes various roads and bridges that connect the complex to the broader surrounding area.\n\nThe river that flanks the industrial site appears wide and is crossed by at least one visible bridge, enhancing the connectivity of the area. In the broader setting, beyond the immediate vicinity of the industrial complex, there are more urban and green areas, suggesting nearby residential or less industrialized zones. The overall atmosphere of the photo is somewhat moody, with the fog or smoke partially obscuring parts of the landscape, giving a slightly obscured view of the entire scene.","title":"Smoke from st.
