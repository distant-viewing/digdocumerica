{"path":"544329.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"The photograph features a striking, candid street scene that vividly captures a moment in daily life. Central to the image is an old orange GMC pickup truck, heavily used with visible dings and scratches. In the back of this truck, there are four individuals, most likely a family or a group of close companions. Three of these individuals are women dressed in vibrant, traditional garments, predominantly in shades of red and purple; one wears a significant turquoise necklace, indicative of Native American jewelry. They seem to be engaged in a casual conversation, enjoying each other's company.\n\nThe driver of the truck, partially visible behind the wheel, appears to be a younger male with shorter dark hair, facing away from the camera towards the road.\n\nBehind the pickup, there's an old-fashioned white bus, adding a historical depth to the scene, highlighting public transportation of the time. Other elements, such as another vintage car parked beside the bus, suggest a busy street setting typical of mid-20th century America.\n\nThe background gives a glimpse of a commercial area with store signage visible, including one that reads \"Drugs\" in a classic mid-20th-century style, implying the photo was taken in a town or city center.\n\nOverall, the photograph is a vivid portrayal of a moment in time, showcasing personal interactions within the context of a broader urban environment, underscored by a palpable sense of vibrancy and community connection.","title":"Navajos in town for Saturday morning shopping","placename":"Window Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Window Rock, Arizona","nn1":["542803","557684","546092","556542","553117","544349","556595","543471","549866","553488","548272","557705","552087","543856","545331","551324"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["pickup","truck","bus","turquoise","jewelry","companion","scratch","necklace","century","garment"]}
