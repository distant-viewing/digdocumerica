{"path":"548842.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and introspective moment of a person floating leisurely in a body of water. The image is dimly lit, possibly suggesting it was taken during the evening or in a shaded environment.\n\nThe individual in the water is shown with only their face and part of their shoulders visible above the surface, facing upwards. Their eyes are closed, and their expression is one of calm and relaxation, evoking a sense of peacefulness or meditation. The person's skin appears shiny and wet from the water, reflecting some of the light.\n\nThe water around the person is dark, and the background is almost entirely obscured by the darkness of the surroundings, focusing the viewer's attention primarily on the subject. The surface of the water is textured with ripples and highlighted by glints of light, possibly from sunlight or artificial lighting, creating patterns that resemble sparkling specks or small bubbles.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, along with its limited light and color palette, lends a kind of intimate and tranquil atmosphere to the scene, capturing a moment of personal solitude and reflection.","title":"Swimming in havasu lake","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548835","547712","548291","542556","550826","544343","548972","550237","544196","550940","552226","545229","548844","557255","543753","557572"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["person","glint","bubble","intimate","water","shoulders","speck","sparkling","facing","shaded"]}
