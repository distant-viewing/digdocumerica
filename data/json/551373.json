{"path":"551373.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a small, red-orange mushroom growing amid natural forest floor debris. The mushroom features a smooth, rounded cap and is positioned on a angled thin stalk. It emerges prominently in the foreground against a dark, textured backdrop composed of a large, decayed leaf that dominates much of the frame. The leaf, likely from a broadleaf tree, exhibits rich brown tones and a detailed vein structure, adding a complex texture to the image.\n\nSurrounding the mushroom, the ground is covered with a mix of other organic materials, including green grass blades, smaller leaves, and possibly moss, contributing to the lush and damp environment typically favorable for mushrooms. The lighting in the scene appears natural and diffused, casting gentle, soft shadows and highlighting the vibrant color of the mushroom against the darker, earthy tones of the forest floor. The setting suggests a quiet, undisturbed spot in a densely wooded area, emphasizing the natural beauty and the intricate ecosystem of a forest habitat.","title":"Mushroom grows beside fallen oak leaf in Lake of the Ozarks State Park.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["555017","557624","555181","558076","555006","555179","557595","555015","558081","557612","555014","553032","555018","554593","557006","555026"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["leaf","forest","floor","stalk","vein","blade","habitat","ecosystem","spot","tone"]}
