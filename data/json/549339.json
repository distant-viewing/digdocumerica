{"path":"549339.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a woman engaged in scientific or laboratory work aboard a ship or marine environment. The woman is standing near a table and is pouring a substance from a small bottle into a beaker, suggesting the performance of some sort of experiment or analysis.\n\nThe setting is indoors, featuring a clean and organized space with wooden walls and what appears to be a narrow corridor or room customized for research. Directly in front of the woman is a large, transparent tank labeled \"FRAGILE HANDLE WITH CARE,\" which contains several containers or aquarium sections, each holding different specimens or materials submerged in a clear liquid. These could be biological samples for marine research.\n\nOn the left, there is a sturdy shelf cluttered with various items such as a backpack, papers, and more tools that look important for scientific work. Above the woman, the ceiling has built-in lighting and a fan, essential for ventilation.\n\nThe scene is well-lit, probably by artificial light, emphasizing the focus and isolation of the work area in what might be the challenged environment of a ship adapted for scientific investigations. The orderly and functional arrangement of the space suggests a professional and serious research environment.","title":"Research laboratory in the vila velebita ii, the hydrobiological research ship on the ruder boskovic institute.
