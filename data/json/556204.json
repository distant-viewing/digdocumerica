{"path":"556204.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This is a vibrant, colorful photograph capturing a busy parking lot scene, likely from the mid to late 20th century, judging by the style and model of the vehicles. The parking lot is packed with various cars that predominantly reflect the automotive design styles of the 1960s or 1970s. These cars, ranging from sedans to coupes, feature distinctive vintage designs with long hoods and chrome detailing.\n\nThe setting appears to be a public or possibly commercial area during a sunny day, as indicated by the bright blue sky and fluffy white clouds overhead. In the background, there are multiple structures, including a small blue-roofed kiosk and a larger green-roofed building which may serve a commercial or transportation-related purpose, given the context. There's also a playground or park area visible, featuring a merry-go-round and some greenery.\n\nPeople of various ages are scattered throughout the scene, some walking towards or away from their cars, two individuals are notably conversing beside a car, and others are engaged in casual activities typical of a parking lot setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a slice of everyday life, emphasizing the car culture of the era, set in an urban or suburban community space.","title":"Motorists wait in line at Soldier's Field, one of nine auto pollution test sites conducted free by the City of Chicago's Environmental Control Department.
