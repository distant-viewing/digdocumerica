{"path":"554316.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban street scene dominantly featuring several classic yellow taxicabs. The taxis, which are representative of an older model, each painted in a uniform yellow, are in various states of motion and rest. The focus of the image is on the closest taxi, seen from the rear view, occupying a prominent portion of the foreground with a slightly blurred effect suggesting movement or a quick snapshot. \n\nDeeper into the image, the taxis vary in their style and orientation, all bearing the iconic black checkered design and taxi signage on the side, indicative of a typical American city settingâ€”potentially New York City given the renowned prevalence of such taxis there historically.\n\nIn the background beyond the line of cabs, many pedestrians are visible. They appear engaged in typical city life activities, walking along the sidewalks or crossing the street. Buildings line the background with relatively indistinct features, though they present typical urban architecture. Notably, a canopy that could belong to a hotel or a significant building extends over the sidewalk, shading the pedestrians beneath.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests daylight hours with shadows under cars and on the streets, reflecting a vivid, dynamic urban atmosphere. Overall, the composition of this photograph, with its tight focus on clustered objects (taxis) and bustling background activity, vividly portrays an energetic moment within a city's life, emphasizing the taxis as a key element of the urban transportation network.","title":"High concentration of taxis on Fifth Avenue near 48th Street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554315","549868","554331","549848","554330","548331","554310","554314","549869","549899","549862","549876","548410","549859","549873","549874"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["taxi","pedestrian","sidewalk","city","street","representative","orientation","hotel","cab","belong"]}
