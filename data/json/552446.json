{"path":"552446.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a large dumpsite with a variety of discarded items set against a stark, rocky desert background. The foreground features an accumulation of waste materials, including numerous black and white plastic bags filled with trash, and scattered cardboard boxes, some of which are crushed or torn open. Miscellaneous pieces of trash and smaller debris are dispersed throughout the area.\n\nIn the background, a rugged mountain with hues of brown and reddish tones rises under a clear blue sky. The terrain around the dumpsite is similarly barren and rocky, emphasizing the arid environment. The scene is illuminated by bright sunlight, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the contrast between the natural landscape and the man-made waste. The overall composition of the image paints a stark contrast between the natural beauty of the desert terrain and the environmental issue of waste disposal, suggesting themes of pollution and human impact on natural landscapes.","title":"Abandoned mine in Ladd is used as city dump.
