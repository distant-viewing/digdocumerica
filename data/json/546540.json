{"path":"546540.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph presents a scene viewed from a shaded area looking into a brighter, sunlit space. The foreground is dominated by a dark silhouette of a tunnel-like structure, acting as a frame for the activities happening outside. This creates a contrast between light and shadow, enhancing the subjects captured in the midground and background.\n\nIn the sunlit area, several people are visible, engaged in different activities. To the left, two people appear to be jogging or running through the space, dynamically captured in mid-action which suggests movement. In the center, there are several individuals who seem to be standing and watching or waiting. Their poses are relaxed and they are spaced at intervals, giving a sense of casual observance or participation in the scene.\n\nOn the right, two people with bicycles are prominent; one seems to be walking beside their bike, while the other is slightly behind. The bikes add a recreational or commuter vibe to the scene.\n\nThe background features a paved open space bordered by what appears to be a railing or barrier, potentially indicating an elevated area or walking path. Trees can faintly be seen behind this railing, adding a hint of natural environment to the urban setting.\n\nOverall, the composition cleverly uses the darkened foreground to frame and draw attention to the lively and varied activities in the illuminated background, portraying a snapshot of everyday life with both motion and tranquility.","title":"Lincoln Elementary School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546450","555930","556226","547821","549283","544808","553249","546443","557410","550074","553822","550075","553769","553226","555947","550076"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["bike","railing","space","interval","commuter","tunnel","participation","people","bicycle","pose"]}
