{"path":"554723.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph offers a vivid aerial view of a scenic landscape during autumn. The composition is predominantly filled with richly colored foliage, showcasing a palette of red, orange, yellow, and green trees. These vivid autumn colors suggest the season and provide a warm, appealing aesthetic.\n\nA long, curved road runs through the center of the image, seemingly dividing the residential areas from the wooded regions and lakeside. This road provides a sense of direction and leads the viewer's eye across the image.\n\nTo the left of the road, several houses and structures are nestled among the trees, close to the edge of a calm and reflective lake. The presence of buildings adjacent to the lake suggests a residential neighborhood that enjoys waterfront views. The lake itself extends towards the top of the image, mirroring the sky and treelines, which contributes to the serene atmosphere.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there are more houses and what appears to be a small commercial area with parked cars and a cluster of buildings, including one with a notably white roof that could be a commercial establishment.\n\nThe overall ambiance conveyed by the photograph is peaceful and picturesque, typical of a tranquil, natural setting that could be ideal for leisure and living alike. The setting might be a popular location for those seeking the beauty and calm of a lakeside community intertwined with the charm of forested areas, especially during the fall season.","title":"Aerial view of the village of Inlet, New York, typical small Adirondack Forest Preserve hamlet with one main street","placename":"Fourth Lake (N.Y.)","location":"Fourth Lake, New York","nn1":["554651","554712","554758","554714","554649","554648","554757","558061","554751","554711","558104","554635","554761","554713","557127","554756"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["lakeside","lake","road","autumn","season","run","treeline","house","establishment","calm"]}
