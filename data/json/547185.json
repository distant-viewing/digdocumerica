{"path":"547185.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a rural or semi-rural setting, featuring three individuals and two cars on a narrow road lined with bare trees, suggesting it might be during a cooler season or in an area with sparse vegetation. The road, which appears somewhat wet, possibly due to recent rainfall, leads off into the distance where it curves slightly out of view.\n\nOn the left side of the image, an older car, possibly from the 1960s based on its design, is parked perpendicular to the road. The car's license plate reads \"RM 1363\". Nearby, two men and a woman are standing. The woman, wearing a light-colored coat and a scarf, stands slightly apart from two men who appear to be engaged in conversation. The men are both dressed in dark-colored coats and hats, typical of colder weather attire. The tallest man on the right seems to be wearing a trench coat and a flat cap.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, another car, also an older model which looks distinctively long and broad, is parked facing directly towards the camera on the same road. Like the scene around, the car is illuminated by natural lighting, suggesting a bright sunny day despite the cool weather suggested by the subjects' clothing.\n\nThe background is relatively open with sparse vegetation and a few structures that are barely visible, giving the sense that this area is not heavily populated. There are also utility poles and lines seen running parallel to the road, enhancing the feel of a developed yet not overly urbanized area. The overall ambiance is quiet and calm, focusing on a seemingly casual encounter or discussion on a country road.","title":"Lake Michigan storm flooded this road in Zion","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["544853","546596","557874","557684","557841","552412","555944","547141","551941","554031","552800","551021","548303","552795","548483","546849"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["road","coat","car","trench","man","country","scarf","license","weather","rainfall"]}
