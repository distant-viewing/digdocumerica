{"path":"554312.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The image captures a vibrant, bustling city scene, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s based on the visual clues from clothing and vehicle design. In the foreground, a large number of bicycles are parked densely along railings, showcasing a variety of designs and specifics such as different types of handlebars and one with a front basket. These bicycles are resting on a textured pavement, indicating a designated bike parking area.\n\nThe background is lively with numerous people walking and engaging. Some are dressed in business attire, suggesting a weekday downtown setting. The area is surrounded by signs and advertisements, including one for \"TY Films\" and trucks that hint at the dynamic urban environment. Corporate branding on a truck reveals “NEVAMAR,” and a hint of greenery from planted areas adds a touch of nature to the urban setting.\n\nThe overall composition and atmosphere suggest a city possibly in the United States, due to the English language on signs and the architectural styles visible. The image provides a snapshot of city life, with its mixture of daily commuter activity and the busy pace of urban surroundings.","title":"Bike racks in front of the Time-Life building, Sixth Avenue and 50th Street","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551443","551456","551645","548388","546743","551849","554310","548399","556708","554297","555782","548410","551646","549872","551135","550139"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["bicycle","city","truck","specific","handlebar","branding","commuter","language","pace","designate"]}
