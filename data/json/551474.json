{"path":"551474.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph offers a high angle view of an urban street, capturing a street scene that appears to be from mid-to-late 20th century based on the architecture and style. The image seems to be taken from an upper floor of a building looking down on a clean, well-maintained street flanked on both sides by large commercial buildings. The architecture is modern, with elements such as large windows and patterned facades.\n\nOn the left side of the street, a large building stretches out, featuring a long series of windows near its base, possibly indicating a department store or a similar commercial establishment. The building to the right has a vertical emphasis, with taller windows and a darker facade.\n\nThe street itself is shaded by young trees planted at regular intervals. Several pedestrians are visible, strolling along the sidewalks. There are a few cars and what appears to be one or two buses, indicating moderate traffic. Street lamps and other urban fixtures like trash bins are strategically placed, contributing to the orderly appearance of the space.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the urban planning and architecture of the street, conveying a sense of quiet daily life in a city setting. The photograph's faded colors suggest it might have been taken several decades ago, giving a historical glimpse into the urban design of the time.","title":"From the roof of Northern States Power Company--Nicollet Mall in a rain shower","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553840","551478","553301","556225","546745","546428","555450","556807","555782","548388","553845","556249","556681","542900","550111","546626"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","architecture","interval","facade","window","bin","fixture","building","planning","establishment"]}
