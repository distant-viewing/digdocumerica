{"path":"545332.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a serene indoor scene focused on a young boy lying on a couch. He appears relaxed, with one arm resting on his chest and the other slightly extended, holding what seems to be a small object. The boy is wearing a white t-shirt and dark shorts. The couch features an eye-catching blue floral pattern with a fringe blanket thrown over its edge.\n\nThe surrounding area includes another bed or couch draped in a blue and white checkered blanket, creating a cohesive but simple decor. The flooring is carpeted, enhancing the cozy atmosphere of the room. On the far side of the couch where the boy is lying, there's an intriguing additionâ€”a portable box television displaying a black-and-white image of a figure that draws the viewer's eye due to its distinct, somewhat contrasting appearance in the setting.\n\nThe lighting is soft and natural, suggesting a quiet moment possibly in the morning or afternoon. The overall mood is peaceful and reflective, with the focus primarily on the boy's calm repose and the intimate domestic space around him.","title":"El Paso's second ward, a Chicano neighborhood.","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["553528","546565","546561","556459","553546","557352","553517","553529","553522","556610","556606","553532","552114","553170","556624","548454"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["couch","boy","blanket","lie","television","fringe","flooring","throw","eye","addition"]}
