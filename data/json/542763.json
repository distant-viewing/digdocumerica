{"path":"542763.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside an automobile service or inspection station. In the foreground, two men from the back, presumably mechanics or technicians, are observing a white, vintage sedan that is being inspected or repaired. They are dressed in light-colored work shirts, suggesting a uniform, and one is bald while the other has dark hair.\n\nThe car is parked inside the garage, stationed next to a large, complex machinery possibly related to vehicle diagnostics or emissions testing. The machinery features various gauges and monitors, some positioned on a metal rack structure, and has red tanks associated with it, likely containing fluids or gases necessary for the vehicle inspection process.\n\nInside the car, another individual is working, visible through the open doors. The trunk of the car is also open, perhaps to access additional components or systems for inspection.\n\nThe setting of the image has an industrial feel, with visible tools and equipment scattered around, including hoses on the floor. Natural light filters through windows or openings at the back, casting gentle lighting across the workshop, highlighting the car and machinery amidst the more shadowed areas of the space. The environment suggests a typical day at an auto service station, busy with the task of vehicle maintenance and inspection.","title":"Emission testing","placename":"Los Angeles County (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles County, California","nn1":["557853","557850","557852","557885","557858","557897","557906","557861","557902","557905","549689","557860","557833","553490","557889","557911"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["inspection","machinery","car","service","station","back","monitor","auto","technician","vehicle"]}
