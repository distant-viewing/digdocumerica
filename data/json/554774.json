{"path":"554774.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural outdoor scene, likely taken in a rural or semi-wilderness area. The focus of the image is on a dirt path or trail that cuts through a landscape. The path is deeply rutted and appears to have been eroded, suggesting it may be frequently used or subject to heavy runoff. It meanders upward through the center of the frame, leading towards a small hill crowned with bare soil or possibly light grass, indicating either recent excavation or poor vegetation growth.\n\nOn either side of the path, there are sparse deciduous trees, most of which are bare, suggesting the season might be either late fall or winter. The ground is covered with dried leaves, twigs, and possibly remnants of grasses, which are typical for a deciduous forest floor during these seasons. The general tone of the vegetation and landscape is rather bleak and muted, with browns, grays, and dull greens dominating the scene.\n\nThe sky, partially visible at the top of the image, is overcast, contributing to the overall subdued and cool atmosphere of the setting. The lighting is diffused, with no direct shadows, which aligns with an overcast day.\n\nThere are no visible people or animals in the photograph, emphasizing the solitude and perhaps the desolation of the scene. The environment looks untouched by modern human structures, enhancing its natural and rugged character.","title":"Erosion created a mudslide which pushed through a stand of trees off route 146","placename":"Freeland (Ohio)","location":"Freeland, Ohio","nn1":["555215","545341","545604","555639","553464","550345","545588","553057","555127","557018","554720","554802","545294","548673","545534","547660"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["path","season","crown","runoff","twig","erode","grass","desolation","dry","meander"]}
