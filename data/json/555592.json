{"path":"555592.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph features a rugged natural landscape, predominated by a large cliff or rock formation with a distinctly worn, almost vertical profile. This geological feature stands prominently on the right side of the image, covered mostly by greenish-brown vegetation that suggests it might be moss or grasses able to cling to the rock surfaces. The rock itself appears jagged and eroded, indicating significant natural weathering.\n\nThe landscape around this rock formation is covered with a blanket of grass or heather, captured in hues of dark amber and green, suggesting it could be taken during a season other than summer, possibly late autumn. The sloping hill on the left fills about two-thirds of the frame, and there is an interesting interplay of light and shadow across its surface, highlighting the undulating terrain.\n\nIn the far background, glimpses of a softer, rolling landscape can be seen under what seems to be a clear sky, hinting that the terrain might gradually become less rugged moving away from the rocky features in the foreground. The overall composition evokes a remote, somewhat desolate natural environment dominated by elements of rock and hardy vegetation. The scenery is devoid of any visible human activity or man-made structures, emphasizing its wild and untouched quality.","title":"Harrison Reclamation Area, one of the areas that have been recontoured and seeded and made into a recreation spot by the coal companies","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["544363","555589","544392","555587","552685","549147","552444","551520","550477","552445","554410","543838","555616","549151","545805","545724"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","formation","third","blanket","weathering","grass","feature","moss","profile","terrain"]}
