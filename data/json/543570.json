{"path":"543570.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial setting, likely a water treatment or sewage treatment facility. The main subject is a large, circular concrete basin with a central, cylindrical structure supported by metal beams. In the basin, there are remnants of a greenish water or chemical, forming irregular patterns on the basin's floor.\n\nIn the background, there are various industrial buildings including one with a large chimney or stack. These buildings are constructed with a mix of materials evident from different roof styles and wall textures. Metal railings and walkways surround the basin area, suggesting maintenance access points.\n\nThe surrounding environment features tall pine trees, and in the far distance, snow-capped mountains can be seen, providing a natural and scenic backdrop contrasted by the industrial foreground. The sky is overcast, which adds a somewhat gloomy tone to the setting. There are no visible people in the image, focusing the viewer's attention on the industrial elements and natural landscape.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["549635","543524","543568","543573","552168","552984","543571","547568","545836","543572","545840","543574","548137","548212","548196","548128"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["basin","treatment","pine","metal","chemical","walkway","remnant","access","chimney","railing"]}
