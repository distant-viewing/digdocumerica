{"path":"552163.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a scenery likely at a logging site. It features an expansive area filled with numerous logs that are neatly arranged and others scattered across what appears to be a lumber yard. In the foreground, one can see a paved area with logs lying longitudinally, creating almost uniform rows. Beyond this area, the layout is more cluttered and disorganized with logs floating in a body of water.\n\nTowards the center and left of the photograph is a large industrial facility, possibly a mill. The facility consists of several buildings with dark roofs, and there's visible smoke or steam emanating from a tall chimney, indicating ongoing operations. The background is dominated by a dense forest on a hill, suggesting the site is located in a valley or a similarly enclosed natural area. The trees are lush and provide a rich green contrast to the industrial activity in the foreground.\n\nThe sky above is clear, hinting at good weather conditions, and the overall lighting suggests this photo was taken during daytime. The scene is devoid of any visible human activity, focusing solely on the industrial and natural elements presented.","title":"Log storage in tidal basin of chambers creek.
