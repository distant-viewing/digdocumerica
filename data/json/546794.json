The foreground is dominated by sandy beach where numerous beach-goers are seated or lying on towels and beach chairs. In the foreground, two women seated on folding chairs are facing away from the camera towards the water, engrossed in conversation. There are other individuals around them engaged in similar activities, some reclining and chatting, while others are attending to their belongings scattered across the sand.\n\nMoving towards the middle ground, more people are visible, including individuals standing and walking along the shore. In the water, there's a bustling scene of swimmers of varying agesâ€”some are wading, others are swimming further out. It's a diverse group, comprising children, teenagers, and adults.\n\nIn terms of attire, many of the beach-goers are in swimsuits, ranging from bikinis to full swimsuits, which reflect styles possibly from the 1960s or 1970s given the color and design patterns. Some individuals are also seen in casual beachwear like shorts and t-shirts.\n\nThe background features calm water that stretches to the horizon under an overcast sky, hinting at a muggy summer day. The atmosphere of the beach is vibrant and relaxed, typical of a busy public beach during peak season.","title":"On the beach at Sandy Point state park","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["547503","546874","546942","548541","547482","550931","547628","550919","550243","547491","555923","550932","547507","550929","553685","546768"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","goer","swimsuit","chair","swimmer","teenager","belonging","bikini","wade","engross"]}
