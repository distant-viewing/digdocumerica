{"path":"543535.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque scene by a lake. In the foreground, there is an individual sitting on the sandy shore of the lake. This person, who appears to be a young adult, is wearing dark pants, a green jacket, and has short dark hair. They are seated facing the lake, with their back towards the camera, suggesting a moment of contemplation or enjoyment of nature.\n\nThe lake itself is calm with a few scattered rocks protruding from its surface, and it stretches out to meet a striking mountain range in the background. These mountains are covered with snow, indicating that the photograph might have been taken during the colder months or in a region where peaks remain snow-capped year-round. The sky is clear and blue, adding to the tranquility of the setting.\n\nThe lighting suggests that the photo was taken during the day under clear weather conditions, which enhances the visibility of the distant mountains and reflects the blue sky in the water. The overall composition of the photo, with the calm lake in the middle, mountains in the background, and the peaceful solitary figure, evokes a sense of solitude and the beauty of nature.","title":"Nevada -- Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["543816","550493","555692","543601","543547","552974","545229","543546","552978","551207","543643","543505","543618","554399","553396","543532"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","mountain","snow","month","round","year","protrude","remain","contemplation","enjoyment"]}
