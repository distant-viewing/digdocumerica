{"path":"550101.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This image depicts a suburban street scene, possibly captured in the mid 20th century. The foreground shows a motion-blurred red truck speeding past on a road, evidencing the photograph's capture during a quick moment, likely to emphasize speed or movement in everyday life. The truck's blur contrasts sharply with the stillness of the rest of the scene.\n\nIn the background are two rows of neatly aligned two-story houses, typical of suburbia, with varying shades of white, brown, and red brick facades. Each house features a front yard, some decorated with small trees, and a driveway with parked cars, suggesting a quiet residential area. American flags are visible on some of the houses, contributing to the portrayal of a patriotic, middle-class neighborhood.\n\nThe environment is lush with green grass and mature trees, indicating a well-established community. Overhead utility lines and street lights suggest municipal infrastructure typical of such areas. The overall ambiance is peaceful and orderly, with clear signs of residential life and personal vehicle use, reflecting a slice of American suburbia possibly during the late 20th century.","title":"Freeway truck streaks by residential street","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["558157","556435","557667","547859","558039","546430","557840","551021","547433","545419","550994","551102","553705","557365","544452","555584"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Residential Neighborhoods"],"terms":["house","truck","class","driveway","century","capture","portrayal","blur","street","speed"]}
