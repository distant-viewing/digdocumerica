{"path":"556364.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts a male miner working in an underground setting, visible by his attire and equipment. He wears a helmet equipped with a headlamp, suggesting a dimly lit environment typically found in mines. The miner is engaged in looking at or picking up scattered metallic objects on the ground, which seem to be parts of mining equipment such as bolts and metal pieces, suggesting maintenance work or retrieval of used material.\n\nThe background is dark and difficult to discern, emphasizing the focus on the man and the objects he interacts with. Infused throughout the scene are bright, sparkling specks that could be reflective dust particles or small fragments of metal catching the light, which adds a gritty and realistic touch to the mine setting.\n\nThe overall composition is both dynamic and rich in detail, conveying a sense of the physical demand of the work and the isolated, enclosed space characteristic of underground mining operations. This realistic portrayal highlights the environment's challenges and the manual labor involved in such settings.","title":"Jerry Yates, the section foreman of Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #3 near Richlands, Virginia, checks the teeth of a continuous miner to see if any are loose or missing. The coal is pushed back into a shuttle car which takes the material to the end of the tunnel for removal from the mine. Most coal in the U.S. is mined by this method.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["556357","556358","543775","556396","556366","556360","556359","556510","556397","556367","556319","556363","556515","556511","556517","556329"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Miner"],"terms":["miner","mine","mining","demand","bolt","headlamp","particle","speck","fragment","equipment"]}
