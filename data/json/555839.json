{"path":"555839.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This is a microscopic image showing numerous tiny particles or specks distributed across the field of view, set against a dark, somewhat granulated background. There are several larger, brighter formations that are more distinct and show intricate details. These larger formations appear luminescent, with internal structures that look somewhat crystalline or clumpy. Their colors vary slightly, with shades of white and subtle touches of orange or yellow. The overall appearance is reminiscent of what one might see when observing a sample through a microscope, perhaps in a scientific setting like studying minerals, chemical crystals, or even astronomical bodies in a simulation of space. The mood conveyed by the image is one of intricacy and scientific exploration.","title":"Detritus and small swimming bacteria photographed at the Atlantic Marine Fisheries Laboratory at Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The smallest organisms like bacteria are most buoyant and therefore can survive better in turbid or polluted waters where they have to be able to stay on the surface to get enough light. Research there is being done on the bight's chemical and biological processes.
