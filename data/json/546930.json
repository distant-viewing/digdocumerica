{"path":"546930.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image depicts a scene of numerous dead fish floating in a body of water. The water appears dark, suggesting it could be a deep and possibly polluted water body. The fish are all white or light-colored, floating belly-up, which is a common indication that they are deceased. The surface of the water is scattered with various white specks, which could possibly be bits of ice, froth, or pollutants, reflecting the light and contrasting starkly with the dark water.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or any other objects in this photograph, putting the entire focus on the environmental issue possibly being portrayed here. The arrangement of the fish and the state they are in suggests a significant ecological or environmental problem, such as a fish kill, which can be caused by factors like pollution, lack of oxygen, or a sudden change in water temperature. The overall mood conveyed by the image is somber and possibly serves as a call to attention towards water pollution and its impact on aquatic life.","title":"Dead menhaden float along the tide line just north of Chesapeake Bay Bridge","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["555560","546846","547687","546898","547704","552067","542985","546782","547737","546784","546185","546779","546792","550878","545063","555784"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","water","factor","pollution","froth","pollutant","temperature","indication","speck","ice"]}
