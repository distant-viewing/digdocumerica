{"path":"544467.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of destruction likely caused by a natural disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane. In the foreground, we see scattered debris including broken cinder blocks, roof fragments, and various other building materials strewn across a grassy area. The majority of the blocks appear hollow and are made of concrete, some having remnants of paint on them.\n\nIn the middle of the image, there is a partially destroyed stone building. The building appears quite small and is standing with significant damage to its structure. It features a stone facade, and several elements like a green wooden frame and what appears to be parts of a collapsed roof are visibly hanging or disjointed. \n\nThe background of the image is less chaotic but still shows signs of damage, with scattered debris and possibly other ruined structures visible behind the main stone building. Large, healthy trees surround the area, suggesting that the location might typically be quite scenic or residential. The sky is clear blue, indicating that the weather has cleared up following the destructive event.","title":"Part of widespread damage caused by flooding of Guadalupe River","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["544463","544583","544464","544468","547079","544454","557993","550260","544797","547130","547888","544587","547868","555540","553556","557350"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["stone","damage","block","cinder","disaster","majority","fragment","destruction","debris","building"]}
