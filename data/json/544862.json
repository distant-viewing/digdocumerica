{"path":"544862.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures the dynamic flow of water rushing over dark, wet rocks in a natural outdoor setting. The scene is filled with smaller and larger boulders, each slick and glistening under what appears to be bright, natural light. The water is in motion, with white frothy currents vigorously cascading down and around the rugged terrain of the rocks. The waterâ€™s motion is vividly frozen in this image, creating streaks and splashes that convey a sense of energy and natural power.\n\nThe background is dark and shadowy, contrasting with the whiteness of the water and the reflective surfaces of the moist rocks. There are no visible plants, animals, or human elements; the focus is solely on the elemental interplay between rock and water. The image's composition emphasizes the textures and the chaotic, uncontrolled flow of the water, giving it a wild and untouched feel. The overall impact is one of witnessing a small yet powerful natural spectacle, a moment of unrefined beauty in a possibly remote natural location.","title":"East Dallas Creek","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["544867","552061","550843","545882","542743","544856","553416","543869","545874","545839","554407","543172","549442","550697","550742","542699"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["rock","flow","water","motion","spectacle","streak","current","boulder","splash","outdoor"]}
