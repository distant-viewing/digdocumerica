{"path":"544924.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a candid moment of a young man in an outdoor setting, apparently preparing for or taking a break from a hike or rock climbing. The person is seated on a sandy ground against a large reddish-brown rock wall which is textured and layered, suggesting a desert or canyon area.\n\nThe young man is wearing a deep red long-sleeve shirt, blue jeans, and appears barefoot at the moment. He is focused on tying or adjusting rock climbing shoes that feature a white rand and black and white pattern on the upper part. In his immediate vicinity, there's a visible climbing harness wrapped around his waist, indicating his activity may involve climbing. A large, modern blue and black backpack with reflective linings is propped against the rock, hinting at a potentially extended outdoor adventure.\n\nOn the ground beside him, another climbing shoe is visible, along with what looks like a rolled-up item, possibly a sleeping pad or jacket, endorsing the idea of a multi-purpose outing such as camping or trekking. The natural light suggests daytime, and the overall atmosphere invokes a sense of adventure and the exploration of natural surroundings.","title":"Backpacker","placename":"Escalante (Utah)","location":"Escalante, Utah","nn1":["545773","553370","545786","554460","545781","545697","545782","545766","545776","545762","545753","550443","545785","545758","545770","545493"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["climbing","rock","shoe","adventure","sleep","idea","pad","harness","prop","hike"]}
