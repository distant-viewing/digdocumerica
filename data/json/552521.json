{"path":"552521.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This image features a landscape view which appears to be captured during either dusk or dawn, giving it a softer light and slightly blurred quality. In the scene, there is a dirt road running parallel to a series of utility poles that are aligned neatly along the road. The road slightly curves to the left towards the horizon. On the left of the road, there is a canal or waterway filled with water that reflects the light, enhancing the mood of the photograph. This water body is bordered by grass and shrubs.\n\nOn the far left, the land is potentially farmed, possibly a field, though the specific crops are not distinct. The overall terrain is flat, typical of many agricultural or rural areas. The sky above is misty, adding a layer of haze to the scene, which contributes to the tranquil and somewhat melancholic atmosphere of the image. There are no visible people or moving objects, providing a sense of stillness and solitude. The landscape is primarily natural with minimal human alteration, except for the road and utility poles, suggesting a balance between nature and human-made structures. The composition leads the viewer's eye along the road, inviting one to ponder what might lie beyond the visible scene.","title":"Early morning","placename":"Havana (Ill.)","location":"Havana, Illinois","nn1":["544678","556960","547300","554127","547354","547316","542895","555881","549261","545349","549235","556985","557091","549182","557013","554131"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["road","utility","pole","alteration","softer","canal","leave","stillness","crop","align"]}
