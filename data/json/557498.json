{"path":"557498.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic wetland ecosystem, characterized by a vivid display of natural textures and colors. In the forefront, lush green grass and clusters of tall reeds are present, appearing robust and densely gathered at the edge of a water body. The water, expansive and occupying the middle ground of the scene, shows varied coloration, ranging from clear reflections of the sky to green hues, indicating the presence of algae or aquatic vegetation.\n\nThe expanse of the water is topped with patches of green algae and perhaps some surface plants, adding a textured layer that hints at the richness of the aquatic life beneath. The far background showcases a gentle slope with what appears to be cliffs or a hillside, sparsely dotted with small structures that might be houses or small buildings, suggesting a human presence but not overtly altering the natural vista. Above the landscape, the sky is clear and predominantly blue, suggesting a calm, bright day.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the natural elements in the foreground leading to signs of human habitation in the background under a wide sky, offers a serene yet vibrant snapshot of this wetland environment. This setting could be significant for ecological studies or nature observations, illustrating a peaceful coexistence of natural beauty and minimal human impact.","title":"Buena Vista Lagoon, is one of the last Bodies of water of this type in Southern California. There is concern for the wildlife sanctuary because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments. Coastal wetlands necessary to maintain wildlife totaled some 381,000 acres in 1900. By the early 1970's that amount had decreased to about 125,000 acres.","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["547488","545033","550783","550786","550785","547924","547500","550670","547532","553856","547589","557445","542554","544515","545114","545008"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["algae","wetland","richness","vista","coloration","reed","coexistence","observation","study","habitation"]}
