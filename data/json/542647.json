{"path":"542647.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a relaxed and communal outdoor scene at a riverbank. Several individuals are grouped together in various casual poses, enjoying a day out by the water. Most seem engaged in activities such as fishing and conversing.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a group composed of about half a dozen people seated on the grass. Among them, one individual wearing a cowboy hat is noticeable, sitting closely with others who are dressed in casual, comfortable clothes, some in buttoned shirts and one in a vibrant orange mesh top. There are fishing rods lying in front of them, with one still propped up suggesting that fishing is part of the day's activities.\n\nThe lush green grass slopes down towards the water where a line of buoys in the river is visible, with a bridge spanning the background. Several more individuals can be seen further along the bank, spaced out and also seemingly engaged in fishing or strolling around. There's also a dog walking in the mid-ground area, adding a lively touch to the serene setting.\n\nThe lighting appears soft and natural, indicating either a cloudy day or a time when the sun is not at its peak, casting gentle shadows and giving the riverscape a calm, inviting ambiance. The overall vibe is informal and leisurely, typifying a communal outdoor gathering focused on relaxation and enjoyment of the natural environment.","title":"Rainbow trout fishing below dam","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["546811","554475","543943","548737","551571","546803","557740","549935","551350","543164","542564","551525","551499","551430","548188","545933"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["fishing","riverscape","dozen","buoy","mesh","individual","grass","dog","rod","clothe"]}
