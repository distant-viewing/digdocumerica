{"path":"552633.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a meat processing facility or butcher's shop. In the foreground, a worker, prominently displayed, is dressed in a yellow apron and holds a pair of large cutting tools, possibly cleavers. He is also wearing glasses and displays a proud or satisfied expression. Behind him, three other workers can be seen; two of them are wearing white helmets, possibly for safety precautions, and white uniforms typical in food processing environments. The other individual, slightly behind the main figure, is dressed similarly to him but without a helmet.\n\nThe background is filled with large pieces of meat hanging from hooks, typical of a meat locker or storage area in such a facility. These meats appear to be large beef carcasses, divided into halves. The environment suggests a focus on meat processing, indicated by the industrial setting, overhead rails used for moving and storing the meat, and visible elements like exposed pipes and a simple, functional light fixture.\n\nThe setting is utilitarian with a focus on functionality, typical of industrial or commercial food preparation environments. The overall atmosphere suggests teamwork and the serious nature of meat processing work.","title":"The Rifle packing plant, a family operation, processes locally grown livestock.
