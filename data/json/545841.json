{"path":"545841.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph displays an aerial view of a large industrial complex, presumably a power plant or chemical processing facility. The complex is characterized by multiple large buildings with metal frameworks, densely packed with pipes, tanks, and cylindrical structures, possibly boilers or reactors. The dominant colors are shades of blue and gray, with some red accents visible on certain structures, likely as part of the machinery or safety features.\n\nIn the immediate foreground, there is a series of tall, dark smokestacks projecting upwards, and directly adjacent to these are long, sheltered conveyor systems that appear to transport materials into the plant. The area is well-organized, with paved roads and neat grassy lawns separating the various sections of the facility.\n\nThe surrounding environment features bodies of water on both sides of the installation, suggesting it might be located near a coast or river. There are power transmission towers and lines spreading from the plant towards the horizon, emphasizing its possibly significant role in power generation. The distant background shows a flat landscape with minimal vegetation, possibly typical of an industrial zone or a less inhabited area.\n\nThe overall scene is void of visible human activity, focusing purely on the infrastructure and suggesting the photograph serves industrial, survey, or documentary purposes.","title":"Houston Lighting and Power Company on Galveston Bay","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["544495","551994","545833","549726","549727","545837","545992","546087","543872","557392","544494","546122","550339","549960","549215","551998"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["power","complex","plant","documentary","transmission","generation","facility","coast","conveyor","accent"]}
