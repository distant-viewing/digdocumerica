{"path":"554206.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a weathered, reddish stone tombstone with a circular hole in which a vintage black-and-white photo of a woman is set. The woman has a solemn expression and is looking directly at the camera. Her hair is styled in a bun, typical of older fashion. The hole is rimmed with white, perhaps some sort of protective or decorative outlining that has aged and deteriorated slightly over time.\n\nThe stone itself is rough and weathered, with speckles, textures, and some scratch marks visible on its surface. The edges of the circular opening are not perfectly smooth, indicating natural erosion or hand tooling.\n\nIn the background, slightly out of focus, a tranquil rural cemetery scene is visible. There are lush green trees and what appears to be neatly arranged white grave markers or fences spreading across the ground, suggestive of an organized and well-maintained burial ground. The sky is bright, contributing to a peaceful, serene ambiance. The contrast between the aged, textured stone in the foreground and the vibrant, life-affirming background underscores a poignant reminder of memory and continuity amidst a resting place.","title":"Portrait of Alma Geline Momrak, set into gravestone at St Pietro's Lutheran Church in Grygla","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["554210","550365","546098","547417","550731","552451","558040","557942","557184","550364","552017","548239","554824","554792","557941","552486"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["hole","stone","bun","tombstone","continuity","memory","reminder","scratch","cemetery","rim"]}
