{"path":"542815.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph features an ornate, Victorian-style building facade characterized by a series of bay windows and detailed wooden trim. The architecture includes three prominent bay window sections with a rich display of wooden ornamentation that includes scrollwork, brackets, and dentil mouldings around the top of each section. These architectural elements are painted in contrasting colors, mainly a dark, charcoal gray and a stark white, enhancing the visual depth and intricate design of the facade.\n\nThe windows themselves have arched frames at the top filled with patterned, frosted glass, which adds to the historical aesthetic. Below the windows, the ground floor showcases tall, narrow windows separated by wooden panels. Also noteworthy are the columns with Corinthian capitals that frame what appear to be doorways on the ground floor, contributing to the grandeur of the building.\n\nIn the lower part of the image, there is a man standing in the shadow of one of the bay windows. He is dressed in what look like casual clothes and appears to be either exiting or entering through a tall door, interacting in some way with the building or merely passing by.\n\nThe scene is brightly lit by sunlight, underscoring the contrasts in color and shadow, and reflecting off the glass areas. The background is primarily the building itself, filling most of the frame, with no distractive elements, which focuses attention solely on the detailed architectural features and the lone figure of the man related to the building's scale and usage. The overall composition underlines the historical and architectural significance of the building while providing a human element for scale and interaction.","title":"Controlled development and thoughtful restoration make this old farming town an attractive place to live","placename":"Ferndale (Calif.)","location":"Ferndale, California","nn1":["555949","557073","557066","557074","557643","550042","558156","557634","552535","542893","557286","542811","558031","556046","543028","556276"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["bay","window","building","facay","frost","floor","bracket","underline","capital","panels"]}
