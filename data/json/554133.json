{"path":"554133.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural, wooded landscape prominently featuring a \"For Sale\" real estate sign. The sign is attached to a tall, seemingly dead tree stump in the center of the image. The sign text announces the land for sale and lists the name \"Howard Reynolds\" as the contact, mentioned to be \"Maui's biggest real estate broker.\" Contact details including a phone number and an address on Market Street, Maui, are visible.\n\nSurrounding the sign, there are scattered rocks and debris covering the ground, suggesting a rough, possibly volcanic terrain typical of certain areas on Maui. A variety of shrubs and small trees with dense, green foliage partially obscure the sky in the background, indicating that this area is somewhat remote and undeveloped. The overall mood is somewhat bleak and untamed, emphasizing the natural state of the land being offered for sale.","title":"Sign in an area of land speculation near Manuka Park in the Kau district, on the southwestern side of the island","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554123","543556","554034","543115","545049","557553","547648","549039","552988","543557","543100","543528","543101","556989","545824","543637"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["sale","estate","contact","sign","address","phone","land","stump","name","number"]}
