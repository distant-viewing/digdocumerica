{"path":"553703.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The image shows a construction site with a wooden frame of a building under construction. The structure appears large and scaffold-like, supported by numerous wooden beams and studs outlining what may be multiple rooms or sections. The foreground prominently features a stake in the ground, tied with a fluttering yellow ribbon, symbolizing ongoing construction or marking specific survey points.\n\nThe ground around is barren and muddy, suggesting recent excavation activities. The scene is lit with what seems to be late afternoon sunlight, casting long shadows and giving the wooden frame a warm glow.\n\nThe background is scenic, showing a clear sky with sparse clouds and vague outlines of mountainous terrain, contributing to a serene yet industrious atmosphere. The environment implies a rural or semi-urban setting undergoing development. No people are visible in this image, focusing the viewer's attention on the architecture and rugged landscape.","title":"\"New town\" grows where pineapples used to thrive.
