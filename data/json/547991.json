{"path":"547991.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a striking aerial view of a rugged coastline along a deep blue body of water. The coastline is made up of a series of steep cliffs that curve along the water's edge, showing visible layers of sediment and rock formations. These cliffs appear primarily in lighter shades of beige and white, indicating possible erosion from water activity.\n\nThe terrain above the cliffs is uneven and sparsely vegetated, dotted with small shrubs or bushes that are scattered across the landscape. The vegetation has a dry appearance, typical of a semi-arid environment. The clear, unobstructed view suggests the photograph was taken from a significant height, possibly from an aircraft.\n\nThe water adjacent to the cliffs is a dark blue, reflecting depth and possibly hinting at a significant drop-off near the shorelines. There are no visible human activities or structures; the area is pristine and natural. The composition of the photograph, with its contrasting colors and textures between land and water, emphasizes the dramatic and rugged beauty of this coastal landscape.","title":"Low water on the Columbia River in the Franklin D.
