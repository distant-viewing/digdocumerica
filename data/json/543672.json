{"path":"543672.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive outdoor scene with a focus on a sloped, terraced landscape. The setting appears to be a hilly area covered with dense vegetation, predominantly trees and shrubs, in shades of green and earth tones. A noticeable feature of the landscape is a series of layered terraces, probably man-made, which cut through the hillside. These terraces appear to be barren or only sparsely vegetated compared to the surrounding areas, suggesting they might be under construction or in the process of being rehabilitated.\n\nTowards the center-right of the image, there is a large yellow bulldozer, which is positioned on one of the lowest terraces. The bulldozer stands out due to its color and size relative to the natural surroundings. It is actively engaged in either moving earth or shaping the terrace, as indicated by its placement and the disturbed soil around it.\n\nThe background of the photograph shows more densely vegetated hills, illustrating a contrast between the natural landscape and the modified terraces. The overall atmosphere is one of interaction between human activities and the natural environment, typical of a construction or landscaping project in a wooded, hilly area.","title":"Road building for new housing development","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["543760","556456","547254","554544","555608","546950","543105","549255","547939","549175","548807","543114","555601","545665","549169","551262"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["terrace","bulldozer","earth","construction","landscaping","placement","project","hillside","shrub","landscape"]}
