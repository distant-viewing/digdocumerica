{"path":"547074.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a moment on a construction or renovation site. The scene is centered on a man running towards the camera. He is wearing a red headband, a dark zip-up jacket, light blue shorts, white socks, and running shoes. His focused expression and running posture, with his left knee raised and right arm forward, suggest he is engaged in a serious workout.\n\nIn the background, a large crane dominates the upper portion of the photograph, stretching across the sky with its arm extended and hook hanging down. It seems to be a key component in the construction activity occurring at the site, evidenced by the presence of construction barriers and rubble on the sides of the road. The roadside features a \"Speed Limit 30\" sign, which, along with typical street lamps and traffic signs, set this scene in an urban or suburban setting that's currently under development.\n\nThe sky is overcast, hinting at a cool or chilly weather, supported by the runner's attire. The overall atmosphere of the photograph combines elements of urban development with personal fitness activity, emphasized further by the runnerâ€™s determination and the industrial backdrop.","title":"Jogging along Lake Michigan in Evanston.
