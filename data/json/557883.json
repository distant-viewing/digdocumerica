{"path":"557883.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of individuals, mostly men, gathered in an industrial or workshop setting. The men are dressed in similar attire, consisting of white short-sleeve shirts and dark pants, suggesting a uniform, possibly indicating they are coworkers or part of a team.\n\nMost of the people are engaged in conversations with each other. A few individuals are leaning against or standing near what appears to be red workbenches or tool carts. There is one person in the foreground seated on a stool, seemingly listening or participating in the discussion.\n\nThe background features large glass windows allowing natural light to fill the room, and through the windows, one can faintly see vegetation outside, indicating the setting is not in a densely urban area. The interior lighting is subtle, mostly relying on the natural light from outside.\n\nThe overall ambiance of the scene hints at a break or casual gathering within a workday, where colleagues are interacting probably about work-related topics or casual conversations. The use of red on the workbenches/tool carts adds a touch of color to the otherwise neutral-toned setting.","title":"Auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, had an overabundance of employees in the summer of 1975 because of the change over from semi-annual to annual inspections and the fact that police were not ticketing vehicles. All vehicles in the city are safety tested. Light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles also are hooked up to an exhaust analyzer for a check of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["545537","555290","546628","552616","544022","557899","547365","542607","553636","557727","552368","554870","547368","556028","556314","555233"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["cart","tool","colleague","topic","rely","stool","conversation","workday","team","participate"]}
