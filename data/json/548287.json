From left to right:\n\n1. A woman wearing glasses, a pink dress with a light-colored belt, and black shoes. She is accessorized with a watch on her left wrist.\n2. A man dressed in a light beige, short-sleeved shirt, dark trousers, and dark sunglasses, with a watch on his left wrist.\n3. Another woman in a pink shirt and dark red trousers, standing with her hand gently resting on her hip.\n4. The final woman on the right wears a horizontally striped blue and white sweater and blue trousers.\n\nThe people are standing on a neatly maintained lawn. Behind them is a house with a striped awning extending over a porch area. The structure appears to be made of bricks or a similar material, with visible elements like a white door and a window beside which a utility meter is mounted. The scene includes a clear blue sky and a bright day. Behind the group and across the street is another house and a distinctive white water tower, both partly obscured by the figures and foreground elements. The setting suggests a comfortable, residential neighborhood.","title":"One of 36 families of montz, whose homes were appropriated by the u.s.  Corps of engineers.
