{"path":"547706.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban street scene that appears to be from a bygone era, likely in the 1970s or 1980s based on the style of clothing and vehicles. The scene captures a moment shortly after a car accident involving at least two vehicles. One car, primarily in the foreground, has a visibly damaged front end, with the hood crumpled and opened, resting against a dark-colored sedan, also appearing damaged, stopped in traffic.\n\nAround these two central vehicles, a group of people is gathered, likely discussing the incident. The individuals include men in various outfits: one wears a light-colored fedora and a brown leather jacket; others are in casual attire such as jeans and simple shirts or jackets. The expressions and body language suggest a mix of concern and curiosity.\n\nThe background shows a busy city street lined with buildings that have commercial businesses on the ground floors. Several other cars and a delivery truck are visible on the street, indicating a typical busy day. There is an overcast feel to the sky, suggesting muggy or cloudy weather which casts a soft, diffuse light over the entire scene. The overall atmosphere evokes a moment of unexpected pause in the hustle of city life due to the car accident.","title":"Traffic congestion in harlem","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548355","556734","556709","549882","551324","548388","551913","556724","548369","554309","550020","546626","549273","549932","554310","545351"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["accident","car","damage","street","incident","vehicle","fedora","delivery","crumple","language"]}
