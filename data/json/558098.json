{"path":"558098.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene on a clear, sunny day at what appears to be a golf course. Two people are the central focus of the image, and they are standing in a small body of water, possibly retrieving a golf ball. Both individuals are bent over the water's surface, and it seems they are focused on something in the water, with one person extending their arm towards it.\n\nIn the background, thereâ€™s a well-maintained, lush green lawn that stretches across the scene, punctuated by taller, dense trees that form a natural backdrop. A golf cart, parked on the grassy area, is loaded with golf bags, positioned to the right side of the image. There are also small patches of sand, likely sand traps, and several flags indicating the holes on the golf course visible in the upper section of the photograph.\n\nThe overall setting appears tranquil and leisurely, typical of a golf course environment, with an emphasis on the actions of the individuals immersed in the task of retrieving an object from the water. The sunlight enhances the vivid colors of the landscape, creating a vibrant outdoor setting.","title":"BRandywine golf course located on the Akron-Peninsula road south of Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron.
