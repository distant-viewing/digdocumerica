{"path":"548200.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a large, industrial-looking barge moving through a wide body of water. The barge is painted in white and red, and it's heavily loaded with what appears to be sections or parts of concrete structures. A navigational tower with a small enclosed shelter at its peak can be seen on the barge, probably used to oversee navigation and operations.\n\nIn the background, there's a striking mountain visible under a clear blue sky, suggesting a volcanic feature given its conical shape, possibly Mt. Hood if this is in the Pacific Northwest. The water scene is busy with numerous smaller boats around the barge, likely there for either support or as part of a special event or operation, given their number and organization.\n\nThe far background shows the shores that have patches of forests and some developed areas with buildings barely visible. The overall composition of the image combines industrial activity with natural beauty, showcasing the interaction of human industrial endeavors within a natural landscape.","title":"Columbia river barge and a flotilla of small fishing boats mt.
