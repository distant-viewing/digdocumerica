{"path":"545755.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and rugged landscape, likely set in a desert or arid region. At the center of the image stands a person facing away from the camera, adding a sense of scale and solitude to the scene. This person is dressed in a bright red jacket and blue jeans, contrasting with the natural tones around them.\n\nThe terrain is primarily dusty and covered with scattered rocks and sparse vegetation, including small shrubs and a few larger green bushes that dot the landscape, adding a bit of color to the predominantly earthy tones.\n\nIn the background, towering cliffs rise dramatically, their surfaces marked with layers of sedimentary rock showcasing various shades of red, orange, and white. These cliffs provide a majestic backdrop to the scene, emphasizing the grand scale and the rough texture of the environment.\n\nThe lighting suggests it might be late afternoon or early morning, as the light appears soft and angled, casting long shadows and highlighting the textured surfaces of the rocks and cliffs. The sky is not visible in the photograph, keeping the focus tightly on the landforms and the lone figure amidst the vast natural setting.","title":"Inside the maze, a remote and rugged region in the center of the Canyonlands.
