{"path":"551078.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features a serene outdoor scene dominated by a narrow, rocky stream flowing from the bottom foreground towards the upper right background. The streamâ€™s banks are overgrown with green and reddish bushes, contrasting with the grey and white stones visible in the shallow water.\n\nTo the right of the image, set back from the stream, there is a community of modest houses partially obscured by lush, large trees. These houses appear to have one-story structures with gabled roofs and porches, typical of a rural setting. One house visible in the foreground has a dark color scheme with white trim around the windows and doors, and another building behind it also shares a similar architectural style.\n\nThe area surrounding the stream and houses is heavily wooded, indicating a location away from urban centers. Overhead, utility poles and suspended wires suggest some modern infrastructure, though they blend discreetly into the backdrop of dense green foliage. The overall ambience of the photograph is quiet and natural, suggestive of a peaceful countryside environment.","title":"Kelly's Creek reaches the Kanawha at Cedar Grove","placename":"Charleston (W.
