{"path":"542826.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a rugged landscape heavily impacted by what appears to be logging activity. The terrain is uneven and marked with numerous clear-cuts where large swathes of trees have been removed, leaving bare patches and debris scattered on the ground. These barren areas form irregular patterns and are interspersed with remaining forested sections that appear dark green, showing contrast against the brown, disturbed earth.\n\nIn the foreground, at the bottom of the image, is a body of water, dark and smooth, possibly a river or a lake. The edge of the water body is lined with trees and debris, some of which has fallen into the water, possibly as a result of the logging activity.\n\nThe landscape is a mix of exposed earth and remaining vegetation, indicating significant human intervention likely aimed at resource extraction. This intervention has dramatically altered the natural environment, which is vividly depicted through the stark contrast between the raw, exposed areas and the remaining patches of dense green forest. The clear cutting has created a patchwork effect, visual evidence of the environmental impact of such activities.","title":"'Clear cutting'","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542834","545143","542833","555085","542840","542827","542825","556922","542823","542832","555094","542820","550354","542881","555208","557001"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["intervention","cutting","earth","evidence","result","patchwork","cut","extraction","debris","logging"]}
