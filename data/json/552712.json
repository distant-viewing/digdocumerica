{"path":"552712.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban scene characterized by a busy multi-lane highway filled with vehicles from what appears to be the 1960s or 1970s, judging by the styles of the cars which include sedans, station wagons, and trucks. The vehicles are traveling in both directions on the highway, with several lanes allocated for each direction. \n\nTo the left of the highway is a river, reflecting a calm presence adjacent to the busy road. Alongside the river, there is lush greenery, and a neat, well-maintained riverbank is visible. \n\nIn the background, the city skyline is prominent, featuring a mix of residential and commercial high-rise buildings. The architecture includes a variety of styles, indicating a mid-20th-century urban development. Notable in the skyline are a few distinctive tall buildings, which could possibly serve as landmarks.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph contrasts the natural tranquility of the river and green spaces with the dynamic, mechanical movement of the highway and the urban development represented by the skyline. This composition beautifully captures an element of city life, showcasing the blend of nature and urbanity in a significant metropolitan area. The viewpoint seems to be from an elevated position, possibly from a bridge or another highway crossing, providing a wide, encompassing perspective of this vibrant urban landscape.","title":"Schuykill expressway (i-676) speeds traffic between center city and the northern and western suburbs","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549857","546686","546574","545432","546707","546681","546713","553721","547780","545467","546616","546581","556194","546704","546698","555781"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","skyline","direction","river","development","crossing","encompass","city","landmark","wagon"]}
