{"path":"556672.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph portrays a close-up view of a hand holding a small, rectangular punch card positioned in front of a voting machine or similar electronic device. The background is predominantly dark, but on the left side of the image, there is a vertical list of names attached to the machine, which seem to be voters or nominees. The card held in the hand contains pre-printed text and boxes, presumably for selection. Notable are the four red horizontal lights visible on the machine, glowing through a dark translucent panel, indicating active or interactive elements of the device. The setting gives an institutional or bureaucratic feel, typical of election polling stations or similar environments where such technology might be used for recording or tallying choices.","title":"Amtrak passenger train tickets are printed by computer to speed customers on their way. This ticket was made at a suburb of Washington, District of Columbia, for a trip to New York City on the Metroliner. Several trains make a total of 16 round trips between the two cities daily with four to five stops enroute. Some 18,000,000 passengers in the U.S. rode the corporation's passenger trains in 1974, an increase of 10 percent from the previous year.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["545369","556258","545384","546648","547739","555241","556384","556750","551875","557331","555266","557394","552358","547743","547720","548892"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["card","machine","device","selection","choice","hand","technology","panel","box","name"]}
