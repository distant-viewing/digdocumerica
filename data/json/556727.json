{"path":"556727.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban street scene congested with numerous cars, depicting a traffic jam. The image is filled with vehicles of various models and colors, dominated by the styles typical of the mid to late 20th century. There are sedans, station wagons, and a couple of trucks, all closely packed and appearing to be at a standstill.\n\nThe view is slightly elevated, looking over the hood of one car into the sea of other vehicles. In the foreground, the closest car's hood and part of the roof are visible, framing the rest of the scene.\n\nThe background features urban architecture, likely a mix of commercial buildings, with lush green trees lining the road, providing a contrast to the metal and glass of the vehicles and buildings. There's a glimpse of some street signs and traffic lights indicating an intersection ahead.\n\nIt seems to be a cloudy day, as the overall lighting is soft, without harsh shadows, contributing to the somber ambiance of a traffic-heavy day in the city. A person wearing a red cap is seen standing by the roadside, partially obscured by the vehicles, adding a human element to the scene, underscoring the impact of the traffic on everyday life.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed is one of congestion and the slow pace of travel in an urban setting, reflecting common challenges in city transportation systems.","title":"Monumental traffic jams resulted during a bus strike in Washington, District of Columbia, during May, 1974, as drivers learned there were more cars than places to park legally. Some 250,000 persons were forced to find alternate methods of transportation, usually their cars. Drivers faced this ordeal twice each day during the several day strike. As a result they had to park in bus lanes, on traffic \"islands\", in \"no parking\" zones, and on sidewalks and lawns.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556729","556732","542684","546370","553893","549903","556734","556195","557229","545884","552711","548419","553719","549874","549849","549919"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["traffic","hood","vehicle","jam","car","pace","congestion","city","street","wagon"]}
