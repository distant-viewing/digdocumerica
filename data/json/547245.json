{"path":"547245.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and evocative night-time scene focused upon a large body of water. The main element of interest is the moonlight or a distant light source reflected strikingly on the water’s surface, creating a shimmering pathway of light that leads the viewer’s eye across the frame. In the middle of this illuminated path are two small figures, likely people in a canoe. They appear as silhouettes due to the backlighting and the darkness of the night, which obscures details about their identity or activities. The overall atmosphere of the image is tranquil and somewhat mysterious, urging contemplation. Surrounding these features is the darkness of the night sky and the still, dark water, which intensifies the contrast of the sparkling light reflections. The background is completely absorbed by the night, offering no additional details but enhancing the focused effect of the glistening water path and the small silhouetted figures within the canoe. This composition subtly invites an appreciation of quiet and solitary moments in nature.","title":"Sunset on the potomac","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547550","550822","547230","557603","554474","554466","549060","551280","557255","550389","548978","552237","544725","551214","551572","551223"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["night","canoe","darkness","path","identity","intensify","appreciation","backlighting","figure","absorb"]}
