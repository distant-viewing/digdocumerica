{"path":"557910.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene featuring two individuals. A senior woman wearing a light pink polo shirt, with her glasses slightly down her nose, gazes intently towards a younger man on the right side of the frame who is holding and possibly explaining something printed on a piece of paper. The exact content of the paper is not clear, but it appears to be a form or ticket with text and numbers. The woman has a serious and attentive expression, suggesting a conversation of some importance or interest.\n\nThe man, seen partially and blurred, is dressed in a white shirt, and only his arm and the document in his hand are clearly visible. His face is not visible in the frame, directing the viewer's focus primarily on the woman and her reaction. The background of the image is dark and out of focus, placing full visual emphasis on the interaction between the two individuals. The atmosphere suggests an indoor setting, possibly an office or similar workspace, evidenced by some indistinct objects and structures in the dimly illuminated background.","title":"Motorist, left, listens to a city employee explain the exhaust emissions test at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["551337","543906","557894","557872","553202","551482","545478","551436","556028","557033","552931","557037","557909","554097","553217","557868"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["paper","woman","reaction","ticket","polo","nose","explain","importance","print","workspace"]}
