{"path":"550719.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph features an industrial scene that appears to be part of an old and possibly abandoned facility near a water body. The focus is on an aged concrete structure with signs of deterioration and weathering. There are large openings or bays at the base of the structure, partially filled with murky water with foamy patches, suggesting possibly stagnant or slowly moving flow.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a rusty metal staircase leading upwards, indicating multiple levels to the facility. The staircase is in a state of disrepair, covered in spots with dirt or grime, reinforcing the sense of abandonment and neglect. Alongside the staircase is more of the foamy water, which seems to be flowing or accumulating at the base of the structure.\n\nAdditional imagery includes deposits of a white, chalky substance along the borders of these waters, contributing to the scene's old and unkept feel. The perspective and light in the photo suggest an overcast or gloomy day, which further enhances the somber tone and atmosphere of the photograph.","title":"Outflow from the oxford paper company mill at rumford on the androscoggin river","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["547622","547582","547581","547579","547985","551984","543258","543320","549564","547890","551562","552135","554565","552071","550201","551985"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["staircase","grime","flow","imagery","deterioration","base","accumulate","facility","deposit","substance"]}
