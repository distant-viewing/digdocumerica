{"path":"553244.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures a moment between two individuals engaged in a conversation outdoors during the daytime. A man, positioned on the left side of the frame, is holding a piece of paper and seems to be either reading from it or explaining something to the woman. He has curly light brown hair and is dressed in khaki pants paired with a plain, light-colored shirt.\n\nMeanwhile, a woman sits on a raised, textured concrete platform or structure to the right side of the frame. She is wearing a plaid, long sleeve shirt over pink pants and seems interested in the interaction, focusing on what the man is discussing. She has a comfortable posture, with her right hand near her chin, possibly indicating curiosity or thoughtfulness.\n\nOne of the most notable elements in the scene is a large white sign with black text hung around the manâ€™s neck, facing the camera. The text reads, \"IF YOU'VE GIVEN UP SEARCHING I'M WORRIED ABOUT THAT.\" This suggests the man could be conducting some form of street activism or public engagement related to social or philosophical issues.\n\nThe background shows lush, green foliage softly blurred, likely from a park or a similarly wooded area, contributing to a peaceful, yet earnest atmosphere perfect for meaningful conversations. The lighting suggests it might be midday due to the clarity and brightness of the image.","title":"August brings the \"D'Aug Days\" to Fountain Square. \"D'Aug Days\" is a month-long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
