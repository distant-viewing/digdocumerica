{"path":"544793.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy urban street scene likely captured in a U.S. city during the mid to late 20th century, given the aesthetic of the vehicles and signage. The street is bustling with activity, featuring multiple lanes of traffic with cars and trucks from the era, including a distinctive blue van toward the front of the photo.\n\nOn both sides of the street, numerous commercial signs and billboards are visible, advertising various businesses such as \"CONOCO,\" \"Mountain State Bank,\" and \"TV & Radio Service.\" These signs, typical of the period, are colorful and eclectic, contributing to the vibrant and busy atmosphere of the scene.\n\nIn the distance, the street is flanked by larger buildings, and a prominent dome-topped building stands out, suggesting a significant public or governmental structure. Beyond the urban environment, the background shows a mountainous landscape, suggesting that this city might be located near a range of hills or mountains.\n\nThe sky is clear, and the lighting indicates a bright, sunny day, casting shadows and enhancing the vivid colors of the scene. Multiple traffic lights and utility poles line the street, adding to the urban infrastructure visible in the shot. The presence of people can be observed, but they are not the main focus of the photo; rather, they blend into the overall bustling nature of the street scene.","title":"6th avenue west","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["547369","551135","545216","547651","554709","549886","555782","542586","545498","545614","549872","546743","545618","551125","551071","549882"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","traffic","billboard","city","dome","van","advertise","lane","shot","sign"]}
