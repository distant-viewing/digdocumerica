{"path":"553391.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph depicts a construction site in a large open area surrounded by trees in the background. The scene is busy with many elements indicating ongoing construction work.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several red stakes with red ribbons tied to them, marking boundaries or sections within the site. Scattered around the site are numerous construction materials including wooden planks, metal rods, concrete forms, and construction machinery.\n\nA significant section of the site includes a partially constructed foundation made from concrete and supported by wooden and metal frameworks. There are several large concrete blocks and prefabricated sections visible, likely used for building retaining walls or other structures.\n\nTowards the center and back of the image, there are two large cranes. One crane is in the process of being operated, evident from its extended arm. There is also various other heavy construction machinery including at least one bulldozer.\n\nThe environment suggests it could be a warm, possibly summer day due to the bright sunlight and clear skies. The construction work appears to be in an initial or mid-stage of a potentially large infrastructure project, given the scale and the amount of heavy equipment involved.","title":"Sewage treatment plant for Fitchburg under construction on the Whitman River.
