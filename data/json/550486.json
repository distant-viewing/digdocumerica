{"path":"550486.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic natural landscape, primarily characterized by its rugged terrain. In the center of the image, a small stream or rivulet is visible, winding its way through a narrow channel it has eroded over time. The stream originates from or flows into a small semi-circular region resembling a basin or a small canyon. This focal area is enclosed by steep rocky cliffs and slopes that appear to have sparse vegetation.\n\nThe broader landscape around the stream is covered in what seems to be grass or low shrubs; this vegetation provides a varied texture of brown and green hues to the terrain, hinting at possible seasonal changes or climate effects. The hills in the background gently rise and contribute to an overall sense of seclusion and untouched nature.\n\nThe sky is not visible in the image, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention entirely on the natural forms and the tranquil atmosphere conveyed by the remote, undisturbed location. The ambiance suggests a cool or temperate climate, typical of mountainous or high altitude regions. The lighting is soft and diffuse, suggesting an overcast day, which also intensifies the earthy tones of the landscape.","title":"Creek draining into Atigun River from foot of Peak 5308, about 2 miles east of pipeline crossing in the Atigun Gorge.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549187","542583","552905","550586","554777","543647","555592","550433","550598","545783","552582","550510","550441","543793","552548","550511"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["stream","climate","region","basin","seclusion","canyon","channel","altitude","change","terrain"]}
