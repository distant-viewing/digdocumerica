{"path":"553253.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene at a fountain in what appears to be a public park or square. Central to the image is a Saint Bernard dog, drinking water from the fountain. The dog is on a leash held by a young woman with long blonde hair. She is wearing a sleeveless top and shorts, and seems engaged in both managing the dog and watching it drink.\n\nBehind the dog, two young men are playfully interacting with each other near the base of a dark bronze statue. The statue, depicting a male figure sitting on a rock-like base with his one arm leaning over his knee, adds an artistic element to the scene.\n\nAdjacent to these main subjects, a young woman with brown hair is perched on the edge of the fountainâ€™s basin. She appears to be holding a conversation with another young girl with light brown hair, who is sitting cross-legged and attentively engaged with the group.\n\nIn the background, other individuals can be seen including a woman standing, likely observing or waiting for someone, and a man sitting at the edge of another fountain structure in the park. The atmosphere is casual and summery, highlighted by the bright and clear day. Trees lining the area in the far background suggest that this is a green, possibly central area within a city.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
