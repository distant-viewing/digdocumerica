{"path":"552347.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph captures a maritime scene featuring three sailboats on calm water. Each sailboat is equipped with white sails, and the boats appear to be smaller, single-hull designs, possibly used for leisure sailing or small-scale racing. The boat sails bear numerical identifications which read \"104,\" \"715,\" and \"218.\" The individuals on these boats are engaged in sailing, managing the sails and steering the crafts.\n\nIn the background, there's a prominent industrial setting distinguished by a large smokestack that rises powerfully against a clear sky. The smokestack appears worn and is dark-gray in color, suggesting that it might be part of an old industrial facility. Other industrial structures and equipment can be seen around the smokestack, painted in dark colors, further emphasizing the industrial nature of the backdrop.\n\nThe contrast between the leisure activity of sailing and the industrial environment creates a striking visual juxtaposition. The sky is relatively clear, hinting at favorable weather conditions for sailing. The water reflects a bit of the sky and surrounding elements, enhancing the serene yet complex nature of the scene. This blend of recreational and industrial elements provides a rich tapestry of human activity and environmental setting.","title":"Sailboat race by members of the Tacoma Yacht Club on Puget Sound on an almost windless evening.
