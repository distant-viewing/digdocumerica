{"path":"557582.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph features a close-up of a section with exposed layers of fibrous material, possibly asbestos or a mineral with a similar appearance. The fibers are predominantly white and silvery, glistening as though they have a crystalline texture. They extend from a dark background, where bits of other materials and possibly small debris are also visible.\n\nAgainst this background of silvery fibers, a small green plant with long, narrow leaves emerges from the upper middle part of the frame. It adds a touch of vibrant color contrasting starkly with the predominantly dark and silvery tones of the surrounding material.\n\nThe focus is mainly on the interplay between the textures and the subtle infusion of nature represented by the plant. The photograph is rich with detail, highlighting the intricate patterns formed by the overlapping fibers, which reflect light to give a sense of depth and texture. The overall composition and the sharp details suggest a careful study of materials, typically overlooked, presented in an artistic manner. The dark background serves to enhance the details of both the fibrous material and the greenery, making them stand out more prominently.","title":"Close- up of a tiny Douglas fir seedling (naturally seeded) growing under a spider web in an 8 year old clear- cut on green mountain Washington, near Seattle.
