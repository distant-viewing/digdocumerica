{"path":"544202.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph features a man sitting at what appears to be a kitchen table. The man looks to be in his late 50s or early 60s, with a slim build, prominent cheekbones, and a slightly tanned complexion. He has unkempt, dark hair and is shirtless. His expression is casual and he appears to be looking directly at the camera with a hint of a smile.\n\nThe table in front of him is cluttered with various objects. Notably, there are several packs of cigarettes, one pack prominently displaying the \"Marlboro\" brand, and a bottle with a blue label, possibly an alcohol beverage. There also seems to be a plate with some food remnants, suggesting he might have recently eaten.\n\nThe background is simplistic, featuring walls colored in a faded orange or light brown hue. There is a sense of a warm, indoor environment. The photograph has a grainy texture and exhibits rich, saturated colors, indicative of being shot on film, possibly in the late 20th century based on the overall style and ambiance. The focus is sharp on the man and slightly less so on the closer objects on the table, giving a shallow depth of field to the image.","title":"Fisherman at home in Bayou Gauche","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545974","555532","544232","545986","552104","556457","555529","546636","543713","557648","549054","552872","555297","556540","545984","545970"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["pack","table","60","complexion","kitchen","build","cigarette","beverage","brand","object"]}
