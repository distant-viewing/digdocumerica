{"path":"558030.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a quaint and charming urban scene featuring a mix of architectural styles. There are three prominent buildings in the image:\n\n1. **On the left**, there is a large building with a classical architectural style featuring white façade and tall windows. The windows are rectangular, multi-paned, and aligned in both vertical and horizontal rows, contributing to a structured and formal appearance.\n\n2. **In the center**, there is a smaller, unique \"church-like\" structure that stands out due to its architectural details. It features a steep roof and a distinctive bell tower with what appears to be a clock face, adding a vintage character to the scene. The building is constructed with both horizontal siding and areas painted white, possibly indicating renovations or additions over time.\n\n3. **On the right**, partially obscured by lush green trees, is a traditional red-brick building. It has a more conventional residential appearance, with smaller windows compared to the first building.\n\nThe scene is set against clear skies and the street is empty, giving the photograph a serene, tranquil feel. The road in the foreground leads towards these buildings, enhancing the depth of the landscape, and making the structures more inviting. Shadows cast by unseen objects (likely trees and the buildings themselves) stretch across the road, adding a play of light and dark to the composition. The time appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the long shadows and soft sunlight.","title":"Grange Hall, foreground, adjacent to the Boston Township building in Peninsula, Ohio, near Akron. Built in 1887, the structure is located on the corner of Riverview Road and Main Street (Ohio Highway 303), and was heavily used for social and business purposes in bygone days. The village, with many period structures, is located within the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area located in a 20-mile stretch between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["550024","557156","550107","551722","555920","557952","546745","555902","550111","556046","546440","550122","550271","556249","550115","557643"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["building","renovation","window","bell","addition","clock","appearance","time","façade","church"]}
