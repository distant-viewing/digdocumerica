{"path":"552148.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial activity at a dock or shipyard. The image shows a large, dark gray, weather-worn ship hull dominating the background. The hull is towering and features visible rust stains, suggestive of aging or prolonged exposure to marine conditions. Suspended beside the ship is a massive bunch of logs, tightly bound together by chains or ropes, being hoisted probably from or onto the vessel.\n\nIn the foreground, several workers are visible. There are three men standing on a rugged terrain that appears to be strewn with logs and debris, typical of a working dock area. One man, wearing a hat and coveralls, seems to be supervising or interacting with another, who is shirtless, suggesting physical labor in warm conditions. A third man, also in casual clothing, appears to be walking away from the other two.\n\nThe scene is imbued with a sense of hard physical labor, with equipment and materials conveying the scale and nature of the operations at the shipyard. The surrounding environment, including the sky, is not distinctly visible, with the focus remaining tightly on the ship, the logs, and the workers. The lighting is natural, indicative of outdoor work, and highlights certain features sharply while casting others in shadow, adding a dramatic effect to the industrial setting.","title":"Logs for japan","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["552149","552303","546917","546016","547474","546914","546901","548125","547065","555797","545147","546841","547164","546881","546796","546040"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["logs","shipyard","ship","hull","labor","prolonge","worker","dock","supervise","suggestive"]}
