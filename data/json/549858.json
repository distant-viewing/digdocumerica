{"path":"549858.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Morgan, Hank","caption":"The photograph shows a busy parking lot filled primarily with cars from possibly the 1970s or 1980s based on their designs. These vehicles have various body styles including sedans, wagons, and a few hatchbacks, displaying a variety of colors like white, black, red, blue, and brown. One man is visible in the image, walking alone amidst the tightly parked cars. He is dressed formally, wearing a dark suit and carrying a briefcase, indicating he might be a professional or businessman. The setting appears to be an expansive outdoor parking area, with no significant buildings or other structures visible in the frame, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the pattern of parked cars and the solitary figure making his way through them. The lighting and shadows suggest that it might be early in the morning or late in the afternoon.","title":"Commuter parking at Shea Stadium","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549885","556196","556736","546599","553833","546879","556773","556201","554349","556204","547826","546731","546813","556790","547954","556722"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["parking","car","briefcase","1980","wagon","sedan","suit","way","lot","1970"]}
