{"path":"548522.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and colorful sailing scene, likely during a regatta or sailing race. It features several small sailing dinghies actively maneuvering on the water. \n\nIn the foreground, there's a sailboat with a predominantly blue and white spinnaker, ballooning out in front with visible wind filling the sail. A young male sailor, with blonde hair, is positioned at the bow; he's actively handling the rope and seems focused on the spinnaker. Behind him, slightly obscured, another individual is steering the boat.\n\nThe sea is textured with small waves indicating a breezy day which is ideal for sailing. In the background, other sailboats can be seen participating in the race. Each boat has a distinctively colored spinnaker; one boat has a red sail, another features green, and a third has a combination of red, yellow, and white. These colorful sails add a vivid contrast against the blue ocean and the slightly hazy sky.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with the alignment of the sailboats and varied color of the sails, creates a vivid and energetic maritime scene.","title":"Sailboat race in Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549424","548526","549389","549421","549425","548513","549082","547450","549406","548532","549400","549426","549423","549404","548203","549386"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Outdoor Sports"],"terms":["sailing","sail","sailboat","race","boat","regatta","sailor","alignment","third","bow"]}
