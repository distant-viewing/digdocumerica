{"path":"553538.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat rustic, possibly rural setting. In the foreground, a child is seen crouching near a pile of miscellaneous debris, which includes items such as a white cloth and an automobile tire. The child, whose face is obscured, is wearing a dark hoodie and yellow shorts. The items, alongside other pieces of garbage, seem scattered on and around a patch of old, worn red brick paving, leading towards the background.\n\nThe background features a large, two-story white house with a black roof, partially hidden by the lush greenery of several trees around it. The house looks aged and somewhat neglected, with visible wear on its façade. The surrounding landscape is green and appears unkempt, suggesting a rural or semi-rural environment. The clear blue sky suggests it's a sunny day, casting shadows of the trees nearby on the ground, contributing to the overall serene yet derelict atmospheric tone of the scene.","title":"Residents of Mulky Square, a low-income neighborhood on the city's west side, face large scale displacement by a new interstate highway (I-635). Many houses have been demolished, many others stand empty. For the people who remain, life goes on with little change. Billy Watkins plays with an old tire in a cleared-out section now used as a dump. Billy, one of nine children in a biscuit worker's family, doesn't go to school and has a lot of time to kill.","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["547988","547775","546962","546960","556491","556166","552102","551115","546958","556439","551001","553495","544372","551003","548116","543165"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["paving","child","item","cloth","automobile","garbage","façade","tire","short","wear"]}
