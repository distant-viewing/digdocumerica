{"path":"546832.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph features an industrial maritime scene. It captures three tugboats actively engaged in maneuvering a large ship, possibly assisting it in docking or navigating through a channel. The tugboats bear similar design and paint schemes, indicating they likely belong to the same fleet. Each tugboat prominently displays the words \"KINGS POINT\" on its side, with an American flag visible on at least one.\n\nThe tugboat in the foreground emits a plume of dark smoke from its stack, suggesting it is powered by a diesel engine and is currently under significant power. The choppy water and subdued lighting hint at overcast weather conditions, adding a dynamic and somewhat gritty atmosphere to the scene.\n\nThe hull of the large ship in the frame is mostly obscured by the tugboats but appears to be a massive vessel with a dark red color. There are no visible people or specific activities on the decks of the boats, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the boats and their interaction with the water and each other.\n\nThe background reveals a rough, open water context, likely a busy harbor or river area given the presence of multiple tugboats and their activity. The overall composition of the photo emphasizes the scale of maritime operations and the crucial role of tugboats in the navigation and management of large ships in constrained or challenging marine environments.","title":"Tugboats move the tanker \"chevron Hawaii\" to its berth","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["546845","546834","550896","550893","546938","546751","550892","550872","546909","550894","550913","550895","550901","546830","551990","552262"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["tugboat","ship","power","docking","belong","boat","navigation","maritime","maneuver","harbor"]}
