{"path":"545860.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and breathtaking silhouette of a mountain range during sunset. The mountains are layered, creating a range of shadows and contours that are highlighted against the sky. The sky itself gradually transitions from a rich orange near the horizon to a deeper, almost purplish hue as it extends upward. The varying shades of orange and purple suggest that the photo was taken during the golden hour, just as the sun was setting. The mountains possess rugged outlines, with peaks and valleys distinctly defined against the sky, creating an almost jagged horizon line. The quality of the light and the clear gradient of colors emphasize the tranquility and natural beauty of the scene. There are no visible clouds, which enhances the smooth gradient of the sky and the clear outline of the mountains. The overall mood conveyed by the photograph is one of peacefulness and awe at nature's grandeur.","title":"Dawn over the chisos mountains","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["545864","557560","552927","542681","554643","552895","550646","546749","544047","555131","548909","554634","554962","542678","552896","554402"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","gradient","outline","jagged","possess","deeper","range","awe","peacefulness","transitions"]}
