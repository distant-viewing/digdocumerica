{"path":"547109.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a peaceful and somewhat industrial waterfront scene, seemingly during either early morning or late afternoon, based on the soft and muted lighting. The scene is viewed from a high vantage point on a cliff, which is positioned on the right of the frame, sloping down towards the water. The cliff is covered with brownish grass and a few evergreen trees, suggesting a somewhat barren or autumnal season.\n\nDominating the center and left of the image is a calm expanse of water that reflects a subdued, purplish sky. Constructed halfway into the water is a long, curving breakwater or jetty, made from a pile of large rocks, providing a barrier against the waves and indicating some level of human alteration to the natural landscape.\n\nNear the far end of this rock barrier, a large crane is visible, mounted possibly on a barge or platform, suggesting ongoing construction or maintenance work. Further towards the left, a small tug-like boat can be seen, possibly assisting in the construction or in navigating other vessels around the area.\n\nOverall, the scene blends elements of natural tranquility with human industrial activities, captured from a perspective that emphasizes both the beauty and the utilitarian use of the waterway.","title":"Dredge barge at work inside breakwater of consumer power plant at Ludington.
