{"path":"552913.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph shows an aerial view of a rugged, earthy terrain split by a winding river or stream. The surrounding area features varied shades of brown and green, suggesting a mix of dry and vegetated patches. In the river, there are clusters of white birds—possibly pelicans or similar large waterfowl—forming contrasting white dots against the dark water surface. On the land, there is a prominent plateau with a steep face pointing toward the viewer, textured with lines and topographical variations indicating erosion or geological layers. Near the banks of the river, patches of greenery are visible, which could be grass or shrubbery adapted to moist soil. There are also two solitary trees captured in the frame, one on an elevated area and another near the water. The expanse of the scene suggests a remote or less inhabited region, focusing on natural geological and ecological elements without the presence of human-made structures visible in this perspective. The lighting indicates a time of day when the sun is high enough to minimize shadows and highlight the natural hues of the environment.","title":"Aerial view of pelicans feeding in the truckee river delta at Pyramid Lake.
