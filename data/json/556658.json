{"path":"556658.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene in a subway station. A family composed of a man, a woman, and two children stand near the platform's edge. The man stands slightly apart from the rest of the family, directing his gaze along the subway tracks, while the woman, likely the mother, holds the hands of the two young children, standing between them. The children, one boy and one girl, are both dressed in coats; the boy looks towards the moving train, and the girl seems to be looking up towards the adults.\n\nTo the distant right is another individual, likely a male standing alone, somewhat separated from the family and facing towards the camera. He appears deep in thought or waiting patiently.\n\nThe action captured is the passing of a subway train, as evidenced by the blur and motion lines of the train moving behind the family. The setting is dark and moody, primarily illuminated by the lighting of the subway station and slightly enhanced by the lights inside the fast-moving train.\n\nThis ambiance sets a somewhat somber and reflective mood, emphasizing a moment in the busy, everyday life of city dwellers caught in a transient yet intimate family scene amidst the urban rush. The overall composition creates a cinematic feel, capturing a fleeting moment that contrasts the stillness of the individuals with the speed of the urban environment.","title":"Passengers wait for a Lexington avenue line subway on one of the New York city transit authority platforms.  A new 2nd avenue line, under construction at an estimated cost of $2 billion, is supposed to decrease crowding on the Lexington avenue line however, the overcrowding when the decision to build was made in 1967 has lessened because of a decrease in riders.  Many commuters would rather see the money used to improve present lines","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557898","556660","551895","548259","556650","556821","556663","556823","551883","556665","556114","556814","551889","554326","556700","556855"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","family","train","child","girl","move","boy","dweller","station","mother"]}
