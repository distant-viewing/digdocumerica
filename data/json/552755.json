{"path":"552755.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban scene, likely within a residential area characterized by brick buildings. It captures a group of children engaged in outdoor play, possibly playing baseball or a similar game, in what appears to be a paved area surrounded by apartment buildings. The children are variously positioned: one child is in the act of throwing a ball, several are prepared to run or catch, and others are observers. At least two children are perched atop what look like street posts or similar structures, watching the game from an elevated vantage point.\n\nThe environment suggests a communal, possibly low-income housing area with minimal green space, as indicated by the completely paved play area and absence of vegetation. The buildings are plain, multi-story structures with visible bricks and repeated window patterns. There is a sense of casual, unstructured play typical of urban environments where children make use of available open spaces for recreational activities.\n\nThe ambiance is informal, with the children dressed in casual, everyday clothing suitable for play and physical activity. The image has a candid, spontaneous quality, capturing a slice of everyday life and community interaction among young residents of an urban neighborhood.","title":"Play area of black housing project in North Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549271","553512","553096","556287","556166","551768","556170","545404","556175","556159","547201","551094","547170","546527","552761","552024"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","play","game","income","brick","observer","ball","resident","act","baseball"]}
