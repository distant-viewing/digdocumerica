{"path":"557500.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph displays a close-up view of a flowering plant, featuring multiple blooms at various stages of development. The central focus is on a pale pink flower, fully opened and exposing its darker pink center and brown stamens. Above and below this flower, there are additional buds in shades of light pink that are yet to open, and other flowers past their peak with petals that appear faded or slightly wilted.\n\nThe flower stems are thin and green, supporting the buds and blooms, which are clustered along the length of these stems. The backdrop is softly unfocused, suggesting a densely vegetated area, likely composed of similar plants or a natural, green environment. This effect contributes to highlighting the flowers at the forefront, emphasizing their delicate colors and details against the vaguely defined green background.","title":"Closeup of flowers growing around Buena Vista Lagoon. It is one of the last lagoons in Southern California. There is concern that the wildlife sanctuary is endangered because of erosion and septic tank seePage, and the fact that it is being surrounded by freeways and developments. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast and it has resulted in increased land use pressures.","placename":"Oceanside (Calif.)","location":"Oceanside, California","nn1":["553366","554595","542970","554843","550462","554587","554576","553588","543597","544934","554115","557167","557545","545695","544875","547613"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","bud","bloom","stamen","stem","petal","pink","plant","stage","length"]}
