{"path":"543745.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a man engaged in an activity involving a detailed model setup, possibly a scaled construction or city planning model. The man is crouching among various gray blocks, which resemble building models. He is focused on measuring or examining a piece with a small rod or measurement tool. The background and foreground contain many similar gray blocks, some emitting mist or smoke, adding a dynamic and somewhat surreal quality to the scene.\n\nThe area has a workshop or construction site ambiance, with elements strewn around that look meticulously placed for urban or architectural planning. Notable is the meticulous detail of the miniature environment, including street signs labeled \"Howard St\" and \"2nd St,\" which contribute to the realism of the model.\n\nThe setting appears to be indoors based on the lighting and the presence of structures that enclose the space. The man, dressed casually in a shirt and trousers with protective eyewear, seems deeply concentrated on his task, highlighting a sense of precision and attentiveness to his work. This setting suggests a professional environment focused on engineering, architecture, or urban planning.","title":"Experimental wind tunnel device built at Colorado State University.
