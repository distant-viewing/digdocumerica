{"path":"544140.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts a massive dam nestled within a steep and rugged canyon. The dam, which is quite wide and formidable, features a series of vertical gates located at its center, designed to control water flow. Behind the dam, a large reservoir can be seen, hinting at the damâ€™s role in water collection and management. The water flows from the dam into a narrow river that curves gently through the canyon below.\n\nThe canyon walls on both sides of the dam are tall and steep, characterized by reddish-brown rock that emphasizes the arid environment. The composition of the photo enhances the scale of the dam structure compared to the natural surroundings, showcasing the dramatic contrast between human-made architecture and the natural world.\n\nAt the top of the dam, there appears to be some infrastructure related to the operations of the dam, possibly including a bridge or walkway that spans the width of the river which allows for maintenance and transport purposes. Above the canyon, the sky is a clear, vivid blue. No vegetation or wildlife is visible, underscoring the arid, rugged environment of the canyon. No people are visible in the image, giving it a deserted, isolated feel.","title":"Glen Canyon Dam","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["544141","548936","548920","548013","548927","544166","548012","548003","544151","548947","548938","548016","553828","548007","548975","549004"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","canyon","reservoir","gate","width","world","river","walkway","wildlife","collection"]}
