{"path":"548491.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene of a group of people sailing. The sailboat, named \"Stinker Too,\" is shown gliding through the water. The dominant feature of the image is the sailboat's large, colorful spinnaker sail which displays a rainbow gradient from red at the top, transitioning through yellow, green, to a deeper blue or green at the bottom. The numbers \"13029\" are visible on the sail, likely indicating the sail's registration or identification number.\n\nThere are several people aboard, casually dressed, suggesting a leisurely outing rather than a competitive event. At least three individuals are visible, with two facing towards the stern, so we can see them in profile. The environment around the boat is open water, and in the distance, faint outlines of other sailboats and possibly the shoreline can be seen, creating a peaceful, maritime setting.\n\nThe sky is somewhat overcast, bathing the scene in soft, natural light which highlights the vivid colors of the spinnaker and the reflective water surface. The image conveys a sense of freedom and enjoyment associated with sailing, emphasized by the calm water and gentle movement of the boat.","title":"A member of the crew takes a swim in chesapeake bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549422","548495","549386","549421","548513","549415","549408","548494","548526","552343","548522","547465","548203","549423","549425","549404"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","number","rainbow","glide","identification","registration","freedom","boat","maritime"]}
