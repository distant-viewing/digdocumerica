{"path":"553556.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of destruction, possibly following a demolition or disaster. The image is dominated by a large pile of debris, which includes broken bricks, wooden planks, and other unidentifiable rubble. Prominently jutting up from this wreckage is a surviving doorframe, still mostly intact but devoid of its door, creating a poignant symbol amidst the chaos. This doorframe stands lean and oddly solemn against a background of dense, leafy green trees and a slightly overcast sky, hinting at a rural or semi-rural setting. The ground around the debris pile is covered in grass and small shrubs, indicating that the site has been left untouched for a period allowing vegetation to grow. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, adding a moody atmosphere to the scene. The overall impression is one of melancholy and abandonment.","title":"Doorway to nowhere - all that remains of a Mulky Square house that stood in the path of a new expressway (Interstate 635)","placename":"Kansas City (Mo.)","location":"Kansas City, Missouri","nn1":["544468","547888","550260","544463","553470","554437","543165","544583","557993","544797","544467","544587","557351","544464","557349","557350"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["pile","demolition","wreckage","chaos","disaster","rubble","destruction","debris","symbol","plank"]}
