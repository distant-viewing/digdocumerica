{"path":"546987.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"In the photograph, a Black woman stands on a weathered porch of a house that shows signs of age and wear. The siding of the house is a faded green and the porch she is on has a rough, worn wooden floor. The porch is enclosed with screen windows and a screen door, also in a state of disrepair. The ceiling of the porch has exposed wooden beams and an unlit bulb hangs down.\n\nThe woman is dressed in a practical outfit consisting of a khaki skirt and a striped blouse with rolled-up sleeves. She wears colorful red and blue slippers. Her expression is thoughtful as she looks to her side, holding what appears to be a piece of white fabric or a small curtain. The lighting suggests it might be daytime. The background includes lush greenery indicating a rural or semi-rural setting. The composition of the image along with the visible wear and simple construction of the house contribute to a rustic, perhaps mid-20th-century setting.","title":"Poverty characterizes the situation of most of the blacks on st.
