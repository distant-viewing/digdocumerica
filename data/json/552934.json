{"path":"552934.jpg","date":"March 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene inside a room, likely set up for an emergency or disaster response drill. In the foreground, we see a young boy, dressed in a jersey with the number \"15\" on it and checkered pants, leaning on a table labeled \"SHELTER REGISTRATION.\" Behind this first table, there is another sign marked \"MEDICAL.\"\n\nThree women, appearing to be in mid-discussion or coordinating efforts, are seated behind the tables. The woman closest to the boy appears to be speaking to him or directing him towards something outside of the frame, as indicated by her facial expression and hand gestures. The other two women are engaged in work or discussions, one pointing to something out of view, and another looking through papers.\n\nThe background shows a plain, nondescript wall and parts of another table where some paperwork is visible. The overall atmosphere suggests a scene of activity and coordination, presumably part of a drill or real-life event requiring registration and medical assistance at a shelter. Such settings are typical in simulations of natural disasters, emergency evacuations, or similar scenarios where community preparedness is tested or utilized.","title":"Most people went out in the country or visited friends.
