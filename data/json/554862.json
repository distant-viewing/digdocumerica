{"path":"554862.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a moment in the outdoors featuring a person engaged in a traditional outdoor cooking activity. The person, a woman wearing a white sweater and plaid pants, is crouched near a small, open fire. She appears to be tending to two metal cooking pots placed directly on the ashes of what seems to be a recently diminished fire. There is visible smoke and a small flame.\n\nThe background reveals a rural setting, possibly a camping area or a field, with a variety of sparse, medium-sized trees and a broad expanse of grass. The lighting suggests it could be either late afternoon or a cloudy day given the soft and diffuse light. The overall atmosphere appears calm and serene, focusing on the simplicity and fundamental aspect of cooking over a fire in a natural environment.","title":"Wife of an itinerant sheep shearer cooks her noon meal outside the tent in which her family lives.
