{"path":"545802.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a rugged landscape, likely a canyon system, consisting of expansive, jagged rock formations that stretch into the distance. The image is captured at a time when the lighting casts long shadows, accentuating the textured, irregular surfaces of the rock formations and deep crevices.\n\nIn the foreground, one particularly prominent rock ridge, with a heavily textured, uneven top, runs vertically through the frame. This ridge is pockmarked with numerous rounded boulders that appear clustered on its surface, suggesting years of geological activity and erosion. The coloration of the rocks shifts between earthy reds and browns.\n\nThe middle and background reveal further layers of similarly rugged terrain, giving the viewer a sense of depth and the extensive scale of the canyon. Additional ridges, characterized by sharp edges and steep cliffs, alternate with narrow valleys and shadowed areas that are darker, possibly indicating lesser sun exposure or deeper sections of the canyon.\n\nThe horizon shows a softer gradient of color, blending into a pale sky that suggests either dawn or dusk due to the softness of natural light. The overall impression is of a remote, wild, and untouched natural landscape, evoking a sense of isolation and the enduring power of natural geological processes.","title":"The Maze, a remote and inaccessible labyrinth of narrow canyons in the center of the park","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545799","544745","545796","545800","545806","552690","545750","545761","545805","544950","545795","545792","544392","555595","545783","543148"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["canyon","ridge","rock","formation","softness","crevice","shift","coloration","boulder","year"]}
