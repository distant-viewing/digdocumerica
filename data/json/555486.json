{"path":"555486.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a gas station during what appears to be the 1970s fuel crisis, based on the distinctive signs and restrictions displayed. The image shows two individuals, possibly employees or customers, outside a car at a gas pump. One person is an older man with grey hair, partially seen from the back as he stands near the pump, facing toward the gas station storefront. The other is a younger man with distinct red hair and glasses, seen in profile, looking slightly towards the older man.\n\nThe background reveals a sign on a blue board with bold white lettering reading “ODD NOS. TODAY” and another red and white sign indicating a \"15 GAL. LIMIT SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE,\" highlighting the gas rationing measures of the time. The gas price shown is \"0.310\" per gallon, which suggests the historical setting. The storefront behind has large windows through which shelves and possibly more products or equipment can be glimpsed. \n\nThe car in the foreground is a cream or light beige color with a sleek 1970s design, characterized by a long, horizontal body shape. The license plate and other car details are not distinctly visible. This setting and the vivid details like attire, car design, and signage effectively place the photograph in a specific historical moment, emphasizing the economic and social impacts of the fuel crisis during that time.","title":"On january 31, 1974, an odd-numbered day, motorists with odd-numbered license plates could obtain gasoline at this station the limit was 15 gallons","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["555465","557834","555489","555434","548049","555485","555498","555490","548170","550096","548053","555452","555459","548173","548174","548171"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["gas","crisis","fuel","pump","storefront","car","gallon","station","employee","restriction"]}
