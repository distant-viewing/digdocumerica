{"path":"549963.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil outdoor setting where an individual is engaged in painting by a lakeside. The setting is serene, with several trees framing the scene, including a prominently featured weeping willow whose drooping branches add a lacy curtain effect to the left side of the image. The painter, seated on a grassy slope, is wearing a pink shirt and dark shorts, and seems consumed in the act of painting, with a canvas set on an easel in front of them.\n\nThe background reveals a calm body of water that smoothly transitions into a further grassy area and distant trees, enhancing the peaceful feel of the environment. This scene is under a soft, diffused light, likely indicative of either an overcast day or the gentle light of early morning or late afternoon. The composition and natural lighting emphasize a quiet, creative moment captured in a beautiful, natural landscape.","title":"Artist on bank of the Schuylkill River","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549964","549930","554493","543835","554486","553082","550735","558093","546293","552319","543535","550217","550268","543601","546566","544031"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["painting","consume","canvas","lakeside","curtain","act","outdoor","diffuse","short","transition"]}
