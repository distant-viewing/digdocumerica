{"path":"544227.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph depicts a weathered warning sign mounted onto a wooden post. The sign reads \"DANGER\" in bold, capitalized text followed by \"HIGH PRESSURE OIL PIPE LINE\" underneath, also in capital letters. The cautionary message continues with \"DO NOT ANCHOR OR DREDGE,\" again emphasized through capitalization. In the upper left corner of the sign is the logo of what appears to be a company or organization labeled \"Interstate,\" encircled. \n\nThe sign exhibits some signs of wear and tear, including discoloration, scratches, and rust spots, which suggests it has been exposed to the elements for an extended period. The background of the image is blurred, primarily dark blue with vague outlines that could be interpreted as vegetative or marine, hinting at a natural environment, possibly a wetland or coastal area. This background contributes to a slightly eerie or abandoned atmosphere, accentuating the warning nature of the sign. \n\nThe lighting in the scene is dim, possibly indicating dusk or dawn, which further enhances the mood of the image by creating stark contrasts between the lighter sign and the darker surroundings. The focus is primarily on the sign, making it the central element of the photograph.","title":"Sign warns of submerged pipeline from the Humble Natural Gas installation.","placename":"Bayou Gauche (La.)","location":"Bayou Gauche, Louisiana","nn1":["545949","545997","548063","553749","552432","557546","550255","546402","544245","546240","546936","554103","552212","558000","545621","544715"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","warning","capitalize","pressure","danger","interpret","scratch","discoloration","capital","encircle"]}
