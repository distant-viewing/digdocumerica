{"path":"551073.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a busy and somewhat industrial scene in what appears to be an urban area. On the right side of the image, there's a man standing on a grassy slope next to a line of large, stationary train tank cars. He is dressed in a casual, light-colored shirt and darker pants, and is engaged in gardening or landscaping, possibly watering plants or grass as he holds a hose.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, the scene shifts to a street lined with various commercial buildings and signs, with cars from the 1970s-era parked along the roadside and a collection of road construction machinery. Notable signs in the scene include one for a bank and another for a store advertising TV and appliances. The area is dense with utility poles and wires, adding to the industrial feel.\n\nThe background reveals a lush, tree-covered hill, suggesting the setting is in a valley or a region with varied topography. The air appears slightly hazy, which could indicate dust, pollution, or just a bright, sunlit day. The overall composition of the photo captures a vivid contrast between industrial activity and everyday life, along with a snapshot of an era, evidenced by the vehicles and the style of the signs.","title":"Ingenious method of mowing steep railroad slope on dupont avenue in west Belle","placename":"Charleston (W.
