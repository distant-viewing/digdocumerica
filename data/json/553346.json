{"path":"553346.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph presents a serene outdoor scene featuring a body of water, most likely a lake or a river, with two Canadian geese landing or taking off from the surface of the water. The geese are captured in motion, their wings outstretched, stirring the water into splashes around them.\n\nIn the background, there's a dense arrangement of trees, composed of both deciduous and coniferous species, adding a rich texture and a variety of colors from dark greens to muted browns. This dense backdrop of trees provides a natural frame to the scene, enhancing the focus on the geese in the foreground.\n\nThe overall lighting in the image is soft, indicating that it could be an overcast day, which casts even lighting across the scene and enhances the colors and details of the geese and the trees. The composition of the photograph, with the geese centrally located and the background symmetrically filled with trees, draws the viewer's eye directly to the action of the geese while appreciating the quiet, untouched natural environment surrounding them.","title":"Canadian geese on the Nashua River","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["546086","557122","557126","558091","557121","557120","557124","556987","545991","552993","557493","553347","544838","552221","557202","546081"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["wing","tree","specie","splash","arrangement","action","water","brown","motion","lake"]}
