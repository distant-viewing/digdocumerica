{"path":"548260.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a moment inside a graffiti-covered subway car. The image shows two individuals seated apart from each other. On the left, a woman dressed in a blue jacket is captured in mid-yawn, holding onto the metal subway pole across from her. Her expression and open mouth suggest that she is possibly tired or perhaps reacting to the environment.\n\nTo the right, a man in a brown suit, with a beard and glasses, sits reading a newspaper. He appears composed and engrossed in his reading, seemingly unaffected by the graffiti that surrounds him.\n\nThe interior of the subway car is heavily vandalized with various styles of graffiti covering the walls and doors. Signs of wear and neglect are visible, and there's a vending machine labeled \"CANDY\" in the background near the entrance of the car, adding to the urban atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights the contrast between the public transportation environment—marked by neglect and the insistence of urban culture expressed through graffiti—and the individual lives and responses of the commuters within that space.","title":"Many subway cars in New York City have been spray-painted by vandals.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548258","553823","556811","554325","556653","554370","548273","548255","556665","556691","548261","554324","554326","556666","556814","556659"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","graffiti","neglect","vending","car","response","commuter","reading","beard","newspaper"]}
