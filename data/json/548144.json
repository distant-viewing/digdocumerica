{"path":"548144.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic roadway beside a large body of water, possibly a lake or river. The road curves gracefully from the foreground to the background along the waterâ€™s edge. It features a four-lane divided highway, marked with white lines. There are two vehicles visible on the highway: one white truck or trailer moving away from the viewer, and a smaller black vehicle further in the distance, also heading in the same direction.\n\nThe landscape surrounding the water and road consists of undulating hills dotted with sparse vegetation. It suggests a semi-arid environment given the brown and green color mix of the landscape. The hills rise steeply from the far side of the lake or river, and their slopes are marked with what appear to be terraces or erosion control structures. \n\nThe sky above the scene is clear and predominantly occupied by a soft blue tone, suggesting a sunny day without much cloud cover. In the foreground, darker green shrubbery partially obscures the view of the lower portion of the scene, adding depth and a hint of lushness to the composition. The overall impression is one of tranquil, natural beauty combined with human-engineered infrastructure skirting the natural terrain.","title":"Columbia River Gorge between The Dalles and the Hood River","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["548143","554566","547302","549527","547294","551240","550600","545104","547298","550613","554130","545367","555630","546720","550614","557468"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["highway","lushness","terrace","lake","engineer","mark","shrubbery","hill","trailer","undulate"]}
