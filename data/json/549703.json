{"path":"549703.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"In the photograph, a man is seated casually in a grassy area, leaning against a wooden cannon. The setting gives the impression of a historical reenactment or a themed event. The man is dressed in a period costume, suggesting a military uniform from around the 18th or 19th century. His attire includes a dark hat with a brim, which looks like a tricorn hat, a red neckerchief, a dark blue jacket, and beige gaiters over black boots. His legs are crossed, and he holds a smug, thoughtful pose, his arms folded and a relaxed demeanor on his face.\n\nThe cannon, a central element in the image, features prominently next to him. It is mounted on a wooden carriage with large wooden wheels, typical of field artillery from historical periods. The background is blurred but shows an expanse of green grass, suggesting the setting might be a park or a similar outdoor venue where historical recreations take place.\n\nThe overall mood conveyed is of a reflective or relaxed moment during a historical reenactment, with the man likely taking a break from the activities. The natural light and outdoor setting complement the historical theme, adding authenticity to the scene. The photograph captures a slice of historical interpretation, focusing on the individual experience amidst a broader historical context.","title":"Old time Rifleman's meet, june 24, 1973, is held on the greenfield village green adjoining the henry ford museum of dearborn.
