{"path":"547069.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a large industrial scene, most likely a steel mill, during a period of significant activity. The setting is dense with industrial infrastructure, including multiple towering blast furnaces, extensive piping, and a variety of large buildings with corrugated metal surfaces. Smoke and steam are rising from numerous points, contributing to a haze that hangs over the site, indicating heavy operation.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a river or canal where a barge is floating. The barge is loaded with large piles of raw materials such as coal, covered by tarpaulins. Next to this body of water, a dock structure supports a rail line with several hopper cars, likely for transporting raw materials into the plant.\n\nThe photograph's color palette is dominated by muted tones of rust, grey, and blue, reflecting the industrial atmosphere. The scene is backlit with subdued lighting that may suggest either early morning or late afternoon, casting a gloomy, somewhat eerie light over the area. \n\nUnseen but implied by the context of the image are the sounds of machinery, the clatter of metal, and the busy movement of workers, though no individuals are visible in this shot. The image captures a moment in time in an industrial heartland, emphasizing the scale and intensely busy nature of the operations in steel production.","title":"Republic steel plant","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["547101","549966","550225","557216","547060","557227","550961","557223","546769","549510","547702","549508","550957","549511","553826","546827"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["barge","steel","sound","hopper","backlit","furnace","piping","operation","canal","coal"]}
