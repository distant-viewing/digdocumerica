{"path":"554656.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a seaplane in the midst of a water landing. The aircraft is depicted with its pontoons creating a wake as they touch the lake's surface, indicating the plane is either landing or taking off. It's a clear, serene day given the brightness and clarity of the scene.\n\nThe seaplane is painted in a two-tone color scheme, primarily red with white areas, and includes identifiable markings and registration numbers. The wings are extended above the main body of the aircraft, typical of high-wing aircraft designs, which provide clear visibility below and stabilize the plane during water operations.\n\nThe background showcases an idyllic autumn landscape, densely packed with trees in a variety of vibrant fall colors ranging from deep green to red, orange, and yellow shades. These trees indicate a forested area typical of a northern or mountainous region. The body of water reflects both the sky and the colorful foliage, enhancing the overall calmness and beauty of the setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of action in a tranquil, picturesque environment, highlighting both the adventure of flying and the natural beauty of the landscape.","title":"Seaplane taxiing on smooth water at seventh lake in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554654","554487","551219","554655","554488","556909","554714","554651","542506","544491","556928","554635","554751","543548","554648","548469"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["aircraft","landing","plane","wing","registration","stabilize","fly","midst","calmness","wake"]}
