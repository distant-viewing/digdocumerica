{"path":"546094.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a moment inside a rustic setting, possibly a workshop or a storage area. Two men are engaged in an activity involving a taxidermy animal, which appears to be a deer, laying on a table covered with newspaper.\n\nThe man on the left is older and dressed in a mustard-colored jacket with a white shirt underneath. He is bending down, actively working on the deer, his focus directed towards his task. The younger man on the right is wearing a dark leather jacket and a cowboy hat, suggesting a western style. He is holding a tool and appears to be assisting the older man or observing the process closely.\n\nThe background is characterized by corrugated metal walls which give an industrial or utilitarian feel. Various items hang on the walls, including what appears to be another set of antlers, enhancing the rustic and outdoor theme of the setting. There are also shelves cluttered with bottles, boxes, and other materials, indicating that this space is used for work related to hunting, taxidermy, or similar activities. The lighting is artificial and focused on the central area where the men are working, drawing attention to their activity and the intricate details of their task.","title":"Rev.
