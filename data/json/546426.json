{"path":"546426.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph shows a modern construction site featuring a large building with a distinctive architectural style. The building consists of two main sections connected by a raised walkway. One section has a large glass facade supported by metal framework, revealing complex internal structures or scaffolding. The adjacent section is a solid-colored wall with minimalistic design, painted in blue-grey, complementing the technological appearance of the glass section.\n\nIn the foreground of the image, the ground appears muddy and littered with construction debris. Several piles of materials, including wood planks and metal pieces, are scattered across the site. A yellow fire hydrant is also visible near the center of the scene.\n\nTwo individuals can be observed in the photograph. One is walking near the building, dressed in typical construction or work attire, which includes a hard hat and safety boots. This person appears engaged in inspecting or moving from one part of the site to another. Their presence, along with the materials and construction equipment, indicates ongoing work and the developmental phase of the building.\n\nThe background is relatively nondescript and mainly serves as a backdrop to the main subjects of construction and architecture. The overall composition highlights the juxtaposition between the organized, high-tech architecture and the chaotic, raw state of the construction site.","title":"Fodrea community school, designed by caudill, rowlett, and scott","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["555373","548552","546414","546411","550737","548551","547977","547829","548431","556642","546422","547833","544167","545877","546503","550273"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","section","hydrant","phase","scaffolding","glass","architecture","building","material"]}
