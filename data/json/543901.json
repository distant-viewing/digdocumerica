{"path":"543901.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This image captures a close-up view of a fish lying on a solid brownish surface, which appears to be either sand or a sandy textured background. The fish is depicted centered horizontally in the frame, taking up a large part of the image. The fish has a striking appearance, featuring an almost metallic, silver body juxtaposed with a dark, black patch covering its head and eye, which adds a dramatic contrast to its overall coloration.\n\nThe body of the fish is somewhat transparent with shimmering silver scales that reflect light, giving it a glossy look. Its eye is large and prominent, surrounded by the dark patch, drawing attention to it. The fishâ€™s fins are delicate and partially spread; the dorsal and tail fins are visible and display thin, nearly translucent qualities with a light silver color matching the body.\n\nNo other objects or activities are present in the frame, focusing all attention on the fish itself. The overall composition emphasizes the textures and colors of the fish against the simplicity of the sandy background, highlighting its natural beauty and intricate detail. The photo has a somber, static quality due to the nature of its subject and composition.","title":"Marine life taken from water near the P.H.
