{"path":"548728.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The image captures a serene scene at a water body, most likely a sea, featuring several pelicans perched on weathered wooden posts sticking out from the water. The immediate foreground is dominated by four distinct wooden poles, varying in height, planted into the sea. These poles, showing signs of age and exposure, are textured with frayed and broken ends.\n\nAtop these posts, three pelicans are positioned. The first pelican, standing on the highest pole at the left side of the frame, is slightly hunched, observing its surroundings. The second pelican is settled on a mid-height pole towards the center, standing erect and looking straight forward. The third pelican is positioned lower on a relatively short pole on the far right, parallel in posture to the second pelican. The ocean that envelops these posts expands into the horizon, meeting the clear blue sky at a distant, indistinct line.\n\nThe clarity of the sky suggests a sunny day, enhanced by the bright lighting that accentuates the vibrant blue tones of the water and the faded hues of the wooden posts. This scene creates a quiet, almost tranquil setting, emphasizing an interaction between wildlife and an aquatic environment. The composition of the photograph, its natural lighting, and the perspective lend a captivating depth and a serene mood to the imagery.","title":"Pelicans on dock pilings at Conch Key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["545187","545302","542919","552911","544559","544500","544496","544611","555554","550903","552912","545991","552909","550388","544838","549896"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["pelican","post","pole","height","sea","imagery","clarity","wildlife","exposure","end"]}
