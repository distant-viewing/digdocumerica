{"path":"546702.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive, modernist building complex surrounded by lush greenery. The main structures consist of several multi-storied, horizontally elongated buildings arranged in a staggered, rectangular pattern, effectively creating a unified architectural appearance. Each building features a large number of windows that run along its length, reflecting the style of mid-20th-century modern architecture, likely designed for functionality and maximizing natural light.\n\nThe buildings are nestled amidst a wooded area, indicating that the location is either suburban or on the edge of an urban area where space allows for ample green surroundings. At the foreground, there is a large parking lot filled with numerous cars, suggesting this could be a workplace or an institution that accommodates a significant number of employees or visitors.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is one of a peaceful, well-planned, and functional space, likely intended for professional or academic purposes, given the size and scope of the buildings and the parking facilities. The time of the shot appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the gentle lighting and the long shadows cast by the trees.","title":"Central intelligence agency complex in Virginia","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546464","546473","546448","546460","546531","548022","546543","546456","542593","558056","546481","546485","550547","546534","551613","555449"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["parking","number","employee","institution","nest","scope","building","workplace","accommodate","elongate"]}
