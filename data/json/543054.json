{"path":"543054.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene coastal scene, primarily in shadows with sections lit by soft, reflective sunlight. In the foreground, large, weathered logs dominate the beach, suggesting remnants of trees either washed ashore by the ocean or left from past logging activities. The logs vary in size and are scattered across the sand in a haphazard fashion, their rough textures contrasting with the smoothness of the wet sand.\n\nThe middle ground shows a broad, flat beach with damp sand reflecting the light, creating shimmering patches that highlight the beach’s moisture. The beach extends towards the ocean, gently sloping down to meet the water’s edge, where small waves can be seen breaking softly.\n\nIn the background, distinctive rock formations emerge from the sea, adding dramatic flair to the landscape. These formations, likely sea stacks, are rugged and steep, surrounded by the ocean and partly shadowed by the surrounding terrain. The shoreline curves gracefully around these natural sculptures, leading the eye towards more distant landforms partially visible under a hazy sky.\n\nThe overall composition evokes a sense of tranquility and natural beauty, typical of coastal wilderness areas, possibly captured during late afternoon when the sunlight is less harsh and more diffused. The photograph’s contrast between the dark, detailed foreground and the shimmering, illuminated parts of the sand creates a dynamic visual interest, emphasizing the untouched and raw appeal of the seaside landscape.","title":"Old logs weather in sandy cover near Trinidad","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542890","543069","544989","542889","543052","542884","545111","543075","542887","548757","543078","543287","544985","551554","555400","547483"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sand","beach","ocean","log","smoothness","formation","flair","sea","sculpture","landform"]}
