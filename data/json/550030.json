{"path":"550030.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene aboard a sailing ship. The viewpoint is looking upward at the ship's tall masts, which are surrounded by an intricate network of ropes and rigging. The masts support several large, billowing sails, providing a dynamic feel to the composition. The image is filled with vertical and diagonal lines created by the ropes and vertical masts, which add a sense of movement.\n\nA key feature of the image is a person climbing up the rigging on the mainmast. This individual, dressed in dark clothing, is positioned centrally in the photograph, ascending a ladder-like structure attached to the side of the mast. Their activity contributes a human element that underscores the traditional seafaring skills necessary to operate such a ship.\n\nThe photograph is framed in such a way that parts of multiple sails can be seen, utilizing natural lighting that partly silhouettes the climber against the lighter sails. The sky is not visible, focusing all attention on the ship’s equipment and the person’s interaction with their environment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is one of adventure and nautical skill, capturing a moment of routine yet fascinating activity aboard a traditional sailing vessel.","title":"Setting the sails of \"Westward\" for return trip from Great Brewster Island to Long Wharf","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["546763","549599","547467","547459","547458","548513","555802","549428","549426","544667","549594","549427","549617","549395","549355","547456"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["mast","ship","sail","skill","rigging","sailing","rope","ladder","ascend","climb"]}
