{"path":"547137.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and expansive industrial scene dominated by a massive cloud of white smoke. The smoke is billowing intensely and occupies most of the picture, creating a visually striking contrast against the darker ground below and the clear sky above.\n\nThe background of the image features a large industrial facility. On the right, there are three tall cylindrical tanks, standing side by side, each with a flat top and seemingly metallic construction, reflecting sunlight on their outer surfaces. These tanks are associated typically with the storage of chemicals or petroleum products. Beside these tanks, there are other industrial structures including what appears to be a warehouse or large buildings with flat roofs.\n\nIn the foreground, obscured slightly by the dense smoke, are elements of infrastructure such as roads and possibly conveyor belts, along with various smaller structures that might serve as offices or control stations for the facility. The area has a concrete or paved surface, indicative of heavy industrial use.\n\nThe composition and atmosphere of the image suggest that the smoke might be the result of an industrial process or an emergency situation like a fire, given its volume and density. The photograph might raise concerns about environmental impact and air quality, depicting a moment of intense industrial activity or disruption.","title":"U.S. Steel","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["544704","545994","545990","550983","545975","545920","551054","547204","548376","557214","548377","551052","546908","550938","550981","550987"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","tank","emergency","result","volume","disruption","situation","facility","product","concern"]}
