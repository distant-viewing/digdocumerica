{"path":"548076.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a river bustling with activity, framed elegantly by overhanging green tree branches in the foreground. The water is populated with numerous small boats, some close to each other and others scattered apart, creating a lively scene of aquatic navigation.\n\nIn the distance, there is an industrial plant situated beside the river, from which billowing white smoke emerges, ascending into the overcast sky and contrasting starkly against a backdrop of lush, dark green, dense forest on a hill. To the right of the plant, a waterfall breaks in the river, adding a natural element to the view, which juxtaposes the industrial activity.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with its industrial and natural elements, offers a complex narrative of environmental interaction and human activity. The serene yet industrious atmosphere suggests a scene likely captured during midday, given the bright but diffused lighting. The natural framing of the branches gives an almost secretive, peek-through look at this blend of nature and human industry, hinting at both the harmony and tension between the two.","title":"Crown-zellerbach corporation and publisher's paper company both have paper mills on the willamette river at Oregon city.
