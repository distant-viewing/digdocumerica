{"path":"556422.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling street scene in a small town nestled in a valley. The narrow street is flanked on both sides by two-story brick buildings with a variety of business signs prominently displayed, creating a visually dense and commercial atmosphere. Notable signs include \"Glamour Beauty Salon,\" \"Browning & Stacy Building Contractors,\" and \"Heating Cooling Dealer,\" among others. There are also signs for a florist, a typewriter company, and other local businesses.\n\nThe street is filled with parked cars typical of those from the mid-20th century, suggesting the photo originates from around the 1960s or 1970s. There is also a pedestrian scene visible; two people (a woman and a child) are seen walking down the sidewalk, carrying bags presumably from shopping.\n\nThe scene captures the essence of a lively, small-town commercial district during this era. Overhead, numerous electrical and telephone wires criss-cross above the street, adding to the crowded, industrial feel of the area. In the background, the street is enclosed by the rising wooded hills that hint at the geography of a valley location, and an overcast sky suggests a cool, possibly damp environment. The overall atmosphere is one of a bustling, close-knit community locale with a focus on local commerce and daily life.","title":"Main street of Logan, West Virginia, showing a narrow street with parking on only one side which is typical in many of the small towns in southern West Virginia.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557655","546428","542586","552526","551117","545614","552601","551125","552602","551106","558118","542900","545216","545610","554710","550110"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["street","business","valley","town","geography","sign","telephone","cross","shopping","locale"]}
