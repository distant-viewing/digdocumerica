{"path":"555456.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph appears to be taken inside a storefront, possibly displaying merchandise like men's clothing. On the left side of the image, there is a mannequin dressed in a dark suit jacket resting on a mannequin body, which also has a striped tie with patterns that can be seen laid next to the jacket. This ensemble is likely displayed to attract potential buyers to the style and fashion of the items.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a prominent sign mounted on a wooden stand, providing a key focus. The sign reads, “This window now using 1600 Watts less than usual! We are Watt Watching. We are cooperating in the region-wide effort to conserve electricity. Using energy wisely and efficiently is of utmost importance during this shortage. Every kilowatt-hour saved is a help. We appreciate your understanding and hope you will join in this Watt Watching effort. Thank you.” This message highlights an energy conservation effort presumably during a period of energy shortage, promoting environmentally conscious behavior.\n\nThe background of the image is mostly obscured by the darkness, focusing the viewer’s attention on the sharply illuminated subjects— the clothing and the energy conservation sign. The overall composition of the photograph combines elements of retail marketing and public awareness, using visual merchandising to convey a social or environmental message.\n","title":"Sign in a downtown Portland business window notes that with display lights reduced more than 1,600 watts of energy were being saved","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["556695","555445","555404","550132","548168","555380","550136","546034","555389","545368","546672","555413","557332","552932","556209","555442"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["energy","shortage","effort","conservation","message","save","awareness","ensemble","join","merchandise"]}
