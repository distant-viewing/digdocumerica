{"path":"554048.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of a young man. He is wearing a mesh baseball cap that is labeled \"Maui Country Club Hawaii\" on a gold-trimmed, oval patch. The cap appears slightly worn, suggesting it may have been used frequently. The young man has dark, straight hair peeking out from under the cap, and his facial features include sharp cheekbones, a serious expression, and focused eyes looking slightly to the side of the cameraâ€™s lens.\n\nThe man wears a light-colored, possibly white, crew neck t-shirt that appears to be lightweight, suitable for a warm climate. His complexion is fair, and there are visible freckles or sun spots on his face, which together with his attire, suggests outdoor activity or exposure.\n\nThe background of the image is muted and out of focus, primarily in soft blues and greens, indicating an open outdoor setting under overcast or subdued lighting conditions. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of a candid, personal moment captured in a natural setting.","title":"Young sugarcane field worker.
