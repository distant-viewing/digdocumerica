{"path":"544962.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph displays a panoramic view of a rural landscape with various ecologic and human activities. The foreground of the image features a densely wooded area with what appears to be clusters of trees, possibly a mix of conifers and broadleaf trees. Beyond the foreground, the middle ground of the scene shows cultivated fields that are vividly partitioned, possibly for different types of crops or agricultural purposes.\n\nSmoke is visible in two distinct areas, suggesting controlled burning or possibly small wildfires; the smoke columns rise vertically, indicating relatively calm atmospheric conditions. This activity is set against a backdrop of large hills or low mountains that dominate the landscape. These hills are covered with dense vegetation, and their rugged terrain includes visible rock formations that add to the scene's dramatic natural beauty.\n\nThe overall composition and color palette of the photograph – with the blues and greens dominating most of the scene – emphasize the natural environment while hinting at human influence through agriculture and land management practices like burning. The vastness and isolated smoke suggest a sparsely populated area, primarily focused on land and forest management.","title":"\"Teepee\" burner disposes of lumber mill's waste","placename":"Paradox (Colo.)","location":"Paradox, Colorado","nn1":["545009","545051","545042","548589","542937","543981","545048","545025","557003","548595","556920","548199","548172","548594","556968","548592"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["smoke","management","wildfire","burning","land","influence","conifer","hill","practice","agriculture"]}
