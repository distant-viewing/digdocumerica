{"path":"550471.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph presents a serene natural setting dominated by tall grasses and a bird, creating a composition that blends wildlife with its habitat. In the foreground, lush greenery and various types of tall, skinny grasses fill the lower half of the image. These plants appear to be in the peak of their growth, offering a detailed texture of leaves and seed heads.\n\nCentral to the image and slightly to the left is a bird, positioned amidst the grass. It seems to be a small species, possibly a sparrow, characterized by its slender beak and detailed plumage, which suggests that it is either foraging or resting. The bird adds a focal point to the scene, providing a sense of life and activity.\n\nThe background is softly focused, featuring lighter tones of blues and greys, possibly indicating a hazy sky or a distant body of water. This background generates a calm, tranquil mood and gives depth to the photograph, highlighting the natural environment in which the bird is situated.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a quiet moment in nature, focusing on the simplicity and beauty of everyday wildlife interactions within their ecosystem. The composition and focus on natural elements evoke a sense of peacefulness and the intrinsic value of natural settings.","title":"This parka squirrel is gathering green grasses to eat during the 9-month winter","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["551378","557104","550388","545069","544838","545991","551370","548731","557111","548832","544484","547318","547540","547924","544884","543595"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","wildlife","grass","beak","value","plumage","generate","peacefulness","hazy","half"]}
