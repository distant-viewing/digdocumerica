{"path":"550193.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene focused on environmental pollution. The setting features a body of water, possibly a pond or a small lake, that is being contaminated by water flowing out of a large pipe. The pipe, placed halfway down a man-made embankment, discharges a stream of what appears to be polluted water into the calm surface of the lake, creating a white foamy area where the water meets.\n\nThe embankment itself is strewn with various materials including rocks, debris, and dirt, indicating recent earth-moving activities or dumping. Vegetation appears sparse and dead, suggesting the area is not well-maintained and possibly suffering from the environmental impact of the industrial activities nearby.\n\nIn the background, there are industrial structures with visible metal frameworks and other equipment, accentuating the industrial function of this location. Barrels and more debris are piled around the structures, reinforcing the sense of a neglected or heavily used industrial site. The overall atmosphere is somewhat bleak, highlighted by the overcast sky and the muted colors, emphasizing the environmental damage presented in the scene.","title":"Harshaw chemical company discharges waste water into the cuyahoga river","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551562","550959","544775","552019","546793","549624","550708","543819","550713","544779","543773","544294","547907","549564","543636","551561"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["embankment","pipe","barrels","contaminate","lake","dumping","materials","foamy","debris","strewn"]}
