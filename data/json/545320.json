{"path":"545320.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a casual and intimate moment featuring two young individuals lying on a patch of grass next to a parked car, likely from the mid to late 20th century. The car, partly visible in the image, shows details characteristic of a classic model, evident in its chrome bumper and styled side trim.\n\nThe two individuals, both of whom appear to be male teenagers, are relaxing on the ground. The one on the left is slightly elevated on a woven mat, wearing dark red pants and a black shirt. He has long dark hair and is lying on his back with his arms resting on his stomach, one leg bent and one Adidas sneaker visible. His relaxed posture and closed eyes suggest he might be resting or perhaps daydreaming.\n\nThe other individual is lying prone on the grass, turned towards the first boy. He is dressed in a dark, long sleeve top paired with lighter colored pants. His hair is dark and styled in a bowl cut. He is holding a small object between his hands, closely scrutinizing it, suggesting a moment of focus or curiosity.\n\nBehind them, the environment appears somewhat unkempt or rural, with scattered debris, bare dirt, and a grass patch that is unevenly covered. The lighting, which gives a soft glow to the scene, suggests this image was captured either in the early morning or late afternoon, contributing to a serene yet somewhat melancholic atmosphere. There's a feeling of candidness and youth, with a touch of nostalgia prompted by the vintage elements in the photograph.","title":"Teenagers of the second ward, the spanish-speaking section of El Paso","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["554901","548465","543027","549922","554900","551425","556525","554910","548467","548306","553546","553519","547045","558182","545959","554679"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["lie","grass","prone","rest","mat","teenager","bowl","sneaker","bent","youth"]}
