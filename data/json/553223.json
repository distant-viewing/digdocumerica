{"path":"553223.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph depicts a person sitting on a railing. The person is in silhouette against a softly illuminated background, which appears to be a street scene during daylight. The individual has an Afro hairstyle and is wearing a casual, striped, short-sleeved shirt paired with light-colored pants and dark shoes. They are looking off to their left side, with their head turned away from the camera, creating a profile view. Their hands are folded and resting on what appears to be their knees.\n\nThe background has a muted color palette with a hint of urban environment glimpsed through partial blurring. Details of the background include a portion of a vehicle on the left and a storefront or entrance with posters or signs visible in a soft focus to the right in the distance. The overall lighting and composition focus the viewerâ€™s attention primarily on the silhouette and thoughtful pose of the person. The mood conveyed is reflective and somewhat introspective.","title":"Fence-sitting at Fountain Square.
