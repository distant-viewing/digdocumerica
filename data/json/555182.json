{"path":"555182.jpg","date":"March 1967","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a rocky surface with various textures and color hues. The predominant color is a deep purplish-red, with a rough and uneven surface that suggests the rock could be a type of sedimentary or igneous formation. Across the surface, there are patches of lichen or moss, primarily in shades of gray and light green, which add a coarse texture different from the smoothness of the underlying rock.\n\nIn addition to the lichens, thin strands of what appears to be dried vegetation, possibly marine algae or terrestrial grass, cling to the rock, especially on the left side of the image. The combination of these plant elements with the rock suggests a natural setting that could be near a coast or in a dry, rocky area where wind and water have deposited these organic materials.\n\nThe right side of the photograph shows significantly darker areas on the rock, featuring black and dark brown patches that might be wet or host different types of organisms or mineral deposits. This variation in color and texture emphasizes the dynamic and diverse environment this rock is exposed to, possibly involving cycles of moisture and drying, or the growth and decay of organic materials.\n\nOverall, the image provides a detailed and textured representation of a natural rock formation, showing the intricate interplay between geological and biological elements in a specific environment.","title":"Lichens growing on a 60-year-old sitka spruce in olympic national timberland, Washington.
