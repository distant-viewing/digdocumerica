{"path":"548162.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures an expansive outdoor scene centered around a large body of water where a vast array of logs are floating, forming a sort of log boom. This appears to be a logging operation where logs are being stored or transported via water. The logs are clustered in a large circular pattern in the foreground, tightly packed together and surrounded by a barrier, possibly ropes or chains, to keep them contained.\n\nIn the immediate foreground, a cluster of vibrant yellow wildflowers adds a pop of color to the scene; these flowers appear to be an example of balsamroot, which are common in mountainous and open landscapes in North America. The flowers are large and bright, with their faces tilted up towards the sun.\n\nBeyond the floating logs and flowers, the background features a serene lake environment. The lake is bordered on one side by what seems to be a thin strip of land or a dam. In the distance, there are rolling hills covered with dense forests. The hills are various shades of green, suggesting a mix of tree types and possibly different sunlight exposure. The background also shows a partly cloudy blue sky, which casts soft, natural light over the entire landscape.\n\nOverall, this photograph suggests the activity of lumber processing in a beautiful, natural setting, juxtaposed with the untouched flora foregrounding the human influence on the landscape.","title":"Spokane river at post falls, Idaho, with log boom of the Louisiana pacific lumber plant floating in the water","placename":"Coeur d'Alene (Idaho)","location":"Coeur d'Alene, Idaho","nn1":["545028","552178","548018","550326","545036","550325","545037","550338","552161","545266","548004","552175","552162","552176","552163","542921"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","flower","float","example","cluster","lake","lumber","pop","boom","dam"]}
