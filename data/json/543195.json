{"path":"543195.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image features a striking natural contrast between the delicate and the rugged. In the foreground, a cluster of small daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and pale pinkish-white petals is nestled atop a large gray rock. The rock has visible cracks and crevices, highlighting the robust, enduring nature of stone.\n\nIn the background, there is a dynamic, slightly blurred view of rushing water, which appears to be a waterfall or a fast-moving river. The water is foamy and white, suggesting significant force and motion. The composition cleverly juxtaposes the static, sturdy rock and the serene, fragile flowers against the chaotic, moving water, emphasizing themes of perseverance and beauty in harsh conditions.\n\nOverall, the photograph is a study in contrasts and balances the elements of nature in a visually compelling way, drawing attention to both the strength and delicacy found in natural landscapes.","title":"California--Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["547646","544451","544435","550678","545703","545589","553997","547635","544887","544894","551331","544862","545718","550843","545723","544867"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["rock","daisy","flower","strength","crack","crevice","petal","waterfall","force","study"]}
