{"path":"544894.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up of a barren, rocky terrain with two bright yellow flowers emerging through the gaps between the rocks. The rocks are large, with mottled surfaces that vary in color from light grey to dark brown, possibly due to weathering or the presence of lichens. The composition focuses mainly on the contrast between the harsh, rugged texture of the rocks and the delicate, vivid appearance of the flowers.\n\nThe flowers are positioned near the center, enhancing their visual impact against the stark, stony background. Each flower has multiple small yellow petals and is attached to a thin, sparsely leafed stem. The leaves of the plants are narrow and slightly silvery, suggesting they are adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is bright, indicating daylight, which casts sharp shadows and highlights the textures of the rocks and the delicate details of the flowers. The overall setting feels remote and barren, emphasizing resilience and the beauty of life in extreme conditions.","title":"Bright yellow flowers of the arnica herb","placename":"Mesa Verde National Park (Colo.)","location":"Mesa Verde National Park, Colorado","nn1":["545718","544451","545727","544443","543201","549228","545562","549018","545723","544440","544938","544875","545296","544887","545703","555186"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["rock","flower","flowers","mottle","gaps","lichen","silvery","adapt","petal","stem"]}
