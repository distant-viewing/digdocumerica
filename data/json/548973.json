{"path":"548973.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph presents a serene yet somber natural scene featuring a large tree partially submerged in water. The setting is a calm, shallow body of water, possibly a lake or river. In the foreground, a dead fish with a notably textured, scaly skin lies on rocky, wet ground, emphasizing a disturbing element within a beautiful environment.\n\nThe large tree, central to the composition, has a robust trunk and sprawling branches covered in dense foliage. Its reflection is faintly visible in the stagnant water around it. The background shows a tranquil water body extending into the distance, bordered by gentle hills under a clear, perhaps slightly overcast sky.\n\nOverall, the image conjures a peaceful scene marred by the incongruence of death, indicated by the lifeless fish, hinting at environmental or ecological issues. The contrast between vitality (the tree) and mortality (the fish) poignantly captures a moment in nature that may invoke reflections on life, death, and environmental sustainability.","title":"Dead fish at pahranagat lake about 10 miles south of alamo","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["547737","546066","555637","546779","555008","550878","554608","554603","555560","542570","546332","551352","546963","550788","554717","555002"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["fish","sustainability","vitality","reflection","invoke","skin","water","issue","submerge","trunk"]}
