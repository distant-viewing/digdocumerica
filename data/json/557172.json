{"path":"557172.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph depicts a close-up of an elderly woman, who wears a colorful, patterned blouse with purples, reds, and whites, and a military-style cap that has a yellow band, black peak, and embellished with a metallic eagle badge. She has light skin and greyish hair partially visible under her hat. She is smiling slightly, showing teeth, and she appears to be mid-conversation or mid-laughter, which adds a joyful expression to her face.\n\nThe background features a sunny, outdoor setting with some parts softly focused. Behind her, there is a glimpse of a red brick structure that might be a building or wall, and a car which appears to be from the mid-20th century based on its design, can also be seen. There is also a grassy area with autumnal or early spring trees, mostly bare of leaves, indicating the season might be either fall or winter. The setting suggests she might be at a gathering or outdoor event, given her attire and the relaxed, informal atmosphere.","title":"Mrs. Betty Dorrell, part Iowa Indian, wears an old band hat from her school days in White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy in the northeast corner of the state. The band uniforms and other items from the schoolhouse were being auctioned for the benefit of the Ma Hush Ka (White Cloud) Historical Society. Proceeds were for the local museum housed in the school building. Mrs. Dorrell is a student at Haskell Indian Junior College in Lawrence, Kansas.","placename":"White Cloud (Kan.)","location":"White Cloud, Kansas","nn1":["557177","547385","543864","557039","554051","556594","543853","550679","555530","547379","557157","552398","553480","556176","553760","556487"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["tooth","laughter","badge","band","skin","fall","purple","up","white","blouse"]}
