{"path":"542617.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene where a large tractor is operating in a heavily wooded area. The tractor is moving through a rough, possibly makeshift path surrounded by dense trees, predominantly conifers. It appears to be running over logs and branches on the ground, generating a considerable amount of dust as it moves forward.\n\nThe setting is a forest with tall, mature pine trees that are illuminated by bright sunlight, suggesting it might be midday or early afternoon. The sunlight streaming through the branches of the trees creates areas of light and shadow on the forest floor, adding to the dynamic quality of the scene.\n\nThe tractor itself is green and is seen from behind, moving away from the viewerâ€™s point of view. Its rear wheels are covered in dust and are kicking up more dust as it progresses. The overall atmosphere is one of vigorous activity, likely related to logging or clearing land within the forest. The focus and motion blur suggest movement and action, capturing a moment in the laborious process of managing woodland environments.","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["554417","554416","542790","542624","542623","542609","554419","542614","553468","555154","542851","552201","547690","548807","553608","546950"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tractor","dust","forest","move","kick","branch","generate","clear","progress","conifer"]}
