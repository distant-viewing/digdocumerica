{"path":"546098.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a somber and reflective scene in a cemetery. The focus of the image is a gravestone, prominently occupying the right foreground. The gravestone is relatively new looking with a dark surface and clearly readable engraved text that says \"ALLEN LEASE, DIED APR. 19, 1881, AGED 15 YRS.\" Below the name and dates, an inscription reads \"Gone but not forgotten,\" which adds an emotional depth to the scene.\n\nTo the left of this main gravestone, there are several other gravestones, all of varying sizes and states of upkeep. One particularly noticeable gravestone in the middle ground is toppled over, lying flat on the ground, suggesting neglect or the passage of time. The lawn is covered with dry, brown grass, indicating a late fall or winter season, and the trees in the background are mostly bare, reinforcing the seasonal setting.\n\nThe background reveals more of the cemetery, extending into the distance with numerous other gravestones. Some are upright while others are slightly tilted, creating a sense of continuity and vastness in the cemetery. The sky is overcast, casting a muted, grey light over the scene, which enhances the serene yet melancholic atmosphere of the photograph. The overall composition conveys a sense of quiet and memory, characteristic of such a place of remembrance.","title":"The grave of Allen Lease, a young boy killed by the Apaches during the last Indian war between the Comanches and the Lipan-Apaches","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["554824","557941","558040","547417","557184","557942","554792","550731","554790","550364","550365","546147","552451","544259","547420","545322"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["gravestone","cemetery","continuity","remembrance","engrave","die","memory","upkeep","inscription","forget"]}
