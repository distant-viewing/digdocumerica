{"path":"546840.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph shows a large ferry boat crowded with passengers. The ferry, sporting multiple levels, is primarily white with windows along each level. The upper deck features a bridge visible with people surrounding the area, suggesting a clear, sunny day conducive to outdoor activities. On the front of the wheelhouse, the name \"PORT WELCOME\" is clearly visible, suggesting either the name of the vessel or a welcoming phrase related to the location. \n\nEach deck is populated with numerous passengers, most standing and appearing to be enjoying the ride or viewing the surroundings. The left side of the ferry, which occupies most of the frame, shows the vessel full of life with the open sea in the background, indicating it is possibly in transit or partaking in a sightseeing tour. The hull of the ship is close to the waterline, suggesting a heavy load, typical of a passenger ferry.\n\nThe water appears reasonably calm with little waves, reflecting light which indicates sunshine and good weather. This setting typically suggests a recreational or transport journey near a coast or on a large body of water. The crowd and the context hint at a festive or communal event, possibly a public holiday or a special sightseeing tour.","title":"The \"port welcome\" is underway on one of its regular tours of the harbor","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["553797","549706","549905","549707","547838","554176","549900","545728","549889","549910","554189","552280","550029","549561","553795","549373"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["ferry","sightseeing","passenger","tour","deck","crowd","vessel","partake","name","sunshine"]}
