{"path":"549059.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals engaged in scientific fieldwork by a large body of water. The setting is vivid, with the river taking up a considerable portion of the frame, reflecting the bright, clear sky. The background features lush greenery and a line of tall trees, indicating a vibrant, natural riverside environment.\n\nOn the rocky shore, two people are immersed in their tasks. The person on the left is seated on the ground, attentively writing or sketching on a clipboard, suggesting they might be recording observations or data. They are dressed in a light-colored short-sleeved shirt and dark pants, fitting attire for fieldwork.\n\nThe second individual is positioned closer to the water's edge, bending over while seemingly collecting samples or examining the water. This person wears a dark vest over a light shirt, coupled with dark shorts, and is either scooping up water or interacting with an instrument or container, indicative of environmental research activities.\n\nScattered around them are various pieces of scientific equipment and materials, such as open cases with bottles and tools, a bucket, and other sampling gear, denoting a well-equipped field study. The natural daylight and calm water add a serene ambiance to this scene of scientific exploration and environmental study.","title":"California Fish and Game biologists take water samples from \"Goose Flats\" section of the Colorado River.
