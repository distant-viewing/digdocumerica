{"path":"550384.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a serene nature scene composed of two caribou and a flying bird, set in a vast open landscape that appears to be a grassy plain. The left caribou is bending down, possibly grazing, showing its profile with its head near the ground, while the right caribou stands upright, viewed from behind with its head slightly turned to its right, showcasing a large, majestic rack of antlers. The bird in the background is mid-flight, positioned above the caribou and slightly blurred, indicating motion.\n\nThe setting is expansive and appears relatively flat, with a hint of low mountains or hills on the horizon under a soft, light sky. The light conditions suggest it might be either early morning or late afternoon, lending a gentle illumination to the scene. The photograph has a soft focus, creating a dreamy, tranquil atmosphere. The overall composition emphasizes the wildlife and the undisturbed natural environment they inhabit.","title":"Caribou feed on lichens and moss.
