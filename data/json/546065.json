{"path":"546065.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a hauntingly desolate scene of a dead forest. The landscape is filled with numerous leafless tree trunks, standing tall with a stark appearance against the sky. These trees exhibit pale, whitish bark, and many are stripped down to bare wood, evoking a sense of devastation or aftermath of a possible fire or environmental disaster.\n\nThe ground level shows darker shades, possibly representing charred earth or moist soil created by a wetland environment. Sparse remnants of underbrush and smaller plants can be seen interspersed throughout the area, mostly in dark tones, adding to the somber and bleak atmosphere of the setting.\n\nThe background subtly blends into a lighter sky, suggesting either an overcast day or smoke residue in the air, which softens the details of any distant trees or landscape features. The overall impression is of a desolate, affected natural space, likely recovering from a significant ecological impact.","title":"Bayou segnette swampland, which has been devastated by runoff petroleum sludge from a nearby natural gas installation the dead trunks of giant virgin cypress trees attest to the ravages of industrial pollution","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["546121","553572","553571","555162","555088","553626","555230","544241","555113","554746","555159","555201","555002","542819","543843","555202"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["residue","devastation","disaster","affect","soften","aftermath","bark","wetland","fire","remnant"]}
