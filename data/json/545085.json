{"path":"545085.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features an individual standing on a pebbled beach, partially obscured by a large, conical fishing net. The net is held open, perhaps to dry or sort post-catch, and fills much of the frame showcasing its fine mesh and structural rim. The person inside the net is visible only in part; we see from about knee level down to the person's feet. This individual is wearing dark pants and sturdy, dark footwear, which appear to be shoes rather than boots.\n\nThe background is unfocused but indicates a harsh, sunlit environment likely near water, suggested by the glare and the nature of the activity depicted. Rocks or pebbles make up the ground on which the person stands, with hints of a natural landscape or rocky outcrop visible beyond.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of maritime or fishing-related activity, emphasizing the tools of the trade in a natural, outdoor setting. The composition uses the texture and shape of the net to create a visually interesting frame around the action.","title":"Netting smelts","placename":"Yachats (Or.)","location":"Yachats, Oregon","nn1":["546360","543076","545086","552807","545208","553953","543033","547723","552298","545212","552271","546330","545077","554008","545185","543077"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","fishing","person","footwear","glare","trade","rim","catch","mesh","pebble"]}
