{"path":"557173.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up, side profile of a man with a distinct rugged appearance. He wears a wide-brimmed, weathered hat and has a full, bushy beard and mustache, both of which are graying. His long hair is pulled back, showing signs of gray, and peeks from beneath his hat. He is dressed in a denim or similarly textured gray shirt, contributing to his overall rustic, outdoorsy look.\n\nThe man's expression is serene, with his eyes closed and mouth slightly opened, suggesting a moment of relaxation or contemplation. The background is a simple, unobtrusive brick wall that provides a clean and undistracted backdrop, emphasizing the subject of the photograph.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a warm, natural color palette, dominated by the earthy tones of the man's attire and the red brick background, evoking a sense of calm and timeless character.","title":"Bob Breeze, a local historian known as \"Wolf River Bob,\" shown attending an auction of school artifacts at White Cloud, Kansas, near Troy.
