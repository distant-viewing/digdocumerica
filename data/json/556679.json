{"path":"556679.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling, spacious interior, likely of a grand train station hall, imbued with a vintage ambience. The wide-open space is characterized by a high ceiling with characteristic architectural features, possibly from an early or mid-20th-century design, and expansive floor area that gives an airy feeling to the scene.\n\nThe main hall is filled with people engaged in various activities. There are individuals and groups walking across the hall, some seemingly in a hurry, while others appear more leisurely. Magenta and brown tones dominate the clothing style, suggesting this photo may have been taken in an era when such colors were popular.\n\nThe floor of the venue is peppered with several small, eclectic kiosks and stalls, selling a variety of items ranging from what seems to be newspapers to possibly snacks or flowers. These stands add a commercial buzz to the atmosphere.\n\nAt the back and on the sides of the hall, there are large openings and doorways leading to other parts of the building, perhaps to different platforms or exits. The lighting in the hall is a mix of natural and artificial sources, creating pockets of brightness and shadow, enhancing the depth and texture of the scene.\n\nInformational signs, including what seems to be a digital timetable (marked by a '410' sign), adorn the walls, serving the practical needs of the travelers navigating the space.\n\nOverall, this photograph vividly captures the dynamic and lively essence of a major transportation hub during what appears to be a peak hour, with a rich architectural background and a diverse mix of people and activities.","title":"Train passengers in the main hall of the 30th Street Station at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is one of four or five stops made by Amtrak's Metroliners which make 16 round trips each day between New York City and Washington, District of Columbia. The corporation reported 18,000,000 passengers in the U.S. during 1974, an increase of 10 percent from the previous year. Despite more riders and revenue of $256.9 million, the management noted a deficit of $272.6 million.","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556828","556686","556069","556024","556131","556054","556680","556122","556825","556674","555963","556067","555962","555960","556018","556684"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["hall","kiosk","floor","pepper","snack","traveler","sell","stall","imbue","pocket"]}
