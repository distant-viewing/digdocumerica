{"path":"550606.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image appears to be a microscopic close-up of a mineral or possibly a geological sample. The photograph shows an array of complex textures and colors, predominantly dark hues interspersed with shiny, reflective areas that resemble tiny fragments of crystals or metallic elements.\n\nThe composition has an abstract quality, with rugged, bumpy surfaces dominating the scene. These surfaces are irregular and multifaceted, suggesting a hard, rocky material. The sparkling points of light scattered across the image give an impression of the sample being examined under particular lighting conditions that highlight its reflective properties.\n\nThere's an overall lack of uniformity in the texture, with some parts appearing more glossy and others more matte. There's no indication of human activity, objects, or specific actions taking placeâ€”just a detailed snapshot that captures the intricate physical characteristics of a geological or mineral sample. The perspective is such that the viewer feels submerged within the details of the material, making the image both educational and aesthetically intriguing due to its natural patterns and randomness.","title":"Fast water and granite rocks of the gulkana river where the pink salmon spawn","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["553582","544682","546165","543149","557626","552239","544815","555841","550474","555793","546119","553770","557609","555839","545487","543151"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sample","mineral","crystal","uniformity","indication","characteristic","fragment","material","property","close"]}
