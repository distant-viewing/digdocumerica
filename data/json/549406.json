{"path":"549406.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures two small sailboats actively sailing on a body of water that appears to be an open sea or a large lake. One of the sailboats is in the foreground and is shown at a close angle approaching from the right side, with water splashing dramatically around its bow as it cuts through the waves. The boat is manned by two young men; one is steering the boat while standing and the other is sitting down, both looking intently ahead. They are wearing casual sailing attire suitable for a day on the water.\n\nThe second sailboat is visible in the background, slightly out of focus, and it is sailing in the opposite direction to the foreground boat but on a similar course, suggesting a possible regatta or group sailing activity. Both boats have clean, white sails fully hoisted and are catching the wind effectively, indicating a breezy day perfect for sailing.\n\nThe sea is a deep blue with sunlight reflecting off the surface, implying it is a clear, sunny day. The composition of the photo, with its dynamic water action and the focused expressions of the sailors, conveys a sense of motion and the enjoyment of an adventurous sail. The overall mood is vibrant and full of energy, typical of a water sport scene.","title":"Contender in the Annapolis-Newport race on chesapeake bay in the early hours of the race.
