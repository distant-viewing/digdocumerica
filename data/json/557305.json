{"path":"557305.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph captures a detailed view of an industrial facility, likely a power plant or heavy manufacturing unit. The composition of the image displays several key features:\n\n1. **Smokestacks and Emissions**: Dominating the skyline are several large smokestacks. One prominent smokestack on the right is particularly tall, with a striking red and gray striped pattern. It emits a plume of dark smoke, contributing to the industrial atmosphere of the scene.\n\n2. **Structures and Machinery**: The plant features an array of metallic structures with complex arrangements of pipes, ducts, and cylindrical tanks. These elements are tightly packed, suggesting a facility designed for heavy industrial processes. The exterior surfaces of the buildings and machinery typically show metallic gray and muted red tones that blend with the industrial theme.\n\n3. **Architectural Elements**: There are staircases visible on the exterior of some tanks, providing access to different levels of the facility. The design and placement of these staircases add a geometric contrast to the cylindrical and rectangular shapes of the tanks and buildings.\n\n4. **Sky and Lighting**: The sky above the plant is notably clear and blue, offering a stark backdrop that highlights the smoke emission and the industrial nature of the facility. The lighting suggests the photograph was taken during daylight hours, with good visibility which helps in accentuating the details of the plantâ€™s infrastructure.\n\nOverall, the photograph provides a detailed and somewhat stark portrayal of an industrial setting, focusing on the elements typical of a facility likely involved in energy production or heavy manufacturing, marked by its complex machinery and environmental impact.","title":"Wet scrubbers (center of photo) were installed in a $42 million environment improvement project at the Phillips Power Station owned by the Duquesne Light Company and located on the Ohio River northwest of Pittsburgh.
