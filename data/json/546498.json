{"path":"546498.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set in an urban architectural environment. It features large columns and beams constructed from textured dark gray and beige blocks or stones. The perspective is framed by a close-up of one of the columns on the right side of the image, leading the viewer's eye down a corridor created by successive square columns on either side.\n\nAt the center of the composition, a woman is walking towards the camera. She appears to be dressed in a blue coat and is carrying a large white bag on her right arm, suggesting she might be returning from shopping or an errand. Her casual attire and the bag hint at everyday urban life. The area around her is seemingly deserted except for her, emphasizing a sense of solitude or introspection.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph highlights the structure's geometry, with sunlight creeping in from the above left, creating dramatic shadows and bright beams across the corridor floor, enhancing the depth and texture. The background shows a continuation of the architectural theme, with hints of a city environment beyond the immediate space. The general mood conveyed by the setting and the solitude of the figure is slightly solemn but peaceful, evoking a sense of quiet routine or contemplation in an urban setting.","title":"Columbus post office, built in 1970","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546528","546558","546510","556027","546493","549916","546506","546519","546526","546515","546462","546450","546576","546495","548257","552724"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["column","corridor","bag","beam","solitude","return","introspection","continuation","shopping","routine"]}
