{"path":"543969.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph depicts a cityscape during sunset or sunrise, under a heavy haze or smog, casting a significant impact on visibility and ambient light. The sun, slightly off-center to the left, appears as an intense, glowing orange orb suspended above the horizon. Its presence illuminates the sky around it with a gradient of orange and red hues tapering into the surrounding muted blue and gray atmosphere.\n\nThe bottom third of the image faintly reveals dark silhouettes of tall buildings, possibly skyscrapers, which are obscured by the haze giving a ghostly and isolated impression of the city below. There's an overall sense of tranquility despite the implications of urban pollution, reflected by the lack of any visible human activity or movement in the visible parts of the cityscape. \n\nThe composition, with its vast expanse of shaded sky dominating the frame and the sun acting as a focal point, conveys a moody, almost apocalyptic ambiance. This scene might be evocative of environmental themes and the human impact on natural phenomena.","title":"Smog lingers over Louisville skyline","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["542683","544086","545428","549970","543965","553021","548383","545406","545499","550300","543410","550289","548384","544082","549620","550304"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["haze","cityscape","phenomena","implication","orb","sun","smog","impact","third","sunrise"]}
