{"path":"552485.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up image of windswept grass or grain. The grass blades are predominantly in shades of green, tinged with yellow hues, suggesting either the effect of sunlight or the natural coloring of the plants. Each blade has a soft, furry texture, which is particularly noticeable at the tips, adding a tactile quality to the visual. The composition is dynamic, with the grass appearing to sway or ripple, an effect possibly enhanced by a long exposure or a gentle breeze at the time of capture. \n\nThe overall impression is one of movement and fluidity, almost as if the viewer is in the middle of a field with the grass swishing around. The background is not distinct due to the close focus on the grass, emphasizing the feeling of being enveloped by the natural environment. The image evokes a sense of calm and tranquility, yet also carries the energy of motion.","title":"In a field","placename":"Kickapoo (Ill.)","location":"Kickapoo, Illinois","nn1":["545069","544884","557104","557559","552504","552312","551370","549232","557191","549251","547924","547312","557442","546154","552554","542687"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["grass","blade","fluidity","visual","effect","coloring","tip","capture","grain","breeze"]}
