{"path":"548650.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up view of a striking architectural detail, specifically focusing on the roof of a building. The roof features a prominent pyramid-like pyramid shape with a textured surface made of what appears to be metallic tiles. Each diamond-shaped tile reflects light, adding a shimmering effect. The apex of the roof is adorned with a decorative finial, consisting of a spherical element on top of a tapered, spire-like structure, suggesting an element of Victorian or traditional design.\n\nPart of the building visible in the image includes the edges of white wooden structures, most likely part of the eaves. Additionally, there is a glimpse of a balcony railing that evokes a classic, ornate design, situated behind the main element of the pyramid roof. This is painted white and matches the traditional aesthetics of the buildingâ€™s architecture.\n\nThe background against which these architectural elements are set is a vivid blue sky, devoid of clouds, which highlights the roof's details and creates a strong contrast with the bright metal and white elements of the structure. The clarity and brightness of the sky suggest that the photograph was taken on a clear, sunny day.\n\nThe overall impression is one of a detailed examination of historical architecture, emphasizing craftsmanship and the use of durable materials, placed within a serene and clean environment. This type of roofing could typically be seen on institutional buildings or well-preserved historic homes, indicating meticulous maintenance and a commitment to preservation.","title":"Part of Key West's history and much of its charm is preserved in its old bahama style houses.
