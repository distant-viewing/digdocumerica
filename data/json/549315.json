The kiosk is covered with an assortment of items including postcards, small statues, guide books, and various trinkets that are designed to attract tourists. The stand features a striped canopy and is surrounded by a group of people.\n\nThere are several individuals in the photograph, each engaged in different activities: some are browsing items at the stand, while others are in conversation or walking by. The persons pictured vary in age and attire, suggesting a casual, everyday environment. There's a noticeable diversity in fashion, indicative of the era which appears to be from the 1970s or early 1980s based on the clothing styles, such as jackets, trousers, and hairstyles.\n\nThe environment around the stand includes leafy green trees, suggesting that the setting is a park or a similar recreational area. The backdrop has a natural feel, which contrasts with the commercial activity at the stand. There is also a partial view of a promotional umbrella and other urban infrastructure which provides context to the location being frequented by visitors or city dwellers.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph focuses on everyday urban life, showing the interaction between commerce and leisure in a park setting.","title":"People enjoying memorial day holiday at battery park in lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["556215","551694","551691","551833","551840","551689","550045","549974","557131","551686","553204","551695","551851","551749","549806","551699"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["dweller","stand","kiosk","park","frequent","browse","item","attract","1980","statue"]}
