He is standing in an outdoor setting next to a chain-link fence. The man is smiling and posing with his left hand resting on a wooden ladder and his right hand on his hip. He is wearing safety goggles, which are also coated in dust. His attire includes a long-sleeve shirt, trousers, and shoes, all of which are uniformly covered in the white dust.\n\nIn the background behind the man, the chain-link fence serves as a prominent backdrop. The ground beneath him appears to be grassy with some areas covered by the same white dust, suggesting an outdoor work environment, possibly related to painting or construction work that involves dust or powder. The overall ambiance of the photo suggests a lively moment captured during a work-related task, emphasizing a sense of accomplishment or good humor amidst physical labor.","title":"Painter working on chain link fence","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["553609","549961","553618","546032","554953","544171","542783","553025","556867","556391","550251","542779","544835","549632","554441","546041"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["dust","link","chain","work","fence","goggle","hip","painting","ladder","hand"]}
