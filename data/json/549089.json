{"path":"549089.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This image depicts a rural landscape, likely along a riverbank. In the foreground, the river flows with some people and animals engaging in activities. One individual is on horseback riding through shallow waters while another person appears to be walking along the riverbank with a small animal, potentially a dog. There's someone else standing in the river, possibly fishing or washing.\n\nBeyond the river, there are several structures that look like makeshift dwellings constructed with basic materials and featuring corrugated metal roofs. This suggests a modest, possibly improvised, community living close to the water.\n\nIn the background, the environment changes to what seems like agricultural fields, followed by a denser area with more structured buildings that might be a more urban setting. Trees and greenery are spread across the scene, enhancing the rural feel of the picture.\n\nThe entire setting speaks of a peaceful, everyday life juxtaposed against a backdrop that blends rural simplicity with a hint of urban development. The activities of the people and the tranquility of the outdoors play a significant role in defining the composition of the photograph.","title":"Horseman crossing Colorado River in Mexico, just below U.S border.
