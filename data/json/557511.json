{"path":"557511.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene with three children playing in the sand. The setting is a sunny day, and the beach is characterized by soft, dark sand near the water's edge, where gentle waves are breaking. The kids are engrossed in activities; two appear to be digging in the sand, possibly building sandcastles, while the third is slightly bent over possibly examining something in the sand or preparing to join the others.\n\nProminently in the background is a long wooden pier, stretching out into the ocean. The pier is supported by numerous wooden pillars and beams, featuring a section at the far end that appears to be slightly elevated or distinct, possibly for fishing or viewing.\n\nThe sky is clear and vividly blue, indicating it might be early morning or late afternoon, given the softness and angle of the sunlight. The overall mood is peaceful and playful, emphasizing a common beach day activity among children. The focus and composition of the image draw the viewerâ€™s eye not only to the children and their beach activities but also to the pier extending into the sea, providing a sense of depth and perspective.","title":"Youngsters play in the sand at the gaviota state beach.
