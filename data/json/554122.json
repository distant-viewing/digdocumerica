{"path":"554122.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene beach scene. In the image, a person is running along a shoreline where the frothy waves gently crash onto the dark sandy beach. The runner, appearing small in the expanse of the scene, is positioned towards the left side of the frame, surrounded by the natural beauty of the beach. The person is wearing swimwear, which suggests they might be enjoying a workout or a leisurely run along the coast.\n\nThe beach is lined with tall, dense palm trees that sway slightly, hinting at a gentle breeze, and extending into the background. These trees provide a lush, green contrast to the dark hue of the volcanic sand. The ocean water is a mixture of deep blues and whites, reflecting the sky above.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph indicates it might be early morning or late afternoon, as the sun casts soft light but is not directly overhead. The horizon is visible in the distance where the sky meets the sea, creating a sense of calm vastness. This setting not only showcases a peaceful seaside moment but also emphasizes the tranquility that can be found in nature.","title":"Famous black sand beach at Kaimu, created by lava runoff, is a favorite tourist stop. Area around beach is due to be developed. In order to preserve beach, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to add a new foundation of sand under the existing layer. Critics argue this would change color of beach, causing it to lose its appeal.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["543498","547612","546953","557509","543287","554159","554120","547600","548757","554118","554121","547607","545280","543296","547943","548088"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","swimwear","sway","run","crash","coast","breeze","palm","person","white"]}
