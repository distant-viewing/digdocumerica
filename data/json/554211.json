{"path":"554211.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph depicts a cluttered outdoor setting filled with a variety of agricultural machinery and equipment, which appears old and possibly discarded. The immediate foreground is filled with an array of metal components, some of which are rusted, including parts of machines, frames, boxes, and other unidentifiable objects. These items are piled together haphazardly.\n\nFurther back, the middle ground of the image is occupied by larger pieces of agricultural equipment, such as harvesters, tractors, and different types of yellow and red machinery. This machinery is also in various states of disrepair, scattered throughout an expansive grassy field.\n\nThe background shows a continuation of the grassy field which eventually meets a line of low-lying trees under a partially cloudy sky. The horizon is relatively flat, suggesting a vast, open rural landscape typical of farmland regions. The sky is mostly clear with some cloud cover, casting natural light over the scene, enhancing the rural, serene yet somewhat neglected atmosphere of the setting.","title":"Junkyard for worn-out agricultural implements at Karlstad","placename":"Lake of the Woods County (Minn.)","location":"Lake of the Woods County, Minnesota","nn1":["554212","557701","554783","543354","547777","542585","552102","552091","556324","546201","553985","554561","547297","547625","556323","543165"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["machinery","harvester","continuation","farmland","tractor","equipment","field","disrepair","outdoor","machine"]}
