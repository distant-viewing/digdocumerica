{"path":"549420.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures two contrasting watercrafts on what appears to be a calm body of water, possibly a river or a harbor, under a clear blue sky. On the left, thereâ€™s a larger, traditionally styled boat with multiple rows of oars, somewhat resembling a historical or ceremonial ship. It is painted in bold red and black and is equipped with a tall mast but no visible sails. The ship flies several flags from the top of the mast. There are several people aboard dressed in what seems to be traditional maritime outfits, including a person standing at the back steering the boat. This group appears engaged and lively.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, there is a small, simple motor boat with a single elderly gentleman seated at the helm, rowing with a pair of oars. This boat is much more modest and utilitarian compared to the left boat, suggesting a contrast in the usage and possibly the socio-economic status represented by each boat.\n\nThe background features a shoreline with buildings that include houses and larger structures that might be warehouses or commercial buildings, indicating a populated area. The atmosphere is peaceful and leisurely, with the bright daylight and gentle water rippling indicating good weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of nautical activity that contrastingly showcases tradition versus utility, involving people of different generations and activities.","title":"Viking image on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549411","543945","549414","552010","549416","549410","550825","548524","549418","552316","548507","548058","549432","549396","546819","557815"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","oar","mast","ship","gentleman","status","tradition","generation","motor","harbor"]}
