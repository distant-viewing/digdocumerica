{"path":"548223.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"The photograph depicts a lively, communal scene outside the Rockport Art Association, set in what appears to be a quaint, charming location. The white building, adorned with an American flag and another red banner with white lettering announcing the Rockport Art Association, creates a welcoming entrance. There is a group of people of varying ages entering and exiting the building, suggesting a communal or social event taking place. People's attire, consisting of winter coats and scarves, suggests the season is probably late winter or early spring.\n\nIn front of the building, there is a large wooden signboard, which includes flyers and announcements. The most prominent flyer advertises a \"One-Man Show\" featuring the work of Sandra Douglas, alongside a Red Cross poster urging onlookers to \"Be a good neighbor. Help the good neighbor. Give.\" This suggests community support and charitable activities are emphasized within this environment. Other smaller posters also advertise art classes and other exhibitions, reinforcing the building's purpose as a local community arts hub.\n\nThe old-style lamppost and the weathered look of the sidewalk, along with the trimmed, bare bushes and a visible bare tree stump, contribute to the rustic charm of the scene. Elements like these give the image a sense of community focus and historical coziness typical of small-town America. The composition of the photograph, with its focus on both the community board and the people, highlights the vibrant community interaction and the importance of art and gatherings in this town.","title":"Sunday afternoon at the Rockport Art Association","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["557943","551666","553177","554691","553262","558118","548242","557654","550110","545221","552460","551116","551692","545384","543132","543398"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["art","community","poster","winter","town","signboard","lamppost","exhibition","class","onlooker"]}
