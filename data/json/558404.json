{"path":"558404.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Stroble, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a church during a service. The setting features wooden pews filled with congregants who are attentively facing forward towards the altar. The foreground shows the backs of several people, including a man in a dark suit and a woman with curly hair. The middle ground offers a clearer view of a clergyman dressed in a white robe with a red stole, actively gesturing as he speaks from behind a wooden pulpit. Beside the pulpit, there is a small podium with a red fabric hanging. On the steps of the altar area, several lit candles and a large red banner with white text that adds to the ceremonial ambiance are visible. The interior architecture includes paneled wood walls and a large, modern stained-glass window on the right. The atmosphere seems solemn and reflective, typical of a religious service.","title":"Religion plays an important part in the lives of residents.
