{"path":"553585.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up scene involving a pig and a human hand interacting with a tree. The pig, which has a prominent snout, is sniffing or biting into a broken, jagged piece of the tree bark. The tree has a rough texture covered partially by lichen or moss, indicating that it may be old or in a moist environment.\n\nIn the foreground, a human hand is visible, pressing against the tree trunk. The hand appears weathered or dirty, possibly suggesting physical labor or outdoor activity. The setting around them is not distinctly visible, giving the entire focus to the interaction between the hand, the pig, and the tree.\n\nThe image has a somewhat mysterious or intimate nature, focusing closely on the textures and immediate action without revealing much of the surroundings or broader context, concentrating on a moment of interaction between nature and animals.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain Range near Sonora. 5,880 acres (a third of the affected area) are owned by the Pickering Lumber Company of Standard, California. Salvage operations were started as soon as area could be entered. Pickering forester Joe Dillard cuts burned bark to expose unharmed wood of white fir tree.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["557938","556605","556608","546954","554559","546071","542749","554997","554929","544662","544332","542777","543488","551023","554604","557616"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["hand","lichen","tree","bark","interaction","moss","texture","labor","animal","trunk"]}
