{"path":"547343.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural landscape at dusk, dominated by a wide view of a plowed field in the foreground. The field is evidently agriculture land, likely after harvest, with remnants of crop stubble visible, forming a rough texture across the scene.\n\nIn the middle of the composition stands a pristine white church with a classical design, including a pointed steeple that extends skyward. Its white facade contrasts sharply against the darker, muted tones of the surrounding landscape and the deepening blue sky at dusk. \n\nBehind the church, to the left, there is a cluster of dark trees that add depth and a sense of the natural environment typical in rural settings. On the right side of the church, there are a few structures which appear to be farm buildings, including a house and perhaps barns or storage buildings. These structures have a traditional rustic appearance, hinting at the functional, agricultural use of the surrounding land.\n\nThe sky above is clear, suggesting a serene, tranquil evening. The overall composition and the twilight lighting evoke a peaceful, solemn atmosphere typical of many rural American landscapes.","title":"70-year-old Immanuel Lutheran Church looks out over farmlands of Plymouth.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547324","547440","550287","546455","547346","556480","547289","557952","557023","547357","557119","547393","547309","554035","547288","557951"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["church","dusk","steeple","plow","harvest","land","field","agriculture","barn","remnant"]}
