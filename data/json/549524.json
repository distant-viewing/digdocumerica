{"path":"549524.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an industrial area by a body of water, exhibiting a predominantly blue and dark tone that implies significant water pollution. The area is densely packed with factories, warehouses, and various industrial buildings, which are interspersed with open lots and piles of materials or debris.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a waterfront with several large buildings lining the edge, and a spacious parking area filled with numerous cars, suggesting a busy working day. The water itself appears to be darkly colored, possibly indicating pollution.\n\nIn the center and towards the right of the photograph, there are rail tracks running parallel to the waterfront. The overall layout includes a mixture of smaller structures, possibly workshops or storage facilities, and larger industrial complexes. Some areas show exposed earth and construction activities, suggesting ongoing development or maintenance.\n\nTowards the bottom right, two rectangular, filled pools or basins are visible, colored in black, which might be used for some type of industrial processing or waste management.\n\nOverall, the area captured in the image is characterized by heavy industrial use and significant human modification of the landscape, all set against the backdrop of a polluted water body, depicting environmental impact commonly associated with industrial zones.","title":"Industrialized section of the heavily polluted Buffalo River oil slick, visible on the surface, will eventually flow into the Niagara River.","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["549519","555769","550890","555770","551183","552209","548423","552151","555776","552219","549968","551177","549495","552181","555771","550761"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["waterfront","pollution","modification","basin","black","workshop","water","pool","rail","warehouse"]}
