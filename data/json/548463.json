{"path":"548463.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph is set in what appears to be a medical or educational environment. The main focus is on two peopleâ€”a man and a woman. The man is positioned slightly to the left and appears to be conducting a health check or exam on the woman, as he is using an otoscope to look into her ear. He is wearing glasses, has a beard, and is dressed in a striped, button-up shirt.\n\nThe woman, positioned on the right, is sitting and facing forward with a calm but somber expression. She has long, straight hair, and is wearing a gingham check shirt.\n\nIn the background, various educational posters and documents are pinned to the walls, adding to the clinical or scholastic atmosphere. One visible poster shows the anatomy of the human skeleton, while other documents seem to include textual information possibly related to health or environment, given one appears to show an industrial scene or power plant. A small portion of a floral-patterned curtain is also visible, which softens the clinical feel of the room slightly.\n\nThe room is painted in a light green color, and there are no visible windows, suggesting an internal room possibly in a clinic or educational institution. The overall ambiance is utilitarian, with a focus on practicality and education.","title":"Dr. Epstein of the Paris Street Clinic examines Donna Delaney's ears.
