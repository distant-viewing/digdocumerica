{"path":"545411.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a small corner building painted light blue with bold yellow and orange typography on its walls advertising its business. The specific text on each wall reads differently, combining to advertise the business called \"National Scrap Metals\" along with a slogan: “We Buy Scrap Metals.” The typography styles are a mix of uppercase, creatively aligned to fit the corner architecture of the building.\n\nThe building has a simple, utilitarian design with a pitched roof. The depicted corner sharply divides the building into two planes, each carrying part of the advertisement. The left plane has some additional elements such as windows or vents near the roofline, and the business’s phone number is also visible near these windows.\n\nThe surrounding area features a clear sky, indicating it might be a bright, sunny day. To the right of the building, in the background, there is the hint of what appears to be a fairground or carnival, marked by a striped canopy and other unidentifiable structures, suggesting a contrast between the industrial business of the foreground and a recreational area in the background.\n\nThe angle and perspective of the photo make the corner of the building a prominent visual element, guiding the viewer's eye along the building’s walls and the text written on them. The overall composition captures a slice of local enterprise, possibly situated at the edge of a town, where industrial and recreational zones merge.","title":"Alabama--Birmingham","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["544831","547894","555439","545355","556047","550141","552968","544656","546440","545317","552963","545333","552964","545869","547610","546034"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["business","corner","plane","advertise","building","wall","text","slogan","enterprise","pitched"]}
