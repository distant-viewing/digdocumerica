{"path":"552506.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts the Marbletown Community Church, a relatively small, simple structure situated in a natural setting. The church is primarily constructed from horizontal wooden siding, painted white, and it features a gabled roof covered with green shingles.\n\nThe main entrance of the church, visible on the left side of the image, includes a simple wooden door located under a covered porch area. The porch roof is supported by white wooden beams, and a sign above the doorway prominently displays the name \"Marbletown Community Church,\" painted in black in a fairly traditional font. On either side of the entrance, there are small windows, although details of their design are not fully visible due to the angle and lighting.\n\nSurrounding the church are moderate amounts of vegetation, including bushes and wild grasses, indicating a somewhat untended, yet natural environment. The church casts a shadow on its right side, suggesting the photograph was taken in natural daylight with the sun positioned to create contrasting light and shadows on the structure.\n\nOverall, the setting gives a sense of pastoral calm and seclusion, typical of rural community churches. The photograph captures the simplicity and tranquil setting of a small town religious facility.","title":"Abandoned church in Marble-town","placename":"Springfield (Ill.)","location":"Springfield, Illinois","nn1":["556480","554207","558024","552479","557758","554035","558023","554208","557083","557951","554162","554000","558034","558163","554033","558019"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["church","entrance","porch","font","shingle","black","seclusion","roof","doorway","calm"]}
