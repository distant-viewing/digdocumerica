{"path":"548587.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a wetland landscape that appears to have undergone significant environmental stress. The foreground shows tangled branches and dead trees, their trunks and limbs bleached and pale, sprawling across a watery marsh. The gray and white coloring of the wood suggests they have been long exposed to water and perhaps chemical elements. Patches of green vegetation sporadically emerge around the water, indicating some life persists in the area.\n\nThe middle ground consists of more dense clusters of dead trees interspersed with living bushes and trees, which still bear leaves. The topography is flat, and the water surface is covered with reflective patches, possibly hinting at oil or another substance altering the water's surface. \n\nIn the background, the scene opens up slightly with fewer trees, giving way to a clearer view of the sky and a distant treeline. The sky is partly cloudy with some areas of blue visible, suggesting either a break in weather patterns or merely less density in the vegetation allowing a clearer view up above.\n\nOverall, the scene is striking and somewhat somber, reflective of a wetland in distress or undergoing some environmental changes or challenges.","title":"Ohio, or Sunshine Key, in the Lower Florida Keys, is where Rachel Carson researched her book, Edge of the Sea (1955).
