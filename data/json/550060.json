{"path":"550060.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a group of people engaged in what appears to be a roadside clean-up activity. The scene is set along a roadside bordered by a paved street on one side and an area with grass and bushes on the other.\n\nOn the left part of the image, a male figure, dressed in dark clothing with a bag slung over his shoulder, is jogging away from the camera along the roadside. His motion suggests he's passing by the scene where the activity is happening.\n\nIn the middle and right parts of the image, there's a group of individuals, predominantly children and a few adults, who are picking up litter. The children and adults are dressed casually and are using plastic bags to gather the waste. There's a mix of clothing styles, with some individuals wearing long skirts, jackets, and different types of tops, indicative of informal or casual attire suitable for outdoor activity. \n\nThe background of the image shows secondary elements like a green \"Speed Limit 40\" sign and commercial billboards, one advertising Old Thompson with the slogan \"the perfect light touch,\" which adds a commercial element to the rural or semi-rural setting. There's also a glimpse of a Telephone pole line running parallel to the road, a common feature in suburban or rural areas.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its focus on environmental cleanup in a setting that combines elements of both nature and human-made structures, suggests themes of community involvement and environmental consciousness. The road itself is quite empty except for a distant vehicle, emphasizing the quietness of the area and possibly the safety and seclusion suitable for such community activities.","title":"Cleaning up the roadside in Onset","placename":"New Bedford (Mass.)","location":"New Bedford, Massachusetts","nn1":["546863","543927","551427","544800","552948","542655","548198","550155","550056","548191","543176","551421","552951","551391","552085","545136"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["roadside","bag","adult","quietness","cleanup","slogan","clothing","child","community","billboard"]}
