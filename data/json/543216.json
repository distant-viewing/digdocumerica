{"path":"543216.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively beach scene filled with activity. The setting is a sandy beach, with unique purple-colored cliffs and green vegetation in the background, indicating a possibly cool coastal area.\n\nIn the foreground, five young people are engaged in making something out of the sand, possibly a sand castle. Three of these individuals, two young men and one woman, are directly interacting with the sand. The woman is kneeling to the left in a gray long-sleeve top and blue jeans, while one man is kneeling and another is bent over the sand in a kneeling position; both men are shirtless and wearing cutoff denim shorts. Another young woman, wearing a pink bikini, is mostly submerged in the sand except for her upper back and head, suggesting playfulness or an ongoing game among them.\n\nTo the right, slightly further in the distance, a person in a purple T-shirt and yellow shorts walks across the scene. Their energetic stride and wide smile contribute to the vibrant, fun atmosphere of the beach setting.\n\nIn the farther background, other beachgoers can be seen scattered around, engaging in various activities, including a child who appears to be running or playing.\n\nOverall, this is a dynamic and colorful scene of beach-related leisure, highlighting the joyful and casual atmosphere among friends and fellow visitors at the beach.","title":"California--Santa Cruz","placename":"Santa Cruz (Calif.)","location":"Santa Cruz, California","nn1":["543333","543534","555892","550936","555923","553952","543225","543322","548541","557507","546874","543321","550929","550243","546794","550932"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sand","beach","knee","woman","stride","playfulness","beachgoer","bikini","shorts","friend"]}
