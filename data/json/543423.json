{"path":"543423.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a coastal town during what appears to be the evening, as indicated by the low light and long shadows. The town is densely populated with numerous houses and buildings arranged primarily in a grid-like pattern. The architecture is varied, suggesting a mix of residential and possibly commercial properties.\n\nIn the foreground, a curvy coastline featuring rocky shores is visible, contrasting sharply with the manmade environment of the town. Several docks or piers protrude into the sea, around which are clusters of moored boats, hinting at a likely active fishing or boating community. There's also an inlet with a beach area that curves into the town.\n\nThe top central part of the image extends into a forested area, providing a natural boundary to the urban spread. On the opposite side, the ocean stretches out, vast and uninterrupted. In addition to the main body of the urban area, there are smaller, isolated sections of development closer to the water, indicating a possible preference for seafront real estate.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a blend of natural and urban landscapes, suggesting a town that heavily integrates its lifestyle and economy with the coastal environment.","title":"California -- coastal city, Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543438","550363","554058","547984","555757","554143","542913","557453","553931","555756","555688","553790","557463","545121","556953","557462"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["town","preference","estate","economy","inlet","addition","boat","lifestyle","integrate","protrude"]}
