{"path":"550671.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of an auction taking place outdoors. The setting seems to be a semi-industrial or rural area with wooden buildings and structures around, which are possibly unused or abandoned warehouses or barns. The focus of the image is an auction, as indicated by multiple signs. One prominent sign at the forefront reads \"FOR SALE\" and another below it announces, \"AUCTION HERE JUNE 1 '73 at 10:00 a.m. - Furniture, Dishes, Antique Boat, Tools. Rich U. LivE Chattels REFRESHMENTS ON SALE.\" This suggests the auction includes a variety of items from household furniture to unique collectibles like boats.\n\nIn the background of this daytime photograph, people, predominantly males wearing coats and hats typical of the 1970s, are gathered around an auctioneer who is not clearly visible but likely standing on a raised platform. A group of men on the left part of the image can be seen conversing or listening intently. The environment is casual, with some people standing and others moving around.\n\nBehind the auctioneer, a building shows exposed beams and stair elements, indicating either construction or disrepair. Vegetation is visible around the area, with some overgrowth next to the path leading to the auction. The overall atmosphere is one of a community event, bringing people together for the purpose of bidding on items offered for sale.","title":"Auction at Milan, on the Androscoggin River","placename":"Berlin (N.H.)","location":"Berlin, New Hamshire","nn1":["547381","557161","550675","552631","551163","557163","557132","547378","551696","552666","557130","557131","547374","551749","551695","547370"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["sale","overgrowth","item","household","people","stair","furniture","barn","male","disrepair"]}
