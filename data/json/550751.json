{"path":"550751.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph depicts a sunny day in an urban public plaza or park, featuring several groups of people engaged in various activities, mostly seated on wide, red brick steps adorned with flowerbeds. The setting seems to be a part of a larger public space characterized by modern architecture.\n\nIn the composition, there are multiple high-rise buildings that dominate the background, featuring a 60s or 70s modernist architectural style with repetitive geometric patterns on their facades. These buildings provide a stark, structured contrast to the more relaxed and casual scene in the foreground.\n\nThe people captured in the image appear to be enjoying leisure activities; several are sitting and chatting, while others are eating or reading. The attire of the individuals suggests a period look, possibly from the late 20th century, with women in dresses and skirts and men in pants and shirts, some with jackets.\n\nThere is also a fountain visible on the lower left side of the image, adding a sense of tranquility to the scene. Broad walkways intersect the plaza, leading to various directions, and some lamps are seen, which would illuminate the space at night. The overall atmosphere is lively yet relaxed, with people gathered in a social but calm and open environment.","title":"Midsummer siesta at City Hall Plaza","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550759","553158","551651","553319","551636","553159","553324","551823","557257","550762","546452","550003","549988","551643","557258","550302"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["plaza","flowerbed","60","70","people","fountain","skirt","night","space","walkway"]}
