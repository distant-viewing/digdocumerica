{"path":"545979.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene, expansive waterscape under a vast sky filled with clouds of varying sizes and forms. The sky takes up a significant portion of the frame, suggesting a bright, although slightly overcast day.\n\nCentered in the image and seen across a body of calm water is an industrial scene. The foreground shows shallow water reflecting the sky and possibly a hint of marshland or low-lying islands with sparse vegetation. The middle-ground is dominated by several large structures related to industrial activity. Conspicuous among these are cranes and a tall, slender tower that might be part of a facility like a power plant or manufacturing unit.\n\nThere are no visible humans in the scene, illustrating the image's focus on industrial architecture versus human activity. The overall atmosphere is quiet and somewhat isolated, emphasizing the contrast between natural beauty and industrial development. The water and sky contribute calm and openness to the composition, while the industrial structures introduce elements of human endeavor and engineering.","title":"Dredging for natural gas in marshlands along the Freeport Sulphur Co. pipeline canal","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552179","552717","546864","544695","552139","544527","545020","550344","551576","545862","546974","551954","546083","552040","544328","550937"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["waterscape","marshland","introduce","endeavor","openness","engineering","island","unit","manufacturing","crane"]}
