{"path":"553493.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph portrays a street scene that appears to be from a bygone era, depicting the daily life of a residential neighborhood. In the foreground, a woman is walking across the street, pushing a stroller with two young children seated in it. The woman is dressed in a long-sleeved top and patterned pants, suggesting a cooler weather setting.\n\nOn the street, there are two parked cars that exhibit the design style typical of the 1960s or 1970s American automobiles. The car closer to the view is a large, black coupe, while the other, a white sedan, is parked behind it. The architecture of the houses lining the street features front porches supported by columns, and some of these porches have visible furniture like chairs.\n\nThe environment presents a somewhat aged look with visible wear and neglect, including peeling paint on the houses and an unkept front yard devoid of lush greenery, implying an urban setting that might have seen better days. The overall ambiance evokes a sense of everyday life from a specific historical period.","title":"The Watkins of Mulky Square, a family of eleven, live in the 1600 block of Madison Street, a few blocks from the area being cleared for I-635.
