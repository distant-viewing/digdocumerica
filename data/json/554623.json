{"path":"554623.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a serene scene focused on a body of water, presumably a pond or river, surrounded by lush vegetation. The view is from an elevated position looking down towards the surface of the water.\n\nThe water body has a still surface with a mirror-like reflection showing trees and the sky. The predominant colors of the water range from deep blue to murky browns, indicating variability in depth or bottom composition. Subtle disturbances on the water's surface, possibly from falling debris or insects, create gentle ripples.\n\nVegetation surrounds the water and is densely packed, featuring various shades of green. The trees appear to be a mix of deciduous types, with some branches hanging over the water, enhancing the secluded and tucked-away feel of the scene. The foreground prominently displays lush greenery that slightly obscures the waterway, adding depth and a sense of discovery to the composition.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken during the day with ample natural light filtering through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the water and contributing to the overall tranquil and somewhat mysterious ambiance of the setting.","title":"Discharge of untreated sewage effluent into the Moose River from the primary treatment plant below the town of Old Forge, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551352","546963","554776","553410","543561","554527","543611","551349","550844","554603","554608","545008","557254","544765","553465","557255"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["water","variability","discovery","insect","surface","filtering","disturbance","mirror","depth","pond"]}
