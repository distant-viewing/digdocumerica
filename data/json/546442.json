{"path":"546442.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The image shows a two-story brick residential house with several distinct features. The structure has a steeply pitched gable roof, adorned with dark shingles. There are multiple large windows symmetrically arranged across the surface of the house, each framed with light trim and reflective, which indicates they may be glass. The windows on the upper story have shorter top sections which might be part of a dormer structure that is obscured from view. \n\nThere is a central entrance that features an ornate, peaked porch supported by two columns, which add architectural interest to the home's facade. The entryway has double doors, each half glazed with small panes of glass and a semi-circular transom window above, suggesting a traditional style.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a wrought-iron fence and gate which is finely crafted, featuring ornate decor, like scrolls and finials, suggesting careful attention to detail and possibly historical significance. Immediately behind the fence, the garden appears lush and well-maintained, with a closely-trimmed lawn and neatly arranged bushes along the fence line. A pathway leads from the gate to the front porch, inviting entry.\n\nOverall, the photograph offers a view of a quaint and serene domestic environment, likely located in a region with a rich history given the architectural detailing and mature landscaping.","title":"Well-kept home on Franklin Street","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["557065","557076","550124","558035","558153","548667","558152","558149","557071","546439","558160","558156","546429","557094","548295","546433"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["gate","fence","trim","porch","arrange","story","window","entryway","gable","entry"]}
