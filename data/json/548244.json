A young boy with reddish-brown hair is seated in a classic barber chair, covered with a striped barber cape. He appears calm, with his eyes closed, as a barber with dark hair meticulously styles his hair. The barber is dressed in a white short-sleeve shirt, leaning slightly forward while gently shaping the boy's hair with his hands.\n\nIn the background, there are other individuals seated and getting haircuts, reflecting a typical busy day at the shop. Mirrors and additional barber chairs are visible, suggesting a relatively spacious setup. The setting captures a moment of everyday life, preserving the traditional barbershop experience. Elements such as the wooden counters, classic barber chairs with red cushions, and inset mirrors contribute to the vintage feel of the scene. The overall atmosphere is one of casual professionalism and community.","title":"Rockport's barbershop","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["556494","547342","548233","556626","554870","556613","548234","553518","553030","557352","547794","556606","547796","551342","554896","550681"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["chair","hair","mirror","boy","haircut","professionalism","cushion","counter","ambience","shop"]}
