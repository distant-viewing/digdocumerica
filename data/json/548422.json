{"path":"548422.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph shows an industrial or junkyard scene located next to a body of water. The area is cluttered with a wide variety of discarded materials and objects. One can observe multiple scrapped vehicles, including cars, trucks, and buses in various states of dismantlement and decay. There are also shipping containers, large metal tanks, debris, and miscellaneous mechanical parts strewn across the area.\n\nSeveral small buildings and storage facilities appear in the background, possibly used for processing or storing scrap materials. There is also a large warehouse or factory building visible at the upper right of the image. The waterfront includes a section with broken-down piers and wooden structures, contributing to the overall sense of neglect and disrepair.\n\nThe environment appears untidy and polluted, characteristic of industrial zones that handle waste materials. The presence of the water body adjacent to the scrapyard raises concerns about potential environmental contamination. The gray, overcast sky complements the grim, industrial aesthetic of the scene, suggesting this is an area heavily impacted by human activity with little regard for environmental preservation.","title":"Abandoned warehouses and dump on Hudson River","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547611","549307","547610","551996","545059","547062","547152","547054","546913","547901","548357","547625","551985","552072","546854","552154"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["material","junkyard","scrapyard","contamination","preservation","scrap","disrepair","concern","bus","warehouse"]}
