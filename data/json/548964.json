{"path":"548964.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures an agricultural scene in a broad expanse of a leafy green crop field under a bright sky. It features heavy machinery during harvest. A large piece of farming equipment, which appears to be a harvester, is in operation, positioned to the right of the frame. This harvester is connected to a double trailer setup, where two wooden-sided trailers are filled with the freshly harvested crop.\n\nThe machinery is painted in a combination of red and green, typical colors for agricultural equipment, suggesting a practical and durable design for farm work. The trailers are quite robust with high wooden walls to contain a significant volume of crop.\n\nYou can see crop residue being expelled from the top of the harvester, indicating active harvesting. The field itself, lush and dense with foliage, stretches throughout the entirety of the frame, suggesting a healthy and well-maintained crop.\n\nIn the background, the sky is clear, featuring a soft gradient from a pale to deeper blue, hinting at a calm weather condition ideal for farming activities. There are no visible people in the photograph, focusing the viewer's attention completely on the machinery and the process of harvesting.","title":"Alfalfa field on experimental farm operated by EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["548976","548985","548981","548982","555619","554044","548820","547432","548991","547730","548979","548950","549258","545893","557753","557521"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["crop","harvester","trailer","harvesting","machinery","farming","harvest","entirety","residue","volume"]}
