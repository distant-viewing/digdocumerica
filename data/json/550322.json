{"path":"550322.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic vista of a coastal town bordered by a large body of water. The foreground shows the calm water surface, dotted occasionally with wooden poles sticking out. In front of the town, there appears to be a fenced structure partially submerged in the water, possibly a maritime-related facility.\n\nThe midground is occupied by a cluster of buildings directly adjacent to the waterfront. These buildings vary in size and color, including shades of red, yellow, and muted browns, giving the town a colorful, diverse architectural look. Some of these structures are built on stilts over the water, suggesting they are boathouses or warehouses.\n\nThe background features a hill upon which more of the town is spread. The houses here are mostly painted in lighter colors like white and soft yellows, set among greenery. The higher elevation is dotted with an array of residential homes and a notable building with a large white steeple, likely a church, which stands out due to its height and prominence.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is quiet and serene, typical of a small seaside town. The sky is overcast with thick, heavy clouds suggesting a cool or damp climate. This type of setting is typical in regions like New England or similar coastal areas in the mid to northern parts of the United States.","title":"Lubec, looking west from campobello island.
