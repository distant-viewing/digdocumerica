{"path":"544119.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic and moody evening landscape under a stormy sky. The image features deep blues and purples in the sky, with bulky, ominous clouds that cover most of the upper frame, appearing heavy with rain. A streak of natural light at the horizon suggests either sunset or sunrise, adding a contrast to the dark weather above.\n\nIn the center of the image, blurred light trails from a moving vehicle are seen; the trails are mostly red and white, indicating the vehicle's rear and front lights. These trails impart a sense of motion against the stillness of the dark surroundings. The landscape is silhouetted against the sky, showing a rolling hill on the right side, which frames the scene and adds depth to the composition. The hint of another distant hill mirrors the one closer on the right side, creating balance in the image.\n\nAt the bottom right corner, faint twinkling lights suggest a distant human presence or settlement, adding a minute but poignant touch of life to the otherwise somber and natural scene. The overall mood is somewhat eerie yet captivating, dominated by the power of nature and the fleeting presence of human activity.","title":"Hauling coal at night from Black Mesa strip mine.
