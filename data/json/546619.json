{"path":"546619.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures an urban street setting with a clear focus on a prominently displayed \"Emergency No Parking\" sign. The sign is attached to a metal post in the foreground and contains date and time restrictions. Behind the sign, a lineup of parked cars stretches along the curbside, with a mix of vehicle models visible but highlighted by a prominent dark-colored car with a distinctive rear design featuring large rectangular taillights.\n\nThe environment suggests an overcast or dusky time as the lighting is dim, adding a moody atmosphere to the scene. In the distance, a city bus is stopped, marked by glowing brake lights, which suggests there is active traffic on the road despite the parking restrictions.\n\nThe depth of field in the image is shallow with the sharp focus on the no parking sign, causing the background elements like the cars and the bus to blur slightly, emphasizing the importance of the sign in this urban setting. The overall composition uses the street lined with cars and the blurred movement of the bus to convey a busy city life continuing around the stationary objects.","title":"Illegal parking at Jackson Place.
