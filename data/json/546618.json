{"path":"546618.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph showcases a large group of pigeons gathered on a paved public square. The pigeons are densely packed, and they appear in various shades primarily grey, with some having markings of white and black. Shadows, likely from a low sun, stretch across the square, adding a dramatic effect to the composition.\n\nThe background provides an urban context, showing elements such as buses in a parking area, which indicates the photo might have been taken in a city center or near a transportation hub. Beyond the immediate foreground with the pigeons, the environment includes what appears to be a body of water and distant trees, which are mainly leafless, suggesting the season could be fall or winter. This outdoor setting seems well-visited but is devoid of people in the immediate vicinity of the pigeons.\n\nPedestrian barriers and ledges are partially visible, and the setting is made up of hard stone and concrete surfaces, typical of a public urban area designed for high foot traffic and durability. The overall mood conveyed by the lighting and subject matter is peaceful yet lively, characterized by the natural congregation of birds in a human-dominated landscape.","title":"Ubiquitous city pigeons","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["553206","553292","549757","546759","549744","549738","557126","553218","549742","557123","557125","557208","554600","549758","552238","553347"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["square","congregation","matter","visit","ledge","foot","hub","marking","vicinity","bus"]}
