{"path":"548460.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor scene featuring a mobile home and its surrounding environment. The mobile home is prominently displayed with a color scheme of burgundy and white. The home has a small, covered front porch where a woman is seated on a metal step-chair, interacting with a medium-sized dog, possibly playing or petting it.\n\nThe mobile home is skirted with a white rail fence, which complements the neatly landscaped area that includes a few small shrubs and a tiny pointed tree placed near a white, round stand. Two concrete pathways lead to the porch steps. There are also decorative elements visible, such as a small hanging basket with flowers and a decorative item next to the door featuring a heart shape.\n\nBehind the mobile home, the backdrop shows lush green trees under a bright blue sky, adding a serene and pleasant atmosphere to the setting. The environment appears well-maintained and tranquil, suggesting a calm residential area.","title":"Mary Stack, refugee from the Logan Airport area of East Boston.
