{"path":"552393.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The image captures a sunset scene featuring a helicopter maintenance operation. The photograph is tinted with warm hues, primarily oranges and reds, set against a soft, hazy background likely due to the time of day or atmospheric conditions. In the center of the image, a person is actively engaged in working on the top of an orange helicopter, possibly accessing the rotor or performing some sort of inspection or maintenance. The helicopter has a sleek, utilitarian design, characterized by its bulging cockpit and slender body which enhances its aerodynamic profile.\n\nThis person, wearing casual or work attire, is silhouetted against the glaring backdrop of the bright, low-hanging sun, creating a stark contrast between their dark outline and the lighter sky. Another individual, also silhouetted, can be seen standing nearby, observing or waiting.\n\nThe setting appears to be an open area like an airfield or a helipad, indicated by the flat, expansive surface and distant structures that vaguely outline the horizon. This backdrop gives a sense of isolation and focus on the task at hand, emphasizing the solemnity and importance of the work being performed. The overall composition of the image, with its striking color palette and the sun perfectly aligned above the helicopter, adds a dramatic and almost cinematic quality to the routine maintenance activity captured.","title":"The Los Angeles reactive pollutant program (rpp), is a unique multi-agency air pollution research study sponsored by the coordinating research council, a government-industry research group.
