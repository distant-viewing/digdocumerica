{"path":"557069.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features a large, ornate historical residence, displaying features typical of Victorian architecture. The house is prominently painted in red with white trimmings and detailing, which emphasize its architectural features. It showcases a variety of architectural elements such as a turret with a conical roof, a curved bay window, and multiple chimneys.\n\nThe house is designed with multiple steeply pitched roofs, decorative gables, and an arched entrance with a porch supported by classical columns. Large windows are distributed symmetrically across the facade. Several parts of the house, including the turret and the edges of the roof, are accented with contrasting bands of color, enhancing the regal Victorian character of the building.\n\nThe setting around the house includes tall matured trees which partially obscure the view but also complement the grandeur of the home with natural greenery. The sky above is clear and blue, hinting at a serene and peaceful environment. This residential setting appears to be well-maintained, suggesting a combination of historical preservation and pride in property presentation.","title":"Restoration of a late 19th century example of Victorian architecture in Atchison, Kansas.
