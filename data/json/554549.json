{"path":"554549.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a rural or semi-wilderness setting that includes a variety of structures and natural elements, creating a scene that appears to be under development or transformation. \n\nAt the forefront, there is a property with two primary structures captured in the frame: a chalet-style house with a steep, sloped roof, prominent brown and red paint, and large windows, adjacent to what looks like a large, black train car or mobile unit with a flat roof. Decorative elements such as stylized window frames suggest an aesthetic or functional integration between them. The architecture suggests a mixture of residential and unique adaptive use of other structures for living or possibly for a hobby.\n\nIn the background, there are several more mobile homes or trailers; one with a white exterior is visible in the distance, equipped with windows and a secondary structure attached to its side. These are set against a thick backdrop of tall, dense pine trees which dominate the landscape, suggesting a secluded, perhaps private lot geared towards a connection with nature.\n\nThe scene also includes visible signs of construction or landscaping: the ground around the buildings is uneven and patchy, with exposed dirt patches, a scattering of stones and some grassy areas. Several pieces of what might be debris or materials (potentially for ongoing construction or landscaping) are also visible across the area. \n\nMinimal human presence or activity can be observed, emphasizing the tranquility and perhaps transitional state of the space. Overall, the image encapsulates a peaceful, albeit somewhat disorganized, meld of natural and man-made living environments, hinting at personalization and a potentially creative use of space.","title":"Forest trees have been replaced by a Mobile home park near Lake Placid, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["556472","551076","556999","544448","551091","543543","545205","551111","556578","557947","554401","557750","546149","554084","556423","557669"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["landscaping","hobby","meld","window","scattering","stylize","transformation","peaceful","construction","integration"]}
