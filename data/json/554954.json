{"path":"554954.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a dense view of a tree, possibly an oak, shown in close-up detail focusing on its branches. The image is dark and rich in texture with myriad twisting and intertwining limbs and foliage. Most striking is the dappling effect created by light filtering through leaves, which illuminates spots and patches of the scene in a golden hue, contrasted against the mostly shadowy, darker tones. The background is almost indistinguishable, thoroughly blended with the intricate, maze-like pattern of the tree's branches and leaves, emphasizing the depth and complexity of the tree's canopy. The overall atmosphere is somewhat mysterious and autumnal, evoking a sense of nature's dense, raw beauty. There is no human activity or artificial objects visible; the focus is entirely on the natural element.","title":"Trees at sunset near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545072","548709","543488","547634","558103","548687","542958","554961","557622","550792","557621","554976","542723","554985","553576","554979"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["oak","limb","branch","leave","filtering","complexity","spot","canopy","tree","effect"]}
