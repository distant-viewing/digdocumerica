{"path":"545611.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial facility with large cylindrical storage tanks labeled \"Atlas Minerals Division of Atlas Corporation\". The facility is shown in a desert environment, set against a backdrop of towering red rock formations, which suggest a canyon-like terrain possibly indicative of regions such as Utah or Arizona. The storage tanks are metallic and similar in appearance, topped with a flat roof under which is placed prominent signage. Beyond the tanks and the building, several smokes emitted from stacks are visible, rising into the mostly clear sky. The ground in the foreground is sandy, typical of a desert, bordered by a fence running along the perimeter of the facility. The lighting in the photograph suggests either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and enriching the colors of the natural and man-made elements within the frame. The overall composition contrasts the industrial foreground with the natural beauty and grand scale of the rocky background.","title":"Uranium mill just outside of Moab.
