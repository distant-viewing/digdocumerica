{"path":"555195.jpg","date":"February 1965","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph prominently displays two spider webs glistening against a dark background. The webs are intricately woven and are shot from an angle that captures their detailed structure and symmetry against a virtually black backdrop, which enhances the visibility of the fine silk strands.\n\nThe first spider web, positioned on the left of the frame, is mostly intact, showing a complete circular construction with concentric patterns and radial lines that extend out from the center. The second web, to the right, partially overlaps with the first and appears slightly smaller and less complete. Both webs glint as if covered in dew, with small droplets visible along their strands, which catch whatever light is subtly illuminating them.\n\nThere are faint, glistening threads extended outside the main structures of the webs, suggesting the complexity of the construction activity involved. The background behind the webs is uniformly dark, providing stark contrast that highlights every delicate filament of the spider silk.\n\nThe overall composition focuses on symmetry, natural design, and delicate beauty, devoid of any human presence or man-made structures, steering the viewer's full attention to the marvel of nature's craftsmanship seen in these spider webs.","title":"Spiders' webs in a 60-year-old age class timberland in olympic national timberland, Washington.
