{"path":"552539.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a joyful scene at a fountain. There are three children—two more prominently visible with their backs turned and one partially obscured—playing in the water. The children appear to be drenched, suggesting they have been in the water for a while. They are standing in a fountain pool, and you can see water splashing around them, indicating active play.\n\nThe fountain itself is a central feature of the image. Water jets forcefully upwards, creating a high vertical spray that cascades down around the children, adding a dynamic and refreshing element to the scene. Behind the fountain, the background is relatively dark with silhouettes of trees and what might be a distant building, which are not very detailed due to the lighting conditions and focus on the fountain and children.\n\nThe overall ambiance is playful and summery, emphasized by the brightness of the sunlight filtering through the water and reflecting off the pool's surface. The lighting creates a sparkling effect on the water, enhancing the sense of a lively summer day spent enjoying outdoor activities. The photo, rich in emotion and movement, captures a timeless moment of childhood delight and the simple joy of playing in water on a warm day.","title":"Fountain at glen oak park","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552540","551638","552737","553229","553149","551446","551667","551857","551639","550080","552702","550002","551467","552703","553245","557268"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["fountain","child","pool","delight","water","summery","emotion","refresh","cascade","jet"]}
