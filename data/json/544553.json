{"path":"544553.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a dark-colored butterfly feeding on a small white flower. The butterfly, positioned at the right side of the frame, is showcased in sharp detail, displaying its delicate wings which are partially spread. The wings appear velvety, with subtle hints of lighter markings and fringed edges. The butterfly's body and long, curled antennae are also clearly visible, emphasizing its intricate morphology.\n\nThe flower on which the butterfly is perched seems to be a simple wildflower with white petals surrounding a brownish central core, probably containing pollen or nectar. This flower is attached to a slender, green stem that has narrow, elongated leaves branching off. Below this flower, there are a few more buds and another small flower, indicating that the plant might be in full bloom.\n\nThe background of the image is a soft, blurred wash of green hues, suggesting a natural, lush setting but offering no distinct details that could distract from the main subjects—the butterfly and the flower. This use of shallow depth of field highlights the interaction between the butterfly and the flower, directing the viewer’s full attention to this poignant moment in nature. The overall mood of the photo is serene and the setting appears to be tranquil, likely a garden or a wild, grassy area.","title":"Butterfly and wild flowers along TaMiami Canal","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544619","544479","543603","544514","544618","544517","547818","544603","551381","544614","544566","554839","548283","548284","554842","543623"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","flower","wing","antennae","distract","core","curl","bud","feed","wash"]}
