{"path":"543377.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a lone skier traversing across what appears to be a snow-covered landscape. The skier, a man, is dressed in a navy blue jacket paired with blue and white athletic pants, and he's wearing dark gloves and sunglasses. He's equipped with ski poles and is in the midst of propelling himself forward on his skis.\n\nThe setting is a vast, open area covered mostly in white snow, under a bright blue sky. In the distance, sparse vegetation and some distant structures can be faintly seen. These elements suggest a cold, possibly remote environment typically found in winter sport regions. The snow's surface looks slightly melted, indicating either recent warm weather or a midday sun strong enough to impact the snow's texture. The overall scene conveys a sense of quiet solitude, emphasizing the skierâ€™s solo journey across this winter landscape.","title":"Packing expedition of Explorer Post 397 of Los Angeles area.
