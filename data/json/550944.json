{"path":"550944.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph depicts a bustling industrial port scene with a focus on a large cargo ship entering or navigating through the port. The ship, prominently bearing the name \"Kaytrader\" and flagged under \"Kingston,\" has a distinctive yellow and black funnel which stands out against its predominantly gray hull. It is a freight ship, evident from its solid structure designed for carrying heavy loads, and is currently displaying a moderate amount of activity on deck. There is visible smoke emitting from the shipâ€™s funnel, indicating that the ship is actively maneuvering or powering up.\n\nIn the background, several other maritime vessels can be seen. These include both similar cargo ships and possibly smaller service boats or tugs, hinting at a busy port environment. There is a variety of shipping-related infrastructure visible, such as cranes, possibly warehouses, and other facilities pertinent to maritime logistics.\n\nThe setting includes clear skies with very little clouds, suggesting fair weather conditions, which is typical for a daytime setting in a marine industrial area. The photograph captures a typical day at a working port with ships in transit, highlighting the industrial and functional aspect of maritime transport and logistics.","title":"Freighter \"key trader\" out of wilmington, Delaware, in dock on the Houston ship channel","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["546828","555260","548127","555270","551582","552200","547998","550906","547619","552303","553739","551577","552008","545845","551558","548126"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ship","port","funnel","logistic","cargo","freight","shipping","maneuver","enter","emitte"]}
