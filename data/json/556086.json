{"path":"556086.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures two men inside the cab of a locomotive. The setting seems to be during a daytime journey, viewed from a vantage point at the rear of the cab, looking forward toward the cockpit-like dashboard.\n\nOn the left, there is a man who appears to be the operator or engineer, sitting in a driver's seat. He is wearing a dark cap and a dark work jacket. His left hand is holding a control lever, and his relaxed posture suggests he might be in a monitoring phase of the journey rather than actively maneuvering the train.\n\nOn the right, another man who could be a co-worker or another train engineer is facing forward. He has the back of his head toward the camera, showing that he is wearing a white cap. His attire includes a dark jacket, similar to his counterpart. This man seems focused on the panel in front of him or possibly on the view outside, perhaps observing the tracks or the landscape.\n\nBetween and in front of them is a complex array of equipment and controls, featuring levers, dials, and digital displays necessary for operating the train. Prominently placed in the scene is a small table or cabinet in the center, supporting what looks like a pitcher or a jar, possibly for drinking water.\n\nThe interior of the cab is utilitarian with metal walls and has a small mirror and a window that allow the men to have a view outside, indicating speed or assessing station proximity. The scene outside the window appears blurry, suggesting motion, with hints of greenery likely indicating rural or non-urban surroundings.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a moment of everyday professional activity inside a locomotive, highlighting the roles and environment of train operators. The composition focuses on the interaction between the men and their control equipment, framed within the tight space of the locomotive's cab.","title":"Fireman, left, and engineer in the cab of the Empire Builder passenger train as it heads west from Chicago to East Glacier Park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington.
