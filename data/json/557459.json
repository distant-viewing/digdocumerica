{"path":"557459.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases a serene and picturesque coastal dune landscape against a seascape backdrop. The scene captures a wide, open dune area predominantly covered in sand. A sinuous path is carved through the dunes, likely formed by frequent foot traffic, along which several people can be seen walking. The people appear to be in casual, warm-weather clothing suitable for a beach outing, with some of them heading towards the dunes and others walking back.\n\nTo the right of the dune path, a piece of wood, possibly a discarded plank or driftwood, is half-buried in the sand, adding a natural element to the scene. The foreground of the image is dominated by the sandy terrain, showing textures that indicate the shifting and settling of the sand driven by wind.\n\nIn the background, the sparkling ocean shimmers under the sunlight. The horizon is clear, demarcating the line where the sea meets the sky. The composition's depth is enhanced by the vastness of the sea and its gradual merging with the sky, offering a sense of openness and tranquility. To the rear left, the landscape softly transitions into a greener, more vegetated area, suggesting the proximity of a more stable land structure or coastal vegetation, blending the sandy terrain with lush greeneries.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a calm, relaxing vibe typical of a seaside landscape, capturing the essence of a sunny day at the beach, where people enjoy leisurely walks amidst natural beauty.","title":"Access to Niguel Beach Park along the coast in Orange County, is through an area that was scheduled for development however, the plans were halted when the state passed the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November, 1972. State and regional regulatory commissions must present a final report to the legislature by January, 1976, recommending passage of laws affecting future coastal development. Some 84 percent of the state residents live within 30 miles of the coast.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["543193","547607","547015","547697","545280","548220","547620","543303","555400","548221","545199","545200","547592","546953","543255","543192"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["dune","sand","walk","beach","path","bury","demarcate","sea","driftwood","seascape"]}
