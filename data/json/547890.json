{"path":"547890.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial waterway scene with a gritty, somewhat neglected ambiance. The foreground prominently features rough, uneven terrain composed of broken black asphalt and scattered debris, leading up to the edge of a calm water body. Sparse vegetation interrupts the rocky surface, adding a touch of natural elements to the otherwise stark environment.\n\nThe water reflects the cloudy sky above, creating a mirror-like surface that doubles the image of everything around it. Toward the middle of the image, a bridge spans across the water, featuring a construction with a flat roof and what appears to be a control room or booth at its center, suggesting it might be a drawbridge. Beyond the bridge, multiple industrial or older urban buildings line the far bank, complementing the industrial theme.\n\nThere appear to be no people visible in the scene, enhancing the sense of quiet and abandonment. Additionally, vertical poles, possibly utility poles or parts of a railing, are partially seen on the water's edge, suggesting some boundary or demarcation.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a scene typical of older, industrial parts of cities where waterways serve more functional than aesthetic roles, reflecting a blend of human activity and natural resilience in a setting marked by wear and disuse.","title":"Oil-drenched creek in the Gravesend Bay area of Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553393","558003","547622","553428","547582","550214","550189","551984","546112","549303","547581","550204","546887","553462","546903","552441"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waterway","double","bridge","demarcation","pole","interrupt","booth","disuse","asphalt","water"]}
