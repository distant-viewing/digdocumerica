{"path":"545815.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a tall, rustic metal structure, likely an old oil derrick, set against a vast desert landscape. The derrick is centered in the frame and constructed of metal beams that form a triangular shape, supporting a pulley system at the apex, which seems to be inactive.\n\nThe foreground shows a barren terrain with sparse vegetation, small bushes, and dry dirt, indicative of a desert environment. A narrow, unpaved road runs parallel to the derrick and stretches across the lower part of the image.\n\nIn the background, large, rugged mountains dominate the scene. These mountains have a textured appearance with numerous gullies and ridges, suggesting erosion from weather elements. The mountains are in varying shades of gray and beige, reflecting the barren, arid setting of the photograph.\n\nThe lighting in the image indicates a time of day when the sun is high, resulting in deep shadows cast by the derrick and a bright, clear sky. The overall color palette is composed of earth tones ranging from dusty browns to muted grays, contributing to the stark and desolate mood of the photograph.","title":"Abandoned mercury mine tower","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["545827","546245","544102","544405","555634","544374","545826","555397","545809","545341","543848","545789","544740","552990","545677","544401"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["mountain","desert","apex","gully","pulley","result","oil","metal","ridge","erosion"]}
