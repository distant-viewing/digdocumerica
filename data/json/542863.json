{"path":"542863.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a stark and somber landscape, characterized by environmental distress. The foreground features a large expanse of dry, cracked earth, indicating severe dehydration and possibly the effects of environmental degradation. The brown, arid ground is textured with deep cracks that form an intricate network across the surface.\n\nIn the middle ground, a sole figure stands near several large, fallen tree logs, providing a scale for the desolation surrounding them. This human presence underlines the scale of the devastation, as the person appears small against the expansive backdrop of stripped terrain.\n\nThe background shows a hillside heavily stripped of vegetation, speckled with remaining tall, thin trees that seem to struggle in the harsh environment. The landscape is predominantly brown and devoid of lush greenery, suggesting a scene of deforestation or a natural disaster aftermath.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its vivid colors and dramatic natural features, powerfully conveys themes of environmental impact and human interaction with nature. The scene is both visually striking and emotionally evocative, reflecting a poignant moment of confrontation with significant ecological alteration.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["544184","544751","545264","547661","552420","542819","544180","546056","555150","555104","549119","545258","555136","546121","555598","545534"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["crack","strip","distress","struggle","deforestation","devastation","alteration","scale","disaster","speckle"]}
