{"path":"556447.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph depicts an industrial or construction scene, characterized by a gritty and rugged environment. The main subject is a man squatting on the ground under what appears to be a large, dark structure that nearly fills the top half of the frame, perhaps a part of machinery or an overhang. The man, likely a worker, is wearing a hardhat with a light attached, suggesting that he might be in a mining or construction field. He is dressed in a thick, dark coat, suitable for rough outdoor work.\n\nIn the background, slightly blurred, a large yellow construction vehicle occupies the middle ground, with a pile of dirt or rubble nearby, indicating ongoing excavation or construction. The backdrop shows a wooded area, partially obscured by the equipment and activity in the foreground, suggesting that this site is located in a less urbanized area or near the outskirts of a forested region.\n\nThe ground is muddy and covered in scattered debris, which contributes to the overall sense of an active, possibly unrefined work site. The lighting in the photo casts visible shadows and highlights, emphasizing the raw, outdoor conditions of the work environment.\n\nThe composition of the image uses the industrial machinery and the structure above to frame the worker, drawing attention to his actions or possible pause in a moment of contemplation or inspection of the area. The mix of natural and man-made elements evokes a narrative of industry juxtaposed against nature.","title":"Doren Bishop, superintendent for Robin Mines owned by the Alma Coal Corporation near Clothier and Madison, West Virginia, kneels inside the opening which recently had been made. No machinery has yet been placed in the mine for digging coal. It is called a punch mine because it has been \"punched\" or cut into the face of the hill.","placename":"West Virginia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544171","556391","556513","553618","556893","542497","556320","550251","556329","556866","543648","556903","556322","547163","557735","556357"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["construction","work","worker","machinery","site","pause","overhang","rubble","inspection","ground"]}
