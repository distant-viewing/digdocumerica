{"path":"550080.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene and intimate moment featuring a family of three standing next to a large, spraying fountain. The fountain is the predominant feature in the background, with multiple water jets creating a dynamic and soaring splash that catches the light and creates a misty atmosphere around it.\n\nThe family, consisting of two adults and a child, are standing close together by the edge of the fountain's round concrete basin. One adult, possibly the father, is on the left, dressed in a striped short-sleeved shirt and blue shorts. The other adult, likely the mother, stands next to him, wearing a backless halter-neck top and white pants, with her hair pulled up. The child, whose gender is indistinct from the image, stands between them, facing the fountain and appears to be quite absorbed by the water display.\n\nThe setting appears to be a public park or similar outdoor area, emphasized by the spacious, open paved area around the fountain and the presence of green trees in the distant background partially obscured by the fountain's spray. The image conveys a sense of casual, leisurely family activity, enjoying a summer day outdoors by an impressive water feature. The overall mood is tranquil and contemplative, with the family enjoying a quiet moment together in a scenic location.","title":"Hanna fountains on the mall, Cleveland's civic center","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551467","552737","549985","552539","553219","550072","553149","549984","553229","551446","549982","552702","551667","551638","557268","551449"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["fountain","family","adult","halter","father","mother","gender","child","basin","jet"]}
