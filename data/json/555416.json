{"path":"555416.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a sign displayed prominently against a background that suggests it is placed inside a building, perhaps near a window or glass door. The sign is a simple cardboard piece with a handwritten message that reads, \"Sorry... NO GAS TODAY.\" The lettering is bold and black against the cardboard's brown background, with the word \"SORRY\" appearing slightly above and smaller than the \"NO GAS TODAY\" text, which is much larger and more emphasized.\n\nThe edges of the sign show slight wear and folding, implying it may have been handled or moved around a bit. In the background, one can see what looks like a partial view of a window frame, painted green, and hints of a white, curtained window on the side. These suggest an indoor location, possibly a gas station or a small business that offers gasoline among other goods. The atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of a temporary and direct information conveyance, indicative of an impromptu or emergency response, likely due to a shortage or unavailability of gasoline.","title":"\"No gas\" signs were a common sight in Oregon during the fall of 1973, such as at this station in Lincoln City along the coast. Many stations closed earlier, opened later and shut down on the weekends.","placename":"Lincoln City (Or.)","location":"Lincoln City, Oregon","nn1":["555413","548176","548177","555414","548171","548169","548168","548175","555519","555412","555464","555411","548173","555434","548174","548047"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["gas","gasoline","cardboard","shortage","window","response","sign","emergency","information","lettering"]}
