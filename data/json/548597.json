{"path":"548597.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a large wildfire consuming a forested landscape. Thick clouds of white and gray smoke are rising vigorously from the treeline and spread across the entire frame, obscuring the view of the sky above. The fire appears to be intense, with dense smoke indicating a substantial and possibly fast-spreading blaze.\n\nThe foreground shows a relatively unobscured view of green trees, which contrast starkly with the devastated area engulfed in smoke. The trees in the foreground are likely at the edge of the fire's path. The whole scene is captured during daylight, but the smoke gives the surrounding atmosphere a dark, ominous feel. The composition of the photograph, with smoke dominating the upper portion and the greenery at the bottom, starkly illustrates the destructive interface between the natural landscape and the wildfire. There are no visible human activities or structures, emphasizing the natural and potentially remote setting of the event.","title":"Forest fire in the everglades, collier county.
