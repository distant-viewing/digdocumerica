{"path":"558091.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a group of five Canada geese swimming in a body of water. The geese are easily recognizable with their distinct black heads and necks, white chinstraps, light tan to cream chests, and brownish bodies with darker, rippled feather patterns. They are aligned in a loose, staggered formation facing towards the right side of the frame, which gives a sense of movement across the water.\n\nThe water appears calm, with slight ripples around the geese, reflecting subtle shades of blue and gray that suggest it might be either early morning or late afternoon. The background is out of focus, emphasizing the geese in the foreground and contributing to the serene, tranquil mood of the scene. The lighting is soft, which helps in creating a gentle and somewhat muted-tone image, focusing attention on the elegant forms and calm demeanor of the geese.","title":"Canada geese stopped for a brief rest at this lake in the Virginia Kendall Park which is a part of the Akron, Ohio Metropolitan Park System. After 30 minutes they continued on their way. This park is within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area which includes 30,000 acres of largely undeveloped land situated in a 20-mile stretch between the metropolitan districts of Akron and Cleveland. Land acquisition awaits Congressional appropriations.","placename":"Akron (Ohio)","location":"Akron, Ohio","nn1":["557122","553346","546086","557126","557120","557203","551149","552221","557121","543663","556987","552993","546081","543918","555551","547783"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["feather","chest","cream","neck","demeanor","ripple","head","water","body","formation"]}
