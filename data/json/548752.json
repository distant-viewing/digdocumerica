{"path":"548752.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an intriguing scene by the water's edge where nature, an abandoned automobile, and a human figure interact. Central to the image is a dilapidated, vintage station wagon, heavily worn and possibly vandalized. The car's windows are missing, and its body is covered in scratches, faded paint, and spots of rust, giving it an abandoned and forlorn appearance. The car is parked under the dappled shade of verdant trees, which are distributed throughout the scene, enhancing the sense of a secluded spot.\n\nOn the right side of the image, beyond the car, there is a person engaged in a playful activity by the shoreline. The person, appearing to be male, seems to be either throwing something into the water or skimming stones. This individual is dressed casually in a brightly colored, possibly red or pink shirt and beige shorts, suggesting a leisurely day out.\n\nThe background is made up predominantly of the calm blue sea, bordered by a sandy beach dotted with small trees and bushes. The foliage and colors signify a coastal environment, possibly in a temperate climate given the type of flora visible.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a nostalgic or melancholic feel, juxtaposing the lively activity of the person with the quiet stillness of an aging, forgotten vehicle in a serene natural setting. The image tells a story of past and present, activity and abandonment, set against the tranquil backdrop of nature.","title":"Big touring car abandoned at little duck key, a small undeveloped and uninhabited island in the lower Florida keys usually used for fishing and camping","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["547481","547605","550797","546318","552995","547911","547601","547484","553007","545849","547835","546405","553008","549107","545540","547883"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["spot","person","dappled","abandoned","car","missing","scratch","tell","throw","distribute"]}
