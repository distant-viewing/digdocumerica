{"path":"548088.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene beach scene. The main focus is on the dark sandy shore, which has a distinctive pattern of scattered white foam. The foam creates sinuous and irregular lines across the beach, visually leading from the lower foreground into the upper part of the image. \n\nIn the background, near the water's edge where the sand meets the gentle surf, two people can be seen walking. They appear as small, distant figures against the vast expanse of the beach. The ocean itself is not prominently visible, but hints of waves and the horizon suggest its presence beyond the upper frame of the photograph.\n\nThe lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, with the angle of the light casting subtle shadows and enriching the texture of the sand and foam. The overall mood of the image is calm, evoking a sense of solitude and peacefulness typical of a beach setting away from crowds.","title":"North jetty, at the mouth of the Columbia River on the ilwaco, Washington side","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["547600","554159","546982","547607","548290","557509","547612","543078","555402","543493","543252","543055","548221","543287","546953","542890"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["foam","beach","sand","surf","wafe","peacefulness","sandy","enrich","walking","crowd"]}
