{"path":"549507.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial site located near a body of water. Dominating the foreground is a complex array of industrial equipment and structures. Prominently featured is a tall chimney emitting a thick plume of white smoke that billows into the clear blue sky.\n\nThe installation includes several large storage tanks; one of them is spherical while others are cylindrical. Connected to these tanks are a series of metal pipes and structures that appear to facilitate the transportation and processing of substances. The ground around the tanks and machinery is mostly barren, with patches of gray and beige, likely concrete or gravel, covering it.\n\nTo the right of the image, close to the edge of the water, there are scattered smaller tanks and what looks like debris or discarded materials. This area gives an impression of being less maintained compared to the central facilities.\n\nThe water body abuts the facility, its dark blue surface forming a contrast with the industrial structures. Along the shoreline, there are sporadic splashes of waves against the shore, hinting at natural activity in contrast to the industrial setting. \n\nOverall, the photograph captures the stark juxtaposition of heavy industry with the natural environment, highlighting both the industrial activities and their proximity to the natural water body.","title":"Smokestacks of the Bethlehem Steel plant on the shore of Lake Erie just below Buffalo","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["551183","543000","544495","550339","551009","546005","546087","548195","551576","545837","551994","545833","545236","550694","551998","550761"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["tank","facility","body","installation","substance","water","splash","gravel","concrete","proximity"]}
