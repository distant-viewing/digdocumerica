{"path":"548379.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of an industrial area featuring a large facility with prominent features. In the center of the image, there are three tall, cylindrical towers or chimneys, with the central one emitting a substantial amount of white smoke or steam. Adjacent to these towers are several industrial buildings, varying in size and shape, suggesting a complex likely used for manufacturing or power generation.\n\nSituated along a waterfront, the facility is bordered by a body of water on one side, with a quay that includes docked shipping containers and cranes, indicating the transport of goods could be a part of the operation. The surroundings of the site are densely packed with other industrial and commercial buildings, creating a congested urban industrial landscape.\n\nThe overall amenity appears to be operationally active, as evidenced by the smoke and the presence of infrastructure for logistics and manufacturing. The setting and condition hint at a time period when heavy industrial activity was a norm in such environments, possibly indicating the photograph was taken in the mid to late 20th century.\n\nThe color tone is slightly faded, consistent with older film photography, contributing to the historical feel of the image. The area is devoid of visible natural vegetation, emphasizing the industrial character of the region.","title":"Consolidated Edison plant in Queens","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548340","545236","555770","550868","546862","551566","548376","551183","552187","546769","550956","546908","552181","555769","555776","544495"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["manufacturing","tower","smoke","amenity","generation","logistic","facility","shipping","photography","film"]}
