{"path":"554621.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a tan-colored deer in a natural outdoor setting. The deer is positioned in profile but turned slightly toward the camera, allowing a clear view of its face and body. Its ears are upright and alert, and its eyes appear watchful. A notable feature of the deer is its smooth and shiny coat with some darker shade near the edges of its ears and around its eyes.\n\nThe background shows a grassy area that transitions into denser greenery consisting of trees and bushes, suggesting a forest or park-like environment. The lighting in the photo suggests it could be either late morning or early afternoon, providing a soft and even illumination over the scene.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is serene, accentuated by the natural environment and the deer's calm demeanor. The composition effectively focuses on the deer, using a shallow depth of field to subtly blur the background, ensuring that the attention remains on the animal.","title":"White-tailed doe in the Adirondack Forest Preserve atop McCauley Mountain near Old Forge","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544916","546163","545902","552339","543279","558368","542778","545898","546159","543369","544114","550803","544571","546088","544623","543839"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["deer","ear","eye","illumination","profile","outdoor","demeanor","transition","coat","animal"]}
