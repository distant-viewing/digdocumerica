{"path":"546566.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene, likely set in a park during the spring or summer due to the bright, sunlit environment and the presence of blooming dandelions on the grassy field. The composition is divided by a dark, vertical tree trunk on the right side, which adds depth and contrast to the image.\n\nIn the foreground, a person with long hair is seated on the grass, leaning forward slightly while engaged in reading or writing in a book placed on their lap. They are dressed casually in a long sleeve jacket and jeans, suggesting a comfortable, relaxed day out in the park.\n\nThe background is open and expansive, mainly consisting of a well-maintained, green lawn sprinkled with small white flowers. The lighting suggests it is midday or early afternoon, given the vividness of the green grass and the long, soft shadows cast by the trees.\n\nOverall, the photograph evokes a peaceful, tranquil mood, with a focus on leisurely activities in a natural setting. It's a snapshot of a moment where one can immerse themselves in solitude and the beauty of nature.","title":"Columbus East Senior High School","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546555","543835","551682","552723","551970","557146","554424","551942","552033","554099","553065","553156","549911","552688","556990","543452"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["dandelion","sprinkle","immerse","reading","write","midday","grass","lap","vividness","book"]}
