{"path":"547558.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene ocean scene during a dimly lit time, possibly during sunrise or sunset. In the foreground, a single fisherman in a traditional rowboat maneuvers his craft. The boat is an old, distressed wooden rowboat painted red at the waterline, indicating a long usage and exposure to elements. The fisherman is leaning forward actively rowing with a single oar, suggesting he is stabilizing or steering the boat. \n\nHe is dressed in heavy, layered, possibly waterproof clothing that includes a hat, demonstrating preparation for maritime activity and protection against elements. The sea around him is relatively calm with some small waves, and the photograph captures the ripple and splash around the oar as it dips into the water.\n\nIn the background, the ocean extends to the horizon, sprinkled with several spherical buoys, likely indicating a fishing area or an aquatic farm of sorts. The distant shore is barely visible adding a sense of isolation and vastness of the setting. The overall atmosphere evoked by the lighting and the solitary figure in the vast ocean conveys a sense of tranquility and the enduring relationship between humans and the sea.","title":"Trap nets are set in april and may at the mouth of the sakonnet river.
