{"path":"547717.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a breathtaking aerial view of a vast desert landscape during, what appears to be, either sunrise or sunset. The lighting casts long shadows and creates a dramatic, moody atmosphere. The scene is dominated by numerous sand dunes, which exhibit smooth and flowing contours that suggest a gentle texture. These dunes form a complex pattern of ridges and valleys, characteristic of wind-shaped desert sands.\n\nThe color palette of the image is warm and earthy, consisting predominantly of dark browns and shadows contrasted with the lighter tones of the sand highlights. These colors hint at the low angle of the sun, emphasizing the three-dimensionality of the dunes through stark lighting contrasts.\n\nIn the distance, a mountain range can be seen lining the horizon, adding a sense of scale and depth to the image. The sky above the mountains is clear, suggesting tranquil weather conditions at the time the photo was taken.\n\nNo human activity or presence is visible, highlighting the natural and untouched state of the landscape. The photo captures the solitude and vastness of the desert, evoking a sense of calm and awe for the viewer. The composition effectively conveys the rugged beauty and the immense scale of the desert environment.","title":"A hundred-mile ribbon of sand dunes separates the Chocolate Mountains of Southern California from the Imperial Valley, which stretches from the Salton Sea into Mexico.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["552923","545199","550490","545771","544027","543097","545203","552897","548906","549037","545789","545790","553058","545748","545843","548897"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["dune","desert","sand","scale","mountain","sunrise","highlight","ridge","calm","contour"]}
