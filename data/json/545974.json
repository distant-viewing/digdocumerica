{"path":"545974.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an older man seated at a kitchen table. His posture is relaxed, leaning slightly forward with his right elbow resting on the table, and his chin propped against his hand. His expression is serious and contemplative, staring directly at the camera.\n\nHe is wearing a dark, long-sleeve pullover, and there's a cigarette between the fingers of his right hand. There's a tall, red and white beverage can also on the table beside him. His notable features include his rugged, lined face and combed-back, dark hair with touches of gray hinting at his age.\n\nThe setting appears to be a cozy, lived-in kitchen with walls painted in a warm, mustard color. The room is adorned with small, personal items and photographs pinned to the wall trimming and on top of a cupboard in the background, adding a personal touch to the environment. The window, dressed with curtains, filters natural light into the room, contributing to the homely atmosphere.\n\nThe decor and the objects in the setting suggest a familiar, everyday scene, perhaps in a middle-class household. This snapshot seems to convey a moment of introspection or casual relaxation, emphasizing a personal and intimate glimpse into the manâ€™s life.","title":"Mr. Tillman Matherne, a lifelong resident of Bayou Gauche who supports his 9 children by fishing","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["555532","545986","544202","544232","552104","545970","553517","543713","555297","548458","552105","556457","546636","557648","556563","555529"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["kitchen","table","room","stare","trimming","comb","mustard","elbow","touch","chin"]}
