{"path":"543413.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph depicts the exterior of a quaint building adorned with various decorative elements reflecting a rustic, maritime theme. The facade is painted white with a large black trim around a singular entrance door, flanked by windows with horizontal black shutters.\n\nAbove the door, adding to the uniqueness, a large propeller and a sculptural display of a marlin fish sporting a mermaid figure clinging onto it inject a nautical and somewhat fantastical element into the scene. The mermaid, with long flowy hair and a visible tail, balances the theme between reality and fantasy. To the left of the door, a whimsical cutout of a white fish with black detailing is mounted on the wall, enhancing the maritime décor.\n\nAdjacent to the building, decorative old-fashioned wagon wheels are repurposed as a rustic aesthetic touch. They are cleverly positioned beside the windows, contributing to a symmetrical visual anchor. Between these wheels and near the doorway, various plants and flowers are displayed in charming arrangements using an old carriage as a planter and wooden barrels, alluding to a warm, welcoming, and cared-for environment.\n\nA chair next to the doorway suggests a place for relaxation or a vantage point from which one might enjoy this curiously decorated frontage. Overall, the scene is a blend of maritime elements with a sprinkle of imaginary themes, presented in a cozy and inviting manner typical of a seaside cottage or a themed resort.","title":"Relics on early America enhance this California doorway.","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["548661","547808","546444","547881","545221","557649","544445","552489","548242","546433","545067","544911","558029","545334","548658","554457"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["door","doorway","fish","wheel","theme","décor","anchor","propeller","planter","carriage"]}
