{"path":"555225.jpg","date":"February 1971","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph captures an up-close view of a striking natural mineral formation that resembles a fluffy, cotton-like texture. The image is rich in detail, showcasing an array of crystal structures that vary in density and opacity. The colors predominantly range from soft white to various shades of pink and beige, contributing to a delicate and airy visual impression.\n\nThe composition is densely packed, with the crystal formations tightly clustered together, filling the frame without any distinguishable background elements. The formations appear soft and jagged at the same time, with spiky edges that emerge from the more rounded, cloud-like masses.\n\nThis image likely depicts a form of fibrous gypsum or another mineral growth that forms under specific geological conditions, characterized by its fibrous and voluminous appearance. The lighting is diffuse, highlighting the intricate textures and enhancing the three-dimensional feel of the mineral structures. There is no sign of human activity or manipulation, suggesting that this is a natural geological phenomenon captured in its untouched environmental context.","title":"The mouth of the Raft River in Washington State, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550606","557609","551358","555170","552920","557582","546165","553770","544907","550740","552239","553582","543149","557626","543756","550476"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mineral","crystal","formation","phenomenon","masse","pink","density","white","texture","growth"]}
