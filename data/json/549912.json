{"path":"549912.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of urban construction dominated by a large number of iron rods and beams, possibly for a foundation or framework, laid out on the ground in a systematic, organized manner. Most of these materials are grouped in bundles and spread across the picture in a foreground filled with construction infrastructure.\n\nIn the background, there's a significant and prominently classic style building which features multiple stories and an array of windows across its façade. This building represents typical early 20th-century architecture with its detailed stonework and decorative elements at the roofline, visible in various tiers leading up to a dark, flat roof.\n\nTo the right side of the image, a construction crane and other machinery are partly visible, indicating ongoing heavy construction activities. Trees can be seen on the left side of the frame, adding a touch of greenery and life to the urban environment.\n\nThe atmosphere suggests a busy, possibly noisy construction site in a bustling city area, combining elements of nature, urban life, and development. The clear sky and the lighting suggest that the photo was taken during a sunny day, enhancing the sharpness and colors of the scene.","title":"Construction on east side of Battery Park, lower Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["544167","549913","547235","548551","553391","547829","556940","547977","549664","549640","546422","555746","546252","548431","547833","546029"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","bundle","stonework","tier","sharpness","foundation","roofline","iron","façade","rod"]}
