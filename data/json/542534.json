{"path":"542534.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor agricultural scene. In the image, a man is operating a red tractor equipped with a large umbrella that provides shade over the driver's area. The man, wearing a straw hat and a long-sleeved shirt, appears to be working in a field of grapevines as he handles and guides the machinery through the vines.\n\nThe backdrop shows a sunny and clear day, with a few trees and a utility pole visible in the background, suggesting that the location might be a rural farmland. The overwhelming presence of vibrant green grapevines fills the frame, indicating that the picture might have been taken during a peak growth period in the vineyard.\n\nThe overall composition focuses closely on farming activities and the utilization of machinery in vineyard management. The umbrella mounted on the tractor is quite distinctive, adding an interesting element to the picture that highlights the importance of protection from the sun while working in such environments.","title":"Bob Martinez spraying grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542654","543667","544888","557521","557697","554204","553665","542533","557753","552577","545893","548950","555619","555878","549258","547436"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tractor","umbrella","picture","vine","machinery","farmland","protection","straw","importance","driver"]}
