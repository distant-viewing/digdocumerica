{"path":"545518.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts a row of old, weathered wooden cabins with a rustic appearance. Each cabin has a front porch. The exterior of the cabins shows signs of aging and wear, with faded and peeling paint on the walls and damaged wooden components. On the porches, there are various chairs, including rocking chairs, which contribute to a homely, albeit neglected, ambiance.\n\nOne of the cabins features a torn curtain hanging loosely in the doorway, swaying slightly as if caught in a gentle breeze. The roof of these cabins is shingled and appears to be in a dilapidated state with visible signs of rust and wear on the metal parts. The environment surrounding the cabins suggests a rural or semi-forested area, as trees and greenery can be seen in the background, enhancing the secluded and rustic feel of the setting.\n\nMoreover, the porch of the first cabin has a small collection of plant pots near the steps, hinting at attempts to add a touch of care and decoration to the space. Each porch is raised slightly off the ground and accessible by a few steps, indicating the cabins are designed to handle potential issues like moisture or flooding.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of past domestic activity now quieted, evoking a sense of nostalgia and solitude.","title":"In many areas of the city blacks still live in substandard housing.
