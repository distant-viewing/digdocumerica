{"path":"552749.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on an urban street, portraying a row of red brick row houses. The buildings have a somewhat neglected appearance with boarded and graffitied doors, and windows varying in conditionâ€”some intact while others are boarded or marked over. The graffiti includes various names and phrases in white chalk or paint, adding a layer of urban textual intrigue to the scene.\n\nIn front of the buildings, the sidewalk is mostly empty except for scattered bits of debris and a few items next to the curb. A lone individual, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, is seated on the steps of one of the houses, deeply engaged in reading a newspaper. The person's relaxed posture and focus on the paper contrast with the dilapidated and graffiti-marked surroundings.\n\nThe overall ambience of the photograph suggests a quiet moment in a city environment marked by signs of disrepair and abandonment, yet life persists in quiet corners as evidenced by the person reading. The street is devoid of visible vegetation or trees, emphasizing the stark urban setting, and the overcast sky contributes to the somber mood of the setting.","title":"Two men sit silently on stoops of abandoned north Philadelphia houses","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552751","545510","555897","553552","550253","552762","556164","557286","553506","555952","557345","549785","550257","552965","555902","552756"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["mark","boarde","bits","phrase","row","intact","house","graffito","ambience","newspaper"]}
