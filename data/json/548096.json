{"path":"548096.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene river landscape under a clear, blue sky. The river is winding through a stony, pebbly bed, subtly reflecting the sky above. It travels from the foreground toward the background, creating an S-shape curve through the terrain. Surrounding the river are banks covered with various sizes of rocks and scattered vegetation, indicating a relatively arid or semi-arid environment.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a steep hill rises prominently, dotted with dense greenery and trees, and sporadically placed houses near the top, suggesting a residential area that overlooks this river. The houses differ in architectural styles and are partially obscured by the abundant foliage.\n\nTo the right of the river, the land flattens somewhat, and further in the background, there is a bridge spanning the width of the river. This bridge appears to be an arched structure, possibly made of stone or concrete, facilitating road traffic over the river. Beyond the bridge, there are visible industrial or agricultural structures, with large, flat buildings and what looks to be some sort of storage tanks or silos, suggesting this area might be used for industrial purposes or large-scale farming.\n\nThe landscape around the river and beyond is a mix of undulating hills and mountains, which further extend into the backdrop, underlining a rural or semi-rural setting. The overall composition of the photograph highlights a tranquil yet inhabited landscape, where human infrastructure and natural environment coexist.\n","title":"The Hood River near its exit into the Columbia River","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["548097","555575","557485","542555","548098","542653","552107","548868","558042","543793","550656","557106","549456","549457","548010","542558"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","bridge","house","width","hill","sort","silo","bed","concrete","farming"]}
