{"path":"550468.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a ground squirrel standing upright in a natural setting. The squirrel is centrally positioned and is the clear focal point of the image. It appears alert and is looking directly towards the camera with a slightly curious or cautious expression. The squirrel's fur is a rich brown color, with lighter shades around its face and underbelly, and darker striping is visible along its back.\n\nThe background consists of dense greenery, suggesting that the picture was taken in a lush, verdant environment typical of a grassland or a lightly wooded area. The plants around the squirrel are varied in size and type, hinting at a rich biodiversity in the setting. The lighting of the photograph is soft, possibly indicating that it was taken during the early morning or late afternoon, which helps accentuate the squirrel's features and the surrounding foliage with a gentle glow.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the presence of the squirrel within its natural habitat, portraying a moment of stillness that captures the essence of the animal's interaction with its environment. The depth of field is shallow, keeping the focus tight on the squirrel while softly blurring the background, enhancing the viewer's attention on the subject.","title":"A parka squirrel, or \"siksikpuk,\" the eskimos make their warmest winter parkas from the pelts of the parka squirrel","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["543265","550472","555668","550469","554597","542629","545556","545564","545560","550470","557615","554599","544916","542630","551376","554621"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["biodiversity","grassland","fur","keep","stillness","woode","habitat","help","essence","animal"]}
