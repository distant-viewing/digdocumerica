{"path":"555531.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Cooper, Jane","caption":"In this photograph, a middle-aged man is intimately engaging with a young goat, both forming the central subjects of the image. The man, appearing affectionate and gentle, is holding and embracing the goat, his face partially obscured as the goatâ€™s head is pressed against his side. The goat, with medium-sized horns and a notable expression of calm, seems to be comfortably nestled against the man.\n\nThe man is dressed casually in an outdoors style, wearing a plaid, flannel shirt and a cap with a logo that indicates some form of outdoor or wildlife affiliation. A pipe is placed in his mouth, adding to the rustic, pastoral feel of the scene. The background is softly blurred, showing a natural, lush environment with trees and hints of a residential or farm structure in the farther distance.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo suggests a moment of close connection between human and animal, possibly on a farm or rural setting. The bonding scene captures a tender human-animal interaction that indicates care and familiarity. The image exudes a sense of peace and simplicity, reflecting a lifestyle closely tied to nature and animal companionship.","title":"This native of Randolph Center, Vermont, quit a job as an auto mechanic to return to the family farm in hopes of keeping it running.
