{"path":"546826.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph appears to depict a scene from an industrial or construction environment, likely inside a large tunnel or underground setting given the curved, dark backdrop. Multiple workers are visible; three of them are actively engaged in moving a large, heavy wooden crate or panel across the floor. They are pushing the structure which is mounted on what look like rollers or small wheels to aid in movement.\n\nAll three men are wearing helmets indicating safety protocols are in place, with one of the helmets visibly labeled \"VIR‚Äù suggesting a possible company or team name. Their attire consists of casual work clothing such as jeans and long-sleeve shirts.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the image, there is another group of men who are observers or supervisors. They are standing and watching the work being done, contributing to an organized operation, possibly discussing the proceedings or waiting their turn to assist.\n\nThe environment is dimly lit, with artificial lighting highlighting parts of the scene, particularly on the left where the activity is concentrated. The entire setting gives off a utilitarian vibe typical of construction or maintenance activities in industrial settings. Additionally, there are some numbers painted on the wooden structure (\"#2\"), likely used for identification or tracking purposes within the project.","title":"Aerial view of sparrows point on a hazy day","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["555236","556376","554426","544022","544053","544018","546036","544320","545537","546824","554930","556513","542857","556339","546815","555246"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Equipment"],"terms":["helmet","roller","protocol","consists","identification","crate","team","tunnel","construction","aid"]}
