{"path":"556622.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of a smiling man outdoors on a sunny day. The man appears middle-aged and has slightly tousled dark hair with a hint of grey, noticeable particularly on the sides. Positioned on his head are sunglasses with round, dark lenses. He is wearing a dark button-up shirt under a slightly worn brown jacket with textured and padded shoulders.\n\nHis expression is warm and relaxed, with a broad smile showing teeth, and his eyes appear to be squinting slightly, suggesting it might be bright outside. The background, though out of focus, hints at a somewhat rural or industrial setting with patches of snow on the ground and a building structure with a window visible behind him. The lighting in the image casts noticeable shadows and highlights on his face and jacket, adding depth to the portrait.\n\nThe composition focuses on capturing the man's jovial expression and casual outdoor attire, set against a nondescript background that does not draw attention away from him. The portrait seems candid, capturing a natural moment of joy or amusement.","title":"Architect and experimental house builder Michael Reynolds who lives near Taos, New Mexico.
