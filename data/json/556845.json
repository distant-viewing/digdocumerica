{"path":"556845.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a train station, likely during an activity related to train service or maintenance. The central focus of the image is a large train carriage, which has a distinctive blue and red geometric pattern on its side. The photograph is taken from behind three individuals who appear to be train staff or workers involved with the train operations.\n\nOn the left side of the image, two individuals are seen from the back, climbing into the train carriage. The first person, dressed in a red jacket and black pants, is partially visible at the door of the train. The second person, visible only by their arm, is dressed in a similar dark-colored outfit. The interior of the train carriage shows metallic walls and a glimpse of the ceiling lights.\n\nIn the foreground, more prominently featured, is another individual who appears to be overseeing the operation or perhaps taking a break. This person is dressed in a light pink shirt, dark trousers, and a cap, and is holding two items in his left handâ€”one appears to be a small metallic can and the other possibly a tool or part related to train maintenance.\n\nThe overall setting is industrial, with a focus on the functionality and the routine of train service work. The cloudy sky and gloomy lighting suggest that the weather might be overcast. The image portrays a moment of everyday procedure in the world of rail transport, emphasizing the teamwork and maintenance involved in keeping the service running smoothly.","title":"Amtrak train crew changes at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania after a trip from Chicago. Here the train is split into two sections, one for New York City and the other for Washington, D.C. Those who continued on to the nation's capital and slept late missed their breakfast because the dining car did not continue the trip as had been promised. Amtrak carried 18 million passengers in 1974, an increase of 10 percent from the previous year.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556846","556860","556844","555957","555973","556087","556109","556045","556670","551921","556857","544163","555984","556872","555986","556089"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["train","carriage","service","maintenance","person","procedure","staff","individual","operation","teamwork"]}
