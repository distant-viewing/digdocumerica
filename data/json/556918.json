{"path":"556918.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This is an aerial photograph depicting a vast, densely wooded landscape. The composition primarily features expansive forests of conifers stretching across the frame. A noticeable, dark paved road snakes through the forest from the foreground towards the middle of the image, suggesting a tranquil, undisturbed natural setting.\n\nTo the left and towards the center of the composition, you can see a clearing where multiple large, industrial cylindrical tanks are positioned, possibly for storage purposes related to forestry or agriculture. This opening in the woods provides a stark contrast to the densely wooded areas.\n\nIn the distance, the scene opens up to reveal a large body of water, which could be a lake or a coastal bay, bordered by more forested areas. Beyond the water, majestic mountains rise, their peaks possibly capped with snow, adding a dramatic backdrop to the scene. The sky above is clear and bright, suggesting it might be a sunny day.\n\nThe landscape is predominantly natural and untouched, except for the road and the industrial facility. This suggests a balance between human activity and nature preservation in this region. The overall vibe is serene and picturesque, typical of a remote or less-populated region, possibly used for forestry operations and enjoying the natural environment.","title":"Aerial view looking southwest across the Bangor annex Douglas fir re-growth area to hood canal and the olympic Peninsula.
