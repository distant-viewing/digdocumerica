{"path":"544420.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"In the photograph, a man is depicted riding a horse in what seems to be a rugged, natural setting, perhaps a canyon or similar geographical feature characterized by rock formations. The man is sitting atop a light gray horse, equipped with a traditional saddle and a colorful saddle blanket. He is dressed in what looks like a western-style outfit including a black jacket and jeans, paired with a straw cowboy hat.\n\nThe background features a large rock overhang with rich, red-brown hues and natural textures, indicating erosion from weather elements. Underneath this overhang, the ground consists of uneven stones and gravel, typical of a dry riverbed or trail found in canyon areas.\n\nThe lighting in the scene is soft and diffused with no harsh shadows, suggesting an overcast sky or late/early time of day, which adds a serene and calm tone to the scene. The presence of the horse and the attire of the rider suggest activities related to horseback riding or trail exploration. The overall composition and elements hint at a theme of nature interaction or possibly a guided tour in a rugged, natural landscape.","title":"HavaSupai indian","placename":"Peach Springs (Ariz.)","location":"Peach Springs, Arizona","nn1":["553118","543787","544362","544308","557051","543776","554011","554010","557041","553116","557988","553109","553102","553103","552564","544414"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["horse","saddle","trail","riding","horseback","riverbed","overhang","tour","rider","straw"]}
