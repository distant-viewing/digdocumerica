{"path":"557320.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a series of large solar panels installed on a rooftop. The panels are arranged in rows and are tilted at an angle to maximize exposure to sunlight. Each solar panel is housed within a wooden frame structure that supports the panels at an inclined position. The rooftop itself appears to be covered with gravel, typical for flat commercial building roofs to aid in water drainage and protect the roofing material.\n\nThe background of the image features a partly cloudy sky, suggesting it might be a warm or temperate day. There are no buildings or natural landscapes visibly close by, indicating that the setting could be on top of a larger building or in an isolated location. On the right side of the photo, there are a few large, nondescript metal boxes, likely housing electrical or mechanical equipment related to the solar panel system.\n\nNo people are visible in this image, emphasizing the focus on the technology and infrastructure of renewable energy. The overall composition of the photograph is functional and straightforward, aimed at documenting the setup of solar technology rather than artistic expression.","title":"Flat plate solar heating collectors built by the Solaron Corporation, and installed on the roof of the Gump Glass Company in that city.","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["555309","555327","555288","555323","555294","555347","555292","555349","555293","557312","557328","555333","557319","555331","555343","555341"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["panel","rooftop","technology","drainage","roofing","housing","gravel","position","energy","box"]}
