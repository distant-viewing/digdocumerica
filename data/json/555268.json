{"path":"555268.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph shows a collection of chemical reagents and laboratory supplies organized in a storage shelving unit. The shelves are densely packed with bottles, jars, and bags, many of which are wrapped in plastic bags or sealed in some manner. The items vary in size and shape, and the shelving unit has multiple rows, each filled with these containers.\n\nDistinctive items visible include a can labeled with \"Resinol Oint\" and a box roughly labeled \"TCPO\" among other containers with scientific measures and labels not entirely legible from the photo. There are also several larger plastic jugs with liquids, suggesting that some of the substances might be in liquid form.\n\nThe shelving unit is dark, possibly black, which stands in contrast to the mostly white and yellow labels on the containers. The image has an overall dim lighting, lending a slightly obscured quality to the objects and shadows behind and between the items on the shelves. The focus and clarity are moderate, providing enough detail to identify the general nature of the objects but not the specifics of all labels and contents.","title":"Laboratory storage room for pesticides at an Environmental Protection Agency facility in New York City","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555267","551588","555259","555253","555255","546273","553658","555254","546275","549611","543834","546283","546278","555281","548856","549608"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["shelving","label","unit","container","shelf","item","bag","jug","jar","specific"]}
