{"path":"552657.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image captures a vibrant town parade seen from a shaded viewpoint, possibly the perspective of an observer under an awning or a balcony. The setting appears to be a small town with an \"Old West\" architectural feel, under a cloudless sky suggesting a warm, sunny day.\n\nIn the foreground, the edge of the shaded area can be seen, with numerous spectators gathered. Individuals of various ages and attire watch attentively, with one person notably wearing a straw hat and facing away from the camera. These spectators line the sunlit street, creating a border around the parade.\n\nThe central focus of the photograph is a parade float moving through the street, towed by a green pickup truck. The float is festively decorated with white and red materials, and what appears to be a crown design at the front. Several people are visible on the float, likely involved in presenting or performing, although the specific details are not clearly distinguishable.\n\nThe background shows the town's two-story buildings, typical of small-town main streets. Signage that reads \"LOUNGE\" and other partially visible signs can be seen, suggesting the presence of local businesses. The buildings, coupled with other pedestrians on the sidewalks and additional elements of the parade proceeding behind the pictured float, contribute to the communal, festive atmosphere typical of such events.","title":"Labor Day weekend brings the annual Garfield County Fair parade.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552660","557710","549566","556274","552653","557712","557716","552654","552659","546991","557046","549576","557715","557053","556280","557045"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["float","parade","town","spectator","street","lounge","awning","observer","pickup","straw"]}
