{"path":"544206.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene on a sandy beach near a body of water. In the foreground, a woman in a red sleeveless dress sits on the sand, her back to the camera, looking toward the water. She is wearing a pearl necklace and her dark hair is styled in a short, voluminous cut. To her right, three children are engaged in playful activities on a patch of green grass transitioning into sandy terrain. The nearest child, a toddler in a pink one-piece swimsuit, is kneeling on all fours, possibly playing or crawling towards the beach. Behind her, two boys in swimwear—one in black trunks and the other in a yellow-brown tank top and black shorts—are captured in motion. The boy in black seems to be climbing up the sandy bank, while the other boy stands and looks down, probably watching over the toddler or waiting for his turn to play. The setting suggests a relaxed, leisurely day by the water, highlighted by the natural interaction among the group and the carefree spirit reflected in their activities.","title":"On the beach at Lake Pontchartrain","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543534","555892","543216","543321","543225","552341","547009","557507","548699","547873","543390","550936","550929","543310","547877","553951"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["toddler","boy","beach","play","swimwear","necklace","spirit","child","swimsuit","climb"]}
