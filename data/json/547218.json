{"path":"547218.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a construction site scene, predominantly under a brilliant bright sunny sky, which vividly backlights the figures and creates deep shadows. The main activity is centered on a worker in the foreground who is bending over while using a tool with both hands, possibly engaging in tasks like drilling or grinding into the metallic surface he's standing on. This worker is wearing work clothes and a cap, and is illuminated by a strong glare from the sun, which also produces a halo-like flare above him.\n\nAround this central figure, several other workers are either seated or standing across the platform, engaged in various tasks or watching the ongoing work. The workers are dressed in casual, regular work attire, including jeans and jackets which suggests a cool weather. Shadows cast by these figures give a strong sense of the sunlightâ€™s position and its strength during capture.\n\nThe site itself appears expansive, with various construction materials like rods protruding vertically from some sections, suggesting a development possibly in early stages. The environment beyond the immediate working platform hints at a large open area, potentially near a waterfront based on the horizontal line and open skies in the backdrop.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with the stark lighting, the active postures of the workers, and industrial environment, portrays a typical robust construction site vibe, encapsulated in a moment of daily labor.","title":"Expansion of the Blue Plains sewage treatment plant; workmen are fitting flooring into place at filtering plant.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["556893","553924","544167","556185","547989","547240","543594","546929","549309","553385","544159","542989","549640","544394","544828","546252"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["worker","site","construction","figure","platform","work","halo","glare","working","task"]}
