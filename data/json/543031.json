{"path":"543031.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene with a man and a dog in a somewhat rustic or rural environment. A focal point is a small, two-story wooden building with a gabled roof and a noticeable window on the upper story. The structure appears weathered with fading white paint and is nestled between other structures.\n\nTo the right of the image, a man is seen seated next to a wooden structure, possibly a shed, engaging in a task. He wears a dark cap, a green long-sleeved shirt, and brown pants. The man appears to be either resting or possibly working with a hose which is visible in his hands.\n\nA small dog with a light and dark coat is seen towards the left of the man, sniffing the ground close to where the man is seated. The ground is predominantly dirt, with sparse grass.\n\nTools, including what looks like a rake and other unidentifiable objects, are scattered near the man. Multiple cinder blocks and pieces of wood are also visible in the foreground, suggesting ongoing construction or repair work.\n\nOverall, the scene conveys a sense of casual outdoor activity, possibly in a backyard or work area adjacent to residential structures. The setting is simple and utilitarian, with a focus on the man and his immediate surroundings.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["554537","554126","553089","546992","547767","551000","555528","552674","557637","552106","557761","542874","557115","554951","555581","547792"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["man","dog","rake","cinder","work","story","backyard","hose","seat","repair"]}
