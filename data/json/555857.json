{"path":"555857.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph features a man standing in a shallow body of reddish-brown water, deeply engrossed in examining the ground at his feet. The man appears middle-aged, with graying hair and a beard, and is dressed in a dark jacket and green pants, accessorized with a belt that likely has tools or equipment attached.\n\nThe background presents a striking scene where numerous cars are submerged and jumbled in the water, suggesting a catastrophic flooding event or disposal site. The condition and styling of the cars imply a vintage era, possibly around the 1960s or 1970s. The water around and beyond the man is littered with debris and parts of vehicles poking out of the muddy watery mass, signaling severe damage or long-term abandonment.\n\nIn the distance, against a backdrop of clear blue skies, an imposing mountain range can be seen, providing a stark contrast to the devastation in the foreground. This natural backdrop adds a tranquil but ironic layer to the scene of wreckage. The environment suggests a remote or rural setting, possibly a floodplain near mountains that might experience sudden inflows of water leading to such a scene.","title":"One of the workers involved in the cleanup of a five acre pond filled with acid water, oil, acid clay sludge, dead animals junked cars and other debris checks the consistency of the muck the EPA supervised the cleanup operation which included taking the 1,200,000 gallons of liquid, neutralizing it and trucking it to a disposal site.","placename":"Ogden (Utah)","location":"Ogden, Utah","nn1":["546173","555850","555849","547132","544433","548298","552439","555852","555870","555853","552829","555871","548197","552073","547911","547839"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["styling","wreckage","mass","devastation","flooding","mountain","disposal","beard","foot","damage"]}
