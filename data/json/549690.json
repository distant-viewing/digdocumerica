{"path":"549690.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Clark, Joe","caption":"This photograph depicts an automotive testing environment, likely conducted in a laboratory or workshop designed to measure evaporative emissions from vehicles. A man is present in the scene, standing to the left, wearing dark clothing and possibly handling some testing equipment or vehicle parts.\n\nThe focal point of the image is an enclosed testing area labeled \"5 Evaporative Emissions Enclosure.\" The enclosure is structured with a metal frame and clear plastic walls, allowing visibility into the interior where a car is parked. This setup suggests that the vehicle within the enclosure is being tested for emissions that evaporate from the fuel system.\n\nFurther details of the setting include various pieces of equipment around the enclosure, likely involved in the testing process. These include gauges, tubes, and electronic devices placed on a counter adjacent to the enclosure. There are also gas cylinders, perhaps containing calibration gases for the equipment, situated beside the man. \n\nFluorescent lighting illuminates the space from above, and the surrounding area, which is less visible, seems to be a larger industrial or laboratory space. The atmosphere appears methodical and technical, focused on precise measurements and environmental compliance.","title":"Testing a new car in the evaporative emission enclosure of EPA's Ann Arbor Motor Vehicle Emission Laboratory","placename":"Detroit (Mich.)","location":"Detroit, Michigan","nn1":["542762","553895","549691","557859","557829","549692","557889","549689","557851","557855","557825","557930","542763","557849","557857","553329"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["enclosure","testing","laboratory","gas","emission","equipment","vehicle","cylinder","gauge","measurement"]}
