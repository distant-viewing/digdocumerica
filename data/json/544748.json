{"path":"544748.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph presents a stunning aerial view of a rugged landscape, likely a canyon area, characterized by dramatic geological formations. The central feature of the image is a winding river, its waters a murky shade of greenish-brown, flowing through the canyon. The river is bordered by steep, rocky cliffs that display various hues including red, brown, beige, and grey.\n\nThe terrain adjacent to the riverbanks is a combination of flat plains and undulating hills, composed primarily of rocky surfaces with minimal vegetation. These surfaces show a color palette primarily consisting of earthy tones, contributing to the arid appearance of the landscape.\n\nIn the background, there are higher plateaus and distant mountains, appearing in a deeper, darker shade of blue and grey, which suggests they might be further away or in the shadow of clouds above. These elements add a sense of depth and scale to the scene.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is bright, indicating that it might be taken during the day. Shadows cast from the higher terrains and edges of the riverbank add contrast to the image, enhancing the rugged textures of the landscape. The sky is not visible in the frame, focusing all attention on the geological features.\n\nThis setting is typical of canyon landscapes possibly found in areas such as the Grand Canyon or similar locations known for their erosion-sculpted terrains and dramatic natural beauty. The composition and perspective provided by the aerial view offer a comprehensive overview of the canyon's impressive scale and the natural processes shaping such environments.","title":"Colorado--South Platte River","placename":"South Platte River (Colo. and Neb.)","location":"South Platte River, Colorado","nn1":["545794","545640","545787","545633","545765","545301","545798","545632","544744","544950","550414","549021","544752","545802","552908","543977"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["canyon","grey","riverbank","plateaus","terrain","plain","overview","scale","beige","river"]}
