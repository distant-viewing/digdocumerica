{"path":"552916.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil and scenic landscape featuring a large body of water. The foreground shows the edge of a lake or sea with a pebbled sand shoreline visible under the clear water. The water is serene, showing minimal ripples, and reflects the partly cloudy sky, contributing to a glassy surface.\n\nIn the middle distance, the water takes on a deeper blue hue and you can see patches of underwater vegetation. The background features a series of gentle, rolling hills or low mountains that stretch across the horizon. These hills are somewhat barren, with sparse vegetation and a predominantly brown and green color palette. Above this, the sky is mostly clear with thin, wispy clouds.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is peaceful, depicting a quiet natural setting with no visible human activity or artificial structures, evoking a sense of isolation and untouched natural beauty. The composition and natural lighting enhance the calmness and vastness of this landscape.","title":"Algae growth in one of the shallow bays of Pyramid Lake, Nevada's largest natural lake.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["554527","552894","550493","543643","548030","544679","552904","555692","554616","543546","550391","555388","551573","555717","543058","542882"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["calmness","hill","water","ripple","vastness","sand","vegetation","shoreline","series","sea"]}
