{"path":"549346.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph depicts a man sitting at a table, leaning forward with his arms crossed over each other and resting on the table. He has a serious expression and is looking slightly to his left towards the camera. He is wearing a black polo shirt. The main focal point behind him is a large, illuminated aquarium filled with light-colored fish and some aquatic foliage. The aquarium appears bright in contrast to the relatively darker room. There are some other items beside the man, possibly a drink on the table but it's small and not very clear. The room's walls around the aquarium have a darker color, helping to highlight the tank as the centerpiece of the image. The setting conveys a thoughtful or contemplative mood.","title":"Dr.  Bartolo ozretic, chief of the aquarium at the rovenj branch of the ruder boskovic institute","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["551589","551597","549340","544957","542690","553657","549350","552104","557648","551596","545974","546353","551598","555297","545471","546572"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["table","room","centerpiece","polo","drink","fish","help","cross","arm","tank"]}
