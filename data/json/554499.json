{"path":"554499.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a recreational scene by a lake. At the center and right of the image, several children are engaged in playful activities on the sandy beach. One child, furthest to the right, is crouched near the water's edge, seemingly interacting with the water or wet sand. Two others are positioned slightly to the left, one seated and the other probably bending down, also busy with the sand. Moving further left, another child appears to be in motion, maybe running or skipping along the beach.\n\nTo the far left of the frame, a child is completely bent over, focused on something on the ground, perhaps engaging in building or digging. Near this child, there is a small puddle reflecting nearby objects.\n\nIn the background, the tranquil lake stretches across the entire scene, meeting a lightly forested shoreline opposite the beach. The distant scenery is serene, with calm water and a soft overcast sky suggesting it could be a cool day.\n\nAdding to the scene, on the far left, a part of a vehicle is visible, parked just off the beach, which, along with a small boat partially seen in the water, suggests a family outing or a recreational day trip. The natural elements, such as scattered driftwood and debris along the beach, emphasize the outdoor, untamed setting. The overall mood is one of casual, unstructured play and enjoyment of the natural environment.","title":"Girls playing in the sand on a public beach at a New York state campsite at Raquette Lake, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["553431","553446","552341","550827","553447","545267","546941","543518","547727","547009","557772","551543","558233","554476","543998","543892"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["beach","child","sand","digging","lake","bent","crouch","driftwood","puddle","out"]}
