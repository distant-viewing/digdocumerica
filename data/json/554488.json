{"path":"554488.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a seaplane in mid-flight against a sky filled with a blend of dark and light clouds. The seaplane, mainly white and red, has a high-wing design which places the wings above the fuselage for increased visibility and stability. Additionally, it is equipped with pontoons, suggesting it is capable of water landings. The registration number \"N2938C\" is visible on the tail, indicating its identification and registration status in the United States. The plane is slightly angled in the photograph, giving a dynamic appearance as it flies. The cloud cover in the background reveals varying tones from light to dark, indicating either the presence of a weather system or the time of day with shadows cast by the clouds. There are no people or other objects visible in the frame, which places the entire focus on the aircraft and the sky.","title":"Seaplanes are popular with tourists for sightseeing, and are used for fire control by New York State rather than observation towers, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554656","554654","554487","542720","544491","542793","542719","542500","547810","542717","542506","548469","551219","548884","542496","542501"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["registration","wing","cloud","status","stability","identification","landing","increase","plane","tail"]}
