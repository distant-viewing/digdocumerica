{"path":"555336.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph features a murky and diffuse view, potentially an underwater scene or a surface with a layer of grime or growth. The details are not crisp, contributing to a lack of clear focal points in the image. The colors are predominantly dark and muted greens, emphasizing the obscured and possibly submerged quality of the scene. Scattered throughout the image are small, faint forms that could be debris, biological material, or other particulate matter, floating or suspended within the medium. The overall composition suggests a neglected or natural setting, evoking a sense of stillness and abandonment. The corners of the image are darkened, likely from vignetting, which focuses the viewer's attention towards the center, though it remains challenging to discern specific details or objects due to the image's overall obscurity and low visibility.","title":"Bottom of a shrimp raising tank showing young shrimp at the University of Arizona's Environmental Research Laboratory experiments near Tucson are conducted in high intensity agriculture and aquaculture using solar heated facilities.","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["553348","552054","555804","547541","547622","545674","550368","546779","542582","546789","547905","551352","549641","554919","554554","543555"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["grime","medium","matter","detail","stillness","lack","growth","visibility","abandonment","corner"]}
