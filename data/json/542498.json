{"path":"542498.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of activity around a small biplane, which is primarily yellow in color. The scene likely takes place during the late afternoon given the warm lighting and long shadows visible on the ground.\n\nTwo men, both wearing aviation or mechanic outfits, are engaged with the plane. The first man stands on the lower wing of the biplane. He is dressed in a light-colored helmet and goggles, a zip-up jacket over a shirt, gloves, and light-colored pants. He is actively reaching towards something inside the cockpit or assisting the second man, who is partially visible in the cockpit.\n\nThe second man, in the cockpit, has his back to the viewer, with only his torso and arms visible. He is also dressed in a similar light-colored, possibly protective, outfit.\n\nThe biplane itself features some visible markings and labels. One such label reads \"UNITED\" indicating a possible affiliation with an organization or company. Additional text beneath this seems to include some registration or identification number.\n\nThe scene is set in an open area with sparse vegetation in the background, emphasizing a setting that could be an airfield or similar aviation-specific location. The ground is uneven and looks like compacted dirt, typical of rural airstrips.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a sense of teamwork and preparation, possibly before a flight, highlighting the human and mechanical elements involved in aviation activities.","title":"Preparing to sulfur-dust grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542499","542496","542576","542578","548881","545935","552370","542504","542506","548884","542669","553873","547247","549072","542508","542500"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["biplane","cockpit","aviation","label","goggles","affiliation","torso","mechanic","identification","registration"]}
