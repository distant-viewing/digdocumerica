{"path":"548159.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a robust tree trunk on which a distinctive yellow sign is attached. The sign reads \"Federal-State Cooperative Snow Surveys Snow Course Marker,\" and below in smaller text, \"Soil Conservation Service U.S.D.A.\" It is diamond-shaped with black bold lettering and a double line border.\n\nThe tree's bark is rugged and heavily textured, typical of a mature tree, possibly a type of conifer given the context and visible foliage. Traces of snow are speckled across the bark, suggesting a cold, snowy environment.\n\nIn the background, other trees can be seen, their branches heavy with a thick layer of snow, emphasizing a wintry forest setting. The overall atmosphere suggests this photograph was taken in a remote, snow-covered area, commonly used for snow surveys and environmental monitoring.","title":"Soil Conservation Service sign at Tilly Jane Campground on Mt.
