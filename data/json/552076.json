{"path":"552076.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph portrays a natural, serene setting with a focus on a distinct, man-made objectâ€”a blue barrel-like item, prominently displaying a painted sign that reads \"PRIVATE PROPERTY KEEP OUT.\" The barrel is weathered, showing signs of rust and wear, and parts of the text are faded. It is positioned on what appears to be a dirt road, flanked by lush, overgrown green vegetation. Behind it, there is a river that spans the width of the image, bordered on both sides by thick, forested areas, which suggest a secluded or less urbanized location. The sky is partly cloudy, casting a soft, diffuse light over the scene, which enhances the tranquil and slightly moody atmosphere of the setting. The distant background features a hill or elevated landform with buildings just visible, suggesting a town or settlement. The composition of the photograph, with the road leading towards these distant buildings, draws the eye past the sign and across the river to explore the landscape beyond.","title":"Property along the Kansas river in the area of the 7th street bridge.
