{"path":"549010.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant daytime scene focusing on a road bridge over a river, highlighted by a prominent sign in the foreground that reads \"MUDDY RIVER.\" The bridge, which is constructed of white metal with a truss design, spans across the foreground and leads into the distance. The river itself is not immediately visible and might be obscured by dense greenery on either side of the bridge.\n\nThe left side of the picture is dominated by the clear blue sky and arid landscape showcasing some rolling hills in the background, hinting at a dessert or semi-arid location. On the right, the landscape includes a roadway parallel to the bridge where a few cars are visible, suggesting some level of activity or travel. There are also some buildings or structures scattered around the scene, and power lines stretching across the sky connecting to utility poles further frame the scene.\n\nThe composition also captures a blend of human-made objects and natural environment, providing a glimpse into a specific locale and its infrastructure, possibly in a rural or outskirts area where such rivers and bridges are pivotal. The overall mood conveyed by the vibrant light and sharp colors is that of clarity and openness in a small, possibly remote community.","title":"Muddy river and highway crossing","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["552247","551527","552052","551186","549469","550954","548941","558051","552598","548064","557096","555727","558048","549068","550214","553663"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","river","truss","parallel","locale","openness","outskirt","daytime","clarity","roadway"]}
