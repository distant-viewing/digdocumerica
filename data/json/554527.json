{"path":"554527.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape featuring a tranquil body of water, likely a lake or tranquil part of a river, with a dense forest in the background. The water is calm with slight ripples, reflecting the blue sky and some of the surrounding greenery.\n\nThe foreground of the image is dominated by the reflective surface of the water, providing a mirror-like effect that enhances the peacefulness of the scene. Trees, probably varieties of evergreens typical of a coniferous forest, densely populate the background. They vary in height, with one particularly tall tree standing out, towering over the others. This creates a dynamic array of green tones and textures against the sky.\n\nThe sky is mostly clear with a few fluffy, white clouds drifting, suggesting a bright, sunny day. This light enhances the vividness of both the sky and the landscape's natural colors. The angle and framing of the shot are such that nature's untouched beauty is the focus, offering a view that suggests remoteness and the tranquility that comes with being far from urban centers.\n\nOverall, this photograph depicts a quiet, untouched, natural environment inviting viewers to appreciate the calm and beauty of an undisturbed natural landscape.","title":"Typical shoreline of an adirondack preserve forest lake in the southwestern region with remnants of virgin white pines, red spruces, maple and birch with lower understory of bushes","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554616","546963","554526","543611","553410","554529","552141","550579","550656","555692","551349","554623","553465","552916","556928","555637"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["drift","evergreen","remoteness","appreciate","forest","peacefulness","vividness","framing","come","calm"]}
