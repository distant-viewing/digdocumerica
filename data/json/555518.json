{"path":"555518.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a large vertical sign prominently positioned in the foreground with a clear view of a street scene in the background. The sign is divided into three colored sections, each with distinct text messaging:\n\n1. The top section of the sign is green with white lettering that reads \"GREEN FLAG EVERYONE WELCOME.\"\n2. The middle section is yellow and specifies \"YELLOW FLAG COMMERCIAL TRUCKS CARS\" with additional text \"BURDEN OF PROOF ON CUSTOMER\" in black.\n3. The lower section is red and simply states \"RED FLAG CLOSED NO GAS\" in white lettering.\n\nBehind the sign, there is visible street traffic with cars from the 1970s era. A brown sedan is directly behind the sign, and further back, a white station wagon is noticeable. Across the street, there is a dealership with cars displayed, and a banner that reads \"LINCOLN.\" The environment suggests a primarily commercial area with wide streets and ample spacing among vehicles and structures. The setting and the sign hint at the context of possibly rationed or restricted services, likely related to fuel availability, as indicated by the sign.","title":"Gasoline dealers in Oregon displayed signs explaining the flag policy during the fuel crisis in the winter of 1973-74.  As the sign says the green flag means anyone can get gas, the yellow is for commercial vehicles only and a red flag means no gas at all.
