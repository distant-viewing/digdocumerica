{"path":"542553.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph shows an expansive outdoor scene dominated by a large industrial operation in a valley setting. In the foreground, there is a field of golden crops, rich in color and possibly ready for harvesting. The middle ground is occupied by some industrial buildings – possibly a factory or processing plant – emitting white steam or smoke into the air from several stacks, suggesting active production or processing work.\n\nFurther back, the presence of various other structures is visible, possibly storage units or additional factory buildings, which are spread across horizontally. A significant amount of cleared earth and stockpiled materials (which might be minerals or construction aggregates) suggest that this might be a mining or materials processing site.\n\nIn the background, gentle hills rise, covered predominantly in green, with a few sparse trees. Above the hills, utility poles and a clear blue sky can be seen, adding a sense of depth and openness to the scene. The air appears slightly hazy, possibly due to the emissions from the plant or ambient dust. The overall composition balances the natural landscape with the industrial activity, highlighting the interaction between human enterprise and the environment.","title":"California--San Joaquin Valley","placename":"San Joaquin (Fresno County, Calif.)","location":"San Joaquin, California","nn1":["542589","543159","544059","552544","554625","545020","543642","543764","554763","544068","544676","545013","554630","544788","551112","545971"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["processing","factory","air","enterprise","harvesting","material","openness","hill","plant","mineral"]}
