{"path":"557301.jpg","date":"January 1975","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph features a large factory or power plant chimney emitting thick, billowing smoke into the sky. The chimney, painted red with a white stripe around the top, stands out markedly against the vivid blue sky. The smoke, which is predominantly white but with dark hues suggesting the presence of pollutants, dominates the scene as it flows upwards and fans out.\n\nThe background is a clear sky, dotted with fluffy, natural clouds that mingle with the artificial smoke plume, creating a stark contrast between industrial activity and the natural environment. The image captures an environmental theme, possibly highlighting issues of air pollution and its impact on the atmosphere. The composition emphasizes the massive scale of emissions and its intrusion into the natural sky, possibly prompting contemplation on industrial impacts on air quality and environmental health.","title":"Closeup of smoke from a stack at the Phillips Power Station owned by the Duquesne Light Company and located on the Ohio River northwest of Pittsburgh. The company installed wet scrubbers to minimize emissions in a $42 million environment improvement project. Some corrosion difficulties were experienced with the scrubbers during the shakedown phase.","placename":"Beaver County (Pa.)","location":"Beaver County, Pennsylvania","nn1":["545472","546760","556499","545468","550905","550871","550938","545441","552184","557302","550998","543005","548157","545247","550869","557299"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Environmental Pollution"],"terms":["smoke","chimney","air","fan","intrusion","pollutant","impact","health","emission","issue"]}
