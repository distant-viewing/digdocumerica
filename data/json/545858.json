{"path":"545858.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a construction scene beside a body of water, presumably a river or a large canal. The foreground features a grassy area with scattered vegetation. This leads down to the water's edge where an industrial construction site is visible across the river.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, a large mechanical crane stationed at the waterâ€™s edge is the most notable feature, suggesting heavy machinery work. The crane appears to be involved in excavation or construction operations at a site bordered by piles of dirt and construction barriers.\n\nAcross the river, on the opposite bank, there is more visible construction activity, characterized by bare earth, various construction debris, and equipment. No people are visible in the scene, emphasizing the focus on the industrial equipment and the environmental setting.\n\nThe background extends into a built environment with faint outlines of structures and utility poles, indicating proximity to a more urban area. The sky is clear and the overall lighting suggests it is daytime.\n\nThe photo evokes themes of industrial development and its interaction with natural water bodies, perhaps pointing to environmental management or infrastructural expansion.","title":"Construction of solid waste disposal settling tank on Simms Bayou.
