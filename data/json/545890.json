{"path":"545890.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil rural scene featuring a brown horse and a young white foal with brown patches. The foal is standing close to the horse, possibly its mother, in what appears to be a bonding or feeding moment. They are situated in a lush, open field dotted with yellow flowers, signifying a spring or summer season. To the right of the frame stands a solitary, small tree with a distinctively twisted trunk and full, green foliage, providing a striking visual contrast in shape and color to the relatively flat landscape. The background is a hazy blue sky, which suggests either early morning mist or a gentle fog. The overall composition, with the animals positioned slightly off-center to the left and the lone tree on the right, offers a balanced and peaceful rural imagery, inviting viewers to appreciate a moment of natural serenity and the beauty of wildlife interactions.","title":"Mare nursing colt","placename":"Austin (Tex.)","location":"Austin, Texas","nn1":["545894","542972","542619","542622","556958","543678","551327","543726","551229","552501","554161","557186","553064","556957","552562","544425"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["horse","bonding","mother","imagery","serenity","fog","wildlife","spring","mist","right"]}
