{"path":"542495.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a crop dusting airplane in mid-flight, emitting a stream of chemicals over a field of crops. The scene captures a clear blue sky as the backdrop, with multiple power lines stretching across the upper part of the image, some of which intersect at angles due to the perspective. The airplane, which appears quite small and compact, is colored bright yellow and emphasizes the activity's dynamism with its tilted posture in the air.\n\nBeneath the airplane, there are rows of densely planted crops which extend towards the horizon, displaying a rural farming landscape. On the right side, a dirt road runs parallel to the crop rows, bordered by utility poles that carry more power lines. The photograph has a wide-angle view that gives an expansive feel to the setting, attempting to capture the scope of agricultural activities and the rural setting in which they occur. The dynamic nature of the image is further boosted by the airplaneâ€™s active spray, suggesting movement and purpose in the midst of a calm, static backdrop.","title":"Dusting grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542503","553044","542504","553873","542505","549072","553881","548902","542508","548903","549104","548883","548820","548898","553048","549094"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["airplane","crop","dusting","power","dynamism","scope","row","attempt","chemical","static"]}
