{"path":"547108.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures an elderly man actively engaged in manual labor involving coal. He is shoveling coal into a rusted, red wheelbarrow. The man is dressed in worn, dark-colored work clothes which include a long-sleeve shirt, a pair of trousers, and a light-colored cap on his head. His posture is slightly bent due to the laborious task. \n\nThe setting is outdoors, and the background includes a large, textured brick wall that adds a stark, gritty backdrop to the scene. The bricks are weathered, and their arrangement is uniform, suggesting an old industrial or urban environment. \n\nThe wheelbarrow, positioned in the foreground, is filled with shiny black coal bits reflecting light, drawing attention to the labor and the material being handled. This image projects themes of hard work, possibly in an industrial or construction setting, reflecting a moment in the daily life of a worker. The man's expression, although not fully visible, seems focused and determined, indicative of his engagement in the task at hand. The image is rich in detail, capturing the essence of manual labor and the physicality involved in such work.","title":"Coal delivery in Rogers Park, part of Chicago's North Side","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547076","556345","556337","554937","544154","547078","551043","542497","556896","554856","558306","548761","551039","553603","556357","544386"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["coal","labor","work","brick","task","clothe","pair","man","essence","bit"]}
