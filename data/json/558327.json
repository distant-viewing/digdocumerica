{"path":"558327.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Phillips, Kathy","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly woman engaged in a craft activity. The woman is seated, bending slightly over a table as she focuses intently on assembling or decorating a small object, which she holds delicately between her fingers. She wears glasses and is dressed in a casual, comfortable manner with a gray cardigan over a patterned blouse.\n\nThe setting appears to be a well-lit indoor room, likely a communal area given the existence of other objects in the background that suggest a shared space. On the table in front of her, there is a blurred object resembling a doll or a colorful decoration, contributing to a sense of homely and creative environment. A bright window can be seen in the background, and there seems to be a patterned curtain or wall hanging, enhancing the cozy, domestic vibe of the scene.\n\nThe photograph uses soft, warm lighting, which highlights the woman's focused expression and the textures of her clothing and the objects around her. The overall composition, with its gentle colors and intimate framing, evokes a sense of peacefulness and the deep concentration involved in craftwork.","title":"Senior citizens find that New Ulm, Minnesota, is a good place to retire.
