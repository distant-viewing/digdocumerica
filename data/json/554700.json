{"path":"554700.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and picturesque scene centered around the spire of a church roof. The spire towers upward into a bright blue sky, with a weather vane perched at its very tip. The spire itself is partially clad in what appears to be weathered wooden shakes or tiles that lend an old, serene charm to the building.\n\nMost prominent in the scene are the vibrant red and orange autumn leaves framing the spire. The foliage, likely from maple trees, is richly colored and lush, partially obscuring the church spire and creating a sense of depth and natural beauty. The composition of the photo, with leaves in the foreground and the church spire in the background, beautifully juxtaposes the man-made structure against the splendor of nature in fall.\n\nThe image evokes a calm and tranquil atmosphere, typical of a serene autumn day, suggesting a quiet location possibly in a rural or semi-rural area. The natural lighting and clear sky add to the peaceful and idyllic quality of the photograph.","title":"Church spire framed by sugar maple fall finery at","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557954","558023","546455","546466","558024","554035","550287","546451","556480","554207","557088","550376","557952","553327","546459","546463"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["spire","church","autumn","tip","tile","fall","charm","leave","foliage","weather"]}
