{"path":"549097.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a high-altitude or spaceborne view of an area, rendered in a fisheye lens effect, which creates a spherical distortion making the scene look like a small, self-contained planet. The curvature of the Earth is evident at the edges, enhancing the globe-like presentation.\n\nThe area captured in the image consists of a variety of geometric agricultural fields, predominantly in shades of greens and browns, suggesting different types of crops or fallow land. These fields are segmented into various rectangular and irregular shapes, creating a patchwork appearance.\n\nIn the central part of the image, there is a developed area featuring buildings, roads, and possibly industrial or farming infrastructure. The layout includes several compact clusters of buildings connected by roads that intersect at various angles.\n\nThe surroundings are devoid of visible natural landscapes such as forests, rivers, or lakes, focusing solely on the cultivated and developed land. The background fades into a dark backdrop due to the fisheye lens effect, emphasizing the central area even more.\n\nOverall, this photograph provides a unique, almost otherworldly perspective on human land use, highlighting both agricultural and built environments in a compact, globe-like frame.","title":"Fish-eye shot of Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["558414","549094","553695","553977","552858","542708","557517","554164","547724","553059","542517","547725","544768","553943","553047","548907"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["globe","lens","land","self","curvature","effect","presentation","patchwork","field","crop"]}
