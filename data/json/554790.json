{"path":"554790.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene landscape scene, possibly at dusk, given the lighting and color tones. The focus is on a large grassy hill that slopes gently upwards from the foreground to the middle of the frame, where it peaks. The hill is unevenly covered with grass and shrubs, exhibiting a mix of green and brown hues, indicative of either autumn or mild weather conditions.\n\nOn the left side, behind the hill, there is an expansive cemetery that spans the width of the photograph. The cemetery is populated with numerous gravestones, which stand out as white or light-colored specks against the darker backdrop of lush trees. This collection of trees includes several large, prominent ones that resemble pine or cypress, contributing to the somber and tranquil aura typical of a burial ground.\n\nThe background is a subtle blend of lighter sky and darker earth tones, creating a calm and slightly somber atmosphere. There are no visible structures or people, emphasizing the solitude and stillness of the scene. The overall composition and elements suggest themes of memory, quiet reflection, and the passage of time, fitting for a cemetery setting.","title":"After miles of bare land is a remainder of the past, the Casville Cemetery, off Route 22.
