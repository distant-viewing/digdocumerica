{"path":"551266.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph presents a dark and moody interior scene featuring large, sculpted birds, possibly doves, in the foreground. The birds are made of a smooth, white material, and are captured from a dramatic angle that emphasizes their spread wings and detailed plumage.\n\nThe room shown has wooden accents and a sloped ceiling paneled in white, suggesting a roof-like structure and creating a cozy, enclosed feeling. Behind the bird sculptures, there is a well-furnished bedroom visible. The bed features a dark, ornate headboard and a comforter with a rich, floral pattern in deep and vibrant colors.\n\nNext to the bed, a traditional lamp with a dark shade sits atop a small, dark wooden table, adding to the quaint and vintage atmosphere of the room. The wall behind the bed has a picture frame, but the contents are indistinct in this lighting.\n\nA window is also visible in the background, providing a natural light source that illuminates part of the room, contrasting with the otherwise dim interior lighting. The overall composition is dramatic and artistic, utilizing the bird sculptures as a striking visual centerpiece against the darker, textured backdrop of the bedroom interior.","title":"Porcelain lovebirds decorate the master bedroom of the Charles Welek House in Blackhawk Estates.
