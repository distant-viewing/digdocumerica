{"path":"551530.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of outdoor recreation by a body of water, likely a river, with an urban-industrial backdrop. A person is swinging from a rope suspended from an unseen source, positioned mid-air over the river, suggesting a moment of thrill and exhilaration typical of rope swinging. The river water sparkles under bright daylight, enhancing the dynamic and summer-like atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, another group of individuals is visible; some are on a rocky outcrop close to the waterâ€™s edge, while others appear to be in the water, possibly swimming or preparing to take their turn at rope swinging. The foliage around them is lush and green, indicating a location rich with vegetation despite the urban elements.\n\nThe background includes prominent urban features: a tall cylindrical building and a large electrical transmission tower. The industrial feel is heightened by the presence of these structures and other smaller, nondescript buildings to the right of the cylindrical building. There is also a bridge or similar large structure to the far right, partially cut off from the frame, adding to the sense of a bustling, developed environment.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the leisurely and adventurous human activities with the rigid, utilitarian elements of urban infrastructure, creating a narrative about urban nature and recreation. The imagery is captured from a distance and under a shadow, likely from another structure or bridge, framing the vibrant scene in a more muted, serene light which contrasts with the energy of the activities depicted.","title":"Swinging into the Mississippi River from a rope attached to a railroad trestle.
