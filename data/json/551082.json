{"path":"551082.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph features an industrial scene dominated by a sprawling complex of a chemical plant or refinery. There are multiple large industrial structures, including tall vertical towers, some of which emit plumes of smoke or steam. The plant comprises various tanks, pipes, and metallic frameworks, replete with a mix of rusty and silver hues.\n\nIn the background, dense, lush green forests on rolling hills set a contrasting natural backdrop against the industrial foreground. The sky is partially obscured but appears to be a muted blue, suggesting either dusk or a slightly overcast day.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image hints at industrial activity in a rural or semi-rural setting, where manufacturing operations juxtapose sharply with the natural environment. This creates a visually striking composition of man-made versus natural elements.","title":"Dupont Belle works","placename":"Charleston (W.
