{"path":"547548.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene on a calm, expansive body of water that stretches to the horizon under a clear sky. In the foreground, two individuals in a small rowboat are actively engaged in a task that involves handling equipment or ropes connected to a bright red buoy floating near them. They are both clad in heavy, possibly waterproof, yellow outerwear, giving the impression of being fishermen or workers involved in maritime activities.\n\nTowards the middle of the image, several white buoys line up on the surface of the water, possibly marking a path or boundary or linked to the activity in which the individuals are engaged. In the background, a larger boat painted in dark colors, likely black or deep blue, is anchored. This vessel is more equipped and considerably larger than the rowboat, featuring a cabin and a mast, and it hosts several people on deck who appear to be observing or waiting.\n\nThe vastness of the water and the involved maritime activity suggest this scene could be part of a commercial fishing operation or some form of aquatic monitoring. The clear weather and calm sea add a serene yet industrious quality to the scene.","title":"Fishermen check leader of trap nets at mouth of Sakonnet River.
