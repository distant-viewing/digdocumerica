{"path":"546989.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This image captures a somewhat aged and weathered two-story wooden house with a gabled roof, set in a somewhat rural or perhaps semi-abandoned setting. The house features a pale paint, possibly white or light grey, which appears somewhat faded and peeling, indicating possible neglect or age. The structure is quite large and rectangular, with multiple windows that have arched designs on the top, suggesting architectural influences from past eras. Notably, several of the window shutters are either closed or partially closed.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a prominent and robust tree with a thick trunk and expansive branches that partly obscure the view of the house. The leaves of the tree are dense, suggesting the image was taken in a season where trees are in full leaf, possibly spring or summer. Beneath the tree and around the area, the ground is barren and covered with patches of dirt, grass, and scattered debris, which contributes to the feel of an unmaintained environment.\n\nThe sky, visible through the branches of the tree, appears bright, indicating either a sunny day or a clear environment despite the detailed and aged look of the house and surroundings. This scene evokes a sense of stillness and perhaps historical depth, possibly indicating the house's historical value or its abandonment over time.","title":"An old church used by the Black community of John's Island.
