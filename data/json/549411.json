{"path":"549411.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a serene maritime scene on a body of water, likely a lake or a slow-moving river. The main focus is on a distinctive boat in the foreground, painted prominently with red and black, and featuring traditional design elements such as a robust wooden mast and multiple oars extending out from the sides. Aboard the boat, there are at least two individuals wearing casual clothing and caps, who appear to be engaged in managing the boat, possibly rowing or steering.\n\nIn the background, there are several other sailboats gracefully moving across the water, each with sails fully hoisted, catching the wind. The sails are mostly white, and the boats vary slightly in design and size, suggesting a leisure or recreational setting rather than a competitive race. The far background displays a light haze that obscures detailed features but hints at a tree-lined shore or a distant landmass, contributing to the tranquil and picturesque atmosphere.\n\nThe lighting suggests this scene is set during the day under partially clear skies, which provides a bright but muted light, casting soft shadows and contributing to the calm and peaceful ambiance of the overall setting.","title":"Viking image on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549416","544669","549417","552345","549413","549410","548247","552316","548118","548524","547549","548521","546976","547273","548555","555718"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["boat","sail","oar","race","landmass","steering","mast","design","sailboat","wind"]}
