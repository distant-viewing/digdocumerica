{"path":"544732.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a striking sunset view of a railway yard. Multiple railroad tracks converge in the foreground, bathed in golden sunlight that reflects off the metal rails, creating a network of vibrant lines that lead the eye into the depth of the image.\n\nThe background features a large metal truss bridge, silhouetted against a partly cloudy sky, glowing from the setting sun. The sun itself is visible as a bright, diffuse orb partially obscured by clouds and the infrastructure of the bridge. Below the bridge and above the tracks, there are several faint outlines of buildings and possibly other structures, contributing to an industrial atmosphere.\n\nOverhead, utility poles with multiple cross arms and wires are visible, and they stand out as dark silhouettes against the lighter sky. The entire scene is infused with a warm, orange and yellow hue, emphasizing the end of a day.\n\nOverall, the composition captures an evocative industrial landscape, highlighting the intricate interplay of light, shadow, and the robust features of the railway infrastructure during a sunset.","title":"Sunset over railyards","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["544724","544728","547711","549096","556004","547714","556783","545541","545022","558140","557513","547140","545430","556854","545418","548851"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["bridge","railway","sunset","track","infuse","orb","sun","truss","silhouette","infrastructure"]}
