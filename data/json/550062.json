{"path":"550062.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph showcases two high-rise buildings, presenting a striking contrast in styles and eras.\n\nOn the left, there's an ornate clock tower with classic architectural features such as detailed stone work, a pointed roof with a spire, and a clock face set below the peak. The design elements suggest a historical structure with Gothic or Baroque influences.\n\nDominating the right side of the image is a modern skyscraper. It features a much simpler, more functional design with a grid-like facade filled with seemingly identical rectangular windows. This building's exterior is marked by its minimalistic and utilitarian aesthetic, typical of mid-20th century modern architecture.\n\nThe background is a clear blue sky, providing a clean backdrop that highlights the buildings. At the bottom, partially visible, is what appears to be an elevated roadway or platform, indicated by the horizontal structure with vertical supports.\n\nThis composition captures the architectural evolution of cityscapes, where the old and new coexist, creating a diverse urban environment.","title":"Old custom house and new waterfront apartment building","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["546499","549997","551442","550001","546557","550011","552042","546521","551457","546503","550007","550024","555278","547229","557237","551455"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["clock","evolution","spire","influence","design","support","skyscraper","roadway","grid","exterior"]}
