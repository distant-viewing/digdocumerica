{"path":"544790.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"The photograph captures a natural scene of rocks partially submerged in a muddy body of water. The water is visibly thick and has a distinct orange-brown color, possibly indicating the presence of iron or other minerals in it. The rocks vary in size and shape, and all appear to have a smooth texture. Some rocks are dark grey while others have lighter shades, all coated wetly, adding a gleaming effect from the catch of light.\n\nThe composition focuses on the contrasting textures and colors between the water and the rocks. It appears that this may be a shallow part of a river or stream with a slowly moving current, as evidenced by the gentle ripples around the stones. The setting seems serene and untouched, suggesting a remote or natural area away from urban influences. The lighting in the photo is bright, indicating either a sunny day or a well-lit environment that enhances the vivid colors and reflective surfaces in the scene.","title":"The Denver metro sewage treatment plant discharges into the South Platte River","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["550726","552061","555626","543185","557251","543152","543172","542583","555077","544862","543789","543617","550678","553420","544856","544867"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["rock","gleam","iron","mineral","influence","grey","stream","texture","have","evidence"]}
