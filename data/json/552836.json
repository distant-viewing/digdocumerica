{"path":"552836.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph is an aerial view of a river or a lake that displays an interesting infrastructure possibly related to oil or gas extraction. From the right, a long pier or jetty extends into the water, connecting to a large platform equipped with industrial equipment, including two white storage tanks and what appears to be a crane or some structure for loading material.\n\nTo the left of the pier are two unusual circular formations in the water, both ringed with what looks like dirt or mud piles. These circular formations, particularly the connected double-ring feature nearest the platform, might be part of environmental dredging operations, aquaculture, or another form of water-based industrial activity. The surrounding area is heavily vegetated, suggesting a somewhat remote location. The vegetation is lush and green, indicative of a wetland or swampy environment.\n\nOverall, the image captures a scene of industrial activity amidst a natural water body, highlighting the intersection of human-made structures and the environment.","title":"In the spring of 1973, the Mississippi River reached its highest level in more than 150 years. Unprecedented flooding occurred throughout the river basin. Particularly affected were the marsh area below New Orleans and the entire Atchafalaya River basin aerial view of the flooded Mississippi below New Orleans.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["552835","547668","547958","552245","552131","555862","545834","551612","552009","552206","544643","552205","552258","548641","551203","544636"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["pier","platform","dredging","aquaculture","formation","ring","jetty","extraction","mud","oil"]}
