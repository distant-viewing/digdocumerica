{"path":"548530.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image captures an outdoor scene focused on a variety of shells arranged neatly on a cement ground, presumably for sale or display. The foreground of the photograph is dominated by numerous shells, primarily conch shells, which are organized in rows. These shells vary in size and are positioned with their openings facing upwards, showcasing the pinkish interior. Smaller, more rounded shells are clustered in groups, and two signs are placed among the shells, presumably displaying prices or information.\n\nIn the middle ground at the edge of the land, there are three larger trays or platforms that hold several larger conch shells and a pile of smaller shells. These platforms seem to function as either a part of the organized display or as preparation areas for purchasing.\n\nBeyond these displays, the background shows a tranquil body of water that stretches to the horizon, meeting a clear, cloudless sky. Two small fishing boats float on the calm sea not far from the shore. The left side of the scene is framed by a line of lush green vegetation, which suggests a tropical location. The overall atmosphere is serene and picturesque, typical of a coastal market or tourist spot known for selling marine products.","title":"Souvenir seashells are lined up for sale here on the southernmost point of the united states","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548534","548538","545082","548545","545193","548810","548282","545186","543191","550306","555552","552866","552941","547008","547016","548789"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["shell","display","cement","platforms","beyond","tray","sell","price","facing","tourist"]}
