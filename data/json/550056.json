{"path":"550056.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of children engaged in a clean-up activity. In the foreground, there is a boy in a red jacket and pants picking up a discarded aluminum can. He has short dark hair and is wearing brown shoes, actively bending over while holding a large, transparent trash bag full of various types of litter. Behind him, a girl in a similar red outfit, with her hair tied back, is standing while also holding a transparent bag filled with litter.\n\nIn the background, there are two more children, each holding transparent trash bags. The setting appears to be a slightly unkempt roadside with green grass and weeds on one side and a dirt path running beside it. The focus on environmental care is evident as these children work diligently to collect and dispose of litter from surroundings which appear quasi-rural or suburban. The weather is sunny, casting clear shadows, and suggesting an active, bright day for the clean-up event.","title":"Cleaning up the roadside in Onset","placename":"New Bedford (Mass.)","location":"New Bedford, Massachusetts","nn1":["544827","543927","551427","546863","550060","548191","544800","542655","543708","552948","551391","551421","545136","552951","548198","543176"],"cl":[9],"cluster":["#09 &mdash; Flooding"],"terms":["litter","bag","child","trash","aluminum","weed","hair","care","roadside","can"]}
