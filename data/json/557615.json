{"path":"557615.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a chipmunk peeking through a natural frame of dark green foliage. The chipmunk's expressive eyes and detailed fur, marked with its distinctive stripes, are visible as it peeks forward, appearing almost as though it is emerging from the shadows. The leaves around the chipmunk have soft edges, contributing to a shallow depth of field focused primarily on the chipmunk's face. The background and some leaf edges have a gentle blur, creating an enchanting and intimate atmosphere in the photograph. The play of light and shadow adds a dynamic contrast, highlighting the chipmunkâ€™s features and providing an overall mood of curiosity and caution.","title":"Chip monk nibbling on a piece of cone on the private preserveon green mountain in Washington.
