{"path":"554034.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures two for-sale signs mounted on posts in a lush, tropical setting. The primary sign is large and features an outline of a map, possibly of Hawaii, and includes the text \"FOR SALE,\" followed by the real estate company name \"Friendly Isle Realty,\" along with \"HONOLULU\" and two phone numbers. Below it, in smaller print, the sign states \"HOTEL USE.\" The secondary, smaller sign to the right advertises another property for sale, referencing \"Kona Beach,\" and includes a phone number.\n\nThe background shows dense vegetation, primarily low shrubs and trees typical of a tropical climate, and a glimpse of a road or path that leads through this verdant area. The sky above is brightly lit, suggesting a sunny day. This setting gives the impression of a remote, possibly coastal location. The lighting and shadows indicate that the photo was taken during daylight with bright sunlight.","title":"More signs like this will be appearing on Molokai if residents have their way.
