{"path":"548221.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph is set on a serene beachscape exhibiting a vast expanse of sand. In the foreground, shadows are cast by waning sunlight on rippled sand textures, accented by the distinctive patterns produced by a wooden slat fence vertically placed and slightly buried in the sand, leading into the midground of the image. \n\nTowards the left, there stands a prominent white lighthouse-like structure atop a modest elevation lined with sparse vegetation, hinting at a change in terrain from the broader flatlands. The beach stretches infinitely to the right in a gentle curve, bordered by a tranquil ocean that hints the coastline. \n\nOn the beach, several people are scattered at various distances. Some appear close to the water's edge, likely enjoying a peaceful walk, while others are more distantly speckled across the wide sandy space, contributing to a peaceful, leisurely atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, the sky, filled with an assortment of clouds, suggests late afternoon or early evening light, influencing the cool yet soft tones that wash over the landscape. An elongated island or landmass sits on the horizon under the expansive sky, giving a sense of depth and isolation to the scene.\n\nThis setting emits a tranquil and contemplative mood, ideal for reflective walks or serene outings, with all elements composing an image that captures the essence of a calm coastal environment.","title":"Crane's beach, a federally-protected dune preserve, between essex and ipswich","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["548220","557509","546953","542890","547607","555402","547600","543287","554159","543078","547612","555400","543493","547697","557529","543244"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sand","beach","bury","slat","lighthouse","peaceful","landmass","walk","outing","wash"]}
