{"path":"553064.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a tender moment between a young boy and a large white horse in a rustic setting. The boy, dressed in a striped yellow and green shirt and dark trousers with boots, appears to be affectionately checking or adjusting the horse's bridle. He stands on his toes, reaching up towards the horseâ€™s mouth. The horse, towering over the boy, is white with speckles and splotches of grey, complemented with a dark mane and tail. It stands calmly, holding its head low, making it easier for the boy to reach.\n\nThe setting is a rural environment, likely a farm or ranch. The background features a shack with an old, rusted roof and another similar structure further behind it. The ground is uneven and rocky, suggesting a well-trodden outdoor area possibly used for horses. There's a blurred figure of another person further in the background, adding a sense of daily activity and life at this location.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the interaction between the boy and the horse against a backdrop of rural simplicity, evokes a sense of closeness and care between humans and animals, and a peaceful, pastoral life.","title":"Southwest Colorado ranch.
