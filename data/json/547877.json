{"path":"547877.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment on a sandy beach, depicting three people engaged in different activities. On the left, an older woman sits on a wooden log, comfortably reading a book while leaning forward slightly, dressed in a dark top and a patterned skirt. Next to her, a young girl seems occupied with something small in her hands, possibly playing with sand or a small object. She is dressed in a bright red sweater and dark pants.\n\nTo the right, a man is lying flat on his stomach on the beach, his arms extended forward as if he is also engaged in picking up or inspecting something on the sand. He is dressed in a dark outfit, possibly shorts and a t-shirt or rolled-up sleeves. \n\nThe scene is set against an expanding backdrop of a wide, quiet beach, with a visibly low tide revealing wet sand and sparse vegetation scattered around. A few boats can be seen in the background along the waterline, enhancing the coastal vibe of the setting. The day appears bright and sunny, casting distinct shadows and contributing to the vibrant colors of the scene. The overall mood is peaceful, depicting a leisurely day by the sea.","title":"Plum Beach at Sheepshead Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["543225","555402","547009","548697","545162","557507","543534","548695","552341","543499","543493","546982","543310","543072","543089","554159"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["sand","beach","waterline","expand","pick","tide","dress","inspect","t","skirt"]}
