{"path":"552436.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a single-story house partially submerged in floodwaters. The house, featuring a typical suburban design, has light-colored siding, a steep roof, and several windows and doors that face the viewer. The roof is dark, possibly shingled, and has a small chimney protruding from it.\n\nThe surrounding area is heavily flooded; water reaches midway up the houseâ€™s first-floor windows, suggesting a significant water level rise. Several trees surrounding the house are also partially submerged, indicating the extent of the flooding. These trees, mostly without leaves, stand starkly against the background and are reflected in the calm water, creating a somber and still atmosphere. \n\nThe background to the scene is less distinct, composed of additional water and possibly more submerged trees, blending into a horizon that is hard to differentiate from the water. The lighting is soft, suggesting either a cloudy day or a time of day when the sun is not fully bright, which adds to the melancholic and quiet mood of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image captures the dramatic and tranquil impact of natural flooding, highlighting the intrusion of water into a living space designed for dry land, and the resilience or vulnerability of human structures against natural forces.","title":"House in Liverpool (population approximately 400) partly submerged by the swollen Illinois River.
