{"path":"557797.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"In the photograph, a middle-aged man stands under a tent with a subdued maroon color visible in the background, which suggests he might be at an outdoor event, possibly a fair or festival. The man sports a traditional German attire, which includes a white short-sleeved shirt and lederhosen—knee-length trousers or short pants made of leather—complemented by decorative suspenders. One notable feature of his outfit is the elaborate hat he wears, adorned with numerous small badges or pins, which add texture and interest, featuring a large feather or tuft at the top.\n\nHe is also holding a newspaper, which suggests he is either reading or about to read it. His facial expression is calm and gentle, with a subtle smile, indicating he is likely enjoying his environment and activity. The background, blurred with hints of people and the tent's structure, puts the focus on the man and his distinctive cultural attire. There's also a clear sense of a lively social gathering, suggested by the presence of other people and the overall casual yet festive atmosphere.","title":"Visitor to the fifth annual Oktoberfest at Helen, pauses with a copy of the Helen Mountain Eagle.
