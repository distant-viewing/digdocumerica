{"path":"545338.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures a moment on an outdoor wooden staircase in an urban setting, likely on the backside of a brick building. The focus is on a young boy shirtless, with black hair, wearing grey knee-length shorts. He is in the midst of climbing over what appears to be a railing or a barrier made of wooden planks and a metal pole. His posture is bent forward as he intimately grips the pole, suggesting he is either climbing down or balancing himself.\n\nThe staircase itself shows signs of wear, with aged, weathered wood and some debris scattered around. The metal post he holds onto is possibly a support structure for the stairs. Below him, in the background, three other boys look up, watching his actions. They stand on the ground and their facial expressions suggest attentiveness and perhaps anticipation of the boy's next move.\n\nThe setting around the children is typical of an older urban area, characterized by reddish-brown brick architecture and a narrow passageway between buildings, hinting at a dense, possibly lower-income neighborhood. The overall lighting and shadow in the image give it a gritty, realistic feel, reinforcing the spontaneity and everyday nature of the scene.","title":"The Armijo Community Center in El Paso's Second Ward","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["555950","556163","545319","556165","550249","552833","551225","547188","551725","556166","553497","552764","546536","557987","545383","544207"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","staircase","income","spontaneity","brick","move","pole","attentiveness","anticipation","stair"]}
