{"path":"551375.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a water snake resting on a log submerged in water. The snake is stretched out across the length of the log, which is partially covered in algae and small leaves. The texture of the snake's skin is visible, showing a pattern of darker and lighter brown scales. The water surrounding the log is fairly clear but tinted green, likely due to aquatic plants below the surface and algae.\n\nThe background of the image is out of focus, and it hints at the presence of more vegetation, presumably part of a marsh or pond environment. The sunlight appears to be striking the snake and part of the log directly, highlighting the snake's scales and some wet spots on the log that are reflecting light. \n\nNo human activity is discernible in this scene; it is solely a snapshot of wildlife and natural habitat. The overall mood of the image is peaceful and portrays a typical moment in the life of a water snake in its natural environment.","title":"Water snake (Natrix) at ease on a log in the clear waters of Ha Ha Tonka Lake","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["544900","551374","544908","549459","544904","555065","543286","550219","544528","544546","554603","550341","551366","550786","551352","549145"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["snake","log","algae","marsh","scale","skin","water","pond","habitat","wildlife"]}
