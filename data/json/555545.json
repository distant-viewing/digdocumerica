{"path":"555545.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a natural scene dominated by cracked, dried mud. The stark texture of the cracked ground is highlighted by the irregular pattern of large and small cracks that create an almost mosaic-like appearance. Shades of dark blues and blacks fill the spaces between the light gray and white crusty textures of the dried mud, suggesting that some moisture may still be present below the surface.\n\nIn the foreground, thereâ€™s a bundle of green plants with long, slender leaves that appear to be growing directly from the cracks. These plants add a splash of life and color to the otherwise desolate landscape. The leaves are draped over the mud, suggesting they might be struggling for growth in a tough environment. \n\nThere is no visible sky or horizon line, and the focus stays solely on the surface and the vegetation, giving the viewer a sense of being close to the ground. The lighting is subdued but direct, emphasizing the textures and the contrast between the vitality of the plant and the aridness of the mud. This setting might imply a dry lakebed or a similar environment where water has evaporated, leaving behind these natural patterns and struggling plant life.","title":"Dying corn plant is shown in a truck garden about 12 hours after being contaminated when a pennwalt corporation chemical storage plant was desTroyed by fire and explosions believed caused by lightning.
