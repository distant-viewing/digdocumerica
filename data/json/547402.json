{"path":"547402.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a man standing in the foreground, dressed in a sheriff's uniform, which includes a dark brown jacket over a lighter brown shirt, complemented with a brown hat featuring a sheriff's badge. He is also wearing a badge on his jacket and has a two-way radio attached near his shoulder. His arms are crossed, and his expression is serious.\n\nIn the background, a large, stately building is visible, likely a government or state capitol building given its prominent dome and classical architecture. The building is multi-storied and has several large windows and steps leading up to its entrance. The dome is topped with some antennas or rods, indicating modern use, perhaps for communications. This setting suggests the photograph might have been taken in a capital city or significant governmental area.\n\nThe surrounding area includes a parking lot with parked cars and neatly maintained lawns with trees, indicating a well-organized, possibly urban environment. The sky is clear, suggesting a sunny day, which casts shadows on the ground complementing the clarity and brightness of the day.","title":"Seward County Sheriff Marvin Pollock in uniform of office.
