{"path":"554698.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This image depicts an ancient rock engraving or petroglyph, likely from a historical or prehistoric site. The main engraved figure appears to be a chariot drawn by two horses. The chariot is detailed, showing a solid, larger central area possibly indicating a compartment for passengers or warriors. Both horses are in motion as suggested by the position of their legs and tails. The figures are stylistically simple but clear, with visible wheels on the chariot and the outlines of the horses and chariot rider distinct against the rock surface. The rock itself is rough and uneven, with natural textures and cracks, which gives it an aged and weathered appearance. The image's color is monochromatic, appearing in varying shades of brown and gray, which enhances the sense of antiquity. The overall composition focuses on the depiction of the chariot scene, occupying the center of the frame, and gives an insight into the artwork and cultural expressions of an ancient civilization.","title":"Outline of an old stagecoach hand-carved into the rock along Route 73 between Lake Placid and Keene","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545675","545671","545679","557117","554172","545687","544915","550098","549682","558133","558134","545692","547002","544309","545608","545683"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["horse","rock","civilization","insight","artwork","crack","figure","compartment","rider","tail"]}
