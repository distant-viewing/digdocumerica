{"path":"547056.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial waterside scene involving a large, dark-hulled ship moored near the bank of a body of water. The ship, appearing heavy and somewhat aged, has several windows along its upper structure and a funnel releasing a plume of dark smoke, suggesting it is either operational or in the process of being powered up or down.\n\nTo the right, adjacent to the ship, is a series of freight train cars on railroad tracks. The train cars are primarily boxcars, and one is visibly red, adding a splash of color to the otherwise muted scene.\n\nThe foreground of the image shows a dirt area with gravel and sparse vegetation, typical of an industrial or undeveloped waterfront area. This setting appears slightly rugged and neglected, with a few small litter items scattered around.\n\nThe sky is overcast, contributing to the overall gloomy and gray atmosphere of the photograph, and there are several birds, possibly seagulls, flying above the ship, which adds a dynamic element of wildlife interaction in this industrial setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of industrial activity by a waterfront, highlighting elements of transportation and industry with a backdrop that suggests a chilly or wintry climate given the bare trees and grey sky.","title":"Ludington ferry to Wisconsin.
