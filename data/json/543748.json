{"path":"543748.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a bustling outdoor activity scene, likely set in a dry, rocky location reminiscent of a mining or excavation site. In the foreground, there is a wooden sign hanging on a rail, marked with the words \"TOUR FEE 50c BEYOND THIS POINT\" which suggests the activity taking place is commercial and requires a fee to participate. Handwritten notes are attached below this sign indicating the price for \"GOLD PANNING $1.00,\" pointing to the primary activity being showcased.\n\nThe majority of the image shows numerous individuals engaged in the panning for gold. People of various ages are scattered across several wooden troughs filled with water. They are seen closely examining or sifting through the rocks and dirt accumulated in their individual pans or troughs, which are positioned in a line along the water's flow.\n\nThe background features a moderately steep, rocky hillside, confirming the outdoor, rugged nature of the setting. There are no significant vegetations or trees, just bare rocky grounds, contributing to a sense of an arid environment. Overall, the scene captures the essence of a recreational or tourist activity centered around gold panning, facilitated in a naturalistic, historical-themed environment.","title":"Small \"tourist trap\" gold-mining operation.
