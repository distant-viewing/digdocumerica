{"path":"548784.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a coastal development, possibly a marina or a series of canals, alongside a lush, green landscape and housing areas. The central focus of the image is a large body of turquoise water interspersed with long, white rectangular structuresâ€”these appear to be docks or piers arranged in a series of straightforward, orderly rows extending into the water. Each dock has spaces that seem designated for boats or other watercraft, suggesting a man-made, organized marine facility.\n\nSurrounding the water are several patches of land covered with greenery, indicating a somewhat tropical or subtropical environment. There are numerous buildings, potentially residential, visible in the background, scattered across the landscape and aligned along the roads.\n\nTowards the horizon, the composition shifts to include more densely packed buildings and infrastructure, providing a contrast to the more natural elements such as the clear water and green areas. The sky above is clear, suggesting fair weather, which casts bright lighting across the entire scene, enhancing the vivid colors of the environment.","title":"Land development at Plantation Key","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548639","548638","557462","545128","548634","548637","557422","548783","548780","548779","548763","557450","546951","554058","549505","549501"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["dock","series","watercraft","designate","marina","canal","shift","housing","water","pier"]}
