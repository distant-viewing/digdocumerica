{"path":"544033.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a lakeside. In the image, there are two individuals, likely a mother and her child, near the water's edge. The adult is wearing a red top and turquoise shorts, standing and pointing towards the lake, possibly directing or speaking to the child. The child, who appears to be wearing a dark tank top and lighter shorts, is squatting and seems to be interacting with the lake water or something on the ground.\n\nThe lakeside is covered with small rocks and pebbles, creating a rough texture on the ground. Two empty bottles are visible in the foreground, hinting at recent human activity in the area. The background of the image features a calm lake with a gentle ripple, surrounded by a hilly landscape under a clear, blue sky. There are some boats visible on the lake, suggesting recreational activities. The overall setting is serene, with natural beauty highlighted by the water and the hills, while the human figures add a dynamic element to the serene landscape.","title":"Outing at Lake Pleasant","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["546941","552029","550827","552940","550242","544200","547727","554534","552975","554499","543998","547749","553431","543951","548794","543892"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["lake","lakeside","child","short","turquoise","mother","pebble","bottle","ripple","water"]}
