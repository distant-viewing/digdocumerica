{"path":"544188.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a natural aquatic scene filled with numerous water strider insects skimming across the surface of water. The image is characterized by vibrant, warm colors ranging from deep browns to rich purples and some reddish hues, likely enhanced by the lighting or photographic filters. The water surface has a slightly rippled texture, suggesting gentle movement, which is emphasized by the circular, ripple effects around some of the water striders.\n\nThe water striders are gathered in dense clusters, with some areas more heavily populated than others. These insects, known for their ability to walk on water due to surface tension, appear as small dark specs on the colorful water surface. Their legs spread wide, distributing their weight to stay atop the liquid.\n\nThe angle and framing of the shot creates an almost abstract, painterly effect, transforming a simple moment in nature into a compelling visual tableau. This scene might pertain to a study of nature, focusing on the ecosystem's dynamics, or perhaps a purely artistic exploration of color and pattern in photography.","title":"Polluted waters of Lake Pontchartrain","placename":"Louisiana","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548283","542582","543555","543554","547541","545850","550341","553180","543558","555626","543564","545923","555080","543187","555044","547509"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["insect","water","surface","transform","stay","weight","tension","effect","tableau","distribute"]}
