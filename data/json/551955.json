{"path":"551955.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a maritime scene involving a shirtless man aboard a boat. The man, visibly muscular and perhaps in his mid-years, is looking upwards with a contemplative expression. He is standing next to a large coil of thick rope which suggests his role might involve physical labor or operation on the boat. His skin is tanned and he appears weathered, possibly indicating prolonged exposure to the elements typical of those who work at sea or outdoors.\n\nThe environment around him consists of a body of calm water and a large steel bridge structure in the background, which stretches across the scene horizontally. The bridge supports are large and geometric, dipping into the water and helping to frame the image with a sense of industrial scale.\n\nThe colors in the image are somewhat muted, lending an almost vintage or retro look to the scene. The composition of the photograph directs the viewer's attention from the textured details of the man's physical features and the rope, leading to the expansive bridge and open water. This arrangement conveys a narrative of hard work within the vastness of the man-made and natural landscapes. The overall mood evokes a sense of solitude and perhaps the dignity of labor.","title":"Crewman watches helmsman as tug boat nears home berth calumet river","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["549376","551046","547554","548279","547164","547559","555802","549331","546763","545219","546301","549595","547566","552301","548102","548278"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["bridge","rope","labor","involve","coil","dip","man","retro","boat","tan"]}
