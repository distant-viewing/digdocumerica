{"path":"556990.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph portrays a serene, expansive landscape dominated by a vast meadow under bright sunlight. The foreground of the image is covered with lush, dark green grass and wild plants, which appear slightly overgrown and unkempt, suggesting the natural, undisturbed nature of the area. This leads into a wider, open field in the middle ground, where the vegetation transitions to shorter, golden-yellow grass, creating a contrast with the darker foreground.\n\nBeyond this field, the landscape gently undulates into mild hills. On these hills, a dense mixture of coniferous and deciduous trees forms a thick forest that stretches across the horizon. The trees are rich in hues of dark green, indicating the vibrancy of the natural environment.\n\nThe sky above the scene is vast and clear, suggesting a crisp atmosphere, characteristic of a bright, sunny day without clouds. The overall ambiance of the photograph conveys a tranquil, untouched wilderness, possibly in a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThere are no visible human figures or man-made structures in the immediate vicinity, which emphasizes the solitude and pristine condition of this natural landscape. The composition and the quality of light suggest that the photo might be taken during late afternoon, as evidenced by the soft, yet bright, sunlight and long shadows cast over the grass.","title":"View of agricultural property which is part of a proposed \"new city\" north of silverdale.
