{"path":"548164.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a group of three men, each engaging in different activities on two small boats in a body of water. The water has a rich, textured surface indicating either currents or the disturbance created by the boats.\n\nOn the left side of the image, one man is sitting on the stern of a silver boat, focusing on a task maybe related to the boatâ€™s engine. He wears a dark green or grey top and seems to be absorbed in his work, not interacting with the others.\n\nIn the center of the image, another man stands proudly, holding up a large fish he seems to have caught, showing it off. He wears a red cap and a multi-colored jacket over a shirt. His expression and posture indicate a sense of pride and joy.\n\nOn the right, another boat contains one man, wearing a darker jacket and a hat. He is seated and looks on but it's unclear whether he is watching the man with the fish or possibly looking at something in his own boat.\n\nThe overall lighting is subdued and slightly silhouetted, which suggests either early morning or late afternoon. The background is largely indistinguishable with a focus on the activities occurring on the boats. This, together with the attire of the subjects and their activities, suggests a leisurely yet enthusiastic fishing trip among the group.","title":"Landing a Chinook salmon on the Willamette River near Oregon City","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548132","546053","546079","546001","554198","551410","552283","547566","552325","554199","549935","545093","552323","546980","552313","552282"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["boat","fish","man","stern","pride","jacket","silver","trip","current","group"]}
