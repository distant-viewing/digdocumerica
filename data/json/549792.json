{"path":"549792.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a landfill or waste management facility under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, there is a massive pile of garbage comprising varied materials like plastic, paper, and other refuse. Dominating the scene are two large yellow construction vehicles engaged in waste management tasks.\n\nOn the left, a yellow bulldozer with tracks is visible. It appears to be compacting or pushing the trash. To the right, there's a large yellow crane with an extended arm and a huge bucket grabbing a portion of the garbage. The crane is positioned over a large, open-top metal dumpster that is partially filled with waste, indicating that it is in the process of transferring trash into this container.\n\nIn the distant background, the horizon is flat and barren, suggesting the landfill is located in a remote or undeveloped area. The sky is vividly blue, contrasting sharply with the industrial activity and the stark piles of waste on the ground.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts heavy machinery at work in an industrial waste disposal setting, emphasizing themes of waste management and environmental impact.","title":"At Staten Island landfill, steam shovel loads carts with garbage brought by barge from Manhattan.
