{"path":"553964.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a group of tourists at an outdoor vantage point overlooking a deep and expansive canyon. The canyon features steep, rugged cliffs with layers of reddish-brown rock, and sparse vegetation primarily in shades of green. The landscape suggests a dry, possibly arid environment.\n\nIn the foreground, numerous tourists are gathered behind a railing. They are dressed in casual vacation attire, indicative of the warm weather, with many wearing hats and sunglasses. The tourists appear engaged in various activities: some are taking photographs, others are talking among themselves, and a few are simply gazing at the view. The group is diverse, with men and women of various ages.\n\nThe overall composition highlights the contrast between the human activity at the viewpoint and the vast, untouched natural beauty of the canyon. The atmosphere seems relaxed and leisurely, as people take in the scenery and enjoy their surroundings.","title":"Tourists view waimea canyon","placename":"Kauai (Hawaii)","location":"Kauai, Hawaii","nn1":["545689","553962","553965","545705","545693","545780","545581","545782","544903","549536","544313","544917","545702","544108","545607","545595"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","tourist","vacation","talk","group","sunglass","overlook","viewpoint","gaze","scenery"]}
