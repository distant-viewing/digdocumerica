{"path":"549573.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a festive and lively parade scene on a city street. Prominently featured is a person on tall stilts dressed as the iconic character Uncle Sam. The costume includes red and white striped pants and a dark coat layered over a vest with a white shirt and bow tie, complete with a blue hat adorned with white stars. The stilts person is gesturing with one hand while holding stilts supports with the other, towering above the spectators and giving a friendly wave.\n\nThe background setting is an urban environment with modern and older architecture blending together. A tall, multi-story building with a grid-like facade of dark windows dominates the background, reflecting the bright blue sky. The street is lined with a large crowd of spectators sitting and standing along the edge, focused on the parade. To the right, you can glimpse another parade participant dressed possibly in a red outfit and mounted on a horse, adding to the diverse elements typical in a parade.\n\nThe scene has a clear, vivid blue sky which provides a bright and contrasting backdrop to the colorful activities. The photograph appears to be taken during a sunny day enhancing the vibrance and festive atmosphere of the event. The perspective used in the photo, possibly near ground level and looking upward, emphasizes the height of the stilted Uncle Sam and adds a dynamic element to the composition.","title":"A stilt-walking \"Uncle Sam\" strides along East Wisconsin Avenue during the annual \"Old Milwaukee Days\" circus parade.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557710","552653","552660","552657","556274","549577","549566","558181","549567","549576","546995","552654","557715","557712","553234","549579"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["parade","stilt","spectator","costume","star","street","vest","participant","person","horse"]}
