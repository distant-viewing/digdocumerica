Central to the image is a large industrial facility, possibly a power plant or processing facility. This expansive facility includes several tall structures with metal scaffolding, multiple chimneys, and large tanks. There is an intricate network of pipes and other infrastructure visible.\n\nAdjacent to the industrial complex, there's an electrical substation filled with numerous transformers and power lines, showing the facility's heavy reliance on electrical power. Lines of traffic and rows of parked cars suggest the area is busy and functional.\n\nThe industrial area is surrounded by natural beauty. To the left, there is a large body of water with hints of a shoreline, where a few boats can be seen. A river or canal curves from the right of the image towards this body of water, lined with lush greenery and a few small boats. In the background, there are further signs of residential or smaller commercial buildings nestling among scattered trees. Beyond, another body of water extends to the horizon, enhancing the scenic contrasts of the area.\n\nAbove all, the photograph illustrates a vibrant yet contrasting blend of industrial activity within a serene natural environment, depicting human enterprise amidst nature.","title":"Industrial area","placename":"Puerto Rico","location":"OTHER","nn1":["551202","550860","545996","557377","551576","546974","550856","550694","550995","545833","551994","552191","548070","551998","557392","550761"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["facility","power","reliance","enterprise","scaffolding","boat","body","canal","line","pipe"]}
