{"path":"545189.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene of a fishing or marine-related activity, presumably on a boat. The focus is centered on a large, mechanical apparatus, likely a crane or winch system, which is used to haul what appears to be a pile of oysters or clams from the water. This heap of shellfish is visible in the foreground, forming a significant mound on the deck of the boat.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a person is actively engaged in the process, standing next to the mechanical equipment. This individual, who appears to be a man, wears outdoor, functional attire suitable for marine activities, including a dark jacket and is involved in either operating the machinery or handling the shellfish.\n\nThe background features an expansive view of the open water, under a sky that seems early morning or late evening, as suggested by the subdued light and the moody, cloudy sky. The horizon is visible, and the calm sea suggests a peaceful setting, albeit a working environment.\n\nThe ambience is one of rugged, active maritime labor, emphasized by the visible elements such as ropes, chains, and the mechanical nature of the equipment used. The overall setting suggests this might be a typical dayâ€™s work in shellfish harvesting, capturing an essence of the maritime industry and the natural environment in which it operates.","title":"Harvesting oysters by dredging","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545181","552865","546301","545193","552863","552877","545185","545093","547552","546305","545178","549597","547563","551046","552881","546297"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["shellfish","winch","oyster","harvesting","boat","equipment","ambience","heap","apparatus","chain"]}
