{"path":"555504.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a rectangular traffic sign mounted on a single post. The sign is predominantly black with a white border and text. At the top of the sign, thereâ€™s a graphic depicting a stylized car in white, containing three figures symbolizing passengers or carpoolers. Below the graphic, in white bold letters, the sign reads \"POOL IT.\"\n\nThe background of the image shows an unfocused view of a highway during the daytime. Several cars are visible on the road, moving away from the viewpoint. The environment beside the highway includes green trees, suggesting a suburban or rural setting. The sky above appears overcast, giving the scene a slightly muted tone. The combination of elements in the photograph emphasizes the concept of carpooling, likely in an effort to reduce traffic or environmental impact.","title":"\"pool it\" sign north of vancouver, Washington, was a reminder that the gasoline shortage was not over in march, 1974 and sharing rides was a good idea","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["542761","555421","542755","553018","547811","548342","546619","546644","555437","549879","542760","557881","553719","545455","557824","543874"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["graphic","highway","sign","concept","traffic","reduce","symbolize","pool","daytime","combination"]}
