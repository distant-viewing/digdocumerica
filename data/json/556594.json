{"path":"556594.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph features a close-up portrait of an elderly woman. Her white hair is neatly combed back and she is wearing a pair of black-rimmed glasses. The expression on her face is solemn and her facial features display signs of aging, such as wrinkles and a slightly furrowed brow.\n\nShe is dressed in a black and white patterned sweater, which appears thick and warm, suggesting it might be cold where she is. Over her sweater, she's wearing a light scarf with intricate paisley designs, and she has pulled a part of it up over her head like a hood, adding to the warmth and possibly protection against the elements.\n\nThe background of the photograph is out of focus but appears to be a uniform, muted color that does not distract from the subject. The focus on the elderly woman is sharp, capturing great detail in her features, which conveys a strong sense of her presence and character.","title":"Closeup of Mrs. Berry Howard, wife of a retired coal miner who lives in Cumberland, Kentucky.
