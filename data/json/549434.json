{"path":"549434.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant and active scene on the ocean involving a group of people aboard a sailboat. The boat, which has the name \"La Forza del Destino\" and hails from Sunapee, New Hampshire, is seen heeling significantly in the waterâ€”a sign it is moving briskly under strong sail. The hull and deck of the sailboat are primarily white, contrasting with the dark blue of the boat's stern, and the sails billow full of wind.\n\nOn deck, there are several people engaged in various sailing activities. The crew, consisting of both men and women, are dressed in casual, maritime-appropriate attire such as shorts and T-shirts. Some crew members are actively handling the rigging and sails, reflecting a moment full of action and teamwork. Their postures and engagement indicate they are possibly maneuvering the boat or adjusting the sails to suit the wind conditions.\n\nThe ocean around the vessel is choppy with waves splashing against the hull, highlighting the windy conditions on the water. In the background, a murky sky suggests overcast weather, which adds a somewhat dramatic ambiance to the setting. Another sailboat is visible in the distance, hinting at a possible sailing event or a common sailing area. The overall composition of the image, with the dynamic tilt of the boat and the active crew, conveys a sense of adventure and nautical skill.","title":"Contender in the five-class Annapolis-Newport race on Chesapeake Bay near the start of the race","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549433","549435","549430","549404","549436","549388","549394","547449","549390","547458","548513","549392","549391","547456","549421","549428"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["sail","crew","sailing","sailboat","boat","hull","wind","deck","ocean","skill"]}
