{"path":"553143.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"The photograph captures a scene in an urban square, characterized by cobblestone paving and surrounded by tall buildings. In the foreground, a man stands on the left side, dressed in a dark suit and a hat, leaning on a red hand cart. His pose and expression suggest he is observing his surroundings but is not involved in the central activity.\n\nThe central subjects of the image are two women holding signs, standing slightly to the right of center. The signs express political messages with the text \"STOP ISRAELI NAZISM IN PALESTINE\". Both women are dressed in smart, somewhat formal clothing. The woman on the left wears a simple shirt and trousers combination, while the one on the right dons a darker blouse and trousers with a light jacket or cardigan. Behind them, various individuals can be seen walking or standing, who appear disconnected from the protest, simply going about their day.\n\nThe background features a mixture of classical and more modern architecture, contributing to an overall busy, metropolitan atmosphere. The scene exudes a sense of everyday urban life, juxtaposed with the focused intent of the protesters conveying their message. The image captures both a moment of political expression and the broader context of city life, with pedestrians and architectural details that suggest this is a public, possibly well-frequented area.","title":"Fountain square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: delivery man pauses to read signs of pro-arab pickets","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553140","551852","551829","553321","551816","551911","553237","553280","551823","551854","546445","547205","549806","551789","552720","551648"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["message","trousers","protest","woman","cobblestone","intent","don","cardigan","cart","square"]}
