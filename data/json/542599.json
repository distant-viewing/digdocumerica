{"path":"542599.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural mountainous landscape, primarily covered with coniferous trees such as pines. The terrain is rugged and sloped, scattered with a variety of trees of different sizes and ages, indicating a healthy, varied forest ecosystem. On a dry, barren patch of the hill, there is a group of four elk grazing and wandering. The colors in the image are vibrant with the greens of the trees contrasting against the brown earth and the animals' bodies.\n\nIn the background, the dense forest canopy extends over hilly terrain, suggesting this scene might be set in a large mountain range or a national park. The lighting appears to be midday, as it casts deep shadows among the trees and bright highlights on the open dirt slope and on the elks. The overall composition creates a serene and untouched natural setting, emphasizing the peaceful coexistence of wildlife within their habitat.","title":"Water in background is Mammoth Pool.","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["543022","542604","554461","550494","543582","544114","550602","550536","548025","549155","542964","554531","555698","550535","543569","557003"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["grazing","forest","pine","tree","midday","coexistence","highlight","terrain","habitat","wildlife"]}
