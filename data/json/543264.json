{"path":"543264.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph features a close-up view of two snails, each partially withdrawn into their shells on a rough, textured surface that appears to be moist sand or wet soil. The foreground prominently displays one snail, positioned towards the left, with its shell showing patterns of lines and ridges in natural brown and cream colors. Another similar snail is visible in the center, slightly receding into the background against a jagged edge in the sand or soil.\n\nThe texture around the snails is grainy and there are visible darker patches and crevices on the surface, suggesting an outdoor natural habitat, perhaps near a body of water given the wetness of the soil. The color palette consists chiefly of various shades of brown, with specks of darker and lighter tones enhancing the rugged feel of the terrain. The focus of the image is sharp on the snails and somewhat softer on the sandy background, creating a bokeh effect which highlights the foreground. The composition captures a naturalistic and detailed examination of these small creatures within their environment.","title":"Snails","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["543191","555552","545082","552867","557605","544904","544908","542957","557101","554005","553582","555365","555196","552941","557169","552866"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["shell","soil","sand","wetness","bokeh","darker","reced","examination","creature","crevice"]}
