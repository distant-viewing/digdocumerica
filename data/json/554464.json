{"path":"554464.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor camping scene in a wooded area beside a river. Several canoes are pulled ashore near a dense collection of trees. The foreground is filled with leafy vegetation and a partially visible, chopped tree stump. In the mid-ground, to the left, a few individuals are busy arranging or handling their gear near the canoes. One person, kneeling beside the closest canoe, is possibly packing or unpacking items.\n\nTowards the center and right side of the image, other individuals are engaged in various activities. A few are standing near or moving around the canoes, dressed in outdoor, casual attire. Colors like red, yellow, and black are noticeable in their clothing, suggesting outdoor or waterproof gear suited for river or camping activities. \n\nTwo tents are pitched in the background right side of the image, confirming the camping nature of their gathering. One tent is a vibrant red, highly noticeable against the green backdrop provided by the trees. The river flowing past behind the scene adds a serene and scenic element to the setting, suggesting these individuals might have been engaging in water-related activities like canoeing prior to or after this moment captured.\n\nThe setting is lush and green, indicative of a temperate climate and possibly spring or summer season, perfect for such outdoor endeavors. The overall mood appears to be collaborative and active, with everyone taking part in managing the campsite or the equipment related to their outdoor adventure.","title":"Canoe and kayak club from Vermont prepare to paddle down the Upper Hudson River near Indian Lake via Indian River, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543889","549450","545734","554470","554463","554469","544855","554468","553806","548748","545293","548796","550659","554661","544759","551538"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","camping","tent","gear","river","campsite","individual","stump","endeavor","adventure"]}
