{"path":"548678.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid underwater scene, predominantly featuring a large, mound-like coral formation. The coral presents a diverse texture characterized by numerous rounded protrusions, which visually dominate the central part of the image.\n\nThe coral itself exhibits shades of dark green blended with areas of brown and muted yellow, which are typical color distortions caused by the water's absorption of light. Surrounding the coral formation is a dense sea grass bed. The grass, appearing elongated and slightly blurred, extends into the murky blue-green background, contributing to a sense of depth and natural habitat complexity.\n\nThe lighting in the image hints at natural sunlight filtering through water, casting gentle highlights and creating a subdued glow on parts of the coral. This illumination subtly emphasizes the coral's rough texture and the flowing lines of the sea grass.\n\nOverall, the composition and color palette present a serene yet mysterious underwater tableau, showcasing the beauty and variety of marine ecosystems. This setting might be typical of coral reef areas which are known for their biodiversity and ecological importance.","title":"Coral and sea life in the john pennekamp coral reef state park at key largo is photographed at a depth of 12 feet","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["548682","548679","548677","548711","548712","548723","548719","548722","548710","548676","548717","548721","548713","548681","548680","548683"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["coral","grass","protrusion","reef","formation","sea","biodiversity","tableau","present","importance"]}
