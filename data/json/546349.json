{"path":"546349.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene on a body of clear, blue water, most likely a lake or a calm sea inlet. The focus is on two men engaged in aquatic activities. The foreground features a man seen from the back, partially submerged in water, holding onto a wooden pole. He appears poised and focused on his task, which involves interacting with something at the water's surface, likely part of a makeshift or recreational water activity setup.\n\nIn the midground, another man is using a kayak paddle while seated on what seems to be a low-floating platform or a very shallow boat, navigating through the water. This individual adds an active, dynamic element to the scene, suggesting leisure or sport.\n\nThe background offers a scenic view of a sandy shore lined with a variety of houses and sparse vegetation, under a clear sky. Notably, one larger, more distinctive house with a steep roof and a surrounding balcony stands out, possibly indicating a residential area that enjoys waterfront views.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph, with its crisp colors and clear lighting, paints a picture of a relaxed, recreational day at the water, involving community interaction and engagement with the natural environment.","title":"These aquatic biologists from the Southeast Water Laboratory in Athens, GA, have set up a Mobile lab near the EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory, in order to study the continuous fishkill in Escambia Bay.
