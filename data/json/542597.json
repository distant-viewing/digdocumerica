{"path":"542597.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of the forest floor where a striking red sprout or fungal growth emerges prominently from the burnt earth and ash. The background and surrounding area are densely littered with dark, charred debris from a forest, likely after a fire. This includes blackened twigs, branches, and scattered leaves. The texture of the soil is rough, filled with small stones and covered with ash, emphasizing the aftermath of a fire. The color of the plant or fungus is vivid crimson, contrasting sharply against the muted, dark tones of the ground, drawing the viewer's attention immediately to it. This vivid growth, amidst the devastation, suggests a theme of resilience and rebirth in nature.","title":"Moving ponderosa pine logs at Pine Industry Mill","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["555095","555090","555202","542610","555180","553626","542598","553571","542819","552059","553583","555159","553561","555183","553595","542571"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["ash","fire","growth","devastation","twig","forest","aftermath","resilience","floor","stone"]}
