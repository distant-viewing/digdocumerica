{"path":"545070.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a construction site set on sandy terrain that likely resembles a beach or dune area. The image is vibrant, with clear blue skies above and an abundance of sand surrounding the various construction elements.\n\nCentral to the image is a large white mobile crane, equipped with an extended black arm and cables. This crane dominates the scene and suggests heavy lifting and significant construction work. The crane is labeled \"GENERAL CONSTRUCTION CO.\" with additional text that starts with \"INDUSTRIAL\" visible above it.\n\nA large portion of the photograph shows big pipeline segments lying horizontally across and parallel to each other in the foreground. These pipelines are substantial in diameter, reinforced with flanges and bolts, and appear to be part of an infrastructure project, perhaps for water or sewage.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is ongoing construction with various vertical and horizontal metallic and wooden beams forming a complex structural framework. There are also wooden walkways and platforms, suggesting active work areas and access points for workers. The entire setting is interspersed with construction materials, tools, wooden planks, and a bit of standing water, reflecting recent activity or work in progress.\n\nAdditionally, there are two structures that appear incomplete, surrounded by temporary frameworks for support, hinting at early stages of construction or foundational work. These may be part of buildings or facilities being erected on the site.\n\nThe environment indicates that the work is happening in an open, unconstructed area where the natural landscape consists primarily of sand, which underscores the challenges and preparations needed for such an undertaking. Overall, the photograph provides a detailed depiction of an active and extensive industrial construction project on a scale that impacts the landscape profoundly.","title":"Part of Georgia Pacific milling operation at Isthmus Slough","placename":"Coos Bay (Or.)","location":"Coos Bay, Oregon","nn1":["544167","547235","546833","553391","545648","548431","553383","545631","547259","548559","545858","549169","549640","547926","548775","550274"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","pipeline","crane","work","project","framework","sand","lifting","bolt","site"]}
