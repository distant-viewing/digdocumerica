{"path":"554646.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene featuring a group of birds in flight across an evening sky. The birds, which appear as silhouettes due to the lighting, are aligned in a V-formation, a common pattern amongst migrating birds. This formation is both practical and energy-efficient for long-distance travel in avian species.\n\nThe background consists of a gradient sky shifting from purple at the top to a lighter blue near the bottom, suggesting either sunrise or sunset. There are no clouds visible in the sky, which enhances the visibility and focus on the birds. The simplicity of the composition—just the birds against the expanse of the sky—evokes a sense of freedom and the natural world. The photograph does not include any other discernible objects or activities; it is an example of nature-focused imagery, highlighting the beauty of avian movement against a dramatically colored sky.","title":"Canadian geese flying in formation above Ausable Lake, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557203","553875","550382","544609","557209","544605","550887","550888","550889","544597","544601","544834","557208","555013","544612","550903"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","v","formation","example","imagery","freedom","flight","sunrise","specie","world"]}
