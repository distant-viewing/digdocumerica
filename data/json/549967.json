{"path":"549967.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene, likely a steel mill, under a hazy or smoggy sky. The image features multiple industrial buildings and structures, primarily in a deep red or rust color. Prominent in the scene are several tall smokestacks emitting white and gray smoke into the air, contributing to the haze.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, there's a large multi-story industrial building with several smokestacks attached, and additional structures that appear to be part of the operational facilities of the mill. Moving towards the center and right of the image, you can see a series of interconnected metal frameworks, which likely support conveyor belts or similar mechanisms for transporting materials. There are multiple crane-like structures throughout the scene.\n\nIn the front left corner, there is an asphalt road leading to a parking lot filled with cars, indicating the presence of workers or visitors to the facilities. Above the horizon, the sky is a dull gray hinting at pollution.\n\nOverall, the composition portrays a busy, functioning industrial area with significant smoke emissions, underlining the environmental impact of such industries. The photograph likely intends to document or highlight aspects of industrial operations and environmental conditions associated with this type of facility.","title":"U.S. Steel Fairless Works on the Delaware River","placename":"Bucks County (Pa.)","location":"Bucks County, Pennsylvania","nn1":["546884","550195","545445","547010","545507","550344","546908","549966","557215","557218","550328","542999","550982","545447","553891","545434"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Industrial Facilities"],"terms":["mill","facility","smokestack","smoke","asphalt","conveyor","mechanism","emission","belt","rust"]}
