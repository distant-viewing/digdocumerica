{"path":"544910.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures the stunning geological formations of what appears to be Bryce Canyon National Park, noted for its unique hoodoo structures. The image is dominated by a foreground of intricate, tall, red rock spires and columns that exhibit a rugged, eroded texture. These formations are characterized by their sharp edges and pinnacles, which are typical of hoodoos formed through the processes of frost weathering and stream erosion.\n\nIn the background, contrasting with the vivid red rocks, is a dense, green pine forest that blankets the rolling hills stretching into the distance. The forest provides a lush backdrop to the arid, rocky formations in the foreground, illustrating a beautiful contrast of natural textures and colors. The sky above is clear and bright, casting ample light that enhances the vividness of the rock formations and the forest's greenery.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes nature's artistry, blending rough, dramatic rock structures with the serene beauty of a wooded landscape, set under a clear, sunny sky.","title":"Rock spires are sculptured by erosion and are red-hued by the presence of iron oxide.","placename":"Bryce Canyon (Utah)","location":"Bryce Canyon, Utah","nn1":["545791","545803","544397","545797","544429","544950","543125","545754","545799","544745","545805","545750","544935","558083","545601","545566"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["formation","rock","forest","artistry","frost","spire","pine","weathering","vividness","stream"]}
