{"path":"555385.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a picturesque, yet somewhat stark, lakeside scene. In the foreground, there's a prominently positioned sign with two overlapping boards. The upper board is painted red and reads \"NO SKIING\" in white capital letters. Below it, a green slanted board reads \"KEEP OFF\" in white letters, suggesting some restrictions on activity in the area. These signs are anchored to the ground, amidst rubble and patches of dried earth, indicative of a possibly drought-affected area or a seasonally receding waterline.\n\nIn the middle ground, scattered remnants of infrastructure, possibly buoys and barrier-like floating devices, can be seen on the drying, cracked surface leading into the water. Several small, basic structures or shacks are visible near the water's edge. The lake itself is tranquil, reflecting the blue sky above.\n\nThe background is dominated by a panoramic view of mountain ranges with slopes that display different shades of green, possibly due to variable vegetation or the angle of sun exposure. The sky is remarkably clear and features only a few small dispersed clouds, contributing to the serene, yet arid atmosphere captured in the image. This seems to suggest a remote or less frequented area, underlined by the lack of human presence in the scene.","title":"Detroit Lake shown at an all-time low in the fall of 1973 due to sparse snowfall and rain the year before.
