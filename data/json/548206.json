{"path":"548206.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph shows a pollution control scene, likely taken to showcase environmental impacts. Featured prominently in the image is a spillway or concrete channel covered partially by dark, murky water and surrounded by rocky terrain. This channel slopes downwards toward a metal grate that prevents larger debris from passing through.\n\nIn the foreground are pools of foamy, polluted water, suggesting the mixture of water with some chemical substances or pollutants, resulting in the white foam. This water surrounds various large, irregularly shaped rocks, suggesting a rugged, natural environment outside the manmade channel. \n\nThe colors in the photograph are a mix of the dark reflective surfaces of the water, the gray tones of the dried areas and concrete structures, and the stark white of the foamy pollutants, highlighting the contrast between natural elements and pollution.\n\nThe background is minimal, focusing entirely on the environmental aspect of the scene without any distinct structures or skyline, emphasizing the starkness and the environmental theme of the image.","title":"Detergent waste froths up in passage to the Columbia River from sluice near the interstate bridge at vancouver","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550371","549624","544779","545168","543819","548090","550193","544775","552069","546116","550369","550708","546793","550959","547614","552989"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["channel","pollutant","pollution","spillway","starkness","prevent","water","result","substance","pass"]}
