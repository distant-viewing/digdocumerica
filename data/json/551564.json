{"path":"551564.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a large body of water with distinct and interesting visual features. The most prominent aspects are the long, straight white lines created by the wakes of boats. These lines cut across the water, offering a sharp contrast to the dark, muddy color of the water itself. There are four of these wake lines in the body of water, each likely created by a boat, although the boats themselves are not very distinct in the image.\n\nThe water has a brownish-red hue, which may suggest it contains a significant amount of sediment or that it is affected by algae bloom. The image captures part of the shore, visible on the right side, which appears rugged and somewhat arid, characteristic of sandy or rocky coastlines found in certain geographical regions.\n\nThe aerial perspective is further emphasized by part of an airplane's structure visible in the top left corner, which provides a sense of scale and context to the viewer, indicating that the photograph was taken from inside or close to an airplane.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo, with its mix of natural and man-made elements, provides a dynamic view of human interaction with a large aquatic environment, highlighting movement and the expansive, textured surface of the water.","title":"Clay washed from the banks of the Nemadji River gives brownish orange color to the waters of Superior Harbor basin. Darker color near docks comes from spillage occurring when iron ore is loaded on ships at Burlington Northern Railroad docks.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552166","555701","547674","546945","552269","552921","551991","552922","550638","544142","542697","552192","555810","547685","545904","549504"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["airplane","wake","boat","water","algae","line","affect","sediment","bloom","amount"]}
