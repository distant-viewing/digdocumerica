{"path":"558323.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of an elderly woman engaged in the painstaking activity of crocheting. The woman, likely in her 70s or 80s, has short, curly gray hair and is wearing black-rimmed glasses. Her facial expression is focused and intent on her work. She is working with a large crochet needle and a light-colored yarn, crafting what appears to be a patterned blanket or a large piece of fabric.\n\nThe woman is wearing a blue, patterned top that has green and lighter blue florals. The intricacy of her work and the fine detail of the crochet pattern are evident, reflecting skill and dedication to her craft.\n\nHer skin is light, showing signs of aging such as wrinkles and aged spots, which add to the authenticity and heartfelt nature of the scene. She wears a simple ring on one of her left fingers, possibly indicating her marital status. The background of the photograph is indistinct, mostly dark, which helps to focus all attention on the woman and her crochet work.\n\nThe composition is predominantly filled with warm tones from her skin and the yarn, making the overall feel of the image cozy and inviting. The focused lighting highlights her hands and the crochet work, emphasizing the craftsmanship involved in the activity.","title":"Older citizens, retired persons and those unable to care for themselves physically are cared for in two community centers.
