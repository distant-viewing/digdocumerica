{"path":"549041.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene focused on a rough grave marked by rocks and wooden crosses. The grave is an elongated mound mostly covered with scattered stones, located within a fenced enclosure. The ground surrounding the grave is sandy and barren, with no visible vegetation. \n\nTwo simple wooden crosses mark the site. The cross at the front is plain, standing upright on the mound. Another elaborately decorated cross, painted in black with white detailing suggesting some form of inscription or decoration, stands near the head of the grave. \n\nA wooden fence surrounds the grave, apparent on three sides of the image, providing a stark contrast to the desolate setting. The fence is composed mostly of rugged metal or wooden poles and horizontal bars, creating a squared enclosure. \n\nIn the background beyond the fence, the environment is flat and arid, giving the impression of a desert landscape. Sparse low vegetation and a distant horizon under a clear blue sky enhance the sense of isolation and remoteness of the setting.","title":"Glamis Cemetery, a desert graveyard in the Imperial Valley dates back to 1878 and has been declared an historical landmark.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["545322","545314","545826","545811","552683","544267","546106","555566","547417","552451","557942","546147","550364","554824","550731","544259"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["grave","fence","enclosure","mound","cross","inscription","remoteness","mark","black","bar"]}
