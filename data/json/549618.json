{"path":"549618.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photo features a large ship captured from a close angle. The ship, which is painted in a faded red color, has a small number \"10\" visible on its hull and shows significant wear and rusting, suggesting it's an older or heavily used vessel. From one side of the ship, a male figure, wearing an orange work suit, can be seen handling a hoist mechanism that extends from the ship into the water. Suspended from this hoist is a metallic frame possibly for sampling or measuring, which holds various scientific or industrial instruments. The figure stands on a lower part of the ship and reaches towards the hoisting equipment, actively engaged in an operation to either deploy or retrieve the frame from the ocean. The background shows the open sea, mildly agitated, under an overcast sky, hinting at an isolated or remote location. The overall scene is framed within a darkened border, giving it the appearance of a slide from a projector.","title":"The \"Martin Karlsen,\" a Canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical, biological and meteorological conditions in Lake Superior. Such complete study of fresh water is called limnology. Limnologist washes down sides of plankton net into collector cup from which the zooplankton and phytoplankton can be counted and analyzed.","placename":"Superior, Lake","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546040","549586","549617","549590","549597","549589","546012","549603","549594","555828","544234","552148","551046","549591","550891","550897"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["ship","sampling","slide","figure","mechanism","instrument","border","hull","suit","vessel"]}
