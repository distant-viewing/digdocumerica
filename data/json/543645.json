{"path":"543645.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a vividly colored warning sign attached to a chain-link fence. The sign is yellow with bold black text and a magenta-colored symbol of a radiological hazard (three interlocked circles forming a trefoil) on the top right corner. It reads: \"CAUTION RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL ANY AREA OR CONTAINER WITHIN THIS MILL MAY CONTAIN RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL.\"\n\nBehind the fence, an industrial setting is visible. There are large, gray industrial buildings with metallic structures and several vehicles parked in an area that appears to be a loading or unloading zone. The sky above is slightly cloudy, hinting at overcast weather conditions. The focus and framing emphasize the warning sign, using it as a stark foreground element against the industrial backdrop, highlighting the potential dangers associated with the site.","title":"Warning sign at Union Carbide uranium mill","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["548951","548865","549357","546240","557412","557474","549129","553905","544227","552212","546936","556617","550272","542566","547046","555858"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["warning","fence","hazard","danger","sign","circle","unloading","link","loading","mill"]}
