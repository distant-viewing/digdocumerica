{"path":"550419.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph presents a dramatic aerial perspective of a mountainous landscape, presumably taken from a high altitude. The landscape is predominantly covered in snow, suggesting a winter or high-altitude environment. The foreground of the image displays a glacier with notable crevasses and ice patterns that have a rugged texture, giving a sense of movement as the glacier flows down from the upper regions.\n\nIn the middle ground, the mountains' slopes are steep and are also covered with snow, but their formations and contours are more distinct. Clear lines where the snowpack meets rocky surfaces can be seen. The mountains stretch into the background where they become larger and more expansive, illustrating the vastness of the range. The peaks are smoother here, with broad, snow-covered surfaces that catch the light, enhancing the contrast against the darker valleys.\n\nThe overall color palette consists of whites and various shades of gray and dark tones, indicative of the rocks and shadows cast in the deep crevices. There appears to be a subtle hint of blue, likely due to the ice and atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe landscape is devoid of visible vegetation or wildlife, emphasizing the barren, cold, and rugged nature of high-altitude environments. The overall composition of the photo, with its deep perspective and the layering of the terrain, conveys a sense of the imposing scale and untouched wilderness of the region. The photograph lacks any human presence or man-made structures, highlighting the pristine and remote character of this mountainous area.","title":"Four miles east of the pipeline crossing of the Atigun River near the mouth of the Atigun Gorge.
