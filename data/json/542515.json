{"path":"542515.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image shows an aerial view of a large, industrial logging or mining complex surrounded by a dense forest. The area is subdivided by multiple dirt roads. The central part of the image features large open spaces with piles of logs, several buildings of various sizes, and some vehicles. To the left, there is a noticeable large, clear area potentially used for storage or processing activities, indicated by the neatly arranged piles of material, possibly wood.\n\nIn the surrounding area, numerous smaller structures, possibly for residential use or smaller operational buildings, are scattered among the trees. There appear to be some ongoing operations, as suggested by traces of smoke or dust in a few areas, particularly towards the left side of the photo.\n\nThe backdrop displays a thick forest, indicating that the complex is set in a remote, wooded region. The layout suggests a well-established facility, possibly for logging given the presence of timber and associated infrastructure. The setting is isolated and predominantly green due to the extensive forest cover, emphasizing the industrial activity's impact on the landscape.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["556925","545011","550563","550572","542940","542942","542945","556980","544438","556922","542824","552198","551579","551578","556913","551204"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["forest","complex","pile","trace","timber","logging","dust","cover","log","layout"]}
