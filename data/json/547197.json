{"path":"547197.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene with several activities and natural elements. The setting is a grassy park area leading to a sandy beach and an expansive body of water. In the background, waves gently lap against the shore, with a clear blue sky overhead.\n\nOn the left side of the image, one young man rides a unicycle along a paved path that divides the grassy area from the beach. He wears casual clothes and maintains a focused expression while balancing.\n\nIn the center and to the right, there are two young women engaging in playful activity around a tall, vertical pole. One woman swings enthusiastically from a rope attached to the pole, wearing casual attire and sneakers. Her hair swings out as she seems to enjoy the motion, and she looks out towards the unicyclist. The other woman, standing and smiling, holds the rope, steadying or pushing her friend.\n\nA small, dark-colored dog lies on the grass, near the women, seemingly resting and unbothered by the activities around it.\n\nOverall, the image evokes a sense of leisurely enjoyment and youthful energy in a scenic park setting by the water. The presence of these individuals in casual attire and engaging in light recreational activities contributes to a relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere.","title":"Rogers park, on lake Michigan shore","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551545","550228","552033","555947","553065","543998","551017","552952","551543","543395","547756","545218","545929","543463","554669","546075"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["swing","woman","rope","steady","beach","pole","sneaker","lap","push","friend"]}
