{"path":"550286.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph showcases the interior of a grand, historic arcade or mall. The elegant structure features an ornate, two-level design with a glass atrium ceiling, letting in diffused natural light that softly illuminates the space.\n\nThe architecture is notably Victorian, with decorative metal railings, intricate balustrades, and classical detailing adorning the columns and archways. The floor is laid with patterned tiles that add to the overall opulence.\n\nThe ground level and the upper galleries are lined with various shops and boutiques, displaying signs for businesses such as \"Old Mill,\" \"Foot Specialist\", and places offering cruise tickets. Each store front has its unique fa√ßade and styling, which adds to the eclectic aesthetics of the space.\n\nIn the middle, running from one end to the other, is an open walkway bustling with people. Several pedestrians are visible; their attire suggests the photo might have been taken in the 1970s or 1980s, judging from the fashion styles such as wide-leg pants, casual shirts, and light summer dresses. \n\nAbove, a large American flag hangs vertically, anchored from the top of the atrium, adding a patriotic touch to the setting.\n\nThe atmosphere appears to be calm and leisurely, with people either strolling leisurely, pausing to look at shop windows, or conversing lightly among themselves. It captures a moment in time, providing a glimpse into daily life within a sophisticated urban setting.","title":"The Arcade--enclosed shopping area in downtown Cleveland","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550294","550290","556069","556679","556825","556067","549643","549974","556828","551786","546428","557635","556680","558118","556276","546440"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["shop","balustrade","level","let","styling","ticket","cruise","archway","stroll","tile"]}
