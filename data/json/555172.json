{"path":"555172.jpg","date":"September 1970","photographer":"","caption":"This image presents a magnified, microscopic view of a structure which appears to be organic in nature, possibly cells or tissue under polarized light microscopy. The pattern shown is highly structured with repetitive, alternating shapes that resemble rectangles and squares. The rectangles are primarily vertically oriented and appear in rows. Each rectangular cell-like structure is framed with yellow and orange hues, giving them an illuminated look, while the center of these shapes have shades of blue and deep purple, creating a stark contrast.\n\nThe hues and the contrasts likely arise from the polarization of light which can make structures in biological samples, such as crystals or fibers, appear brightly colored. There is no visible background as the entire frame is filled with this microscopic pattern, emphasizing the intricate details and the vivid coloration caused by this specific microscopy technique. The overall effect is both scientific and artistic, highlighting the beauty that can be found in scientific imaging.","title":"Magnification of Douglas fir annual growth rings.
