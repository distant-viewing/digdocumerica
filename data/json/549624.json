{"path":"549624.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"McAllister, Bruce","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental scene, likely a polluted body of water filled with foam and pollutants. In the foreground, the water is covered with thick white and murky foam, showcasing swirling patterns of contamination. In the background, there is a concrete structure, possibly part of a water treatment facility, dam, or overflow area, with some large mechanical equipment or electrical units mounted on top, and surrounded by a metal fence. Also visible are sparse, dry vegetation and shrubs on the banks of the water body, contributing to a somewhat barren and neglected look of the area. The overall setting suggests a polluted industrial or semi-industrial outdoor landscape under a bright sky.","title":"Point where Denver Metro sewage treatment plant discharges into the South Platte River","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["544779","552989","550371","544775","545168","550193","544689","545119","550206","548206","550369","545164","551562","552019","545312","550708"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["foam","contamination","pollutant","treatment","dam","water","unit","bank","look","fence"]}
