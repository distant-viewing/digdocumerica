{"path":"554935.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a serene pastoral scene showcasing several sheep and a dog in an outdoor setting. The sheep are of varying sizes, with thick and curly wool coats, highlighted by the warm sunlight giving their fleece a bright, glowing appearance. Most of the sheep are positioned side-on to the camera, while one faces towards the viewer in the foreground, grazing on the ground. \n\nA small, alert dog, possibly a Jack Russell Terrier, stands centrally among the sheep. The dog, primarily white with dark patches, looks directly towards the camera, giving it a guard-like presence amidst the flock. Its stance is attentive and poised, contrasting with the calm and unbothered demeanor of the sheep.\n\nThe environment around the animals is lush and green, dappled with sunlight which streams through the surrounding trees, creating areas of light and shadow across the grassy terrain. The background features a dense assembly of trees, casting deep shadows and providing a natural, woody backdrop. The overall composition pairs the rustic charm of the sheep with the vigilant posture of the dog, set against the tranquil woodland area, encapsulating a moment of peaceful coexistence in the countryside.","title":"Angora goats guarded by a watchdog on a farm near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554932","554928","555820","554779","554887","552555","552556","543269","544391","544933","554890","550450","557747","554891","554888","544384"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["sheep","dog","guard","wool","flock","assembly","countryside","stance","camera","sunlight"]}
