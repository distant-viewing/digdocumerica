{"path":"542653.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape during what appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, given the soft light. The scene is dominated by a winding river that flows through a lush environment. The river reflects the clear blue sky, creating an impression of tranquility.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a large area of dried golden grass, punctuated by a couple of small trees and shrubs. This dry vegetation contrasts with the greener, denser foliage that lines the banks of the river. The riverbanks are densely packed with a variety of trees and bushy vegetation, suggesting a thriving ecosystem.\n\nIn the background, gentle hills rise under a sky lightly dotted with clouds. The hills seem covered in a mixture of greenery and spots of brown, possibly indicating different types of vegetation or the impact of seasonal changes. The landscape is open and expansive, giving a sense of peaceful isolation from urban environments.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its rich natural colors and contrasting textures, provides a picturesque view of a tranquil river setting, inviting the viewer to appreciate the quiet and beauty of this natural scene. No human presence is visible, highlighting the undisturbed quality of the area.","title":"About ten miles below Pine Flat Dam","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["550656","557106","550839","550782","550433","550845","555575","554762","550560","552318","544861","550700","557095","543793","545861","552599"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","appreciate","vegetation","hill","punctuate","dry","mixture","ecosystem","change","riverbank"]}
