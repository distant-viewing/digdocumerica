{"path":"557846.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a person viewed through a window with raindrops scattered across the glass, offering an artistic, slightly obscured view. The subject, likely female based on the silhouette, is holding a camera up to their eye, ostensibly taking a photograph of the viewer. The scene takes place during twilight or evening, as suggested by the muted blue and dark tones of the sky and ambient light.\n\nThe window frames the subject into three vertical sections thanks to the window's muntins. These frames intersect the image symmetrically, adding a structured composition to the photo. The pane with the most focus features numerous speckles of raindrops, adding texture and a tactile quality to the image.\n\nIn the blurred background outside the window, a residential area is faintly visible with silhouettes of houses, signaling that this photo might have been taken from inside another building, possibly from an opposing house. The overall mood of the photograph is contemplative and somewhat mysterious, emphasizing themes of observation and the intersection between interior and exterior spaces.","title":"Public works department employees at the Norwood, Ohio auto emission inspection station keep the building clean.  Each evening windows are washed, the safety lane is swept and dusted and the yellow pavement markings are washed.  All light duty spark ignition powered motor vehicles in the city must be tested annually for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions officials hope to have 74 percent of the vehicles tested in Norwood and Cincinnati by the end of the year","placename":"Norwood (Ohio)","location":"Norwood, Ohio","nn1":["543028","548232","553592","548072","552745","542802","556228","553554","544437","549983","553188","556738","542981","549285","557333","542766"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["window","subject","female","silhouette","pane","house","speckle","take","signal","observation"]}
