{"path":"546998.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and bustling harbor scene, likely taken during the late afternoon or early evening, given the soft, dim lighting and long shadows cast across the scene. The image prominently features a wooden pier stretching from the foreground into the middle ground, flanked on either side by the harbor waters. On the right side of the pier, several large fishing boats are moored, characterized by their tall masts and booms, which suggest they are equipped for commercial fishing activities. These boats, varying slightly in design and size, add an industrial feel to the scene.\n\nTo the left of the pier and closer to the shore, a smaller motorboat is angled towards the muddy bank, where several children are playing in the water. This adds a lively and playful contrast to the otherwise calm and orderly setting of the docked fishing vessels.\n\nThe background is framed by trees, which partially obscure the sky but allow dapples of sunlight to reflect off the water, enhancing the overall tranquil and golden hue of the scene. The environment suggests this is an estuarine or coastal area, likely a community where fishing plays a significant role in local life. The water is calm, indicating fair weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition beautifully juxtaposes the working elements of the fishing industry with the leisurely activities of daily life, encapsulated in a tranquil maritime environment.","title":"Shrimp boats belonging to a black-owned cooperative on hilton head","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["542872","547004","547565","542907","542905","548235","548249","547549","542877","548228","548078","548247","543035","546939","548229","547561"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["fishing","pier","harbor","play","dapple","boom","motorboat","boat","mast","water"]}
