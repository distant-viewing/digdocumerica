{"path":"548980.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a line of five vintage trucks parked on a flat, open field. The trucks are arranged in a diagonal line, receding into the distance. Each truck is similar in design, featuring a classic rectangular body style typical of a mid-20th-century model, with rounded fronts and prominent grilles adorned with chrome accents and circular headlights. The first truck is colored in shades of white and red, while the subsequent trucks appear to adhere to a similar color scheme, possibly with varying shades.\n\nThe trucks have canvas-covered cargo areas, suggesting that they could be used for transporting agricultural products or other goods. The terrain is flat and appears to be either a dry field or a dirt area, hinting at a rural or agricultural setting. The sky is clear and blue, indicating fair weather conditions, which contributes to the overall calm and orderly atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the scene depicted is one of readiness or pause in transportation or logistics, possibly related to agricultural activity. The image evokes a sense of rural industry and the vehicles' style dates the photo back to the mid-20th century, reflecting the aesthetic and technology of that era in truck design.","title":"These trucks will be loaded with barley grown in the Imperial Valley.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549775","552077","554879","544061","558254","544370","556714","552800","555505","548275","553896","555875","544767","552673","555817","546177"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["truck","canvas","grille","readiness","century","logistic","headlight","pause","field","chrome"]}
