{"path":"548504.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene, likely from the 1970s judging by the style of the clothing and the models of cars visible. The setting is an urban environment featuring a street corner with Neptune Rd sign visible at the top left. The architecture includes a mix of residential and possibly commercial buildings. A prominent building under construction with exposed beams and hollow, windowless openings is in the background, contrasting with the more traditional wood panel structures adjacent to it.\n\nIn the foreground, two young women are walking towards the camera. The woman on the left is wearing a white jacket, light pink pants, and sneakers, with her long hair down and parted in the middle. The woman on the right has curly hair, donning a dark jacket and flared blue jeans. Both appear relaxed and are possibly conversing while walking. A younger boy is seen riding a bicycle, facing away from the camera, wearing a multi-colored jacket and jeans. The bicycle has a banana seat and high handlebars, typical of that era.\n\nThe street itself is lined with various vehiclesâ€”a mix of cars from the 1960s and 70s, reflecting the period's typical American road scene. There is also a small truck visible further down the street. The photograph has a clear, colorful quality, with crisp lighting that highlights the vibrant daily life of this community during what appears to be a sunny day. The overall mood captures a slice of daily life and the casual interactions of an urban neighborhood of the past.","title":"Building under construction, off neptune road, will be used by food preparation company that services airlines","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["551124","552411","551084","545231","548399","550142","557705","548369","546626","556221","549882","556225","556224","556808","556715","549872"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["street","bicycle","jacket","jeans","woman","donn","hollow","flar","handlebar","exposed"]}
