{"path":"553026.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts a man giving a presentation or lecture, standing next to a large poster mounted on an easel. The poster features a detailed diagram of a pollution control scrubbing system for a utility service, specifically describing the units 1, 2, and 3 at a location named Four Corners in New Mexico. The system is noted as having been designed, engineered, and constructed by Chemical Construction Corporation.\n\nThe man addressing appears to be middle-aged and is wearing glasses. He has dark, combed-back hair and is neatly dressed in a button-down shirt with a tie and trousers, complemented by a tie clip and a bolo tie adorned with what seems to be a Native American style emblem, possibly indicating a personal or regional connection. He is gesturing with his right hand, likely explaining a point related to the content of the diagram.\n\nThe background shows a plain wall with light-colored brick or tiles, and part of a roller blind (or pull-down screen) can be seen hanging on the left side of the image. The lighting in the room is artificial, from ceiling lamps that reflect mildly on the poster, adding to the indoor ambiance. The overall setup implies an educational or professional setting, possibly a seminar room or a company facility where technical information is being shared.","title":"Exhibit of pollution control systems at Four Corners power plant.
