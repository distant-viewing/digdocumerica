{"path":"546437.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph depicts a picturesque scene of daily life at a residential property. The main focus is on an elderly woman who is engaged in the activity of sweeping the yard with a broom. She is dressed in a traditional, floral-patterned dress and appears focused on her task.\n\nThe background features a two-story house distinguished by its contrast in architectural elements and colors. One part of the house is finished in white clapboard siding, while the adjoining section has a dark red brick facade. Prominently displayed between these two sections is an ornamental star placed within a decorative square tile, adding a distinct aesthetic to the building. The house also shows features like multiple windows, some of which are open, and intricate trim details around the roof and gables.\n\nAbove the house and partially obscuring it, there are branches from nearby trees, suggesting a lush, green environment. The roofing material of the house appears to be slate or a similar dark-shaded material that contrasts with the lighter walls. The whole scene conveys a serene suburban atmosphere with a touch of historical charm, highlighted by the traditional decoration on the building and the simple but peaceful activity of the woman tending to her yard.","title":"Woman sweeping her lawn.
