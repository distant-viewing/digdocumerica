{"path":"558345.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a young woman deeply engaged in the process of painting. She is positioned closely to the canvas, allowing a detailed view of her work and technique. The canvas reveals an image of a surfer in silhouette against a vividly colored background of blues and yellows, suggesting a dynamic seascape.\n\nThe woman has blonde hair tied back neatly, with some of it braided and covered by a golden crochet hairnet or cap, emphasizing a sense of casual creativity. She wears wire-framed glasses, and her focus is directed intently on her painting, highlighted by the precise placement of her brush on the canvas.\n\nShe holds a small, round artist’s palette in her left hand, which is filled with blobs of paint in various colors, predominantly blues and yellows, mirroring the colors employed in her painting. The strokes and style suggest a blend of realism and impressionism, focused on capturing the motion and essence of the surfing figure.\n\nIn the surroundings, there is a hint of other artworks, possibly her previous works or inspirations, pinned or stored beside her, although these are largely out of focus, keeping the viewer’s attention on the woman and her current creation. The environment suggests a small, personal studio space where she conducts her artistic explorations. Overall, the image exudes a serene yet concentrated atmosphere of artistic endeavor.","title":"Student in one of the art and painting classes taught by Otto Pfeiffer in New Ulm, Minnesota.
