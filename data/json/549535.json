{"path":"549535.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene at a large waterfall, likely Niagara Falls given the context of the scene. The image is set in a parklike environment and shows groups of visitors enjoying the spectacular natural view.\n\nForeground: The lower part of the photo includes the backs of two people, possibly observing the scene or in conversation. In front of them is an expanse of lush green grass divided by paved paths. Stone steps are leading down towards the water, and the pathways are rich with visitors strolling or standing around.\n\nMiddle Ground: The focal point of this middle area is a large crowd of tourists gathered on a paved promenade running along the waterfront. This area is bustling with people, all facing or moving towards the falls to get a better view. Various ages and dress styles suggest this photo captures a popular tourist spot during a pleasant day.\n\nBackground: Dominating the background is the expansive and misty waterfall. On the left side, the waterfall is visibly cascading down with a strong flow, generating a lot of spray and mist rising into the air. This creates a slightly foggy but dramatic backdrop. The right side shows a lighter gushing waterfall, and the whole scene is bordered by dense green trees and standard flag poles adding a patriotic flair to the setting.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively and filled with natural beauty, making this a picturesque representation of a popular tourist attraction enjoyed in a serenely landscaped environment.","title":"Tourists at park on Goat Island enjoy a spectacular view of \"Horseshoe Falls,\" the Canadian half of Niagara Falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549536","549563","549534","549537","549546","549530","549557","549466","549467","549549","549562","549560","549545","549558","549544","549554"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Crowds"],"terms":["waterfall","tourist","visitor","flair","attraction","representation","spray","fall","step","crowd"]}
