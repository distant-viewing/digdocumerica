{"path":"548604.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This image appears to be an aerial photograph of a coastal landscape, showing a string of peninsulas and small islands. The photograph captures the convergence of land and sea, where water, beach, and vegetation interact.\n\nIn the foreground, a narrow strip of land curves gracefully, bordered on one side by a sandy beach and on the other by dense green vegetation. This vegetation appears lush and is likely composed of bushes and low trees typical of coastal areas. The sand on the beach is light in color, creating a stark contrast with the greenery and the shades of blue and green in the water.\n\nBeyond the immediate landmass, the water body encompasses several small islands scattered across the view. These islands vary in size and shape but are generally covered with similar dense and green vegetation. There are no visible human constructions or activities; the scenery is entirely natural.\n\nThe water itself shows a range of colors, from deep blues to lighter greens, suggesting varying depths and possibly different seabed compositions. This color gradation enhances the visual texture of the photograph.\n\nThe sky, visible at the upper edge of the photograph, is a hazy blue, suggesting either a slight overcast day or the effect of aerial haze.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a serene, untouched natural environment typical of a protected coastal ecosystem, possibly a national park or a remote area not easily accessible. The absence of any human activity or development suggests that this area is preserved for its ecological value.","title":"One of the uninhabited islands between the southern coast and the Florida Key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548785","554022","547637","554156","554171","552922","554170","550358","548787","554023","557466","554018","553983","554020","556982","554024"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["island","beach","vegetation","value","string","gradation","peninsula","landmass","blue","land"]}
