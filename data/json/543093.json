{"path":"543093.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image captures a dynamic and blurred scene, likely portraying motion. In the foreground, a woman is visible riding a tire swingâ€”her motion is indicated by the blurred lines and activity around her. The woman is wearing a bright red jacket, which adds a splash of vibrant color to the image. Her hair appears to be blonde, and it flows with the movement of the swing.\n\nThe setting evokes the feel of a park or a similarly open space, emphasized by the stretches of green grass, which also appear blurred, indicating the speed of the swing or the camera's movement during the shot. The background is less distinct but lends an impression of being outdoors with ample natural light.\n\nThis photograph captures a moment of playfulness and motion, using motion blur as a visual effect to emphasize speed and movement, conveying a sense of freedom and abandon.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["551498","553437","546562","553908","550830","544336","550829","547278","551530","547192","557410","547188","555934","551303","553438","556290"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["swing","motion","speed","movement","playfulness","blur","freedom","woman","tire","ride"]}
