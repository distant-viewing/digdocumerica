{"path":"544448.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene suburban or rural landscape featuring two houses set amidst a rocky and verdant terrain. In the foreground, there is a modern building constructed primarily of wood, featuring a prominent triangular geometric roof line that extends over the building's entrance. The facade of the building is covered with horizontal wooden slats, and it includes elements like a small window and a chimney. A stone pathway leads up to or from the building, connecting it with other areas not fully visible in the frame.\n\nBehind this building on a higher elevation stands another house, which appears to be larger and constructed with a combination of materials including bricks or stones and wood. It is a long structure with various sections and annexes that extend back into the landscape, suggesting considerable depth. The house features a series of windows and a large covered porch supported by visible pillars. The roof of this house is flatter as compared to the sharply angled roof of the wooden structure in the foreground.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is rocky and hilly, adorned with a variety of trees and shrubs. Several small grassy areas and pathways enhance the natural and rugged character of the setting. The sky above is partly cloudy, indicating a bright day with substantial natural light enhancing the greenery and architectural features. This tranquil setting conveys a sense of privacy and integration with the natural environment.","title":"Houses at Lakeway development on Lake Travis","placename":"Travis, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Travis, Lake, Texas","nn1":["556959","557669","557326","556433","552986","556426","556423","557094","557750","548295","556472","543587","549279","543526","550704","557547"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","pathway","roof","construct","stone","slat","building","wood","privacy","integration"]}
