{"path":"548454.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures an interior scene featuring an elderly man in a domestic setting. The man, who has white hair and is dressed in light-colored slacks and a short-sleeved shirt, is standing near a window, looking downwards towards a heating unit under the window.\n\nThe room has a nostalgic feel, emphasized by wood paneling on the walls and a heavy use of dark brown and wooden tones. To the left of the picture, there is a black leather armchair with a tufted backrest, positioned next to a small end table that hosts a couple of books and a white cloth, possibly a tablecloth or napkin. \n\nA pair of yellow curtains hangs on either side of the window, parted in the middle to reveal a bright daylight scene outside that's not detailed in the shot. A white roller blind partially covers the window. On the window sill, there's a potted plant in a dark vase, adding a touch of greenery to the scene.\n\nIn terms of decor, there is a small, framed picture of a young man hanging on the wall to the left, and a metal cross mounted on the wall to the right of the window, suggesting a personal and possibly religious significance to the inhabitants. The overall composition gives a glimpse into a lived-in space with personal touches and a semblance of quiet daily life.","title":"Bernard Picarello in the soundproofed den of his home at 112 Moore Street.
