{"path":"546754.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph depicts an outdoor natural scene featuring an intriguing, sinuous stone structure extending into a calm body of water, likely a pond or a river. This stone structure is mossy, suggesting age and exposure to the elements, and its uneven, bulbous surface is studded with large, rounded stones that vary in size and are embedded within the structure itself. \n\nIt has a serpentine shape, bending and twisting as it follows its path into the water, with one end emerging from the shore and the other submerged under the reflective surface of the water. The water itself is dark and mirrors the silhouette of bare tree branches, which are part of the surrounding vegetation, mostly in autumnal or winter decay with lots of dried leaves and some sparse foliage.\n\nThe setting is fairly secluded and natural, evoking a sense of tranquility and isolation. The light appears to be soft and possibly overcast, which enhances the moody, serene atmosphere of the scene. There are no people visible in the photograph, making the focus solely on the interplay of the elements and the quiet beauty of the scene.","title":"Stony run is dammed, temporarily, to contain oil spilled by Baltimore tank lines","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["542583","555008","557997","557251","554776","554603","546963","558086","547518","542526","555212","550750","555153","547526","550844","545008"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["stone","mossy","embed","emerge","water","dry","pond","follow","mirror","exposure"]}
