{"path":"546959.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"In the photograph, we see a vibrant and scenic golf course setting. There are several golfers and golf carts scattered across the wide-open, lush green landscape. The foreground shows a golfer in a yellow jacket standing next to a golf cart, seemingly in the middle of a shot or surveying the area. In the mid-ground, another golfer in red attire is standing, perhaps preparing for a shot, positioned near another golf cart. Just to the left, two individuals are visible near another cart, engaged in a discussion or observing the play.\n\nThe background integrates pockets of water and marshy areas, bordered by robust grassy reeds, which help to delineate the different sections of the golf course. Beyond the immediate vicinity of the golfing activity, a tree line can be seen that adds a natural frame to the course and the distant background softly blends into a gradient of greens and earth tones.\n\nThe composition of this image encapsulates a typical day on a golf course, emphasizing the sport's leisurely pace and its interaction with well-maintained natural landscapes. The players, carts, and layout of the course are distributed throughout the image, creating a balanced visual exploration from foreground to background.","title":"A golf course on hilton head island","placename":"Beaufort (S.C.)","location":"Beaufort, South Carolina","nn1":["543633","554149","548821","549069","554148","554492","552608","554167","557512","558098","545249","546513","547286","553980","543262","548823"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["golf","cart","course","shot","survey","delineate","player","pace","pocket","distribute"]}
