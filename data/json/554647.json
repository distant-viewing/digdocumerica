{"path":"554647.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking landscape, viewed possibly from a high vantage point within a structure. The foreground features rising clouds or mist over a forest, contributing to a serene and almost mystical atmosphere. The mist swirls over what appears to be a water body, reflecting and blurring parts of the nearby land and forest. The various shades of green and hints of autumn colors (like orange and yellow) in the trees suggest that the season is either late summer or early autumn.\n\nEnveloping the scene are rolling hills and mountains in the background that stretch across the horizon, adding depth and grandeur to the view. The sky overhead is a cool, clear blue, indicating early morning or late afternoon, with no visible sun.\n\nThe upper part of the photograph includes part of the roof or structure from which this scene is being viewed, indicated by a straight edge that cuts horizontally across the photo. This element adds a layer to the composition, affirming the viewer's presence within a building or on a deck, observing the natural splendor spread out before them.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is tranquil and reflective, characterized by the soft, diffused light and the expansive, quiet landscape. It invites contemplation and appreciation of the natural beauty and serene vistas typical of mountainous, wooded regions.","title":"Early morning mist over the midsection of Long Lake, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555536","548025","553825","550604","542848","557575","552695","554695","557519","542923","546764","555110","554402","550602","555131","545012"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["autumn","mist","appreciation","vista","forest","overhead","part","grandeur","contemplation","vantage"]}
