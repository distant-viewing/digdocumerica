{"path":"553856.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a wetland scene dominated by a mood of overcast skies and a saturated landscape. The foreground of the image is largely occupied by water pooled among dense clumps of lush green grass, indicative of a marshy area. The water reflects a slight ripple possibly due to a gentle breeze.\n\nAs the eye moves towards the middle ground, there's more aquatic vegetation and patches of water extend further back, suggesting a wide expanse of the wetland. The horizon is lined by a series of low-lying bushes and sparse trees, none of which are particularly tall, implying a flat landscape typical of wetland areas.\n\nThe sky, a significant component of the background, appears stormy with thick, dark clouds covering most of the view, hinting at an imminent rain or recent storm passing. This overcast condition contributes to the overall dark and saturated tones of the image, emphasizing a serene yet somber atmosphere.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or animals in this shot. The image focuses predominantly on the natural elements of the wetland ecosystem, capturing the tranquility and isolation of this environment. Overall, the photograph conveys a sense of quiet and raw natural beauty, typical of undisturbed wetland habitats.","title":"An everglades canal.  (from the sites exhibition.
