{"path":"555380.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a large billboard placed against a sky backdrop, with visible clouds hinting at either dawn or dusk due to the soft lighting. The billboard is primarily yellow, with bold black text that reads, \"There's a name for people who conserve energy. SMART.\" The text is split across two lines, with the word \"SMART\" notably larger and more emphasized than the rest.\n\nThe billboard is mounted on a sturdy metal framework, which is visible at the bottom, raising it well above the ground level. Scattered clouds in the sky provide a contrasting background to the stark yellow of the billboard. There aren't any visible distractions from the main subject, the billboard, making it the focal point of the image.\n\nThe context and message are clear, promoting energy conservation and labeling it as a smart choice, likely part of a wider public awareness or advertising campaign. The branding on the billboard indicates that it is facilitated by Foster and Kleiser, a company known historically for outdoor advertising.","title":"Billboard advising passing motorists of the seriousness of the energy shortage in Oregon during the fall of 1973.
