{"path":"554252.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a dynamic winter scene focused on a skier descending a snowy slope. The lighting is moody, possibly due to overcast weather or a setting sun, casting the entire scene in a blend of blue and purple hues.\n\nThe skier, wearing dark clothing, is actively engaged in skiing down what appears to be a steep part of the mountain or hill. The skier is in a bent posture typical of skiing, with poles angled backwards in motion, suggesting speed and control in navigating the slope. The skier's position and the spray of snow around the skis create a sense of movement and liveliness in the otherwise serene landscape.\n\nThe background features a softly lit sky with hints of brighter light, likely the sun, diffused by cloud cover or atmospheric conditions typical of snowy environments. The slope is sparsely populated with small trees or bushes, partially covered by snow, adding to the wintry feel of the image. There are indentations and variations in the snowâ€™s surface, presumably made by other skiers or natural elements, lending texture and depth to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its central focus on the action of skiing against a picturesque yet subdued winter backdrop, evokes a sense of isolation and exhilaration typical of winter sports in mountainous terrains.","title":"Skiing down an expert trail on Aspen Highlands Mountain expert trails tend to be steep, narrow and full of moguls.","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554292","554251","554236","550017","554253","550004","543377","554257","549989","554254","543384","554235","554255","554249","543507","554242"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["skier","winter","slope","snow","liveliness","skiing","sun","ski","spray","speed"]}
