{"path":"543595.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a serene natural landscape with a single bird perched prominently on the top branch of a pine tree in the foreground. The bird has a striking appearance with bright colors; its visible details suggest it could be a type of songbird. The pine tree is fuller at the top, with sparse branches further down, highlighting the bird as the main subject against the natural backdrop.\n\nThe background of the image includes layers of forest and mountains. These mountains, slightly blurred, have a soft blue and green hue, indicating some distance from the viewer, which adds depth to the scene. Below the mountain line, dense forested areas in various shades of dark green provide a rich texture to the landscape. There is no visible sky in the photo, focusing all attention on the natural elements and the bird itself.\n\nOverall, the composition uses natural lighting and a shallow depth of field to isolate the bird and the tree, drawing the viewer's eye directly to them against the vastness of the less focused, serene landscape. This creates a peaceful yet vibrant outdoor scene, emphasizing the beauty and tranquility of the natural world.","title":"Nevada -- South Lake Tahoe, California","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["551378","544547","547318","554601","548885","555010","557628","550471","553776","553777","544489","548832","554531","544601","552910","554099"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","mountain","branch","perch","pine","viewer","isolate","world","depth","vastness"]}
