{"path":"552197.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast log storage area where countless logs are spread out extensively across the frame. The logs are predominantly dark in color, possibly wet, and feature a range of sizes with freshly cut ends displaying lighter wood tones. The logs are arranged parallel to each other, creating a kind of organized chaos within what appears to be a body of water, possibly a log pond used in the logging industry to store and manage the timber before processing.\n\nIn the background, a dense forest of coniferous trees can be seen, underscoring the likely setting in a heavily wooded region. The time seems to be either dawn or dusk due to the low light and the slightly darkened sky in shades of blue and gray, giving the scene a serene yet industrious feeling. There is no visible human activity in the photograph, emphasizing the scale and the industrial nature of the logging operation against the backdrop of the natural forest environment. The capture of the log details and the surrounding nature conveys both the substantiality of logging operations and their impact on wooded environments.","title":"Cold deck log storage near olympia.
