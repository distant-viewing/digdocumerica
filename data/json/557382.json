{"path":"557382.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph portrays a vintage American street scene, featuring a market alongside various elements typical of an urban landscape from perhaps the 1960s or 1970s.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a small market named \"Pinion's Market,\" which is clearly indicated by the red and white signage. Advertisements for Coca-Cola, 7-Up, and other brands such as \"Daisy Soft\" are visible, representing typical marketing of that era. A mother and a child are seen walking towards or from a parked car, which appears to be a sedan from the period. Another woman is standing by the rear of the car, perhaps loading or unloading items.\n\nThe parking lot in front of the market holds a few other cars typical of the mid-20th-century American automotive design. Notably, there is a \"No Parking\" sign, amusingly placed right in a parking lot.\n\nIn the background, a large water tower dominates the right side of the frame, adding a structural element to the scene. The tower, combined with utility poles and visible power lines, frames the built environment.\n\nTo the left of the image and in the deep background, thick white smoke or steam rises prominently behind a mountainous silhouette, possibly hinting at industrial activity in the area beyond this small commercial setting. This element contrasts with the relatively serene urban foreground, suggesting the proximity of industrial operations to everyday community life.\n\nOverall, the composition offers a glimpse into a slice of mid-20th-century American life, encapsulating elements of commercial, domestic, and industrial existence coexisting within a small geographic area.","title":"Service station and store on route 60, with the union carbide ferro-Alloy plant in the background.  There has been a reduction in emissions from the metallurgical plant since it was photographed in 1973.  Emissions have dropped 97.7 percent since 1967.  The decrease occurred after agreement between the company and the West Virginia air pollution control commission.
