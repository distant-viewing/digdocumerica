{"path":"546149.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph features a rustic, historic-looking house that appears to be a pioneer-style log cabin with a prominent stone chimney. The structure, characterized by its rugged wooden logs and vertical planks, has a distinctly rural and aged look, indicative of early American or frontier architecture.\n\nThe cabin is flanked on one side by a long, open shed or barn structure, also made of wood, where a vintage, white, horse-drawn carriage is visible under its roof. This adds to the historical feel of the scene.\n\nThe environment around the buildings is overgrown, with tall grass and wild vegetation suggesting that the area may not have been actively maintained for some time. The foreground of the image shows rocky soil with sparse patches of grass and a few small plants, indicative of a dry or semi-arid climate. \n\nThe sky is clear and a deep blue, suggesting a bright sunny day, which casts shadows on the side of the cabin and inside the open barn, providing a contrast that accentuates the texture of the wooden structures and the chimney. \n\nThis scene is evocative of rural life in a past era, possibly serving as a historical site or a preserved example of early rural Americana. The overall composition of the photograph, with its focus on historical structures amidst natural overgrowth under a bright sky, conveys a sense of peaceful desolation and timelessness.","title":"Leakey's first school, buzzard's roost schoolhouse, dates back to 1879","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["544865","554084","549193","546142","554786","547658","543350","545233","557947","558109","557026","554401","551111","554822","543339","545137"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cabin","barn","chimney","log","overgrowth","example","timelessness","carriage","past","preserve"]}
