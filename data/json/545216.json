{"path":"545216.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling street scene, likely taken in the mid to late 20th century given the style of the vehicles and signage. The setting is an urban environment with a lively commercial strip.\n\nThe image is filled with various vintage cars that are characteristics of the era, displayed in a mix of colors and designs, driving down a busy street lined with shops and businesses. The vehicles appear to be mostly American models, and there's a sense of movement and crowdedness as the cars occupy all lanes of the street, pointing towards a possible traffic scenario.\n\nBoth sides of the street are lined with myriad business signs, indicating a thriving commercial area. The signs are colorful and feature a mix of neon and lit advertisements. Businesses that can be identified from their signs include a museum, a Chinese restaurant, a grill offering cocktails, pharmacies, a florist, a gift shop, and several others suggesting a diverse commercial offering. There's a sign visible that reads \"24\" which could imply a business open 24 hours a day. Some signage hints at cultural diversity (e.g., Chinese and possibly Italian influences).\n\nThe architecture of the buildings is functional, typical of mid-20th-century commercial constructions, with straightforward designs that focus more on utility than aesthetic detail. The sky is clear, suggesting it's a sunny day, which adds brightness to the colorful scene.\n\nPower lines and streetlights stretch across the photo, intersecting with the signs and adding to the busy, cluttered look of the street scene. In the distance, the street seems to lead towards a more open space, possibly moving away from the central business district.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures the essence of mid-century American urban life, characterized by automobile-centric city planning, diverse commercial entities, and vibrant street activity.","title":"One of the most popular surf and deep-sea fishing resorts on the Pacific coast, this town has been called the salmon capital of the world.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551135","549872","542586","554297","547369","551125","556724","545614","556709","549014","554551","550139","548388","556224","549113","547651"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["business","street","sign","shop","signage","entity","museum","streetlight","offering","grill"]}
