{"path":"544008.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a nighttime scene that appears to be an outdoor setting. There are two main sources of light — possibly from fires — that cast a warm, reddish-orange glow over the scene. One of these fires is more visible and located toward the right side of the image, illuminating what looks like a concrete barrier or wall behind it. The flames are lively and appear small in size.\n\nIn the center, there’s a street lamp casting a yellowish light that directly illuminates a geometric patch of the ground marked by distinct, sharply defined shadows. This lighting creates a stark contrast with the surrounding darkness, highlighting a gritty texture on the ground, which might be a mixture of dirt, sand or degraded asphalt.\n\nThe background of the scene is mostly obscured by darkness, but a hint of distant city lights or reflections on a building suggests an urban environment. The complete absence of people in the visible parts of the image imparts a sense of isolation and the desolate feel of a perhaps abandoned or seldom visited area.","title":"Refining operations at the inspiration consolidated copper company","placename":"Globe (Ariz.)","location":"Globe, Arizona","nn1":["543002","546013","543933","545778","543900","548792","551431","555160","554771","557577","545528","547168","543734","557398","553866","557611"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["darkness","fire","visit","flame","impart","nighttime","lamp","illuminat","gritty","source"]}
