{"path":"548831.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a man in a rural outdoor setting, engaged in an activity near a body of water that appears to be a river or a large pond. The man, who is bending over slightly, is dressed in a white long-sleeve shirt, dark trousers, and dark boots. He is wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat, which mostly obscures his face from view. In his right hand, he holds a blue bucket which he appears to be using to collect or hold something from the waterside.\n\nThe river or pond has calm water and extends toward the horizon, reflecting the blue sky above. The banks of the waterway are sandy with some visible vegetation and occasional debris. On the far side of the river, the landscape features low, sparse vegetation and a flat horizon, suggesting a relatively arid region.\n\nIn the distance, another person can be seen standing knee-deep in the water, which indicates that the area might be used for fishing, irrigation, or other water-related activities. There are no buildings or other structures visible; the scene is entirely natural and quite peaceful, aside from the human activity. The overall lighting suggests it is a sunny day, contributing to the vivid colors captured in the image.","title":"Colorado river at the mexican border (on mexican side)","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["546298","551406","545386","551408","552110","545371","549012","543781","542556","548956","554848","554535","546338","544994","553332","546341"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["pond","river","waterside","irrigation","straw","collect","brim","water","horizon","bucket"]}
