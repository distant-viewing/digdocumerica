{"path":"544875.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a beautiful blooming plant in a natural setting. The main focus is on a cluster of flowers, each with five delicate white petals and prominent yellow stamens that add a striking contrast. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves with serrated edges, which give it a robust and healthy appearance. The flowers and leaves are set against a backdrop of rich, reddish-brown soil that suggests a dry or desert-like environment.\n\nThe lighting in the image highlights the translucence of the flower petals and the intricate details of the stamens and veins in the leaves, suggesting that the photo was taken during a time of day when the sunlight is warm and enriching. Shadows cast across the soil add depth to the scene.\n\nThere are no human figures or man-made objects visible in the photograph; the focus remains entirely on the natural elements. This creates a sense of isolation and tranquility, emphasizing the beauty and resilience of nature in what might be an otherwise harsh environment. The background is softly blurred, which directs the viewer's attention primarily towards the sharply focused flowers in the foreground.","title":"Evening primrose","placename":"Castle Valley (Emery County, Utah)","location":"Castle Valley, Utah","nn1":["547642","544934","545695","549230","554587","553368","553361","543596","553366","545718","554574","554745","554595","557167","554576","555186"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["stamen","petal","flower","leave","sharply","soil","blooming","vein","enrich","plant"]}
