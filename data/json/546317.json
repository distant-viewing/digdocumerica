{"path":"546317.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures an outdoor aquatic scene with a blue boat being the central focus. This boat is actively moving through a body of water, which is likely a sea, given its vastness and the visible horizon line. There are two people visible on the boat. One person is standing towards the back near the motor, possibly controlling the boat, while the other is seated toward the front. The water around the boat is disturbed by its movement, creating a trail of waves and spray behind it.\n\nThe texture of the water surface is reflective, sparkling under the sunlight and suggesting the photo was taken on a bright day. The color of the sea is a deep blue, with glittering light reflecting off the crests of small waves, enhancing the sense of movement and activity. The vast, open backdrop and the absence of any land in the immediate vicinity emphasize the isolation and focus on the boat and its occupants. The sky is not visible in the frame, keeping all attention on the aquatic setting.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of motion and leisurely activity, centered around boating in a large body of water on a sunny day.","title":"EPA Gulf Coast water supply research laboratory, Dauphin Island.
