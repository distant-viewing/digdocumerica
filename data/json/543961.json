{"path":"543961.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a busy cityscape viewed from an elevated perspective, possibly from a high building or a hill. The foreground of the image is dominated by a large, crowded parking lot filled with numerous cars of various colors and designs, suggesting that the photo was taken in an era when car sizes and styles were diverse, likely in mid to late 20th century. The parking lot is packed densely, indicating a significant event or simply a busy day.\n\nThe middle ground shows a sweeping, moderately busy multi-lane highway. Several cars and trucks are visible on the road, moving in both directions. This highway curving through the picture adds a dynamic element to the composition.\n\nIn the background, the city's skyline is visible under a hazy sky, contributing to the atmospheric depth of the photograph. Several tall buildings, likely office towers, define the skyline. The overall ambient seems somewhat smoggy or foggy, typical of many urban environments in past decades given air quality issues.\n\nAn industrial bridge in the far background adds to the urban industrial charm of the image, while lush green trees on the right soften the otherwise tech-centric urban scene. One noticeable element in this urban panorama is a billboard for trucks, visible next to one of the roads, indicating commercial activity typical of urban areas.\n\nOverall, this image is a rich depiction of vintage urban life, capturing the essence of a bustling, crowded, and somewhat congested city environment, important for understanding urban planning, transportation, and cultural elements of the time.","title":"AutoMobile junkyard can be seen from high rise buildings in downtown.","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["548434","549875","546716","547369","556790","546681","550126","549310","546715","550167","546707","553721","556773","546370","547764","549476"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","lot","parking","skyline","centric","panorama","car","truck","billboard","city"]}
