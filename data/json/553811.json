{"path":"553811.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a majestic snow-capped mountain towering above a serene rural landscape. The mountain, which is the central focus of the image, has prominent snowy peaks and ridges. Shades of white and darker blues highlight its craggy textures and large snowfields that blanket much of its upper region.\n\nBelow the mountain, the foreground of the image showcases a verdant valley, dotted with numerous small buildings which appear as tiny white and gray specks amidst the vast greenery. This rural area is interspersed with patches of fields, possibly farmland, and clusters of trees, adding a lush contrast to the snowy mountain above. The lower lands are bathed in shadow, suggesting that the time of day might be either dawn or dusk, which enhances the tranquil and slightly mysterious atmosphere of the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its striking natural scenery and tranquil human settlement, evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence between nature and human habitation. The color palette is rich with deep blues and greens, highlighting the natural beauty and grandeur of the scene.","title":"Mt.  Hood and the hood river valley.  (from the sites exhibition.
