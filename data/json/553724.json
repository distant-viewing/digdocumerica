{"path":"553724.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph offers an aerial view of a densely built urban area, featuring a mixture of high-rise and low-rise buildings. Dominating the foreground is a major highway, densely packed with traffic, which stretches vertically through the image, effectively bisecting the landscape. Surrounding the highway are numerous buildings, including both residential and commercial structures, which are tightly packed into the urban grid.\n\nThe color palette of the buildings varies, with many roofs appearing in shades of red, brown, and grey, while the walls of the buildings are predominantly shades of white and light grey. This suggests a blend of architectural styles and materials.\n\nInterestingly, the top part of the image shows a visible rainbow emerging from a cluster of clouds, adding a natural, colorful element to the otherwise urban scene. The background extends to an area with less dense construction, leading to a tree-covered mountainous area under partly cloudy skies. The ocean is visible in the far background, hinting at the coastal nature of this city. Overall, the image captures the bustling activity of a cityscape contrasted against natural elements.","title":"Looking east on h-1 freeway in downtown Honolulu","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["546707","555743","546678","547755","549476","549478","548392","547764","547765","552233","555781","556193","546617","551509","542674","548414"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","grey","rainbow","pack","bisect","rise","building","low","varies","emerge"]}
