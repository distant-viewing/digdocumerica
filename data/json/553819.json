{"path":"553819.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts a wooden, box-like cargo compartment, possibly mounted on a vehicle, covered on top with a dark, tarp-like canvas that appears partially folded back to expose the interior. Inside, there are at least two people visible. To the left is a person wearing a light-colored hood, possibly part of a jacket or raincoat; this individual is peeking out, looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. To the right, another person is leaning over the side of the compartment, with only their arm and a glimpse of their white shirt visible. \n\nThe compartment itself is constructed of light-colored wooden planks, reinforced by darker wood beams and has a grid-like pattern for reinforcement. The front panel, for example, shows vertical and horizontal wooden reinforcements, creating sections or frames.\n\nThe background of the photograph is indistinct but seems to be a neutral, possibly overcast sky, suggesting the image was taken outdoors during daylight. The lighting and shadows are soft, which aligns with an overcast day. The overall mood conveyed by the image appears somber or contemplative, emphasized by the subdued color palette and the expressions seen on the visible individual. This setting might be indicative of travel, migration, or transport, possibly in a makeshift or improvised manner.","title":"Farm workers taking shelter during a dust storm in southern Utah.
