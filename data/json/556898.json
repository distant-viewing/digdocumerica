{"path":"556898.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph appears to depict two workers engaged in manual labor, specifically working on a section of railroad track. The setting is an outdoor industrial or construction area, likely associated with railway maintenance or similar infrastructure work. \n\nThe two workers are dressed in work attire: one wearing a light blue long-sleeved shirt and jeans, and the other in a greenish jacket and grey pants. Both have protective helmets, the one in green with a yellow helmet, and the other in blue with an orange helmet. They are bending over and using tools on the tracks, indicating they might be adjusting or replacing parts of the railway. The focus and positioning suggest they are working on aligning or securing the railroad ties or tracks.\n\nIn the background, there is a substantial piece of machinery, possibly a maintenance or construction vehicle used in railway work, painted in yellow and black. Some exposed components and possibly a jacket hanging on its side suggest a work-in-progress scene. Visible are other structural elements which are typical of a rail yard or maintenance depot.\n\nThe image captures a sense of physical labor and teamwork in an industrial environment. It showcases aspects of railway maintenance work, emphasizing the physical and technical components involved in keeping railroads functional. The color saturation and style indicate the photo may be from an earlier era, perhaps the mid to late 20th century, which adds a historical layer to the image.","title":"Southern railway right-of-way work crew jack up a rail they are removing old ties and replacing them with new ones while improving the roadbed.
