{"path":"549158.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive field covered thickly with tall, dense green plants that have bright yellow tops, possibly flowers or grains. The scene is set in a vast, open space that suggests a rural or remote area. The plants appear lush and are uniformly distributed throughout the field, which stretches across the entire foreground and middle ground of the image.\n\nIn the background, gentle rolling hills add a soft undulating contour to the landscape. The hills are also green, indicating rich vegetation, with some areas showing slight variations in shade possibly due to the presence of different plant species or the effects of light casting shadows across the terrain.\n\nThe sky above is mostly clear with a soft blue hue, dotted sporadically with light clouds, suggesting a fair weather day. The lighting in the image indicates either early morning or late afternoon, as the light has a golden tone that enhances the yellow of the plant tops, making them vivid against the greenery.\n\nOverall, the composition focuses on the natural beauty and tranquility of an agricultural or wild landscape, free from any visible human activity or man-made structures, offering a serene and unspoiled view of nature.","title":"Open range land near Custer Battlefield National Monument","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549251","557191","549141","549233","557098","556990","549229","551370","545040","552903","557189","542641","547649","549250","544439","549146"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["plant","distribute","grain","field","hill","specie","undulate","variation","top","yellow"]}
