{"path":"550180.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph presents a striking juxtaposition between industrial and recreational life. In the foreground, behind a chain-link fence, a group of people are engaged in a baseball game. There are several players visible, mostly dressed in casual, light-colored clothes, suggesting an informal game. The setting appears to be a grassy field.\n\nIn stark contrast, the background features a dense industrial landscape dominated by towering smokestacks and large structures, likely part of a factory or industrial plant. Black and gray smoke billows out from several of the stacks, filling the sky above the scene and creating a somewhat ominous atmosphere. The industrial elements are further emphasized by high-voltage power lines and structures, which add to the heavy industrial feel.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo highlights the coexistence of leisure activity within an area heavily influenced by industrial operations. The scene is atmospheric, with a sense of normal day-to-day activities occurring in possibly detrimental environmental conditions, thereby evoking a powerful narrative about the impact of industrialization on community spaces and life.","title":"Baseball diamond barely visible through smoke from Republic Steel mill.","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["551096","550170","551099","551095","551075","551103","545989","551145","551959","545013","556583","551146","544328","555542","557373","557225"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["game","voltage","player","industrialization","link","baseball","coexistence","chain","clothe","stack"]}
