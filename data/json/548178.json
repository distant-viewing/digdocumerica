{"path":"548178.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph presents an aerial view of a scenic landscape featuring a large body of water surrounded by tall, forest-clad mountains. The water body has a calm surface reflecting some of the surrounding hues, with a few small islands or landforms visible. One section of the shoreline is prominent, with clearings that seem to be either agricultural fields or developed areas, revealing patches of different shades of green and brown.\n\nA highway or road is discernible, curving along the contour of the shoreline, partially lined with trees and possibly other forms of vegetation. The area gives an impression of a tranquil, remote location possibly used for agriculture, recreation, or simply as a natural habitat.\n\nThe lighting in the photo suggests that it is either dawn or dusk, as the light appears soft and evenly diffused with shadows stretching across the landscape, enhancing the shapes of the terrain and the serenity of the scene. The viewpoint is high enough to overlook the vast expanse but close enough to clearly observe details of the landscape's texture and land usage.","title":"Just after sunrise from a 7,000 foot elevation over the Columbia River gorge, between The Dalles and the hood river","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["556928","542882","556998","556936","556926","552141","556930","556931","551573","556905","556906","552229","545001","543761","553569","553976"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["shoreline","landform","serenity","scenic","usage","recreation","agriculture","overlook","clad","island"]}
