{"path":"552104.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph features a middle-aged man sitting inside a modestly decorated room. The man, appearing thoughtful, is directly facing the camera with the top half of his body visible. He is wearing a plaid, button-up shirt with yellows and blues, and underneath, a white undershirt can be seen. He has a rugged complexion and his facial expression carries a sense of contemplation or concern.\n\nThe background is characterized by plain wooden paneling which covers the walls. Notably, hanging on the wall behind him, there is a wire clothing hanger supporting two legs of sheer white stockings filled with what seems to be dried plants, creating makeshift decorative items. Also visible in the background is a calendar or some kind of document with textual and numerical information, hung above the stockings but it's too blurred to read clearly. Additionally, there is a black cord running vertically, likely an electrical cord, adding to the simplicity and functional nature of the room's decor.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is soft and natural, suggesting maybe a daytime setting with light possibly coming from a window outside the frame to the left. The overall mood is quiet and somewhat introspective, with the man's pose and expression complementing the unembellished, serene environment.","title":"Warren Freeman, 50, built a cottage on an island in the Kansas River.
