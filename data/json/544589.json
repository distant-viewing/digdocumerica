{"path":"544589.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a dense, swampy forest scene, likely taken in a wetland or bayou environment. The foreground features clear, reflective water peppered with various aquatic plants and grasses, which are vividly green and partially submerged. Floating leaves and some debris can also be seen on the water surface, adding texture to the water's appearance.\n\nNumerous tall trees with thick, rough barks rise from the water, their roots visibly protruding into the swamp, which is typical of swamp-adapted trees like cypress. These trees have a unique feature where they seem to have flared, water-swollen bases, likely an adaptation to the wet soil. Some of the trees are covered with dense clusters of epiphytic plants, including mosses and possibly ferns that hang and drape over their branches, creating a lush, green canopy.\n\nThe forest background is dense and dominated by similar trees, creating a feeling of depth and seclusion. The canopy above is thick, allowing some light penetration which reflects off the water surface and highlights the natural greenery and brown tones of the bark and wetland.\n\nOverall, the setting is serene and typical of a healthy, biodiverse wetland ecosystem, showcasing the natural adaptation of flora in waterlogged environments.","title":"Loop Road","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544593","544585","544549","544595","546181","546059","544602","544541","546205","552438","550786","558009","547011","550783","554606","544545"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["swamp","wetland","adaptation","bark","canopy","water","basis","tree","root","fern"]}
