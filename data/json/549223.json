{"path":"549223.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph displays a large roadside billboard positioned on what appears to be a sparsely vegetated terrain with grasses and some small shrubs. The billboard has a predominantly white background with significant text overlays in large, bold fonts. The upper half of the billboard prominently features the word \"WYOMING\" in bold blue and mustard yellow letters staggered in perspective to lend a sort of dynamic appearance. Below this, in smaller black letters, is a message that reads, \"keep it beautiful. Please don't litter.\" These words encourage viewers to maintain cleanliness and care for the environment.\n\nFurther branding or sponsorship is indicated by the logos and names present at the bottom of the billboard. It mentions \"Olympia Brewing Company\" alongside a logo that appears to consist of concentric shapes â€“ possibly representing a stylized letter 'G' from a brand referred to as \"Galaxy.\"\n\nThe background beyond the billboard shows a nondescript, flat landscape that appears typical of semi-arid environments, commonly found in parts of Wyoming. The sky looks slightly overcast with the dull white or gray hues blending into the scenery, emphasizing the man-made object's presence in a largely natural setting.","title":"Billboard","placename":"Wyoming","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545263","549188","544864","555380","543641","543814","548674","544145","543637","548730","548158","545622","545298","545240","544955","549161"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["billboard","letter","word","logo","refer","mustard","encourage","cleanliness","font","branding"]}
