{"path":"545348.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This dynamic photograph captures a scene set in a gritty urban alleyway. The image features three men and a young child among its subjects. Centered in the composition is a large dumpster bearing the labeling \"El Paso Disposal Inc.\" suggesting the setting could be in El Paso, Texas. The dumpster has various scribbles and graffiti on it, enhancing its worn appearance.\n\nThe three men, perhaps in their late teens or early twenties, are lounging around the dumpster. The man on the left, sitting on the edge of the dumpster, is dressed in dark clothes and boots, and he looks off to the side contemplatively. The center man is captured in motion, slightly blurred as he moves, focusing on his actions rather than his surroundings. Lastly, the man on the right sits on the corner of the dumpster, leaning against a makeshift wall, also observing something out of frame. He wears a sleeveless top and plaid trousers, with his expression reflecting a relaxed demeanor.\n\nIn the foreground, a boy, blurred by motion, engages actively with his surroundings, indicating he is playing. A small dog and another figure are seen farther down the alley, suggesting life and activity beyond what is centrally depicted. In the background, dreary brick buildings with barred windows add to the rough, textured feel of the setting. The environment and scattered debris hint at an economically challenged urban neighborhood. The alley is shaded, suggesting it might be late afternoon or early evening, casting long shadows and a somber tone over the scene.\n\nThe photograph captures a slice of life, telling a story of youth, community, and the environment in which they reside, marked by a candid and unstaged quality that adds authenticity to the depiction.","title":"El paso's second ward.
