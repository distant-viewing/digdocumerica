{"path":"557748.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a pastoral landscape rich with lush greenery. In the center foreground, a road cuts diagonally across the frame, intersecting with a secondary road. Both roads appear quiet with minimal vehicle presence. Along one road, there's a collection of buildings, possibly a small farmstead, with a prominent red roofed barn and several smaller buildings tucked amid dense trees. In the immediate vicinity, there is a mix of open fields and patches of dense woodland, providing a varied texture to the terrain.\n\nBehind the initial cluster of buildings, the land opens into expansive green fields that stretch toward a range of rounded, forest-covered hills in the background, which fade into a hazy blue with distance. This suggests the locale is surrounded by natural beauty and possibly serves agricultural purposes. \n\nIn the upper left corner, a solitary building or small structure stands alone in the midst of a large, open field, adding a sense of isolation and simplicity to the landscape. The overall composition of the image, coupled with the vast natural spaces and minimal human presence, evokes a serene and tranquil rural environment.","title":"Rural scene showing the Nacoochee Valley two miles southwest of Helen, Georgia, which is near Robertstown. The Chattahoochee River is visible at the bottom and top right in the photo. The red roofed building on the riverbank at bottom center is the old Nacoochee Station, now a flower and crafts shop. The building across the road is an antique shop. The Nacoochee Indian Mound is seen in the distant field beyond the junction of State Highways 17 and 75.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549256","555635","554819","549257","556968","556971","549222","555624","554800","549261","551305","549236","557946","555577","557087","547428"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["road","field","locale","woodland","building","midst","barn","vicinity","simplicity","collection"]}
