{"path":"550319.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph presents a view of a wet street in a small town depicting an overcast day. The architecture has a distinctly mid-20th century American feel, characterized by vintage facades and signs. On the left, a prominent building with a faded \"Wilborn Furniture\" sign extends an aged yet striking Art Deco style frontage with vertical elements and a central marquee overhanging the entrance. The street itself is mostly emptied of people but features parked cars typical of the 1960s or 1970s style, suggesting the photo was likely taken during this period.\n\nFurther down the street, on both sides, are a series of two-story buildings housing various shops and businesses. Signs are visible but the details are mostly indistinct due to distance. The buildings display classic features of small-town commercial architecture from that era, including detailed woodwork and trim. The pavement is wet, reflecting a recent rainfall, adding a glossy finish to the street and sidewalks.\n\nUtility poles line the right side of the street with multiple lines stretching across the scene. The overall mood is quiet and somewhat nostalgic, capturing a snapshot of everyday life in a mid-century American town, its architecture, vehicles, and weather setting a vivid scene. There is no visible sign of recent technological devices or modern vehicles, which contributes to the time capsule feel of the photograph. The color palette is subdued, dominated by grays and muted tones, enhancing the sense of a rainy day.","title":"Main street of Eastport at midday","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["552526","557155","557655","558028","556564","542900","552933","545333","546428","550108","551106","546440","558037","548500","557805","550138"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","town","architecture","sign","woodwork","finish","rainfall","pavement","trim","shop"]}
