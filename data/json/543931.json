{"path":"543931.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Olive, Jim","caption":"This image captures a dynamic and somewhat abstract scene focused on an object that appears to be a bundle of wet hair or fibers being shaken, resulting in droplets and strands flying through the air. The main subject is predominantly in the center and right side of the frame, under low-light conditions with a focus on the motion and interaction of the material and light.\n\nThe background is dark and vague, providing little context or distraction from the main subject. The lighting highlights the wet strands and droplets, creating glints and sparkles as the light catches the moving water and material. This results in a multitude of bright, scattered reflections that give the image a vivid and kinetic feel.\n\nThe photo's composition utilizes a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on some parts of the object while allowing others to blur into movement, enhancing the sense of motion. The capture of movement, combined with the textural details and contrasting dark background, gives the photograph an energetic and somewhat mysterious quality.","title":"Shrimp catch","placename":"Galveston Bay (Tex.)","location":"Galveston Bay, Texas","nn1":["544716","545850","545882","555804","550372","550237","555184","542742","550608","546217","553883","544862","550373","553180","543564","548818"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["strand","droplet","result","glint","subject","motion","bundle","distraction","multitude","movement"]}
