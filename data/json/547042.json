{"path":"547042.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features a street scene dominated by a stop sign which has been altered with several stickers and additional signs. The red octagonal stop sign prominently displays a sticker across its center that reads “the HELL with Shell,” suggesting a form of protest or dissent against Shell, possibly referring to the Shell oil company. Below this sticker, there is another small rectangular sign attached to the stop sign that reads \"McGovern Shriver,\" indicating support for a political campaign, likely that of George McGovern and Sargent Shriver from the 1972 U.S. presidential election.\n\nNext to the stop sign is a street post displaying two street name signs. The vertical sign reads “Hancock St.,” suggesting this is the name of the street intersecting with the photographer's viewpoint.\n\nIn the background, there is a residential setting with houses, trees, and a clear blue sky. On one lawn across the street, a person can be seen sitting, involved in a leisure activity near a parked car, adding a sense of everyday life and tranquility to the scene despite the politically charged message on the stop sign. The overall image captures a moment of political expression in an otherwise ordinary urban environment, blending social commentary with a snapshot of American suburban life.","title":"Sticker on stop sign reads, \"The hell with Shell\" - in Pentwater","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547384","554793","550196","545419","557881","548174","547279","550187","552602","544715","550099","550200","555452","555455","555420","555584"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["stop","sticker","sign","street","name","campaign","protest","photographer","commentary","company"]}
