{"path":"555184.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image portrays a close-up of multiple thin, grass-like blades or stalks, each adorned with numerous droplets of water. The focus is on a central blade that stands taller than the others, with a prominent droplet at its tip. Other blades around it also have water droplets clinging to their lengths and tips, reflecting light and creating a sparkling effect.\n\nThe background is blurredâ€”a mix of soft white, blue, and grey hues that suggest a misty or damp environment, possibly early morning dew or after a light rain. This diffused background helps to highlight the clarity and reflective quality of the water droplets on the dark, silhouetted blades.\n\nOverall, the composition draws attention to the natural beauty and simplicity of water droplets on vegetation, using a shallow depth of field to isolate the subject from its surroundings and emphasize texture and light reflections.","title":"Spring grass growing in a one-year-old clear-cut area in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543564","543565","553853","547287","547312","558077","543629","555032","557592","555044","543562","543560","543623","552554","542687","555031"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["droplet","blade","tip","dew","stalk","close","water","clarity","rain","up"]}
