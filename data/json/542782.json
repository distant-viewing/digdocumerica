{"path":"542782.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"In the photograph, an older Caucasian man is depicted sitting in the driver's seat of a vehicle, half-facing the camera. He wears a white hard hat and a dark navy blue work shirt, which features a patch indicating some form of distinction or role, possibly in a utility or service capacity. His expression appears serious and somewhat stern.\n\nThe man leans out from the cab of a yellow truck, with his left elbow resting on the open window frame. The door of the vehicle displays a logo reading \"SCE Southern California Edison\" along with the number \"5860\" and a Roman numeral \"II\" beneath it, suggesting it is part of a fleet of vehicles owned by the Southern California Edison power company.\n\nPart of the vehicle's equipped features include a visible chrome siren or horn mounted next to the side mirror assembly, likely used for emergency or service signals.\n\nThe background of the scene is deliberately out of focus but hints at an outdoor environment, possibly a work site or a rural area given the glimpse of what appears to be natural, rocky terrain. The focus and composition emphasize his role and setting, underlining a sense of readiness or attentiveness to duty.","title":"William Wingo, forester with the right of way and land department of Southern California Edison, made decision to block logging road in order to save nesting golden eagle.","placename":"Shaver Lake (Calif.)","location":"Shaver Lake, California","nn1":["544835","548999","556547","556155","546092","556599","556187","547163","554441","544349","556320","546176","558312","547277","556771","548264"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["vehicle","role","service","horn","attentiveness","capacity","elbow","signal","readiness","cab"]}
