{"path":"546926.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"The photograph features a maritime scene, likely taken from aboard or near a large vessel. The composition is divided by a huge ship's propeller on the right, with multiple blades that are reddish-brown and imposing in size, suggesting the magnitude of the ship itself. This propeller dominates the frame, partially silhouetted against a lighter background of sky and water.\n\nTo the left, through the gap created by the propeller and the shipâ€™s hull (visible as a red vertical structure to the far left), one can see a busy waterway scene. There are multiple ships at various distances; the nearest one is a tugboat, directly aligned in the center of the gap, moving towards or away from the viewer. In the background, other maritime vessels of varying sizes and types are visible, imply an active commercial or industrial port area.\n\nThe water appears choppy, indicating windy conditions, and the sky is overcast with clouds diffusing the natural light, providing a somewhat muted color palette predominantly in tones of blue, grey, and brown. The overall impression is of dynamic industrial activity on the water, viewed from an unusual and strikingly mechanical perspective.","title":"Tugboat ready to help move the \"Chevron Hawaii\" to its berth","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550058","548111","551990","544234","545830","550894","550906","545845","551991","550891","548201","544657","555721","549892","547061","550918"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["propeller","ship","gap","vessel","magnitude","size","blade","tugboat","port","hull"]}
