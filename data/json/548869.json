{"path":"548869.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene dominated by agricultural activities. In the foreground, there is a large irrigation system at work, sprinkling water across a lush green field. This system uses long, horizontal pipes supported by wheeled structures that allow it to move across the field, distributing water evenly. The streams of water can be seen jetting out vigorously, forming arcs that catch the light.\n\nOn the left, there is a farming vehicle, possibly a tractor with an attached mower. Inside the vehicle is a person, likely a farmer, operating it. The vehicle is parked and not currently in motion.\n\nThe background features a natural landscape with a range of tall, shadowy mountains helping to frame the scene under a clear sky. This backdrop adds a serene and picturesque quality to the overall rural setting, emphasizing the expanse and beauty of the agricultural environment.\n\nThe overall mood of the image seems tranquil and focused on the productivity and maintenance of the farmland. The technology shown (irrigation system, tractor) highlights the blend of manual labor and mechanization common in modern agriculture.","title":"Farming in the parker valley area","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548950","548875","548877","548991","543650","549178","553432","546825","546949","552577","553652","544888","554014","548953","554204","543777"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["irrigation","system","tractor","productivity","farmer","vehicle","sprinkle","arc","jet","farmland"]}
