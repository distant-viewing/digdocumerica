{"path":"548791.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"In this photograph, a man appears in the foreground holding a long string of white spherical objects strung together on a line. He is standing outdoors and is dressed in a short-sleeved white shirt, which is slightly unbuttoned at the top, and navy blue shorts with a green belt. The man, who has a medium complexion and dark hair, is squinting slightly and has a mild expression on his face as he gazes towards the camera.\n\nThe background features a small white house with green trim around the windows and doors, slightly obscured by some lush, green foliage, including palm trees that partially frame the scene. The lawn in the foreground where the man stands is sunlit and mostly grassy, with some visible patches of dirt.\n\nThe overall impression is of a casual, daytime outdoor scene, possibly in a tropical or subtropical setting, focused on this individual displaying or handling a series of connected white spheres, perhaps for some type of practical or decorative purpose. The atmosphere is calm and serene, typical of a relaxed outdoor environment.","title":"Lobster fishermen of Conch Key with a string of newly painted floats.
