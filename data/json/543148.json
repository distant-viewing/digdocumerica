{"path":"543148.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a detailed aerial view of an intensely rugged terrain, highlighting deep and sharp textural features. The surface pictured seems volcanic or consists of heavily eroded rock layers. The creases and folds appear evocative of geological processes, possibly hinting at past turbulent flows of material such as lava, which have since solidified. The color palette is rich with dark brown tones and hints of a reddish hue, suggesting the presence of iron-rich minerals.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph accentuates the topographical variations, creating dramatic contrasts between the peaks and valleys of the texture. Shadows cast within the folds hint at the depth and unevenness of the surface. The perception of scale is a bit ambiguous without obvious reference points, which lends a timeless and mysterious air to the scene. Overall, the composition is dynamic and visually striking, capturing nature's complexity and raw beauty.","title":"Documerica photograph by Dick Rowan","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545795","555793","545799","552690","542511","545802","545806","544745","550396","545807","555553","550395","544694","546110","555029","550442"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["fold","lava","reference","iron","hint","mineral","variation","complexity","bit","flow"]}
