{"path":"546288.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a woman engaging in a scientific or laboratory activity. The woman, who has long, dark hair and is wearing a white lab coat, is focused intently on her task. She is using a pair of tweezers to handle small, flat objects within a large, circular device that appears to be a heating or drying instrument, possibly a water bath. The device is labeled \"COLE-PARMER INSTRUMENT & EQUIPMENT CO.\"\n\nIn the background, there are neatly stacked racks containing numerous slides or samples, indicating a setting that involves meticulous documentation or analyses. Above the workspace, there is a desk lamp that casts light directly onto the area where she is working, emphasizing her focus and the precision required for the task.\n\nThe overall environment suggests a professional laboratory setting where scientific research or experiments are conducted. The detail and equipment in the scene suggest the photograph was taken in the mid-to-late 20th century, considering the style of the equipment and overall ambiance.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: patho-biology lab.
