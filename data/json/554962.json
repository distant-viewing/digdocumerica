{"path":"554962.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph features a breathtaking landscape view of a mountain range enveloped in clouds, captured during either dawn or dusk. The image is dominated by various shades of blue and purple, imparting a serene mood. Multiple overlapping mountain peaks are visible, creating layers that offer a sense of depth. The clouds settle in the valleys between the peaks, partially obscuring them and resembling a soft, flowing blanket or a sea of mist.\n\nThe upper section of the photo shows a subtly colored sky with striated cloud patterns, hinting at the quiet transition of time. There are small patches where the warm light of the sun peeks through, adding contrast to the otherwise cool toned image and highlighting the undulating contours of the clouds and mountains.\n\nThe overall composition is tranquil and picturesque, inviting contemplation and admiration of the natural world's quiet grandeur. The play of light and shadow, along with the soft focus, contributes to the dreamlike quality of the scene.","title":"Douglas fir country viewed by moonlight from the top of deer park in the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554634","543023","553825","552695","555131","555130","546764","542676","542923","544070","552927","542681","554398","555378","544066","557558"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cloud","peak","admiration","dreamlike","settle","impart","breathtaking","mountain","mountains","peek"]}
