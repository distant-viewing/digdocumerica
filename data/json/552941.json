{"path":"552941.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a young girl focusing her attention on a large sea shell being held in the hands of an adult. The background is slightly out of focus, emphasizing the girl and the shell in the foreground. The girl looks intrigued, her expression a mixture of curiosity and delight. \n\nShe has light brown hair pulled back from her face, revealing her smiling expression. She wears a dark sweatshirt with a marine-themed graphic featuring sea creatures like dolphins.\n\nThe shell itself is quite prominent, held securely by two adult hands with visible dust or sand particles, suggesting that the shell might have just been picked up from a beach. The shell is large, with a deep reddish-brown color and a glossy, wet appearance, enhancing its texture and spiral structure.\n\nThe shell's interior is visible, showing a complex, layered structure with a central spiral that seems to draw the eye inward. The contrast between the soft and smooth interior of the shell and its rugged, textured exterior adds to the visual interest of the object.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of discovery and learning, with the young girl engaged in exploring the natural world, exemplified by this intriguing marine artifact.","title":"Open house at hopkins marine institute (stanford university) (from the documerica-1 exhibition.
