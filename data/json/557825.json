{"path":"557825.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts an auto emission inspection station. The building is a one-story structure with multiple garages, each marked by a number displayed above the garage door. The architectural style of the building is utilitarian, constructed mainly from gray cinder blocks with a concrete foundation. Topped with a flat roof, the building seems designed for functional purposes related to vehicle inspection.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a large informative sign titled \"TIPS TO MOTORISTS\". This sign provides several instructions for drivers coming to the station, including preparing the vehicle for testing and what to expect during the inspection process. To the right of the sign stands a stop sign mounted on a metal pole, further directing the traffic flow within the area.\n\nIn the background, several orange traffic cones are strategically placed on the pavement to guide vehicles into the garages. A worker, wearing light-colored clothing, is visible beside the cones, seemingly ready to assist or direct an incoming car, giving the scene an active sense, albeit quiet. The car featured in the picture is a red vintage model, adding a touch of color to the otherwise neutral tones of the building and pavement.\n\nThe natural elements include a clear blue sky without clouds, which suggests that the photograph was taken on a bright day. Vegetation is present but sparse, primarily consisting of small plants creeping up along the sides of the building. This setting provides a contrasting touch of green to the predominantly gray and concrete environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a common yet essential public service facility, giving insight into the day-to-day operations of vehicle emissions testing. The organization and signage indicate a well-structured routine aimed at ensuring vehicular compliance with environmental standards.","title":"Hamilton county auto emission inspection station in the village of Newtown, Ohio, formerly was operated as an auto dealership.
