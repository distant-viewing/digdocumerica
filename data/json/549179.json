{"path":"549179.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a striking landscape scene. The foreground shows rough, rugged terrain with patches of dark soil interspersed with small, lighter-colored stones and clumps of vegetation. These materials have a notably textured appearance that suggests a dry, possibly arid environment.\n\nMid-ground, the image features a vast, sloping hill that stretches across the frame. The hill is largely barren, marked by numerous tire tracks or paths that have been worn into the slope, indicating frequent vehicular activity. The hill slopes downward from left to right, adding a sense of movement and vastness to the scene.\n\nIn the background, the landscape continues with rolling hills that gradually recede into the distance under a wide, cloudy sky. The sky itself occupies the upper portion of the image, filled with a mix of clouds and clear patches, suggesting a dynamic, possibly windy environment.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph emphasizes the openness and expansive scale of the landscape, predominantly characterized by its sparse vegetation and evidence of human interaction through the visible tracks and disturbed soil. The scene is remote and somewhat desolate, highlighting natural geological features and the impact of human activity in a subtle and expansive setting.","title":"Old strip piles are flattened and planted in an attempt at reclamation.
