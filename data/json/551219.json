{"path":"551219.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a serene lake scene with a focus on recreational activities. In the foreground, the surface of the lake is depicted with gentle ripples, reflecting a somber sky. Prominent in the scene is a red and white seaplane that is either landing or just about to take off, creating a light spray of water beneath it.\n\nScattered across the lake are several boats. To the right, slightly farther from the seaplane, are two small motorboats, one closer to the plane and another further in the distance. Another more sizeable pontoon boat rests near these motorboats, equipped with a canopy.\n\nThe background features a densely wooded area lining the far side of the lake, hinting at a secluded and natural setting. Several small buildings or houses partially hidden by the trees suggest a residential area nearby, contributing a human presence without overtly dominating the natural landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its dim lighting and cloudy sky, evokes a peaceful, quiet day at the lake, ideal for leisure activities and enjoying the tranquility of nature.","title":"Float plane and pontoon boats sail by some of the more modest private resorts near Bagnell Dam.
