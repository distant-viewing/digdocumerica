{"path":"553533.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph displays a close-up of a baby being held securely by an adult. The baby, appearing quite young, is dressed in a fleece-like white jumpsuit with a playful, colorful animal motif embroidered along the chest border, red trim around the neckline, and a small bow on one side. The jumper's sleeves extend halfway through the baby's arms, revealing a long-sleeve, off-white undershirt underneath.\n\nThe baby's skin on the belly is partly visible due to the jumper being slightly pulled up, exposing a small section of the belly and the upper portion of grey pants or leggings.\n\nThe adult's hand, with darker skin, holds the baby tenderly around the baby's waist and hip area, ensuring support and comfort. The adultâ€™s clothing partially visible in the frame feature a blue and white thick-striped design.\n\nThe setting seems to be indoors, though details of the surroundings are obscured, focusing primarily on the intimate interaction between the baby and the adult. The lighting in the photograph is subdued, accentuating the warmth and closeness of the moment.","title":"Dirty hands of one of the nine children of mulky square biscuit worker hold small nephew.
