{"path":"555257.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts two cans discarded in a natural setting, contributing to environmental pollution. One can is lying on its side, and the other is upside down. Both cans appear used and possibly weathered, indicating they have been there for some time. The can lying on its side features a dark blue design with snowflake patterns and the text \"BIO BISCONI\" in a lighter blue hue, suggesting it may have contained a beverage. \n\nThe background and surroundings of the cans include rich, dark soil, some green vegetation, and pieces of wood, such as twigs and a large branch in the immediate vicinity of the cans. The scene is wet, possibly near a body of water or after a rainfall, as evidenced by the shiny, reflective surface around the cans and the saturated ground. This setting gives a strong impression of natural beauty marred by human waste, highlighting a common environmental issue.","title":"Even the prospect of a five cent refund per \"throwaway\" aluminum can in Oregon has not stopped littering entirely.
