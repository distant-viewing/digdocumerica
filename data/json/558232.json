{"path":"558232.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively outdoor scene featuring a collection of motorcycles and a motorcycle with a sidecar parked on a dirt pathway. The motorcycles are classic models, each decorated differently in various colors such as green, red, and black with shiny chrome details and some equipped with helmets placed on their handlebars.\n\nIn the background, a group of people can be seen gathered by the edge of a lake. There's a mix of adults and children, casually dressed, seemingly enjoying a sunny day outdoors. Some individuals are standing by the water where a boat is visible, adding to the recreational feel of the scene. The area is shaded by leafy trees, and there's a traffic sign that appears to indicate a junction or turn in the path.\n\nThe setting is informal and relaxed, typical of a leisure day where enthusiasts might meet to enjoy their hobby and the natural surroundings. The blend of personal touches on the motorcycles and the casual gathering by the lake portrays a sense of community and enjoyment associated with outdoor, motor-related activities.","title":"Motorcycle transportation was used by young people of New Ulm, Minnesota, to get to Clear Lake three miles west of town for a Sunday of swimming and boating. The town is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged its kinsmen to emigrate from Europe. Several manufacturing firms have located here since 1950 and have helped the town to grow.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["549316","557777","553955","548690","551383","545598","556719","554876","556206","554481","554877","548691","551382","546614","547495","554875"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["motorcycle","hobby","junction","handlebar","enjoy","enthusiast","lake","motor","chrome","decorate"]}
