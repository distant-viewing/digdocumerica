{"path":"550750.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a tranquil natural scene featuring a large body of still water with a rich variety of aquatic plants. On the left side of the image, there’s a rocky shore with large, smooth boulders. Among these rocks, small plants and grasses sprout in pockets of soil, and smaller stones scatter across the area, creating a textured foreground.\n\nThe water surface mirrors the cloudy sky and is densely peppered with tall, thin reeds, which occupy more than half the visible water area, adding a vertical contrast to the horizontal tranquility of the scene. These plants thrive in the water, suggesting a shallow, marsh-like environment.\n\nIn the background, a dense tree line borders the water, reflecting faintly on the water’s surface. This band of trees includes different species as indicated by varying heights and densities. To the right, the shoreline curves gently into the distance, leading the eye toward a densely wooded point that juts into the water, partially obscured by mist or a hazy atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the composition offers a sense of calm and isolation, with emphasis on natural textures and the interplay between water, vegetation, and rock formations. The subdued lighting and overcast sky contribute to the serene and slightly melancholic mood of the scene.","title":"Pleasant Point in Merrymeeting Bay in the Brunswick area near the confluence of the Androscoggin and Kennebec Rivers","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["551352","546963","545008","543561","544765","543611","554776","544524","554717","550745","550389","545923","548034","554623","554608","547536"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["water","plant","sprout","pepper","marsh","pocket","jut","thrive","rock","reed"]}
