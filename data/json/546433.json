{"path":"546433.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph features a vintage, three-story house that exhibits typical architectural elements from late 19th or early 20th century American design. The house is painted in a soft, creamy yellow with white trim detailing.\n\nThe top third of the house features an attic level with a distinctive fish scale shingle pattern, complementing the triangular pediment that has a small semi-circular window. This window is adorned with ornate, white, tracery-like woodwork. Beneath this, the second floor showcases a balcony with a balustrade, covered by an extended roof supported by decorative brackets. The windows on this level have shutters designed with intricate cutouts, suggestive of a Victorian style.\n\nThe first floor includes a prominent, spacious porch wrapped with a railing, supported by round, classical columns. The main entrance appears to be centered directly beneath the second story balcony and is visible through the wide swinging gate of a white picket fence, which frames the foreground of the image. The gate stands open, invitingly leading up a few steps to the main porch.\n\nThe scene is set against a clear sky, suggesting a sunny day, and hints of greenery can be seen around the house, indicating a well-maintained yard or garden area. This house, with its detailed woodwork and classic aesthetic, portrays a slice of historic American residential architecture, likely maintained with a degree of pride and care.","title":"A well-kept house along franklin street","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["558160","546429","550124","557076","558155","548667","558156","548662","546442","546439","558148","547981","548661","557092","542816","557065"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["house","woodwork","gate","balcony","porch","pediment","floor","picket","story","balustrade"]}
