{"path":"543231.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and sunny fishing scene at a dock. On the left, an elderly man, wearing a green jacket and a flat cap, is seated on a wooden crate, poised in conversation with another man who is partially visible and seated behind him. They appear relaxed and engaged in their discussion. In front of them, scattered on the dock, are various fishing supplies including poles, a red tackle box, and a partially visible black bag.\n\nOn the right side of the image, another elderly man sits on the edge of the dock, holding a fishing rod that extends over the blue water. He appears calm and focused, wearing a light-colored shirt and dark pants.\n\nIn the background, there is a serene waterscape featuring a ferry or small ship moored at a distance, hills dotted with buildings, and clear skies suggesting a pleasant day. A unique feature in the scene is a crane-like structure with a basket, hinting at the dockâ€™s industrial uses as well.\n\nOverall, the setting is tranquil, marked by leisurely activities and scenic surroundings, typical of a fishing day by the waterfront.","title":"California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543232","550851","550297","545928","552291","546800","543465","546980","546079","549935","548164","548132","547884","544412","546077","550848"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["dock","fishing","ferry","waterscape","crate","basket","supply","discussion","rod","man"]}
