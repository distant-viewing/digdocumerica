{"path":"548671.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an open outdoor scene in a flat, barren park-like area with sparse vegetation. In the foreground, a wooden picnic table is situated prominently. The surface on which the table rests appears to be gravel, and it is located near a few scattered small bushes and very young trees.\n\nBeyond the picnic table, the landscape opens into a wider, desolate area that features numerous similar young trees and scattered bushes, all of which are relatively small and sparse, suggesting relatively young plantings in a possibly harsh environment. The soil looks rocky, further implying tough growing conditions.\n\nThe sky above is cloudy, contributing to a somewhat gloomy or overcast ambiance. Overall, the setting appears to be a designed park area undergoing early stages of development, with the focus on newly planted vegetation in an otherwise empty, flat terrain.","title":"Campsite at Ohio, or \"Sunshine\" Key.
