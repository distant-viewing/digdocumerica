{"path":"545025.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and dramatic rural landscape under a tumultuous sky. In the foreground, there is a field colored in shades of golden-yellow, suggesting it could be a crop field in fall or a dry pasture. The middle distance is populated by a dense arrangement of trees, primarily slender, white-barked trees resembling birch, mixed with some darker, perhaps coniferous trees. This band of trees forms a natural partition across the scene.\n\nBeyond the trees, there is a layer of rolling hills or low-lying mountains, adding depth to the landscape. These are partly obscured by a dark, billowing cloud of smoke, rising prominently into the sky, suggesting a large fire. The fire appears to be significant in size, as the massive smoke plume is dense and expansive.\n\nThe sky above this scene is a dramatic element in itself, filled with towering, voluminous clouds that reflect varying tones of blue and gray, indicating a possibly stormy weather. The clouds are dense and heavy, adding a sense of impending rain which contrasts the fiery activity below.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a serene natural setting juxtaposed with the violent intrusion of a fire, underscored by a moody and atmospheric sky, suggesting themes of natureâ€™s beauty and its unpredictable power.","title":"Cape kiwanda, ore","placename":"Kiwanda, Cape (Or.)","location":"Kiwanda, Cape, Oregon","nn1":["545051","545009","545048","555087","557578","552483","548592","553561","555157","548595","557575","542712","544734","545731","547728","544962"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["fire","cloud","resembling","partition","birch","fiery","pasture","tree","smoke","intrusion"]}
