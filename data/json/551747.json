{"path":"551747.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and picturesque urban park setting, likely from the mid-to-late 20th century. The foreground prominently features blooming, large-petaled roses with rich pink hues, slightly blurred, suggesting they are closer to the camera. Beyond the flowers, the central focus of the image is a green space dotted with a variety of colorful flowers including bright yellow and orange marigolds, creating an inviting, manicured garden.\n\nIn the middle ground, a person, likely an elderly male, stands painting on an easel, dressed in a light gray or white outfit, and wearing a hat. This person is positioned slightly off-center, with a shopping cart nearby filled with unseen contents; their presence contributes a serene, artistic atmosphere to the scene.\n\nThe background displays a busy urban street lined with classic cars and storefronts indicating small businesses such as \"Scandia Craft\" and \"St. Vincent Chemists\" among others, with signs advertising a luncheonette and soda. The architecture suggests this might be in a neighborhood with older, possibly historical, low-rise buildings.\n\nThe overall image is imbued with a sense of peaceful coexistence between urban life and cultivated natural beauty, as well as hinting at the daily lives of city dwellers. There is a palpable contrast between the serene garden space and the bustling city environment beyond, encapsulating a moment of tranquility amidst the urban hustle.","title":"Painter and volunteer worker in the garden opposite St Vincent's Hospital at Seventh Avenue and 11th Street. Property had been acquired by the hospital for expansion purposes, but community pressure brought about a stay and the garden was a temporary solution. Maintained by volunteers, its great variety of plants makes a splendid display.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551746","551745","551743","551781","551744","551739","551785","557257","551784","551644","551705","551775","551702","557266","551756","557262"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["garden","dweller","soda","flower","rose","cart","hustle","shopping","storefront","city"]}
