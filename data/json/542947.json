{"path":"542947.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph shows a forested area undergoing logging activities. The high-angle view captures a dense pine forest, predominantly dark green, surrounding a large clearing where the logging operations are occurring. The scene indicates significant deforestation with many tree stumps and fallen trees visible.\n\nIn the central area of the clearing, you can see heavy equipment such as bulldozers and trucks, some loaded with timber. These machines are dispersed around a muddy, open space carved directly into the earth, where paths and dirt roads have been made by the logging activity.\n\nThe terrain is uneven and scarred with trails of bare earth, and the disruption to the landscape is apparent with piles of logs, uprooted soil, and residual debris. This operation has created a stark contrast between the natural, undisturbed portions of the forest and the active work site.\n\nConclusively, the photograph highlights the impact of industrial activities on forest landscapes, demonstrating both the scale of human intervention and the resulting alteration of the natural environment.","title":"Lumber roads and clear-cutting encroach on pine forest","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["550354","542827","542948","542823","542851","542949","542828","542833","542832","555198","542824","542834","553468","555221","545143","545272"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["clearing","forest","earth","deforestation","undergo","trails","alteration","disruption","logg","operation"]}
