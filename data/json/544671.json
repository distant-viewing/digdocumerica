{"path":"544671.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph features a scenic river view with a strong silhouette effect, emphasizing the outlines of multiple structures and vessels. In the foreground, a tugboat moves rightward across the shimmering water, characterized by the reflection of sunlight. The water itself appears textured and sparkly due to the lighting.\n\nDominating the middle ground are the impressive silhouettes of two bridges. The nearest bridge, most likely a suspension bridge, shows a detailed structure including cables and a tower that rises vertically, dividing the frame almost symmetrically. Beyond this bridge, a second bridge is partially visible, featuring a more distant outline with a similar suspension design.\n\nThe background is less distinct, softly illuminated by a hazy, possibly setting sun, providing a muted backdrop that contrasts sharply with the sharp, dark forms of the bridges and the tugboat. The presence of another small boat on the far left slightly balances the composition. \n\nOverall, the image captures a serene yet industrial scene, utilizing backlighting to create a dramatic interplay of light and shadow and to highlight the engineering marvels of the bridges.","title":"California--San Francisco Bay","placename":"San Francisco Bay (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco Bay, California","nn1":["546203","544722","547064","550965","550915","555725","550955","547061","550964","555731","551210","548207","545022","545430","555730","550901"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["bridge","suspension","tugboat","outline","marvel","silhouette","backlighting","hazy","engineering","cable"]}
