{"path":"557166.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of a yellow-brown bamboo leaf, characterized by a smooth texture and natural variance in shading from yellow to brown. The leaf has numerous small black spots, which could be a natural feature, signs of decay, or pest damage. It is positioned diagonally across the frame, which provides a dynamic angle contributing to an interesting composition. The background is softly blurred, with muted greens and dark shadows, suggesting a natural, outdoor setting. This blurred effect emphasizes the sharpness and detail of the bamboo leaf in the foreground, directing the viewer's focus to it prominently. No human activity or other objects are discernible in this tranquil nature-focused scene.","title":"Closeup of Indian grass in the fall. It is a major native tall grass in Kansas. The picture was taken in Johnson County near Kansas City. A wave of pioneers cleared the native grasses and planted crops in the fertile soil. As a result, only isolated patches of native tallgrass prairie survive. There is a bill in Congress which would make an area of Kansas a tallgrass prairie national park, but there is opposition and the bill remains in committee in Congress.","placename":"Kansas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544731","542686","552693","543620","557593","551356","557539","542688","551372","557168","546096","551357","551371","558077","554744","555030"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["leaf","sharpness","close","up","damage","direct","spot","decay","brown","angle"]}
