{"path":"543033.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a lone fisherman engaged in his work at the edge of the ocean. The subject is a middle-aged man, dressed in a dark, water-resistant jacket and pants, possibly protective gear for fishing. He is focused on handling a large, triangular fishing net which he holds with a long pole. The net is mostly open, suggesting that he may be either casting it or pulling it in from the water.\n\nThe setting is a beachfront, characterized by a gloomy and overcast sky which blends into a rough sea with waves that indicate windy conditions. The horizon is barely distinguishable due to the heavy cloud cover, casting an overall moody tone to the scene.\n\nThe fisherman appears to be standing in shallow water, very close to the surf, which froths around his boots. His stance and the way he manages the net convey a sense of expertise and familiarity with his task, indicative of a possibly routine activity.\n\nThe background is simple and unobtrusive, focusing the viewerâ€™s attention on the man and his interaction with the net and the ocean environment. The light and weather conditions, combined with the solitary figure's engagement in his task, evoke a sense of resilience and the gritty reality of coastal fishing work.","title":"Fishing for smelt on Gold Bluff Beach","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545306","545185","543076","544714","552298","547558","553812","547563","546301","543077","547723","543659","552807","544208","543484","545086"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["net","fisherman","fishing","beachfront","expertise","familiarity","task","surf","reality","stance"]}
