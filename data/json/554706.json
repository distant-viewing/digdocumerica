{"path":"554706.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a rural scene set against a backdrop of lush, wooded mountains, with a prominent rounded peak in the center background. The foreground features a group of seven individuals, predominantly men and one woman, walking towards a modern-styled building. The group, dressed in casual attire like jeans and plaid shirts, seems to be engaged in an outdoor activity, possibly a field trip or a guided tour given their attentive posture.\n\nThe building they are approaching is single-story with a flat roof, surrounded by a grassy and partially rocky area. It features large windows and a blue-gray facade, suggesting functionality possibly as a visitor center or a scientific research station. The architecture stands out against the natural setting.\n\nSeveral 1970s-1980s era cars are parked outside the building, indicating the time period of the image or a gathering of some sort. The cars vary in model and color, adding a touch of everyday life to the scene. The overall feel is that of an educational or exploratory outing in a picturesque, mountainous location.","title":"Winter ski slope in the Adirondack Forest Preserve is unused during the remainder of the year at sit 'n bull ranch conservationists feel slopes should have multiple purpose uses to justify cutting the forest","placename":"Warrensburg (N.Y.)","location":"Warrensburg, New York","nn1":["551116","544853","558033","543236","557943","544389","557684","557985","542593","554667","554666","554699","544093","551413","551114","557947"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Golf"],"terms":["rounded","tour","out","trip","group","approach","functionality","sort","grassy","research"]}
