{"path":"550382.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image features a serene scene with five birds flying in silhouette against a gradient sky that transitions from a deep mauve to a lighter pink hue. The birds are arranged unevenly across the frame, highlighting a natural, spontaneous arrangement. Their wings are outstretched, and varied poses suggest they are captured mid-flight, possibly during migration or routine travel.\n\nThe backdrop lacks any discernible features such as clouds or the sun, offering a smooth, almost textural gradient that focuses attention on the birds. The simplistic yet evocative composition emphasizes themes of freedom and the beauty of nature.\n\nOverall, the photograph is minimalist, utilizing the contrast between the dark figures of the birds and the soft background colors to convey a peaceful yet dynamic snapshot of natural activity. The use of color and light suggests that the photo could have been taken during dawn or dusk, times known for their soft and often vibrant sky colors.","title":"Ducks fly south from the North Slope site where the Alaska pipeline will start.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["553875","554646","557203","544609","544605","550888","555013","544597","557209","557208","557204","550887","544601","544612","544834","550903"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","freedom","wing","flight","pose","travel","gradient","transition","dawn","arrangement"]}
