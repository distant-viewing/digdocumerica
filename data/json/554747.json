{"path":"554747.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene forest scene during early to mid-autumn, featuring a vibrant mixture of foliage and a flowing creek. The creek, filled with small white ripples and larger grey rocks, runs diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-center of the image. It is flanked on both sides by an array of deciduous trees and bushes showcasing a rich palette of seasonal colors; prominent shades include deep reds, bright yellows, and varying tones of green.\n\nThe right side foreground is dominated by bright red leaves, suggesting the presence of maples or similar species. Mixed in are splashes of yellow and green, likely from other types of trees and shrubs, which cover the entire spectrum of fall colors. On the left side of the creek, the foliage is more subtly colored, with yellows and light greens predominating, interspersed with hints of red.\n\nOverall, the lighting appears natural and the sun seems to illuminate the scene from the top-right corner of the frame, casting dappled light through the leaves and enhancing the textures of the water and stone. The sky is not visible, fully obscured by the dense canopy of leaves, making the forest feel enclosed and intimate. This picturesque setting captures the tranquil beauty typical of a forest creek during the fall season.","title":"Hardwood forest trees, including red maple, hang over a fine trout stream on the north branch of moose river","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Forest Preserve, New York","nn1":["554748","557823","551351","558085","555216","554737","555211","554738","555218","554753","552599","554715","552692","557821","554718","554756"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["creek","yellow","leave","forest","fall","predominat","spectrum","green","foliage","flanke"]}
