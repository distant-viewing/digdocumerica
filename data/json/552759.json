{"path":"552759.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a lively group of children standing behind a tall, vertical iron fence. The children, numbering about ten in total, appear jubilant and are variously positioned along the fence. They are smiling and engaging playfully with the camera by waving, making peace signs, and pulling playful faces.\n\nThe children are dressed in casual, colorful clothing typical of younger age groups, with several wearing bright jackets, t-shirts, and differently patterned pants. Their attire reflects a variety of styles, and some wear accessories like belts and watches. \n\nThe setting seems urban, evident from the concrete ground and sparse litter, including a discarded cup and bits of paper near the base of the fence. In the blurred background, there are hints of cars and possibly a red-bricked building, alluding to a neighborhood setting. \n\nIt is a daytime scene given the natural light illuminating the children and their surroundings. The atmosphere conveyed is one of joy and youthful energy, captured in a spontaneous, candid moment. The overall composition of the image, with the fence acting as a physical barrier yet unable to suppress the children's exuberant spirits, adds a dynamic and engaging element to the photograph.","title":"Playground","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556437","546857","552760","548488","556301","555901","556287","549865","556265","553510","553096","556163","556136","544354","554072","553512"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["child","fence","spirit","accessory","peace","cup","group","joy","act","pull"]}
