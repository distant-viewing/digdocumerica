{"path":"542923.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a majestic mountain landscape under what appears to be early morning or late afternoon light, given the soft, diffused light qualities and shadow placements across the scene. The perspective is from a high vantage point, looking out over multiple layers of forested mountain ridges. Each ridge fades progressively in color and contrast from dark foreground tones to lighter, more muted tones in the distant background, creating a dramatic sense of depth.\n\nThe valleys and lower parts of the mountains are blanketed thickly with cloud or fog, which adds to the ethereal and serene quality of the scene. The clouds at some parts are so dense that they obscure the bases of the mountains and create an impression of the peaks floating above a white sea.\n\nThe trees on the nearest ridges are visibly coniferous, potentially indicating a cooler climate or higher altitude. The overall color palette is cool, with blue and grey tones dominant, evoking a calm, tranquil atmosphere. The image composition effectively uses layers, natural light, and atmospheric perspective to draw the viewer's eye through the scene.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["554402","555131","544070","554398","546764","543023","555378","542676","554634","542848","550421","555110","555130","552695","550415","554647"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["ridge","mountain","basis","tone","perspective","layer","placement","quality","cloud","blanket"]}
