{"path":"552623.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a church during a service or a gathering. In the foreground, the backs of several congregants’ heads are visible as they are seated on wooden pews, facing the front of the church. The congregation appears attentive, focusing towards the front where a preacher is speaking.\n\nThe preacher, a man dressed in a dark suit, stands to the right of the image, gesturing with his right hand, likely engaged in delivering a sermon or address. Adjacent to him, on the church’s platform, there are four individuals seated behind a wooden railing; they are likely choir members or other church officials, dressed in blue and white robes.\n\nIn the background, the church's altar is visible, adorned with religious items including a gold-colored cross, several lit candles, an open book (possibly a Bible), and a bouquet of pink flowers adding a touch of color. Red carpeting can be seen on the platform, and there are various religious and possibly patriotic decorations including stained glass windows and an American flag.\n\nOverall, the environment conveys a traditional and serene atmosphere typical of a religious service, with the congregation engaged in listening to the preacher. The church interior is characterized by its historic or traditional architectural elements, contributing to a solemn and respectful setting.","title":"The united methodist-presbyterian church is one of Rifle's larger churches","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["558404","558406","558388","558400","556238","545377","558383","558384","558382","558390","545381","558407","558391","558239","558389","558026"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["church","congregation","platform","service","candle","altar","official","pew","robe","deliver"]}
