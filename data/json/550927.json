{"path":"550927.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph captures a rather unusual scene outdoors. In the foreground, there is a ceramic toilet bowl positioned on a grassy area. The bowl appears to be discarded or perhaps repurposed as a quirky planter, as it contains dirt and a yellow flower growing out from it. The toilet itself is damaged, with a visible crack and a piece missing from its edge, suggesting it has been discarded.\n\nThe grass around the toilet is somewhat overgrown and littered with various pieces of garbage. Visible trash includes crumpled paper, a fabric scrap, and an aluminum can, which adds to the disarray and sense of neglect of the scene.\n\nThe background is not distinctly visible due to the focus on the toilet and the immediate surrounding area. However, the grassy field extends into the distance indicating that the setting is an open outdoor space, likely an uncultivated field or perhaps a neglected urban space. The overall atmosphere evoked by the scene might comment on themes of environmental disregard or surrealism in everyday life.","title":"The life force--West Beach","placename":"Galveston (Tex.)","location":"Galveston, Texas","nn1":["550926","549788","549789","552102","546946","551246","547775","552741","550801","547039","556158","549843","550353","553530","552075","552078"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["bowl","discard","disregard","comment","neglect","repurpose","aluminum","planter","crumple","piece"]}
