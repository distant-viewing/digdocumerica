{"path":"555904.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph features a young person walking on a street, captured in a moment that seems full of purpose and attitude. The individual is dressed in a casual, stylish manner typically reflective of urban youth culture from past decades. The person is wearing tight jeans and a sleeveless shirt featuring a heart-shaped graphic. Adding a distinctive touch to the ensemble is a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses, suggesting a fashion-conscious attitude or possibly a shield against the bright sun.\n\nIn the background, there's a worn-out, two-tone station wagon parked alongside the streetâ€”the car's yellow and brown paint job showing signs of rust and wear, indicating either age or neglect. The tires appear deflated, and the general state of the vehicle implies a long-standing parking spot on this urban roadside.\n\nThe street itself appears unkempt with some disarray. Litter and leaves are scattered on the pavement and the curbside, indicating a less maintained urban environment. The sidewalk adjacent to the car features dilapidated tiles and broken patches, contributing to the gritty aesthetic of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment that could suggest themes of youth culture, urban decay, individual expression, or a snapshot of everyday life in a city environment from a bygone era.","title":"Young Latin male in Paterson, New Jersey's, inner city. The inner city today is an absolute contradiction to the mainstream America of gas stations, expressways, shopping centers and tract homes, it is populated by blacks, Latins and the white poor. Most of all, the inner city environment is human beings, as beautiful and threatened as the 19th century buildings.","placename":"Paterson (N.J.)","location":"Paterson, New Jersey","nn1":["545331","552756","551926","551124","554178","553488","545351","556214","552763","543471","545415","545321","547141","543947","555909","552965"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["youth","culture","street","shield","ensemble","job","graphic","heart","disarray","tile"]}
