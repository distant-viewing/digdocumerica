{"path":"557521.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a rural agricultural scene with two people working in a vast field. In the foreground, there is a large tractor to the left, equipped with what appears to be a tank, possibly for fertilization or pesticide application. The tractor is blue and white, with a person operating it who is wearing a short-sleeved shirt and shorts, indicative of warm weather. \n\nTo the right of the tractor, there is a smaller, four-wheeled vehicle that seems to be carrying planting equipment and supplies. This vehicle is being driven by another individual wearing a red shirt, who appears to be overseeing or managing the planting operation. They are surrounded by the dark soil of the field, which is dotted with small plants, suggesting early stages of crop growth.\n\nThe background is hazy, likely due to dust or mist in the air, with a faint hint of trees lining the horizon. The overall atmosphere is one of gritty agricultural productivity, emphasizing the expansive and somewhat arduous nature of farm work. The image has a slightly faded quality, suggesting it might have been taken several years ago.","title":"Planting a crop on Oxnard Plain, a prime agricultural area now being developed for housing near Oxnard, California, north of Los Angeles. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressure. Restrictions on coastal development within 1,000 yards of the shoreline were tightened with the passage of the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November, 1972.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544319","553665","545893","554204","555619","548903","544888","555878","555879","542654","557753","547436","548950","554108","542533","547297"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["tractor","planting","pesticide","application","productivity","supply","field","year","dust","crop"]}
