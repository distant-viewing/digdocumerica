{"path":"546147.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph depicts a peaceful and well-maintained cemetery. In the foreground, numerous graves are visible, many marked with headstones that are rectangular and polished, with names and other inscriptions engraved on them. One prominent headstone in the foreground reads \"NEWSOME.\" Several graves are adorned with colorful flower arrangements in hues of yellow, red, and blue, adding a touch of vibrancy to the scene.\n\nThe cemetery is laid out on a lush green lawn, and the area is opened with a long fence in the background that appears to be made of iron, providing a boundary for the site. Beyond the fence, industrial structures can be seen, including a tall crane or hoisting device, suggesting that the cemetery is located near a more urban or industrial area. The contrast between the serene, manicured burial ground and the industrial equipment in the distance creates a poignant juxtaposition.\n\nAdditionally, the sky above is overcast, casting a soft diffuse light over the scene, which enhances the somber and tranquil mood of the cemetery. Trees line the back and sides of the area, contributing to the sense of seclusion and privacy in this final resting place.","title":"Oil derrick in cemetery","placename":"Kilgore (Tex.)","location":"Kilgore, Texas","nn1":["550364","557942","555566","547417","557184","547420","546168","552017","550731","552451","544267","547801","552683","545322","557089","554792"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["cemetery","headstone","grave","fence","inscription","privacy","iron","seclusion","vibrancy","boundary"]}
