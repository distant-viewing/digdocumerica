{"path":"543088.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a coastal region. The central focus is on a long stretch of beach, with waves breaking in parallel lines along the shore. The water is a deep blue interspersed with the white of the breaking waves. Scattered across the entire span of the shoreline are numerous rocky outcroppings, some small and some significantly larger, surrounded by the sea.\n\nIn the upper part of the image, you can observe a more forested area that gently slopes down towards the coast. This region appears to be denser with greenery and interspersed with clearings. Toward the top-right corner, there appears to be a more developed area with small structures or houses visible, clustering near the coastline and slightly inland, suggesting a small coastal community.\n\nThe sky above is somewhat overcast, lending a moody atmosphere to the scene, and enhancing the vibrancy of the natural colors of the landscapeâ€”such as the deep blues of the ocean and the rich green tones of the forested hillside. The overall composition underscores the vastness and untouched beauty of this coastal environment, highlighting the interaction between land and sea.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["543328","554023","553983","543427","543430","557453","545106","557466","543090","543085","554156","556982","545230","543045","545129","545122"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["wafe","intersperse","breaking","outcropping","blue","sea","region","denser","coast","underscore"]}
