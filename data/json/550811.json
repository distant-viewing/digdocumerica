{"path":"550811.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of pollution in a natural water body. In the foreground, there's a discarded Pepsi can floating among other debris and decaying plant matter in dark blue-tinted water. Surrounding the can are scattered pieces of sticks and partially submerged vegetation. Tall green reed-like plants ascend from the bottom edge, framing the image and partially obscuring the view. In the middle ground, additional trash can be seen floating on the water, including a prominent white container lying on its side. The background is less focused, contributing to a sense of depth and helping to emphasize the foreground pollution. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of neglect and environmental degradation.","title":"Pepsi can floats on the Wisconsin River at Merrill","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550807","550812","550806","544647","547524","547537","552100","552811","555784","544175","550800","543302","552127","550805","550352","543877"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollution","matter","stick","reed","plant","degradation","trash","container","neglect","water"]}
