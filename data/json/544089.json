{"path":"544089.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph features two people walking through a rugged, arid landscape. The setting is dominated by a vast, dry valley with rocky mountains in the background, suggesting a desert or semi-desert environment. The ground is covered in sparse vegetation and strewn with rocks and boulders, which adds to the rough and barren appearance of the terrain.\n\nThe individuals, likely adults, are walking along a dirt path or a natural trail. Both are dressed in light clothing suitable for a hot environment, wearing trousers and short-sleeved shirts. One individual appears to have a hat for sun protection.\n\nThe sky above is clear and deeply blue, indicating a sunny, cloudless day, which enhances the starkness of the landscape. The mountains behind are large and imposing, creating a dramatic backdrop. The light and shadows on the mountains suggest it could be midday or early afternoon.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes the vastness and isolation of the natural environment, with human figures that appear small and distant within the expansive landscape.","title":"Tailings piles at the Anaconda Co.'s Twin Buttes mine","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["545772","545751","544903","543842","545592","544330","545575","545702","549037","544404","545700","545762","545759","545768","544305","545763"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["mountain","starkness","walk","protection","boulder","midday","impose","strew","trail","trouser"]}
