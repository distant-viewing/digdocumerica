{"path":"543890.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph depicts an overhead view of an urban street scene where two individuals are walking. The background features asphalt with numerous scattered papers and what appears to be trash. The two individuals are men, walking past each other in opposite directions near a street lamp that also has a traffic light attached to it. One man is dressed in a more casual, light-colored outfit with a white shirt and darker pants, holding what seems like a briefcase or a small suitcase. The other man is in a more formal, darker suit with a coat over his arm, and he also carries a briefcase.\n\nParticularly striking is the disarray of papers strewn about the street, suggesting a chaotic or hurried event might have occurred prior. There is also a noticeable white line on the street indicating vehicular boundaries. The scene is devoid of any vehicles, and no other pedestrians are visible in the immediate vicinity, adding to the focused isolation of the two men in the image. The general sense of the photograph provides a snapshot of urban life, possibly capturing a moment of individual routines amidst a surrounding disarray.","title":"Magazines and newspapers litter the intersection of sixth & broadway after debris was spilled from a passing truck","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["556733","551856","549784","545415","549812","551872","543886","550130","549907","556199","549277","551933","556226","546551","546419","547695"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["briefcase","disarray","street","paper","suitcase","man","walk","asphalt","routine","occur"]}
