{"path":"543515.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph captures a family enjoying a day by a lake. In the foreground, a man with a beard, wearing red swimming shorts and brown boots, is seen lifting a small child into the air. Both are smiling, sharing a playful moment. The child, who appears to be wearing a white diaper or small shorts, is being held up high by the man, seemingly in mid-air.\n\nTo the left, a woman in a colorful one-piece bathing suit stands watching the scene. She is slightly bending forward, her hands clasped together near her knees, smiling broadly at the interaction between the man and the child.\n\nThe background of the scene features a tranquil lake with gentle ripples on the water surface. On the opposite shore, a forested area with trees showing hints of autumn colors can be seen. Additionally, there's a small boat visible in the distance on the lake, adding a recreational feel to the scene.\n\nThe setting is serene, likely late afternoon given the soft, warm lighting and long shadows cast on the sandy beach where the family is standing. The composition of the image emphasizes a moment of joy and family bonding in an idyllic natural setting.","title":"Family enjoying Lake Tahoe State Park.
