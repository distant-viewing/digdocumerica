{"path":"552431.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a flooded forest area with strikingly red-tinted water, possibly due to iron oxide or pollutants. The water surface is mostly calm, reflecting the blue sky and the thin, leafless trees towering above. These trees, bare of leaves and appearing somewhat desolate, stand tall against a backdrop of denser green foliage. The ground is not visible under the reddish water that covers it, suggesting the flood's depth. There are also patches of white and yellowish substances floating on the water, which could be natural foam, pollutants, or decomposed plant material. The sky is partially visible at the top of the photograph, showing glimpses of blue sky and fluffy white clouds. Overall, the scene conveys a sense of stillness yet also hints at environmental disturbance.","title":"After strip mining, a finely pulverized coal, or \"slurry,\" is left on the stripped land. Water that runs off from the slurry, and from the mining operation itself, can produce colorful, but often deadly, effects on the flora in its path, as in this scene near a mine in St. David, in Fulton County.","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552438","552429","552853","550832","552847","552440","548587","550950","552834","546111","551077","552430","552843","549641","544804","550368"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["pollutant","flood","iron","substance","disturbance","foam","water","stillness","glimpse","leave"]}
