{"path":"554941.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from what appears to be a butcher shop or meat processing area. An older man, who seems to be a worker in the facility, is featured prominently in the image. He is dressed in a light-colored long-sleeve shirt, white apron, and a red baseball cap, giving him the appearance of a seasoned professional in this setting. He is holding what looks like a large, dark-skinned cut of meat or an animal carcass in one hand, while with his other hand, he supports it by holding onto a metallic round object, possibly a hook or handle for maneuvering the meat.\n\nThe background is dimly lit but reveals other similar large pieces of meat hanging from hooks, indicating a cold storage or preparation area typically seen in butcheries. On the left side, there is slightly brighter lighting, and boxes and possibly other butcher supplies can be glimpsed, creating a busy and utilitarian atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the setting underscores a work environment focused on the processing of meat, with necessary tools and protective clothing for handling raw products, reflecting the daily operations within a traditional butcher shop or meat processing unit.","title":"Fur skins being prepared at a buying shed in Leakey, Texas near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552633","552634","552632","554945","546133","545065","548867","545064","554944","554675","545202","546094","548952","550320","558350","544026"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["meat","hook","processing","shop","professional","apron","round","cut","baseball","supply"]}
