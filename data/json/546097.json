{"path":"546097.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"In the photograph, the focal point is a middle-aged man standing in the foreground. He wears glasses, a broad-brimmed hat, and a plaid shirt layered under a light jacket. A cigar is clenched in his mouth, and his hands are casually in his pockets. Behind him, the environment is that of a small town's main street, capturing a slice of Americana.\n\nThe man stands on a wide street that divides the composition horizontally. The street is lined with parked cars from a bygone era, indicative of the late 1960s or early 1970s based on the vehicle designs visible. This includes a mix of sedans and station wagons in subdued colors.\n\nOn the right side of the image, you can see a row of single-story commercial buildings. A prominent sign reads \"Bruce's Super Market,\" indicating the local business area. Other visible signs and storefronts suggest a self-contained, tightly-knit community likely dependent on local commerce. The market's facade is modest with a wide entrance and large windows.\n\nThe street is not bustling but carries a quiet presence of a few pedestrians and a sense of daily life in progress. The weather appears to be overcast, as the light is soft and diffuse without harsh shadows.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is balanced between the person in immediate focus and the broader scene of the town behind, offering a narrative of small-town life in mid-20th century America.","title":"Main street of Leakey","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["551106","550114","547310","553176","545351","543030","546672","547007","547329","556214","556733","545401","545614","554945","549019","550136"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["town","street","self","pocket","storefront","knit","commerce","progress","brim","wagon"]}
