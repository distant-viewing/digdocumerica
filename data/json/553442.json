{"path":"553442.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This image captures a leisurely scene at a lake during what seems to be a warm day. In the foreground, a person is paddling a small, inflatable orange boat through the water. The calm and glossy surface of the lake reflects subtle ripples around the boat. \n\nAt the center of the photograph, a wooden raft floats on the lake, hosting a group of six people. The group appears engaged in casual conversation or perhaps preparing for a swim. They are dressed in swimwear which suggests the recreational nature of their gathering.\n\nThe background features a lush lakeside setting with dense trees. Across the lake, a slightly blurred landscape with houses partially hidden by foliage can be observed, giving a sense of a secluded and peaceful residential lake area. The soft focus and the tranquility of the scene emphasize a relaxed, summertime atmosphere, typical of a lakeside retreat.","title":"Here at Clinton, in the first quarter mile from its origin below the Wachusett Reservoir, the Nashua River is still safe for swimming.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553445","543881","546856","558233","553440","552982","550236","551543","543892","554610","543579","543943","550674","554552","544442","552316"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["lake","summertime","swimwear","raft","swim","retreat","boat","lakeside","group","ripple"]}
