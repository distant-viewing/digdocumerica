{"path":"547298.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a highway scene in a rural setting, possibly taken from an elevated or hillside perspective. The highway is split into two sections, each running parallel with multiple lanes, separated by a grassy median. The view shows vehicles, including cars and trucks, traveling in both directions.\n\nThe road curves gently through rolling hills, which are covered in green grass and show signs of agricultural activity, such as plowed fields. On the right side of the image, there's a large sign that is partially legible and might be an advertisement or a directional sign. The landscape surrounding the highway features open fields with some patches of shrubs and small trees.\n\nThe image has a slight underexposure, giving it a moody and somewhat dark appearance, which enhances the contrast between the brightly lit highway and the surrounding darker terrain. The overall atmosphere suggests a tranquil rural transportation route, perhaps taken during late afternoons or early evenings.","title":"Interstate 80 passes through a stretch of rolling farmland 10 miles west of Lincoln.","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547302","547294","554566","557430","557471","549890","546733","554127","545367","548144","556405","555630","555437","546603","554130","546720"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["highway","median","parallel","sign","field","route","advertisement","hillside","lane","curve"]}
