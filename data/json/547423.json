{"path":"547423.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a middle-aged man standing in the doorway of a building under a sign that reads \"CHRISTIAN SERVICE\". The building has a red brick façade, and the doorway where the man stands has a dark interior visible in the background. The man is wearing glasses, a dark collared shirt, and his arms are crossed. He appears to be leaning slightly forward while looking directly at the camera with a serious expression.\n\nAbove him, the sign is large and prominently displayed, with white lettering on a black background. The sign includes an additional note on the right side that says \"MADE IN U.S.A.\" The top right corner of the image has a date mark, \"JUN 70\", suggesting the photograph was taken or processed in June 1970. The overall mood is somewhat solemn and straightforward, focusing attention on the man and the sign above him.","title":"Owner carl christian, 67, in doorway of his gas station in beaver crossing.
