{"path":"543340.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image depicts a stunning coastal landscape. In the foreground, rocky cliffs jut dramatically into a vibrant blue sea. The cliffs are rugged and steep, and the waves below crash against them, creating white foam. On the cliff edge, there's a charming building with a flat roof, seamlessly blending into the natural landscape with its earth-toned exterior and covered in parts by greenery.\n\nA winding path lined with low stone walls and bright flowering plants leads to this building, suggesting it's accessible yet secluded. The vegetation around is diverse, featuring small bushes and some trees, which are likely adapted to withstand the coastal winds and salt spray.\n\nIn the background, across the bay, the coastline continues with similar rocky formations and is dotted with greenery and trees. The sky is clear and cloudless, suggesting a perfect sunny day. The overall composition of the photograph, with its blend of natural beauty and quaint human construction, conveys a serene and picturesque seaside scene.","title":"Southern California -- Carmel Highlands","placename":"Carmel (Calif.)","location":"Carmel, California","nn1":["543184","545110","543291","543346","543337","543428","543426","543049","543080","545129","543297","545125","545222","543334","543249","545934"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["cliff","salt","spray","foam","greenery","bay","coastline","wind","exterior","bush"]}
