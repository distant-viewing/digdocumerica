{"path":"549386.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and dynamic sailing scene on a body of water. The focal point of the image is a small sailboat with three individuals aboard. The boat features a white hull and is equipped with two sails: a main sail marked with the letter 'V' and a number '88', and a large green spinnaker that balloons out towards the viewer, adding a vivid splash of color against the blue water.\n\nThe sea around the sailboat is a deep blue, indicating open waters, possibly in an ocean or large lake setting. The sky is slightly overcast, giving a soft, diffused light to the scene which highlights the textures and colors of the sails and the water.\n\nOn the sailboat, one individual is prominently seated at the stern, looking relaxed and directly at the viewer, wearing a sleeveless top and patterned shorts. They have shoulder-length dark hair and appear content, possibly chatting with the others or enjoying the moment. The other two people are more obscure; one appears to be handling the boat's rigging, focusing on the task, and the other is seated, blending slightly into the background, wearing casual, light sailing attire.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo conveys a sense of leisurely adventure and enjoyment of sailing, framed by the natural beauty of the sea, and capturing an intimate moment of interaction among the sailboat's crew.","title":"Contender in the Annapolis-Newport race on Chesapeake Bay in the early hours of the race.
