{"path":"552781.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Lodge, Frank","caption":"This photograph captures two men standing outside, engaged in a discussion over a large architectural plan they are both holding and examining. The man on the left is older, with combed gray hair, wearing glasses, a dark suit, a red tie, and a white shirt. The man on the right is balding, also wearing glasses, and dressed in a dark suit with a patterned tie and a white shirt.\n\nThe scene is set against an urban backdrop featuring a brick building with modern architecture that includes large, dark-framed windows. In the background, other individuals, presumably business professionals based on their attire of suits and ties, are seen interacting. There are also a couple of cars parked nearby.\n\nThe atmosphere appears to be serious and business-like, with a focus on the task at hand, which likely involves discussions related to building or development plans. The day is overcast, contributing to the subdued lighting of the photograph.","title":"Exhibit at the first symposium on low pollution power systems development held at the Marriott Motor Inn, Ann Arbor.
