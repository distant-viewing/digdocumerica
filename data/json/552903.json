{"path":"552903.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"The photograph depicts a vast natural landscape under a clear sky. The foreground is filled with dense, varied vegetation, showcasing a myriad of greens and browns. This gives way to a wide, flat, open space that stretches into the distance, lightly covered with grass or small plants, suggesting an expanse of plain or prairie.\n\nThe midground is dominated by rolling hills or low mountains, which are devoid of any significant vegetation, appearing as smooth, rounded forms rising gently from the plain. These hills add a textural contrast to the textured, rugged flora prominent in the foreground.\n\nIn the background, the sky is abundantly clear and blue, with a few soft, wispy clouds scattered overhead. The lighting in the photograph suggests it was taken either in the late morning or early afternoon due to the well-lit and vivid visibility of the landscape.\n\nThe overall composition of the image focuses on the tranquility and untouched beauty of a natural, rural environment, possibly hinting at its ecological value or its peaceful solitude, far from urban development. There are no visible human figures or artificial structures, emphasizing the pristine and isolated nature of the scene.","title":"Bunchgrass and grease wood on the shores of Pyramid Lake","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["556990","549238","552914","549186","549236","555671","550604","549155","557189","549218","549141","548025","549156","557099","552582","550441"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["prairie","value","myriad","hill","flora","midground","way","visibility","vegetation","solitude"]}
