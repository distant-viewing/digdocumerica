{"path":"545441.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph features a lineup of tall industrial chimneys emitting thick, voluminous clouds of pinkish-gray smoke into the air. The scene is set against a slightly overcast sky, filled with both darker and lighter cloud formations. The industrial chimneys, perhaps part of a factory or power plant, are solid structures with ladders visible on one of the columns, hinting at their large scale and the functionality of access.\n\nThe smoke billowing from the chimneys blends into the sky, creating a dramatic and environmental impact visual. The poles of the chimneys are uniform in height and shape, indicating a systematic and planned industrial setup. The bottom part of the image shows a partial view of the roof of a structure or perhaps a hill, suggesting that the photographerâ€™s vantage point is from a higher elevation, looking down slightly towards the chimneys.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a powerful industrial landscape scene, focusing on the pollution aspect, with a poignant display of smoke emissions and their potential impact on the environment.","title":"U.S. steel chimneys emit smoke 24 hours a day.","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545491","550992","550998","545472","546760","545435","550981","551054","557301","550983","550938","553841","551052","550987","550871","557299"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["chimney","smoke","lineup","photographer","ladder","impact","plan","cloud","functionality","elevation"]}
