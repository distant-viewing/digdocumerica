{"path":"551699.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph appears to capture a vibrant community event or market possibly set in an urban square or street. Urban buildings line the backdrop, featuring classic architectural details and large windows, presenting a stark contrast with the bright, sunny day.\n\nThe center and foreground of the image are filled with numerous potted plants and flowers, possibly part of a flower sale or outdoor market. These are arranged casually across the pavement, adding splashes of vivid color to the setting.\n\nThere are many individuals in the scene, dressed in varied styles indicating a casual, community-based event. People are engaged in different activities, such as walking, talking, and browsing the flower pots. There is a mix of adults and a couple of visible children, contributing to a lively and informal atmosphere.\n\nOn the left, an older woman dressed distinctively in a traditional or historical outfit—possibly a bonnet and a long, yellow dress—stands out against the more contemporary clothing of the others. This attire might suggest she is playing a specific role in the event, perhaps related to some historical or cultural celebration or as part of an educational activity.\n\nThe overall ambiance is that of a social, sunny day in a communal urban space where locals gather for leisure and perhaps to buy plants. The image vibrantly captures a moment of community interaction and cultural color in an urban setting.","title":"Spring flower sale, held in a parking lot on East 30th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues.
