{"path":"549412.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a scene on a traditional-style sailboat with various passengers and a crew member interacting on deck. The boat features a bright red hull with decorative elements and black and red trim, and it has at least one large sail supported by a wooden mast. There are ropes and riggings visible, typical of sailboats, which some of the passengers are handling or observing.\n\nThe passengers, a mix of men and women, appear engaged in a leisure activity. One woman, wearing blue attire and sunglasses, is looking up towards the sail, possibly adjusting or holding a rope with the guidance of the man next to her, who is dressed in a striped shirt. Another man at the center, shirtless with dark hair, is actively handling another part of the sail or boat equipment. Other passengers are scattered around the deck, watching or assisting in the activities.\n\nThe background shows a waterfront cityscape with various buildings along the shore, suggesting this activity is taking place in a harbor or near a populated area. The sky is clear, indicating nice weather, conducive to sailing.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of casual recreational sailing with a group of people actively participating in the experience or enjoying the ride on a traditional, vibrantly colored boat. The atmosphere is lively and cooperative, set against a calm urban backdrop.","title":"Viking image on Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549415","549410","547465","548503","548524","549392","549397","547458","549413","548513","549386","549355","547453","548509","549373","548508"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["passenger","sail","sailing","sailboat","rope","deck","boat","guidance","rigging","crew"]}
