{"path":"555475.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an urban scene featuring a gleaming, dark-colored vintage car, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s. The car is depicted from the front left angle, allowing clear visibility of its shiny chrome bumper, circular headlights, and a prominent grill. A mature man, likely in his 50s or 60s, is seated in the back seat of the car, visible through the open window. He has a composed expression and is wearing a suit, suggesting a figure of some formal or official importance.\n\nThe background shows a bustling street scene that reflects an earlier era, judging by the style of dress and the architecture. Several onlookers stand on the sidewalk, observing the car. These bystanders are dressed in coats and various styles of 20th century fashion. The architecture of the surrounding buildings appears mid-century, with a mix of commercial and possibly residential structures.\n\nThe ambiance of the scene conveys a moment of transit or arrival, possibly associated with an event given the attention the car and its passenger are receiving. The setting has a somewhat overcast lighting, indicating either an early or late time of day or simply a cloudy weather condition. The presence of other cars and pedestrians gives the photo a lively urban feel, suggesting a city environment.","title":"Oregon governor tom mccall takes delivery of a smaller car with better gas mileage as his official auto.
