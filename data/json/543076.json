{"path":"543076.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a man fishing at a pebbly shoreline, standing beside a large, open net filled with a small catch of fish. The man is dressed in outdoor gear, including a water-resistant jacket and boots, suitable for wet maritime environments. His expression appears focused and content as he looks off to the side, possibly observing the ocean or surrounding environment.\n\nThe net, prominently featured in the foreground, is spread out on the dark, pebble-covered beach, revealing several fish that have been caught. These fish are silver, slender, and small, suggesting they might be a type of schooling fish like sardines or herring.\n\nThe backdrop includes a turbulent sea with waves crashing ashore, under a grey, overcast sky, indicating possibly chilly or inclement weather. There are also several birds in flight above the water, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise somber seaside setting.\n\nOverall, the scene is a portrayal of a simple yet enduring method of fishing, set against the rugged beauty of a stony beach and a moody maritime climate.","title":"Smelt fisherman with catch on Gold Bluff Beach","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543033","543077","545085","543232","550297","552274","546360","553812","544714","545212","552271","545086","552321","552320","548189","545306"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["fish","net","catch","inclement","beach","seaside","method","pebble","crash","endure"]}
