{"path":"557983.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a lush, grassy outdoor area, characterized by a natural, green environment. In the foreground on the left-hand side, a wooden sign prominently displays the text “FOOT TRAILS FOR YOUR ENJOYMENT” and below, “SPRING HOLLOW 1.8 MILES.” The sign, painted in dark hues with yellow lettering, appears to be slightly worn and blends into the natural surroundings. \n\nBehind the sign and slightly to the right, there are two people involved in a playful activity. One adult male, wearing a dark brown tank top and jeans, is playfully lifting a child into the air. The child, who seems to be enjoying the game, is wearing a yellow top. Their dynamic movement suggests a joyful interaction in the serene setting.\n\nThe background features dense greenery, probably trees and bushes, which suggests that this area is quite secluded and rich in vegetation. The lighting indicates that it could be either late afternoon or a day with soft sunlight, casting gentle shadows across the scene.\n\nOverall, this image presents a cheerful moment of family interaction in a beautiful, natural park setting, emphasizing leisure and the enjoyment of nature.","title":"Hikers follow a trail through wooded, hilly terrain in the Akron, Ohio, metropolitan park system at spring hollow on Akron-Peninsula road north of the city.
