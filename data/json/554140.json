{"path":"554140.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a rugged and textured volcanic landscape. The ground is covered in what appears to be solidified lava with a rough, uneven surface that has a dark, somewhat shiny appearance. There are numerous ridges, grooves, and folds in the terrain, suggesting it might have been in a molten state before cooling and solidifying into the shapes visible now. \n\nThe terrain is primarily characterized by a mixture of jagged edges and smoother, shinier patches, accentuating the complex process of lava cooling. There are no visible signs of vegetation or life; the environment appears desolate and harsh.\n\nIn the background, the sky is obscured by a dense line of clouds or smoke along the horizon, hinting at possible ongoing volcanic activity or environmental conditions related to the volcano. The colors in the photograph are mostly dark and monochromatic, emphasizing shades of black and gray, which adds to the dramatic and stark nature of the volcanic landscape. There is a subtle glare from the sun, indicating either a setting or rising sun, which adds a bit of brightness to the otherwise dark terrain.","title":"Sunlight reflected from lava flow from recent eruption of the volcanic mountain mauna ulu","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554141","544694","550813","555227","555158","555885","552424","555084","550482","551284","552423","555886","554090","555793","543148","544682"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["lava","jagged","terrain","emphasizing","glare","groove","cool","cooling","sun","fold"]}
