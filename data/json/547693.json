{"path":"547693.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures a construction scene where manual labor and heavy equipment are prominently featured. In the foreground, a worker is focused on operating a jackhammer. The worker, wearing a dark, dirt-stained coverall and a green helmet, is bent over the tool, which is piercing into the pavement, generating visible debris and dust. The worker's face is obscured by the helmet and his position as he looks down at his task.\n\nTo the left in the background, a line of street lamps follows the curve of the road, alongside which is positioned heavy construction machinery, including a crane with a long boom and a heavy-duty, yellow earth-moving vehicle. The presence of these machines suggests an extensive construction or infrastructure project.\n\nThe setting is an urban or semi-urban environment as indicated by the paved road and organized street lighting, but the scene appears distinctly utilitarian with no ornamental vegetation or structures in sight. The weather appears overcast, casting a consistent but subdued light over the scene, which enhances the industrial ambiance of the photograph. The cloud-filled sky and absence of vibrant colors add to the gritty, work-focused nature of the image.","title":"Reinforcing roadbed of Sheridan Road bordering Lake Michigan in the Evanston area","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["557735","551951","546252","549309","547498","556893","546815","557479","545665","553382","544828","547240","547181","555561","550274","552814"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["worker","construction","helmet","sight","boom","street","pavement","project","duty","dust"]}
