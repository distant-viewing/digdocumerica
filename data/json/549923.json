{"path":"549923.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban scene that appears to be from the late 1960s or early 1970s, judging from the fashion and style. It features a diverse group of people, likely pedestrians, crossing a street or walking along a wide path.\n\nIn the image, there are approximately sixteen individuals visible, both male and female, dressed in various styles that reflect the fashion of the period. Some of the men are wearing suits, one with a hat, while others are in more casual attire such as polo shirts and trousers. The women wear a variety of outfits ranging from dresses and skirts to trench coats and pantsuits. The clothing features a mix of solid colors and popular patterns of the time, such as plaids and florals.\n\nSeveral individuals are carrying items; handbags, shopping bags, and books are most noticeable. There is also a general sense of movement in the image, as most people seem to be in motion, walking in different directions with expressions ranging from engaged conversation to forward-focused, perhaps indicative of a busy day.\n\nThe setting is urban, characterized by a smooth pavement surface underfoot and what might be the edge of a street or a wide pedestrian area flanked by city buildings. The lighting in the photograph suggests it might be midday due to the shadows directly underneath the pedestrians, indicating strong overhead sunlight.\n\nOverall, the image gives a vibrant snapshot of city life, capturing the fashion, motion, and communal atmosphere of a past era.","title":"Commuters entering the terminal of the Staten Island Ferry","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["553184","556808","549906","548369","545231","548368","551835","556199","547788","553155","551124","546626","553183","546600","548399","556710"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["fashion","pedestrian","motion","polo","trench","handbag","shopping","city","street","pavement"]}
