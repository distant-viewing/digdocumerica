{"path":"543248.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic, nature-rich moment, depicting two individuals likely exploring or hiking in a rugged coastal terrain. The image is backlit, highlighting the outlines and creating a silhouette effect against a bright background, possibly of the sea or a bright sky.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by a rocky and uneven path covered with small, dense shrubbery and patches of wildflowers in a variety of colors, including yellows and oranges. Jagged rocks characterize the left side of the image, further emphasizing the wild and natural environment.\n\nThe two individuals in the photo appear to be engaging actively with their surroundings, possibly walking or exploring the area. The person leading seems to be gesturing to something in the distance, possibly pointing out a feature of interest or directing the second person's attention to something specific. Their casual attire suggests a leisurely, rather than intensive, activity is likely taking place.\n\nIn the background, the ocean or a large body of water merges at the horizon with a slightly lighter sky, adding a sense of vastness and tranquility to the scene. The overall composition and natural lighting evoke a sense of adventure and connection with nature.","title":"California--Rocky Point","placename":"Rocky Point (Calif.)","location":"Rocky Point, California","nn1":["543416","543316","545768","545751","543492","545772","545763","544903","543203","554503","544305","554513","543389","554504","545700","554672"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["shrubbery","wildflower","person","adventure","yellow","connection","outline","interest","orange","vastness"]}
