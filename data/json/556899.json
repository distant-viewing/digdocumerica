{"path":"556899.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial activity, likely focusing on railroad track maintenance or construction. The image shows several men working at a railway site littered with equipment and machinery that indicates ongoing work.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a set of railroad tracks partially covered with gravel. One person is standing inside these tracks, operating what appears to be a pneumatic hammer or similar tool which is being used on the tracks or ties. Several other individuals, wearing hard hats and safety gear, are gathered around the workings, either assisting or supervising the operation.\n\nTo the left of the image, two more workers are engaged near a station wagon-like vehicle on the tracks, outfitted with equipment and tools, perhaps serving a specific purpose related to track work.\n\nThe most prominent machinery in the photograph is a large, yellow backhoe situated to the right side of the frame. This backhoe is on the tracks, and it looks positioned to either remove debris or assist in the track installation or repair. The operator sits inside the cab of the backhoe, manoeuvring it.\n\nThe environment around the railroad appears to be an industrial zone or an outdoor construction area as there is visible detritus, including timber logs and additional track segments or scrap materials. Trees and open skies can be seen in the background, suggesting that the location might be on the outskirts of an urban area or within a more isolated sectional depot or construction space. The photograph likely captures a moment of rigorous labor and coordination, emphasizing the physical and technical effort required in railway maintenance or construction.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way crew, use machinery to remove and replace old railroad ties while improving the roadbed. The maximum safe speed for virtually all the company's 10,531 miles of track is 60 miles per hour. That contrasts with another company which had some track with a maximum safe speed of eight miles per hour. In 1974 Southern spent 18.6 percent of its revenue on track maintenance, the highest in the industry.","placename":"Alexandria (Va.)","location":"Alexandria, Virginia","nn1":["556871","556883","556894","556895","556878","556886","556885","556872","556881","556884","556890","556869","555561","556897","556901","556861"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["track","railroad","construction","assist","railway","tool","maintenance","depot","work","coordination"]}
