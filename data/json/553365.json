{"path":"553365.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"The photograph captures a close view of a group of showy orchis flowers (Galearis spectabilis), also known as showy orchid, in a natural woodland setting. The scene focuses on several clusters of these small, delicate flowers that feature pink and white hues. Each flower emerges from a green, broad, ovate leaf at ground level, using thin stems that lift the flowers slightly above the leafy base.\n\nThe leaves are smooth, glossy, and predominantly occupy the lower third of the image, creating a rich green carpet. The flowers themselves are arranged in a somewhat rising pattern from left to right along the stems. They have a noticeable two-tone coloration, with pink hoods and white lips, contrasting beautifully against the green foliage.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, which emphasizes the sharpness of the flowers in the foreground. The bokeh effect highlights hints of brown and additional green tones, suggesting a forest floor covered with decaying leaves and other organic matter. The natural light appears to be filtering through a canopy, softly illuminating the flowers and leaves, enhancing their colors and textures.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph centers on capturing the intricate details and vibrant colors of the showy orchis in its native habitat, while gently situating them within the discreet charm and hushed tones of a forest setting.","title":"One of the many kinds of wild flowers growing on the shore of the Nissitisset River, a branch of the Nashua, near the town of Pepperell.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["553369","553368","553366","554595","547642","554574","554112","543597","554587","555037","553588","549230","554582","554576","555106","553367"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","stem","leave","sharpness","lip","matter","tone","carpet","third","coloration"]}
