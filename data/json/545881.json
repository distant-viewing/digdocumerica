{"path":"545881.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a multi-story building, likely an urban residential or commercial high-rise. The building is structured with uniform rows and columns of balconies and visible sliding doors, suggesting private spaces such as apartments or hotel rooms. The façade is covered in dark reflective material, with rails and partitions on the balconies indicating a modern architectural style typical of late 20th century designs.\n\nIn the foreground, two flags are prominently displayed on flagpoles extending from the lower part of the frame. The flag on the left shows the Stars and Stripes of the United States, while the flag on the right is red with a white emblem, which could be a state or corporate flag. These flags are fluttering, suggesting a breezy environment.\n\nThe focus and composition of the image emphasize the repetitive pattern of the building's exterior, contrasted dynamically by the colorful, waving flags. There is no visible activity behind the balconies’ glass doors, and no people are seen, giving the image a static, architectural feel. The lighting and shadows indicate either early morning or late afternoon, contributing to the color richness and depth in the photograph.","title":"High-rise apartment building","placename":"Houston (Tex.)","location":"Houston, Texas","nn1":["553063","550038","550119","549864","550042","545376","556174","546448","548866","550123","546546","557486","549880","553220","548424","546531"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["flag","balcony","door","flagpole","partition","flutter","richness","slide","hotel","emblem"]}
