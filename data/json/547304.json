{"path":"547304.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural setting, likely taken during a clear day due to the bright sunlight and blue sky. At the forefront, there is a plowed field, with the earth turned over to show a rich brown soil. To the left of the image, there seems to be a farming activity taking place; a tractor is depicted pulling a large tank, presumably used for spraying or distributing agricultural chemicals, generating a faint trail of dust or spray behind it.\n\nIn the central part of the image, an old, weathered barn with a dark facade and a pitched roof is prominent. The barn's construction includes vertical siding, and it's situated on relatively flat terrain, adding a rustic charm to the composition.\n\nThe background features a lush green stretch of trees that line the horizon, providing a dense, leafy barrier behind the open field. Slightly elevated, there are visible residential structures or farmhouses nestled among the trees, indicating the proximity of a rural community.\n\nThis photograph likely aims to portray aspects of agricultural life, emphasizing the blend of farming activities with the serene rural environment. The presence of the barn and tractor highlights traditional farming methods, while the presence of homes in the distance suggests a close-knit rural community living in harmony with the surrounding nature.","title":"Farm near Hallam","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["551333","549257","547303","555635","554819","547291","552462","555577","544481","547307","554767","554806","547309","544323","549237","557183"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["barn","farming","tractor","farmhouse","method","harmony","community","field","stretch","chemical"]}
