{"path":"548205.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene where industrial or environmental remnants are evident. The main focus is a large, dark, oil-like spill that stretches down the middle of the composition, over concrete surfaces. The spill has a reflective sheen indicative of a viscous liquid, likely oil or a similar pollutant. It starts in a wide patch at the top of the image and narrows as it trickles down, surrounded by a rough, irregular surface.\n\nAdjacent to the spill, the ground transitions from concrete slab to a more natural, rocky terrain with scattered snow patches, suggesting a cold climate or recent weather that included snow. A few small twigs and debris are scattered across both the concrete and rock surfaces, contributing to a sense of unattended, possibly neglected space.\n\nThe sunlight is bright, casting harsh shadows and contributing to the stark contrast between the shiny, wet-looking spill and the rough, matte textures of the surrounding ground. The setting does not include any human activity, emphasizing the desolate impact of pollution in a natural or semi-urban environment.","title":"Waste runs into the Columbia River from sluice at Vancouver's Interstate Bridge.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545312","551559","551561","544580","546920","546015","547614","548206","551560","543773","547617","544803","551562","555871","547485","553866"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["spill","oil","snow","narrow","slab","pollutant","surface","twig","sheen","start"]}
