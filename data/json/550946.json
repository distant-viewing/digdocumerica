{"path":"550946.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a somewhat somber and polluted riverside scene. It shows a body of water in the foreground, looking calm with a muddy brownish color. On the opposite bank, there is a significant amount of debris and trash piled up against the shore and spilling into the river. The debris includes pieces of wood, metal, and miscellaneous trash, highlighting an issue of environmental pollution.\n\nBehind the pile of debris, residential homes can be observed. These houses appear to be modest, single-story structures, some of which are equipped with porches. The homes are spaced somewhat closely together and have a quaint, suburban aesthetic. Nearby, there's visible vegetation with some trees that are leafless, suggesting it might be either late fall or early spring.\n\nThe overall setting has a dull and overcast sky, adding to the melancholic feel of the scene. The photograph seems to capture a juxtaposition between everyday residential life and environmental neglect.","title":"Trash litters the banks of the kanawha river behind homes in st.
