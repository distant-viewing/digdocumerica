{"path":"548812.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph depicts a quaint and colorful seaside scene. In the foreground, there is a large barrel topped with a uniquely designed object resembling a cheerful, cartoon-like face wearing a brown hat. The face's eyes are large and the mouth is open wide in a kind of friendly grin. The barrel itself shows noticeable signs of weathering and rust, painted with faded and chipped colors, and embellished with simple, primitive-style figures that seem to be dancing or engaged in some activity.\n\nTo the right in the midground, thereâ€™s a thatched-roof shelter over a wooden picnic table, suggesting a casual, public outdoor eating area, typical of beachside locations. Underneath the shelter, there's a wooden picnic table.\n\nIn the background, the sandy beach stretches out toward the ocean, meeting the calm, visible horizon where sky meets sea, under an overcast sky. A lone individual appears on the right side of the frame, near the water's edge, possibly engaged in a beachside activity such as collecting shells or perhaps simply enjoying a quiet walk along the shore. Behind the thatched hut, partial views of tropical vegetation suggest a lush locale.\n\nOverall, the composition gives an impression of a relaxed, perhaps slightly whimsical beach setting, ideal for leisure and enjoyment of the natural coastal environment.","title":"Beach at Ohio, or \"Sunshine\" Key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548809","548183","548810","547034","553765","545162","543474","546378","543477","544989","548733","546393","543069","543053","543225","545108"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["picnic","shelter","barrel","table","hut","beach","cartoon","face","walk","shell"]}
