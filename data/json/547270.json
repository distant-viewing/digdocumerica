{"path":"547270.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and vibrant scene, likely from a dance performance or a similar event involving motion. The key feature of the image is the blurred motion of the dancers, which suggests rapid movement. The dancers appear to be wearing flowing costumes, possibly dresses, in hues of pink, yellow, and other pastel colors, contributing to a sense of fluidity and vibrancy in their movements.\n\nIn the foreground, the movement blurs are intense, with forms and colors overlapping. This creates an abstract, almost impressionistic feel to the main activity area, where the details of individual dancers merge into a collective swirl of colors and shapes.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the blurred dancers, the background of the photograph shows an audience, sharply in focus. The spectators are seated in what looks like a stadium or theater setting, with tiered seating. Their expressions and postures suggest they are watching the performance intently. The individuals in the audience appear relaxed and casually dressed, indicating a public, possibly informal event.\n\nOverall, the composition cleverly juxtaposes the energetic, blurred motion of the dancers against the calm, static audience, enhancing the dynamic nature of the photographed event.","title":"Skirts whirl in the 33rd annual square dance festival, held in the pershing auditorium","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547274","547317","547386","553241","553283","553268","558286","547334","556309","547403","553822","551710","553235","549623","547387","547371"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["dancer","audience","performance","motion","event","movement","fluidity","stadium","theater","costume"]}
