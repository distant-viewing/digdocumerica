{"path":"555343.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph shows a scenario focused on renewable energy technology, depicting a person examining the plumbing connected to a solar water heating system. The individual, a young man with shoulder-length hair, is leaning over a complex arrangement of pipes and valves. He appears to be adjusting or inspecting the system, holding a tool in his right hand.\n\nIn the foreground, on the right side, prominently featured is a large, tilted solar panel with a corrugated surface encased in a metal frame. The panel is designed to capture sunlight and convert it into heat for water heating. \n\nThe setting looks rural or semi-arid, with sparse vegetation comprising mostly brush and a few leafless trees under a clear blue sky. This suggests the location could be in a dry region where such technology would be particularly useful for conserving energy and resources.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes themes of sustainability and technology application in an outdoor, natural environment.","title":"Solar heating panels used to heat a swimming pool at a home outside of Tucson, Arizona","placename":"Tucson (Ariz.)","location":"Tucson, Arizona","nn1":["555349","555347","555292","555323","555309","555341","557312","555348","557332","555293","555288","555327","555342","557328","557316","557320"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["technology","heating","panel","energy","system","application","sustainability","valf","encase","heat"]}
