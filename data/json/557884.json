{"path":"557884.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph depicts an urban scene at what appears to be a vehicle maintenance or service depot. In the foreground on the left, a man stands positioned on a low, round yellow platform next to a brick column. He is wearing a light-colored short-sleeve shirt, dark trousers, and a belt. His posture is casual, with one arm resting overhead on the column and he appears to be waiting or observing something.\n\nTo his side, there is a dark blue car, possibly from the late 1970s or early 80s, based on its design, parked under a covered area marked with a stop sign.\n\nIn the background, several other individuals, all wearing white shirts, are seen around and inside the depot. The architecture of the depot features large open areas with brick columns and overhead beams. The interior is quite dark, contrasting with the brighter exterior lit by natural daylight. Large industrial windows can be seen partially letting light into the covered workspace.\n\nThe setting gives an impression of a routine day at a garage or a similar facility, with workers engaged in various activities, possibly related to vehicle servicing or repair. The environment conveys a sense of organized industry and daily work life.","title":"Auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, had an overabundance of employees in the summer of 1975 because of the changeover from semi-annual to annual inspections and the fact that police were not ticketing vehicles. All vehicles in the city are safety tested. Light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles also are hooked up to an exhaust analyzer for a check of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557902","557905","557852","557850","557885","557893","557906","542763","553491","557855","557858","557897","553488","557921","557853","557833"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["depot","column","80","brick","stop","repair","garage","workspace","belt","vehicle"]}
