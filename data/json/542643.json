{"path":"542643.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a rugged, hilly landscape with electric power lines stretching diagonally across the frame. The scene is dominated by rolling hills in the background that bear sparse vegetation, possibly indicating a dry or semi-arid climate. The terrain is covered with what appears to be dry grass, giving the landscape a golden-orange hue, perhaps due to the angle of the sunlight.\n\nIn the foreground, there are multiple wooden and metal electricity poles lined up along the hill's contour. The poles are connected by multiple strands of power lines that create a geometric pattern against the backdrop of the natural landscape. On one of the metal towers, a lineman can be observed performing maintenance or installation tasks. The lineman, attached to the tower with safety gear, works amidst the complex network of lines, demonstrating a moment of human interaction with the expansive infrastructure set in a vast, natural environment.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the long shadows cast across the hills and the warm tones of the landscape. This timing contributes to the dramatic quality of the image, highlighting both the scale of human endeavor in electrical infrastructure and the vast, undulating terrain it traverses.","title":"Poppies (California state flower).
