{"path":"558169.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Phillips, Kathy","caption":"This image displays a newborn baby lying on a white, slightly crumpled sheet inside what appears to be a medical environment, likely a hospital. The baby has vernix caseosa, a waxy, white protective coating, and appears to be covered in amniotic fluid, which suggests the photo was taken shortly after birth. The babyâ€™s skin is reddish, typical of newborns, and there are visible health monitoring clips attached to one of its feet, likely for measuring heart rate and oxygen levels. The umbilical cord is clamped and visible. The baby's arms are raised near its face, with one hand close to the eyes, displaying natural infant reflexes. The background is neutral and out of focus, drawing attention to the infant, and there is a metallic edge of a container (possibly a baby bassinet or medical table) that adds to the clinical setting of the image. Overall, the photograph captures the immediate moments following birth, highlighting the raw and beginning stages of life.","title":"Newborn child in the delivery room of Loretto Hospital in New Ulm, Minnesota.
