{"path":"555154.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a rugged, outdoor scene where a logging truck is carefully navigating a narrow dirt road along a steep hillside. The truck, which appears to be an older model with a yellow cab and bed, is loaded with a substantial amount of logs that are tightly secured. The road itself seems dusty and uneven, bordered on both sides by a thick growth of tall coniferous trees, mainly pines or firs, which suggest that the photograph might have been taken in a mountainous forested area.\n\nThe natural landscape around the road is dense and lush, indicating that the photograph could have been taken either in the late spring or summer months. The background reveals a downhill slope leading to more thickly wooded areas, and the far background suggests a continuation of the forest with undulating hills under a clear blue sky. A few fluffy, white clouds are present in the sky, adding to the serene yet adventurous essence of the scene.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of modern human activity - logging - within a vast, natural forest environment, contrasting the mechanical and the natural. The setting and the activity likely place the focus on themes of forestry, conservation, and the utilitarian use of natural landscapes.","title":"Loaded logging truck in a cloud of dust in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542855","553629","554416","542609","542858","542854","554420","542780","545930","553627","544767","552583","542856","542616","552584","553628"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Mining Operations"],"terms":["fir","road","truck","month","cab","continuation","forest","forestry","logging","pine"]}
