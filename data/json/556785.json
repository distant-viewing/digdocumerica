{"path":"556785.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a busy highway scene, likely during a period of moderate traffic. The image is taken from an elevated perspective, looking down on the road which features multiple lanes going in both directions. In the center of the highway, there is a grassy median with guardrails on either side to separate the opposite flows of traffic.\n\nOn the left side of the image, in what appears to be the northbound direction, traffic is more congested with a noticeable slowdown, possibly indicating rush hour or minor traffic congestion. The lanes are filled with a variety of vehicles including sedans, station wagons, and a prominent red bus that is nearer to the camera. This bus stands out due to its color and size compared to the mostly private cars around it.\n\nOn the right side, representing the southbound direction, traffic is lighter and cars appear to be moving more freely. Vehicles in these lanes are more spaced apart, allowing smoother travel.\n\nOn the edges of the highway, there are strips of grass, some road signage, and ramps that might be exits or entrances to the highway. Beyond the roadside, there are green, lush trees which suggest that the highway is possibly skirted by suburban or semi-rural areas.\n\nAlso noticeable in the right traffic lane is a truck with a large advertisement for Coca-Cola, adding a commercial element to the scene and dating the photograph likely in a time when such advertisements were common on trucks.\n\nThe overall mood of the photo is dynamic, capturing a typical day of varied traffic on a multi-lane North American highway.","title":"Metropolitan Atlanta rapid transit authority (marta) bus in rush hour traffic on the freeway.
