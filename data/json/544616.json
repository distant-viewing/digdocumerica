{"path":"544616.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of natural beauty featuring a large white egret in flight against a clear blue sky. The bird is prominently displayed almost in the center of the image, dominating the composition with its impressive wingspan fully extended. The egret's long, elegant neck stretches forward, and its head is angled slightly downwards, possibly scanning for prey. Its legs trail behind, contributing to the streamlined, aerodynamic form suitable for flight.\n\nThe egret's feathers are well-defined, showing beautiful details and textures, especially on the wings, contrasted against the smooth, somewhat gradient blue background of the sky. The photograph features subtle variations in the blue tone of the sky, possibly indicating the presence of thin clouds or a difference in light intensity.\n\nNo human activities, other artifacts, or other animals are visible in this single-subject nature shot. The focus is entirely on the egret and its graceful motion, captured sharply against the serene backdrop of the sky. This calm and simple composition emphasizes the beauty and elegance of the bird in its natural environment.","title":"One of the egrets that inhabit the chokoloskee rookery in Everglades National Park","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"Everglades National Park, Florida","nn1":["547745","544631","548732","544842","544478","544482","545967","547593","544516","543922","545142","557204","544486","544489","548731","548729"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["egret","flight","bird","difference","artifact","elegance","feather","wing","suitable","neck"]}
