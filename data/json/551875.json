{"path":"551875.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene inside a public transportation vehicle, likely a bus or tram. A person, appearing to be a woman, is interacting with a ticket machine. She is dressed in a dark coat and is seen from the side as she is focused on the machine. Her dark hair is mid-length, and she wears a patterned shirt or dress underneath the coat.\n\nThe ticket machine is quite large and mounted on the wall of the vehicle. It features a variety of buttons and slots, presumably for selecting and purchasing different types of tickets indicated by various charts and instructions on the machine itself. These details indicate different fare options and possibly maps or routes.\n\nNext to this primary machine is a smaller, vertically oriented box that also seems to be related to ticketing; it has a graphic in the form of a guide or chart, and each level is marked with letters, suggesting it might be used for validating or extending tickets. Below it, there is a small metal bin labeled with a bold \"E,\" which could be for disposing of tickets or other waste.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle has visible metal poles for standing passengers to hold onto, and there is natural light coming through windows suggesting daytime. There are electrical fixtures overhead indicative of transit vehicle design. \n\nOverall, the focus of the photograph is on the interaction between the passenger and the ticket machine, capturing a routine moment of public transit usage.","title":"Automatic vendors sell tickets for public transportation--bus, trolley, subway and schnellbahn (express).
