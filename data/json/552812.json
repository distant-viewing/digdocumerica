{"path":"552812.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts two men working in a tomato field. The man in the foreground, wearing a wide-brimmed straw hat and a denim jacket over a denim shirt, is bent over, attentively tending to a tomato plant supported by a wooden stake. He seems focused on his task, possibly tying or adjusting the plant to the stake. The second man, in the background, is leaning forward, using a hoe on the soil near a row of tomato plants. He wears a long-sleeve shirt and appears to be in the process of weeding or cultivating the soil.\n\nThe field is organized in long, straight rows of staked tomato plants, indicating a well-maintained agricultural setup. The pathway between the rows is made of bare, plowed soil which looks dry and somewhat rocky. The landscape beyond the tilled field gradually transitions into a lush, green backdrop of dense trees, implying a rural, agricultural environment.\n\nThe sky above is overcast, casting a soft, diffused light over the scene, which enhances the earthy tones of the field and the natural green of the vegetation. This provides a calm and serene atmosphere to the photograph, focusing attention on the labor and care involved in farming. The overall composition highlights the industriousness and skill involved in agriculture, showcasing a moment of everyday work life in the fields.","title":"Plaquemines parish farmer tend his rows of creole tomatoes extra heavy rains delayed the setting out of his plants","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["543324","557696","557478","554047","553879","554108","543858","543481","549036","543862","544371","553659","544246","549084","548997","554937"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["stake","field","plant","soil","denim","row","industriousness","ten","plow","bare"]}
