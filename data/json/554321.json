{"path":"554321.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph depicts a close-up view of a heavily damaged and crumpled vehicle. The wreckage is predominantly painted in a deep red color. The frame shows the car’s twisted metal pieces and sharp edges, emphasized by folds and compressions in the structure. The most discernible part of the car in this image is a fender with the words “Cortina” embossed on it, suggesting this could be a model of car or related branding. There is a considerable amount of debris and disarray; various metallic components overlapped in a chaotic manner. The overall feel of the image is one of destruction, illustrating the aftermath of a severe car accident or a similar catastrophic event. The lighting and focus accentuate the texture and color variations on the crumpled metal surfaces.","title":"Auto scrap yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554303","554295","554305","554302","554355","550020","553863","554311","547476","552083","544472","549107","547484","550016","554319","552996"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["car","fender","accident","branding","wreckage","crumple","overlap","disarray","fold","destruction"]}
