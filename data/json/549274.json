{"path":"549274.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures a casual and playful moment with two children climbing a tree in a park setting. The tree, with its robust trunk and several branches, is situated in a sandy area, which appears to be part of a playground. One child is positioned higher on the tree, straddled across a branch and holding onto another for balance, wearing a purple sweater and dark pants. The second child is hanging from a lower branch by the arms, dressed in a dark jacket and pants, with feet dangling.\n\nThe background features an open park space with sparse grass and a few scattered trees. In the distance, there is a chain-link fence that marks the boundary of the playground, and beyond that, some indiscernible structures can be seen, possibly part of a larger public park environment. The sky is clear, indicating a sunny day, which contributes to the overall cheerful and energetic atmosphere of the scene. These elements together depict an innocent and energetic moment of childhood outdoor play.","title":"Neighborhood youngsters in the playground adjacent to Logan Airport at the end of Neptune Road.
