{"path":"549964.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene scene of an artist painting outdoors. The artist, a man, is sitting on a folding chair at a portable easel. He is concentrating on his painting, holding a brush in his right hand and a palette in his left. He is dressed in a light pink shirt and dark pants. \n\nThe setting is picturesque, located by the edge of a tranquil body of water. The artist is shaded under the canopy of a large tree with slender, willowy branches that drape gently towards the water, enhancing the calm and meditative quality of the environment. The tree trunk and branches frame the artist, creating a natural vignette.\n\nIn the background, the water's surface reflects a blend of colors likely from the sky and surroundings, hinting at a possibly bright or partly cloudy day. The far shore is visible but appears soft and unfocused, contributing to the tranquil and somewhat isolated feel of the scene. This backdrop provides a beautiful contrast and a sense of quiet solitude, focusing the viewer's attention on the artist and his interaction with the landscape.","title":"Artist on bank of the Schuylkill River","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["549963","549930","545603","552065","548972","554493","550666","550217","550826","550268","542556","543835","555576","546293","542509","553082"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["artist","painting","vignette","branch","brush","fold","concentrate","drape","chair","canopy"]}
