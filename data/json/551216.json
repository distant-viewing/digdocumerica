{"path":"551216.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil aquatic scene set against a vivid sky. The upper portion of the image showcases a vast expanse of sky filled with an array of fluffy, white clouds that create dynamic shapes across a bright blue backdrop. Some thin, wispy clouds are also visible, adding texture to the sky.\n\nAt the center of the composition, on the horizon, lies a simple splash of greenery, indicating a distant shoreline, densely covered with trees that appear as a dark, uniform band.Splitting the image horizontally, the water body, possibly a river or a lake, has a slightly rippled texture and reflects the grey-blue tone of the sky.\n\nA focal point of the scene is a boat, captured in the lower right quadrant of the image. This small, white boat with a slight red stripe sits idle on the water, facing diagonally towards the viewer, adding an element of human presence and recreational activity to the serene natural setting.\n\nThe border of the photograph has notable signs of wear and imperfections possibly indicative of its age, with visible marks and slight damage which gives it a vintage feel. The composition, with its broad sky and tranquil water body punctuated by the small boat, invokes a sense of peace and simplicity.","title":"Inlet near Sunset Beach","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["543626","548030","555396","550773","550324","557813","555394","549417","550831","545043","551313","542908","551214","548034","545057","557255"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","imperfection","quadrant","split","peace","invoke","band","cloud","punctuate","vintage"]}
