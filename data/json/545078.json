{"path":"545078.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a captivating scene set on an expansive icy surface, possibly a frozen lake or road. The environment is foggy and atmospheric, suggesting cold and possibly early morning conditions. The scene is divided by a distinct path, likely a tire mark, leading through the center where various elements are placed.\n\nForeground: Dominating the foreground is a red wagon equipped with two shafts suggesting it could be hand-pulled. This wagon is positioned next to a makeshift black marker sticking upright out of the ice. Thereâ€™s a scattering of dark particles around these objects, possibly dirt or debris.\n\nMiddle ground: Centered in this area is a lone person wearing a long coat, dark pants, and boots, walking away from the viewer towards a car. The person is walking confidently on the slippery surface, indicating familiarity with these conditions.\n\nBackground: In the distance, partially enshrouded in fog, is a solitary car that appears to be vintage. This car, parked and unattended, adds an element of mystery and isolation to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition has a stark, almost eerie quality, emphasized by the limited visibility and the isolation of the human figure and car in this desolate wintry environment. The use of natural light and shadow plays significantly into the mood, casting a soft glow on the ice and enhancing the reflective quality of the surface.","title":"Robert law, employee of the quinault indian reservation checks quinault beach razor clams monthly for size and quantity","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["542862","542925","545919","551964","553633","557181","547771","549002","557193","543770","544721","553131","543550","554291","555534","544315"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["ice","wagon","car","icy","familiarity","shaft","captivating","scattering","isolation","wintry"]}
