{"path":"551370.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a natural landscape, most likely captured in a meadow or wild grassland. The foreground is dominated by tall grass and sporadically scattered flowers which exhibit vibrant yellow and dark brown colors. The plants appear somewhat windswept or in a natural, untamed state, suggesting the photo was taken in a non-manicured wild environment.\n\nIn the midground, the density of the grass seems to increase, mingling with darker green bushes or shrubs. The colors here are slightly more muted compared to the bright foreground, adding a sense of depth.\n\nThe background is out of focus but shows a cluster of darker green trees, likely a small forest or grove, contributing to the overall verdant setting. The color tones throughout the image are somewhat subdued, with a moody or overcast sky implied, providing soft, natural lighting.\n\nOverall, the composition and focus give a feeling of serene isolation, highlighting the beauty of an undisturbed natural environment. There are no artificial objects or people in the scene, emphasizing the tranquility and untouched quality of the location.","title":"Black-eyed susans (rudbeckia hirta) bloom at overlook of horseshoe Bend","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["557191","557098","557189","549232","556990","557104","557099","545069","545209","550667","547540","549158","549229","553084","544439","550489"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mingle","increase","grassland","meadow","manicure","grass","density","midground","compare","subdue"]}
