{"path":"545687.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a series of ancient rock paintings, or pictographs, created on a reddish-brown sandstone surface. The rock art is located under a rock overhang, providing some natural shelter that has likely helped preserve the paintings. In the image, there are multiple figures painted in white, red, and a mix of these colors. The figures appear somewhat abstract but suggest human forms, with details that may represent ceremonial or symbolic attire.\n\nEach figure has a distinct body and appendages that might represent hands and feet; their heads are larger relative to the body, some possessing elaborate details that could suggest headgear or masks. Notably, a few figures have prominent white vertical lines and dots, which could be decorations or symbolic markings.\n\nThe background of the photograph is dominated by the textured sandstone, showing layers and the effects of weathering. At the bottom of the overhang, there's a visible ledge where smaller chunks of rock have fallen, hinting at natural erosion. The presence of a few green plants growing at the base adds a touch of organic life to the scene, contrasting with the age and permanence of the rock paintings. The overall mood evoked is one of historical significance and mystery, offering a glimpse into the artistic expressions of a past culture.","title":"Thirteen faces east (three faces out of camera range), in Horse Canyon.
