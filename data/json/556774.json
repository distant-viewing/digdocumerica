{"path":"556774.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a subway station. In the foreground, on the left, a metallic subway train is visible with its door open, marked with the number \"266\" at the top. The design of the train includes streamlined features and metallic surfaces, including a decorative grille near its bottom.\n\nThe right side of the image is bustling with passengers. These individuals, comprised of men and women of various ages, are wearing casual and business attire typical of past decades, suggesting this photo might be from the 70s or 80s. Their attire includes trousers, skirts, and shirts in various patterns and colors. One of the women closest to the camera wears a sleeveless orange shirt and a patterned skirt. The group is standing on the platform, apparently waiting to either board or allow others to disembark.\n\nThe platform itself features overhead beams that support the structure of the subway station, with lighting fixtures installed intermittently. The background includes parts of other platforms and tracks dimly visible in the subdued lighting of the station. The scene captures a typical busy moment in urban public transport, vividly depicting the hustle of daily commuters.","title":"Passengers boarding a Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) train in Philadelphia.
