{"path":"544013.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This is a photograph capturing an urban scene on a foggy day or evening along a broad avenue. The perspective is from the middle of the street, looking down the road which is lined with tall palm trees on either side. The atmosphere is murky and hazy, likely due to fog, which gives the scene a subdued and somewhat eerie ambiance.\n\nThe road is busy with several vehicles; their headlights are visibly on, illuminating the foggy air. One can see diverse types of vehicles including cars and what appears to be a van or a small truck. The traffic seems sparse but in motion, likely due to decreased visibility from the fog.\n\nOn the right side of the road, there is an area with various commercial signs and storefronts which emerge vaguely through the fog. Neon signs and billboards are partially visible, suggesting that this area is commercially active with businesses like restaurants or shops. These signs add a splash of color and commercial appeal to the otherwise grey and muted scene.\n\nThe skyline in the far background is barely visible, but one can detect a few high-rise structures suggesting this photograph might be taken in or near a downtown area.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a typical busy urban road scene, shrouded in fog, with elements of city life like traffic, commerce, and city infrastructure intermingling under atmospheric weather conditions.\n","title":"Fountain Hills construction of year-round and vacation homes.
