{"path":"547240.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling urban construction site. The foreground is dominated by a large, out-of-focus amber traffic warning light, which takes up the right portion of the image and partially frames the scene. The blurred edges and iridescent texture of the light create a sense of immediacy and focus on the construction activities occurring behind.\n\nIn the background, numerous construction workers, adorned in yellow hard hats, are visible working amidst a variety of heavy machinery and construction equipment. This includes excavators and bulldozers, which are shown digging and moving earth. The site itself is dug into the ground, surrounded by temporary walls and barricades to manage both the debris and safety zones.\n\nThe architecture around the construction site features a mix of modern and older-style buildings that suggest this scene is in an established city center. This juxtaposition adds depth to the photograph, reinforcing the ongoing urban development theme.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is bright, with a clear sky indicating it is a sunny day, casting sharp shadows and enhancing the details of the construction site's rugged terrain and busy atmosphere. The perspective offered by the photograph places the viewer at street level, partly immersed in the construction environment, as if coming across the scene while walking by.","title":"Metro subway construction on G St., N.W., between 13th and 14th streets","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["547218","549913","544167","547236","550274","553886","547989","546252","553924","553394","551966","551951","556893","549664","549912","553383"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["construction","site","immediacy","barricade","excavator","warning","bulldozer","zone","safety","worker"]}
