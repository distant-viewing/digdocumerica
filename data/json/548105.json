{"path":"548105.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a rundown waterfront area, likely a pier or dockside scene. The setting includes muddy ground littered with debris such as discarded items and timber. Wooden structures, possibly warehouses or boathouses, are built on stilts above the water, showing signs of aging and weathering, with faded paint and some structural damage. These structures also host a collection of boats of various sizes, some of which appear to be stored or abandoned.\n\nA notable feature of the background includes a partially cloudy sky with glimpses of blue, suggesting variably cloudy weather, and a distant bridge visible beyond the waterfront structures. The water beneath the structures is calm and reflects some of the decrepitude visible in the surroundings, emphasizing the possibly neglected or less industrially active nature of the area.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a feel of an old, possibly abandoned maritime area that has seen better days, evoking a sense of quiet decay and the passage of time. The scene is devoid of visible human activity, adding to the sense of abandonment.","title":"Dock scene at Rainier, on the Columbia River","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547622","547594","551985","545005","547582","551978","547581","549300","551984","547575","547577","546871","547584","547893","547572","550293"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["waterfro","abandon","boathouse","rundown","stilt","host","timber","a","passage","warehouse"]}
