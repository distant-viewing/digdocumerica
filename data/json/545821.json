{"path":"545821.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures an old, weathered wooden door set into a decaying earth-toned adobe wall. The door is slightly open, revealing darkness within and hints of natural light streaming through small window openings on the door itself. The adobe wall has a rough texture with patches where the material has crumbled away, exposing underlying layers, suggesting an exposure to elements over time. The peeling and chipping of the wall surface create both textural and color contrast with the relatively intact but faded door. The ground in front of the door appears to be made of similar dirt or mud as the walls, contributing to the sense of decay and abandonment. The composition is simple yet evocative, capturing a sense of desolation and the passage of time. There are no visible objects or activities besides the structure itself, enhancing the focus on the textures and state of disrepair.","title":"Crumbling adobe house in Terlingua","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["552511","543339","550008","543345","543348","545810","557640","544919","551330","543330","556354","552463","555605","544945","557081","545818"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["door","streaming","wall","time","mud","opening","desolation","darkness","disrepair","passage"]}
