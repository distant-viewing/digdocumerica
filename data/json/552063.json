{"path":"552063.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph displays a bustling rail yard scene. Multiple train tracks run parallel to each other, densely occupied by an array of freight train cars. The composition predominantly features tanker cars and boxcars, showcasing a variety of colors and markings that suggest different contents and ownerships. The tankers are closest to the camera; they are cylindrical and mostly black, with some details indicating their capacity and hazardous material warnings.\n\nTo the right of the tankers, other types of freight cars, including covered hoppers and flatcars, are laden with an assortment of goods, suggesting mixed cargo transport. Lush greenery lines the right side of tracks, while a well-paved road runs alongside.\n\nIn the background, the scene is framed by a winding river, flush with water, curving away into the distance. On the far bank of the river, industrial structures are visible, further indicating the areaâ€™s active engagement in heavy services or manufacturing. The overarching cloudy sky suggests an overcast, potentially damp day, adding a somber tone to the industrial setup. The viewpoint looks to be elevated, possibly from a bridge or another high structure, providing a comprehensive overview of the entire rail facility and its operations.","title":"Looking east along the Kansas City railroad and the Kansas river from the bridge at 7th street.
