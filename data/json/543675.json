{"path":"543675.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a white dog in motion, exhibiting a notable blur effect that conveys rapid movement. The dog is mid-stride with its legs and body angled to suggest a swift gallop. Its furry coat appears to be fluttering with the speed of its motion, enhancing the dynamism of the image.\n\nThe background is a blurred mix of dark and lighter brown tones, likely indicative of a dirt or sandy ground with some sparse vegetation or fence-like structures also blurred by the movement. The lighting conditions suggest the photograph was taken outdoors in natural light. \n\nOverall, the image emphasizes motion and speed, using photography techniques such as a slow shutter speed to convey the essence of fast, dynamic movement, resulting in an artistic and somewhat abstract portrayal of a running dog. The shadow of the dog is visible on the ground, adding depth and context to the motion captured.","title":"Calf-bRanding day at ranch","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["552671","545557","543694","542951","544191","553072","554627","545218","545972","553908","554360","545133","543261","543780","542742","543463"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["dog","speed","motion","movement","dynamism","stride","shutter","technique","portrayal","blur"]}
