{"path":"557549.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic landscape with a variety of elements. In the foreground, there are tall yellow wildflowers, which add a vibrant splash of color to the scene. These flowers frame the view of an expansive undeveloped area that extends into the midground and background.\n\nCentral to the composition is a serpentine road that winds through the landscape. The road curves around the hills, highlighting the contours of the terrain. Alongside the road, there appear to be various patches of cleared earth, perhaps indicating areas of construction or development. These sections vary in color from light brown to reddish hues, contrasting with the lush greenery of the surrounding hills.\n\nIn the distance, one can observe a more urbanized area with houses and other structures spread sporadically across the hills. The presence of these buildings suggests the outskirts of a suburban or semi-rural community. The backdrop is made up of rolling hills that recede into the horizon, partially shrouded by a light haze that softens the distant landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph beautifully captures the interplay between natural landscapes and human development with a focus on the sinuous road as a leading line, guiding the viewerâ€™s eye through the diverse textures and colors of the environment.","title":"New road and lots awaiting development are seen off Mulholland Drive in the Santa Monica Mountains on the western edge of Los Angeles. The mountains are the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increased land use pressure. Of the 1,072 miles of mainland shoreline (excluding San Francisco Bay), 61 percent is privately owned.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552549","555630","542642","554130","557726","556405","545880","545723","549235","549157","549225","553785","547300","557528","552442","549123"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hill","road","development","outskirt","wildflower","splash","landscape","midground","contour","curve"]}
