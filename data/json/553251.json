{"path":"553251.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of people gathered in an outdoor setting, likely during a daytime event or festivity. Central to the image is a woman dressed in a stylish, fitted purple tank top and vibrant green, lace-up pants, suggesting an attire for a casual or possibly music-oriented event. Her hair is medium-length, wavy, and appears brown in color. The woman's posture indicates she might be dancing or in mid-motion, giving an impression of dynamic activity. Her back is towards the camera, focusing attention on her attire and the movement suggested by her pose.\n\nIn the background, partially blurred, there are other individuals. These people also seem casually dressed, appropriate for an outdoor gathering, and their proximity to each other suggests a crowded event.\n\nThe lighting in the image appears natural, indicative of an outdoor setting with bright sunlight, enhancing the vividness of the woman's purple top and green pants. The composition plays with a shallow depth of field, focusing sharply on the woman and allowing for a softer focus on the background crowd, thus making her the standout subject in the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph portrays a lively social gathering, emphasizing motion and a casual, festive atmosphere.","title":"August brings the \"D'AUG Days\" to Fountain Square. \"D'AUG Days\" is a month-long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
