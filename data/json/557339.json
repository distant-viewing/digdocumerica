{"path":"557339.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts a vast, expansive view of a housing area situated in a valley with a mountainous backdrop. The scene features a large number of closely packed, uniform mobile homes arranged in neat rows. The homes predominately have white exteriors, contributing to a monotonous yet orderly appearance. The area is relatively barren, with little vegetative cover visible, emphasizing the arid or semi-arid environment.\n\nIn the foreground, a couple of utility poles and power lines are visible, striking a contrast against the natural landscape. These man-made structures underscore the rural but electrified setting of the community. To the right, we see a road meandering through the area with a few vehicles, suggesting some level of activity or transit occurring at the time the photo was taken.\n\nThe background is dominated by rising layers of mountains, which fade into lighter shades of blue and gray as they recede into the distance. This gradient offers a sense of vastness and isolation of the community from larger cities or lush landscapes.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the layout of the mobile homes against a dramatic natural setting, provides a glimpse into the lifestyle and environment of this particular region, emphasizing themes of isolation, community organization, and adaptation to geographical and environmental conditions.","title":"Mobile home housing","placename":"Denver (Colo.)","location":"Denver, Colorado","nn1":["556468","544147","544816","544633","557526","557527","556476","544149","544118","556417","556455","558296","545205","552603","558300","556472"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["home","community","isolation","adaptation","organization","lifestyle","housing","transit","gradient","cover"]}
