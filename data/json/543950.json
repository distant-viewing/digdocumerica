{"path":"543950.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and contemplative scene at twilight. Two silhouetted figures are seen sitting close to each other, looking out over a body of water that reflects the glimmering light of the sun. The taller figure, potentially wearing a hat, appears to be resting an arm around the shoulders of the shorter figure. Behind them, tranquil water extends toward the horizon, scattered with multiple sparkles caused by the sunlight reflecting off the gentle ripples. Both the left and right horizons are lined with the dark silhouettes of trees.\n\nForegrounding the image, there are several tall, slender reeds or grasses, which also appear as dark silhouettes. These grasses' intricate patterns add a textured layer, partially framing the two figures and enhancing the feeling of a peaceful, secluded spot. Overall, the photograph exudes a quiet mood and might evoke themes of companionship, reflection, or nature's beauty.","title":"The Ohio River","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["552226","547217","548833","551280","543601","552331","549471","543951","551945","552225","554901","547595","549933","554404","543203","550296"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["figure","sparkle","silhouette","companionship","reed","grass","horizon","twilight","shoulder","spot"]}
