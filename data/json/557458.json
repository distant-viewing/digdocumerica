{"path":"557458.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling beach scene set against a rugged coastal backdrop. The beach is flanked by steep, rocky cliffs that dominate the background. These cliffs are mostly bare, with shades of brown and patches of green vegetation, emphasising a stark, natural terrain.\n\nThe beach itself is filled with people engaged in various beachside activities. Many visitors are sunbathing, lying on towels or beach chairs scattered across the sandy shore. Others are standing or walking around, some carrying surfboards, which suggests that surfing may be one of the activities enjoyed at this location. A few individuals are near the water's edge, either entering or exiting the ocean, indicating swimming or wading as another popular activity.\n\nThe coastline is partially strewn with rocks and debris, providing a more rugged aspect to the setting. The sky is clear and appears to be a bright sunny day, which adds to the vividness of the beach activities.\n\nAdditionally, there is a small airplane visible in the sky, flying over the cliff, which adds an element of scale and activity to the sky above the beach scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph depicts a lively and scenic beach setting, popular for its natural features and outdoor recreation opportunities.","title":"Access to Niguel Beach Park along the ocean in Orange County is through an area that was scheduled for development; however, construction was halted when the state passed the Coastal Zone Conservation Act in November 1972. State and regional regulatory commissions must present a final report to the legislature by January 1976, recommending passage of laws affecting future coastal development. Some 84 percent of the state residents live within 30 miles of the coast.","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["553952","557480","553765","543322","547482","553686","553684","547628","553782","551931","543310","553766","553685","543254","553683","543089"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","cliff","surfboard","sunbathe","wade","airplane","towel","swimming","exit","recreation"]}
