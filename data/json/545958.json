{"path":"545958.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a bustling river dock. In the foreground, a young woman is squatting on a wooden dock next to a large red fuel tank labeled \"MIRAX.\" She has curly brown hair and wears a light blue shirt. Smiling directly at the camera, she is flanked by two small dogs, likely Beagles, each wearing a collar and looking at the camera as well.\n\nBehind her, the river is busy with activity. Several boats are moored to the dock, and in one of them, two men are engaged in some activity; one is standing and appears to be adjusting something on the boat, while the other sits and holds onto a rope. The water reflects a cloudy sky.\n\nThe backdrop includes tall transmission towers on the far bank beyond the tree line, suggesting this might be close to an industrial or suburban area. The overall mood is casual and outdoorsy, capturing a moment of leisure or preparation for a river outing.","title":"Young fisherman with beagles at public boat launch","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["549954","549928","544209","542731","542906","543038","543934","542874","551415","545658","543943","548523","551516","551038","552272","545972"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["dock","river","squatt","moor","transmission","fuel","out","collar","camera","preparation"]}
