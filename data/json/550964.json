{"path":"550964.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a panoramic riverscape dominated by a lengthy bridge crossing over a wide river. The bridge, an old-style truss bridge painted in red, features a series of triangular trusses, lending it a robust, industrial feel. Its structure is complex yet open, allowing viewers to see through its framework to the urban skyline beyond.\n\nOn the river, a large barge moving from left to right in the frame commands attention. This barge, apparently loaded/heavy as it sits low in the water, is paired with a tugboat at its rear, which shows visible white waves as it pushes the barge forward. The presence of these commercial vessels indicates that the river is a used channel for transporting goods.\n\nIn the background, slightly obscured by a hazy sky possibly indicating weather conditions or air quality issues, stands a city skyline. The buildings, diverse in height but primarily modern, suggest a bustling urban center. The skyline helps to establish a context of a significant metropolitan area existing in close relationship with the river.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a sense of movement and commerce, set against an urban backdrop, connected by an older infrastructure that showcases a blend of industrial and modern elements.","title":"Empty coal barges on the Kanawha River pass beneath the railroad bridge.","placename":"Charleston (W.
