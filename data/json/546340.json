{"path":"546340.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene natural scene with two individuals engaging in an activity by a body of water. In the foreground, both of these people are partially silhouetted and are seen working near the water, pulling or adjusting a large net stretched across the water's edge. They appear to be standing on a rocky outcropping or shoreline.\n\nThe background features tall, mature trees that are heavily draped with Spanish moss, which hangs down in long, elegant strands, creating a lush and somewhat mysterious atmosphere. The trees are dense and cast much of the scene in shadow, emphasizing the feeling of a secluded, natural environment.\n\nThe sky above is visible through openings in the tree canopy and appears relatively bright, suggesting that the photograph was taken during daylight hours. The combination of the water, the greenery, and the activities of the people suggests a context possibly related to fishing or some form of aquatic study or maintenance.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its interplay between light and shadow, and the focus on the interaction of humans with nature, gives it a tranquil yet engaging quality.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze laboratory personnel seining and dip netting for contaminated female shrimp.
