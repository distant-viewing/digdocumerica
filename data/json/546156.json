{"path":"546156.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a cluster of thin, elongated objects that appear to be natural plant elements, possibly dried grasses or reeds. The scene is composed mostly of these elements entwined or interlacing against a dark, largely indistinct background, which may suggest an indoor setting or a night-time scenario.\n\nThe objects themselves are light in color, displaying hues of white and beige, and they exhibit a complex network of intersections and angular formations. The lighting is focused around the center of the composition, causing some parts of the plant materials to be highlighted while others recede into shadow, enhancing the depth and texture of the composition.\n\nThere are no discernible human figures or activities depicted in the image; it primarily focuses on the interplay of natural forms and light. The overall atmosphere feels somewhat contemplative, with an emphasis on line, form, and the intrinsic beauty of seemingly simple natural objects. The photographâ€™s resolution and color saturation indicate it may be a vintage or analog photograph.","title":"Time exposure photograph of bridge","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["555031","555052","552554","545521","557169","545495","557620","555023","555194","557617","555020","545069","557582","558079","555185","557197"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["object","form","reed","saturation","plant","intersection","scenario","night","emphasis","vintage"]}
