{"path":"549851.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street scene likely from the 1970s or 1980s, evident by the style of vehicles and fashion. In the foreground, we see a large brown car with a male driver inside, talking on a classic handheld mobile phone, a rare and high-end accessory during the time period depicted. His expression is focused, suggesting he is actively engaged in the conversation.\n\nTo the left of the image, there's a young man crossing the street, his attention seemingly directed towards something off-camera. His fashion style, including a casual jacket and pants, aligns with the era suggested by other elements in the photo.\n\nThe background is busy with various other cars, including taxis and commercial vehicles, signaling a bustling urban environment. The architecture, typical of a downtown area, frames the top part of the image, with large commercial buildings lining the street. Various pedestrians are visible, each appearing to be engaged in their routines, adding to the dynamic urban atmosphere.\n\nThe clothing styles, vehicles, and overall activity level provide a vivid snapshot of city life during this period. The diverse elements—from the conversation in the car to the pedestrian's crossing—collectively build a scene filled with movement and minor narratives. This image effectively conveys the bustle and variety of urban life from a bygone era.","title":"Large car moves slowly through Manhattan traffic.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548369","546626","548388","549882","549812","551324","549873","548368","549906","549876","549872","554329","554310","548272","551913","556724"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["fashion","pedestrian","street","period","car","vehicle","style","conversation","era","taxi"]}
