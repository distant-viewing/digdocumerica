{"path":"546456.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This image features a large modern building, likely a school or an institutional structure, characterized by its architectural design. The building has a prominent gable roof and is predominantly constructed of materials that appear to be glass and brick. The facade visible in the photograph is symmetrical and extensively utilizes vertical rectangular windows that almost reach from the roof to the ground, providing the appearance of a glass wall segmented by white or light-colored frames. This design suggests an intent to let in a significant amount of natural light.\n\nIn front of the building, there is a thick, lush green shrubbery that extends across the length of the photograph, partially obscuring the lower section of the building's facade. There are no visible human activities in the photograph; it appears to be a calm day with clear, bright skies augmenting the building's stark, geometric aesthetic with a vivid blue backdrop.\n\nThe overall impression is of a serene and quiet institutional environment, highlighted by the architectural emphasis on light and transparency, which is typical of mid to late 20th-century modernist architecture. The lack of any people or movement gives the image a static, almost tranquil quality.","title":"North Christian Church","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546460","546464","546543","546473","548866","546481","546542","549360","546531","546702","546448","558162","542593","546506","546415","546470"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["intent","facade","building","glass","school","shrubbery","roof","design","amount","emphasis"]}
