{"path":"549312.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph shows a close-up view of the rear portion of a dark blue Pontiac car. The focus is on a cheeky bumper sticker on the car that reads \"FIGHT SMOG! RIDE A HORSE,\" written in bold red and white letters. Below the bumper sticker, prominently displayed is the Pontiac logo, and further down is the car's license plate, which is partially visible with the numbers \"620\" seen followed by \"RIF\". The car's paint appears in good condition with a reflective finish, and the tail lights are visible but not fully focused. The background is blurred out, emphasizing the rear details of the car and the text on the bumper sticker. This image captures a humorous and environmentally conscious message from the era, suggesting an alternative to car usage to combat air pollution.","title":"Sound advice on a car parked in a lot on West Street, near the newly constructed World Trade Center.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["546193","557148","557930","549165","547269","547494","554364","545469","550005","542760","554367","549691","557692","555477","557824","543856"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["sticker","bumper","car","finish","license","tail","usage","plate","horse","message"]}
