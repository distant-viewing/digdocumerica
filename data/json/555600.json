{"path":"555600.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph features a small, rustic building constructed from rough, dark stone. The roof is low, and there is a prominent sign on top of the building that reads \"International Sewing & MFG. Festival,\" indicating the purpose or event associated with the structure. Just under the roof, another sign states \"House of Comfort, Visitors Welcome,\" which suggests it's an area set aside for guests to relax.\n\nThe front of the building has a large window through which you can see another inward-facing sign, which is not fully legible. To the right of the window, an informational or promotional poster is displayed, featuring text and possibly images, but the specific details are not clear enough to discern.\n\nBeside the building, there is a simple green park bench for visitors to sit on. The flooring around the building appears to be concrete.\n\nIn the background, beyond this small structure, you can see a statue of a figure holding a sword, mounted on a tall plinth, which might signify a place of historical or memorial importance. The background also features neatly trimmed grass and another traditional building with arched features, suggesting the setting might be a public park or a similar communal area designed for events and gatherings. The bright, sunny day and the shadows cast indicate it's a clear day.","title":"\"house of coal\" erected by the hanna coal company in front of the Cadiz, Ohio, town hall, is an indication of the importance of the industry in the southeastern part of the state","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["544824","558146","554813","544911","557211","555599","545221","558147","551263","552681","547808","547295","557336","554458","557943","545870"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["visitor","building","guest","flooring","event","sign","welcome","statue","poster","importance"]}
