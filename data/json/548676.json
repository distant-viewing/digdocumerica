{"path":"548676.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures an underwater scene where a diver is exploring a vibrant coral reef. The diver, wearing a dark wetsuit, flippers, and a snorkel, is swimming just above the ocean floor, oriented towards the camera with most of the body visible except for the head, which is slightly tilted downwards and obscured.\n\nThe reef itself is rich with a variety of coral formations, predominantly large, rounded, brain-like corals that dominate the foreground. These corals exhibit textures and colors ranging from dark greens to browns. Interspersed among the brain corals are different types of underwater flora, including some elongated, thin, vertical elements that appear to be soft corals or sea whips. Also noticeable is a large fan-shaped coral towards the bottom right of the image.\n\nThe water is clear, emphasizing the vivid details and the varying textures of the coral and marine life. Light is filtering through from the surface, creating patterns and reflections that add a dynamic quality to the scene. The surface of the water is visible at the top of the photograph, subtly rippled and reflecting light, which illuminates the scene naturally.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the beauty and tranquility of the underwater environment, showcasing the interaction between the diver and the delicate aquatic ecosystem.","title":"A snorkeler observes the coral and sea life at the john pennekamp coral reef state park near key largo.
