{"path":"548209.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph features a large informational sign regarding water treatment facilities. The sign is white, with a prominent logo at the top left corner that says \"CLEAN WATER\" in a bold, black font on a white oval background. The text on the sign reads \"CITY OF PORTLAND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS COLUMBIA BLVD. SEWAGE TREATMENT PLANT 100 M.G.D. SECONDARY TREATMENT FACILITIES\". Additional text includes information about the contractor and engineering firms involved, as well as mentioning the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality.\n\nIn the background of the image, there appears to be a partly cloudy sky with a hint of industrial buildings and power lines, which suggests the proximity to the actual facility mentioned on the sign. The ground is grassy, pointing to a roadside or a similarly open setting. Additionally, there is a white truck visible far in the backdrop, which blends with the industrial theme. The overall composition indicates that this photograph was likely taken to document or advertise the efforts toward water treatment and environmental protection in Portland.","title":"Sign outside city sewage treatment plant","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["547876","549162","548193","548137","553351","548216","548212","543574","547257","553837","547260","543573","547239","542988","547252","553900"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["treatment","mention","sign","text","assistance","font","regard","say","facility","protection"]}
