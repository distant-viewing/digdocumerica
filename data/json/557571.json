{"path":"557571.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, early morning scene at a calm lake. A silver canoe is moored to a jetty in the foreground, with its wooden paddles inside, lightly touching the still water. Beside it is another boat, likely a small metal rowboat.\n\nThe lake surface reflects the surrounding landscape with an almost mirror-like clarity. Mist hovers above the lake, adding a mystical quality to the setting. On the other side of the lake, you can see a cluster of slender, tall trees, likely birch, grouped closely together on a small islet or peninsula. \n\nIn the background, the terrain rises gently into wooded hills and small mountains visible under a light morning haze. The overall atmosphere is tranquil and untouched, hinting at either early morning or late evening, when the light is soft and muted. The setting suggests a remote or secluded area where nature predominates.","title":"Early morning at Malibu lake in the santa monica mountains near Malibu, California, which is located on the northwestern edge of Los Angeles county.
