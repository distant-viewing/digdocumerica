{"path":"543086.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic and rugged coastline where steep, rocky cliffs meet the churning ocean. The image features a lighthouse standing prominently on the cliff edge, painted white with a traditional cylindrical structure and a small balcony around the lantern room at the top. Adjacent to the lighthouse are a few small, low buildings, possibly support structures for the lighthouse operations.\n\nThe coastline is jagged, with numerous sharp rocks protruding from the water close to the shore, around which white frothy waves crash, suggesting strong ocean currents or windy conditions. The color palette of the scene is dominated by natural tones: the deep blues of the ocean, the greyish-white of the crashing waves, and the earthy browns of the cliffs.\n\nThe sky appears slightly overcast, with hues of blue and grey, casting a moody light over the landscape. Overall, the composition of the photograph, with the lighthouse as a focal point, conveys a sense of isolation and the rugged beauty of nature where human structures interface with the powerful dynamics of the sea.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544996","550361","545118","550362","543291","545226","543403","547154","547131","543141","547916","543426","543422","550314","549375","543061"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["lighthouse","cliff","ocean","coastline","wave","lantern","dynamic","current","balcony","white"]}
