{"path":"557865.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph captures a moment inside a garage or service station, featuring three persons interacting around an old classic car, likely from the 1960s or 1970s. The car, finished in a pale blue color, is partially visible with its driver's side door open.\n\nOn the left, a man leans over the roof of the car, resting his left elbow on it, and his right hand on his hip. He appears to be in conversation with the elderly woman sitting inside the car. This man is dressed in a blue uniform shirt and dark belt and appears to be a police officer, based on the outfit and a visible badge on his belt.\n\nInside the car, the elderly woman, with gray hair, is seated in the driver's seat and appears to be engaged in a conversation, possibly explaining or discussing something with the officers. She wears a light-colored blouse and glasses with a cat-eye frame style.\n\nOn the right, another person, likely another police officer or a security guard based on the uniform and patch visible on the shirt sleeve, leans closer to the open window of the car to listen or speak to the woman. This officer also wears a blue uniform shirt and is positioned in such a way that his face is partly obscured as he bends down towards the car window.\n\nThe background reveals a portion of the green-painted interior of the garage or service station, and above, there's a small wall-mounted loudspeaker. The lighting in the space casts a cool tone over the scene, contributing further to the indoor setting's ambiance. The photograph conveys a sense of inquiry or routine check, characterized by the casual yet attentive postures of the individuals involved.","title":"Unhappy motorist learns that her car has failed the test at an auto emission inspection station at Norwood, Ohio.
