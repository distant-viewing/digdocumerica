{"path":"543317.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a tranquil ocean scene under sunlight. The predominant element here is the deep blue water, textured with subtle variations in shade and light, indicating gentle movement on the water’s surface. Several shimmering patches catch the light, creating sparkling effects scattered throughout the frame.\n\nCentral to the scene, there is a large patch of white water, possibly foam or bubbles, which stands out against the darker blue of the surrounding ocean. Within this patch, a single white seagull is visible. The bird appears to be either floating on the surface or in the process of taking off, as indicated by the visible spread of its wings and its prominent position in the foam.\n\nThe overall ambiance suggests a peaceful marine environment, possibly observed from an elevated viewpoint such as a cliff or the deck of a ship, giving a broad and undisturbed view across the ocean’s expansive surface. The setting is natural and serene, capturing a moment of natural beauty and simplicity.","title":"California--Monterey Bay","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["557814","555803","555713","547008","544683","549896","548754","542919","557813","552238","543138","543329","543260","548241","557508","554076"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["ocean","foam","patch","bubble","seagull","surface","sparkling","wing","shimmering","marine"]}
