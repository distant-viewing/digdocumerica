{"path":"553077.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a striking natural rock formation known as an arch, set against a vivid blue sky. The rock arch, composed of a red sandstone, features a large, rounded opening through which the sky is visible. The structure's surface shows evidence of erosion, with various striations and weathering patterns that add texture and depth.\n\nThe arch rises majestically from a base of rugged, layered rocks, suggesting significant geological activity over time. Below and around the arch, the terrain is uneven with small ledges and tiers of rock that create a natural staircase effect. Sparse vegetation, possibly shrubs or small trees, dots the landscape, offering a bit of greenery against the predominantly red and brown earth tones.\n\nThe background is minimal, emphasizing the isolation and prominence of the arch in its natural setting. The clear, deep blue sky forms a serene backdrop, highlighting the natural red hues of the stone and enhancing the overall contrast within the scene. The composition is focused on the arch, utilizing the natural lines and curves of the rock to draw the viewer's eye through the image and convey the grand scale and timeless beauty of this natural landmark.","title":"Angle Arch, Canyonlands National Park.
