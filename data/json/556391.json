{"path":"556391.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"The photograph captures a male worker portrayed in a gritty industrial setting. The worker, who is the main focus of the image, is standing in the foreground looking directly at the camera. His expression is serious, and he appears to be dirty, suggesting he has been engaged in physical labor. He wears a hard hat equipped with a headlamp, which along with stickers on the hat, indicates his workplace environment and perhaps some personalization. His clothing consists of a dark, soiled work jumpsuit, which is common in many industrial professions for safety and practicality.\n\nThe worker’s hard hat is notable for its worn and dusty appearance, and he also sports facial stubble, complementing the overall rugged aesthetic of the scene. His posture is slightly turned with one hand resting on his hip, adding a casual yet poised element to his demeanor.\n\nIn the background, partially out of focus, is another individual who appears to be conversing or moving past. The setting includes industrial elements like metal frameworks and part of a green structure, which might suggest the interior of a factory, workshop, or a similar industrial site. This backdrop reinforces the industrial vibe conveyed by the worker’s attire and equipment.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment in the life of industrial workers, highlighting elements of their daily environment and attire in a manner that emphasizes the physical and possibly challenging nature of their work.","title":"Raleigh Worley, a section foreman with Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company mine #4 near Richlands, Virginia.
