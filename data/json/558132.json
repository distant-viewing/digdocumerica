{"path":"558132.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a series of large, textured sculptures displayed on the exterior corner of a building, appearing to be in a public or semi-public space. The sculptures, made from a material resembling terra cotta or a similar type of clay, depict several figures involved in different activities, likely illustrating historical or traditional scenes.\n\nThe first figure, located on the left side of the view, is sculpted in relief format against the building's wall, showing a person gesturing or possibly reading from a book. Moving to the right, there is a freestanding sculpture of a person wrapping or unwrapping an object, capturing a moment of manual labor or craft. Concluding this narrative installation, another sculpture captures a figure engaged in pottery or similar craftwork, working beside a potter’s wheel with clay objects and tools.\n\nIn the background, the urban environment consists of a street with one-way traffic, indicated by the visible automobile—a classic car from around the 1970s or 1980s—further hinting the photograph likely dates back a few decades. On the far side of the street, commercial buildings with signs suggest a small-town main street setting, featuring businesses such as a cafe.\n\nThe overall composition of the photo juxtaposes the timeless, static artistry of sculpture against the fleeting, dynamic nature of everyday modern life. The contrast provides a striking visual commentary on the intersection of culture, history, and contemporary life. The photograph captures not just an artwork, but also hints at the character of the place and time in which it was situated.","title":"Brick sculpture on a wall in New Ulm, Minnesota, shows life in the area as it was lived in the 1850's. The artwork is located in an alley off Minnesota Street which houses the business district. It is part of the beautification of the downtown area which was a community wide effort. Sculptor Gordon Dingman and two assistants used brick made nearby for the work. New Ulm was founded in 1854 by a group of German immigrants. It is the county seat and trading center.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["546512","546516","551476","549676","557263","553254","553278","551654","551646","546508","553163","546520","551830","551651","551645","553266"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Religious Imagery"],"terms":["sculpture","clay","figure","street","artistry","relief","cafe","artwork","commentary","craft"]}
