{"path":"548603.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a complex tidal marsh system, capturing the intricate pattern of water channels and land. The various inlets and outlets form a maze-like pattern, with irregular shapes of land scattered throughout. The water appears darker, and these channels are various widths, meandering through the scene. The land is uneven, possibly muddy or sandy, and is not covered by significant vegetation, suggesting a largely barren or minimally vegetated marshland environment. The horizon is blurry, merging with the haze of the sky, offering little distinction between the sky and the distant landscape. The lighting in the photograph is dim, likely taken either during twilight or under overcast conditions, contributing to the moody and somber atmosphere of the scenery. The colors overall are muted, with dark tones dominating the water and lighter, possibly grayish tones reflecting off the barren land areas.","title":"Aerial view of the mingled land- and sea-scape at the southernmost tip of Florida: mangrove swamps and beginning of the Keys.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["547604","544786","544773","547544","542525","547500","545114","544687","552924","553085","545183","542869","552922","544515","547663","550788"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["land","channel","outlet","marshland","inlet","marsh","width","pattern","twilight","scenery"]}
