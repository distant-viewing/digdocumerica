{"path":"553565.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a vast landscape heavily affected by deforestation or possibly wildfire. The foreground and midground show large areas of barren land, where the earth is exposed and darkened, indicating burned or cleared surfaces. Sparse patches of remaining trees are scattered across the terrain, offering sharp contrast to the otherwise devastated environment.\n\nThe terrain is uneven and rolling, and there are patterns on the ground that may be the remnants of logging activities or natural regrowth paths following a fire. In the distance, the landscape transitions into areas that appear more lush and wooded, suggesting the edge of the affected area. The backdrop features layers of hills and mountains under a clear sky, hinting at the expansive and remote nature of the location.\n\nThe photograph has a somber and stark aesthetic, highlighted by the subdued lighting and shadowy details, possibly captured during dawn or dusk, enhancing the dramatic impact of the scene. The overall mood conveys a sense of isolation and environmental loss.","title":"In August, 1973 a major forest fire swept through 17,470 acres of the western slopes of the Sierra mountain range near Sonora burn area \"Granite Fire\" seen from the air.","placename":"Yosemite National Park (Calif.)","location":"Yosemite National Park, California","nn1":["555088","542819","555136","545138","555104","555162","555150","555089","542865","557001","545139","545264","542840","555202","555221","555094"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["loss","deforestation","fire","remnant","terrain","midground","transition","dawn","aesthetic","dusk"]}
