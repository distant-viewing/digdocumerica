{"path":"548954.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a pastoral scene in a rugged desert landscape. A line of cattle, mostly reddish-brown, is being herded across a sparse, sandy terrain dotted with small shrubs. Behind the herd, a mounted rider on a horse appears to be guiding the animals. The background is dominated by rolling hills and distant mountains which exhibit variations in shade, indicating different types of vegetation or shadow effects from clouds above. The overall hues are muted, typical of arid environments, with greys, browns, and greens blending into each other. The scene conveys a sense of solitude and the vastness of the natural environment.","title":"Cattle raised on experimental farm operated by EPA's Las Vegas National Research Center","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["553105","552698","548829","548828","553100","548830","543634","552565","543776","545901","553101","553104","553814","548878","554128","549033"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["herd","cattle","rider","horse","variation","guide","grey","roll","desert","animal"]}
