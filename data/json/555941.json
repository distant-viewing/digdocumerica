{"path":"555941.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This photograph captures three young girls in what appears to be a playful and joyful moment. The girl in the foreground is looking directly at the camera, with a subtle smile and her tongue playfully sticking out. She wears a light pink, knitted top. Just behind her, another girl is visible, partially obscured, but her presence is marked by a big, engaging smile, and she wears a blue shirt. The third girl on the right is also smiling widely, wearing a striped tank top and her dark hair is pulled back with a clip.\n\nThe setting of the photo conveys a late evening atmosphere with soft, natural lighting, making the environment appear serene and slightly dim. In the background, there is a blurry scene of a water body, perhaps a lake or large puddle, reflecting the twilight. Various indistinct objects and perhaps litter can be seen scattered in and around the water. The focus and depth of field bring the girls into sharp contrast against the more muted, indistinct background which sets an urban, outdoor scene. The girls' expressions and poses suggest a moment of innocent camaraderie and youthful energy, typical of childhood play and interaction.","title":"Three young girls in Brooklyn, New York city.
