{"path":"551228.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"In the photograph, the scene depicts a group of individuals engaged with a large boat in a dock setting. The composition displays one man in the foreground on the left, who is bent over inside the boat, apparently busy working on something. He is wearing a white T-shirt and jeans. On the far right, standing on the dock, stands another man in a uniform, including a light-colored shirt, dark pants, and a cap, facing and interacting with a woman who is wearing a light summer dress and sunglasses. She stands relatively relaxed, with her weight shifted to one hip, and she holds a small handbag.\n\nThe boat itself is sizable, featuring a white hull with multiple windows and life preservers attached along its side rails. Other maritime elements, such as ropes, are visible around the boat, contributing to the nautical atmosphere. The dock is constructed of concrete, with one green hose and other maritime or cleaning equipment present.\n\nIn the upper middle background, an elevated structure spans across the top of the image, possibly a bridge or building. Below this structure, cars can be seen parked or moving, suggesting proximity to a public or semi-public area. The ambient light is bright, suggesting a sunny day, casting moderate shadows and contributing to the vivid colors of the environment.","title":"A member of the Missouri Water Patrol watches as houseboat's toilet holding tank is pumped out at Link's Landing in Osage Beach.
