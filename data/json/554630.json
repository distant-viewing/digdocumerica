{"path":"554630.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph portrays an industrial scene set in a lush, green landscape. In the foreground, there is a calm body of water reflecting the sky and surroundings. To the right of the picture, there is a pile of dark-colored stones and some scattered pieces of wood debris, suggesting either construction or mining activity.\n\nThe main focus of the image lies in the middle ground, which features a large factory complex with several multi-story buildings. Various chutes and connection points between the buildings suggest that this is possibly a processing plant or a manufacturing facility. Smoke, likely steam, can be seen emitting from a tall stack, indicating active production.\n\nThe background is framed by wooded hills that rise gently behind the factory, contributing to a scenic yet contrasting view of industry and nature. The overcast sky and the presence of the dense flora indicate a likely temperate climate. Overall, the scene captures a moment of industrial activity amidst natural surroundings, possibly highlighting issues related to industrial impact on the environment.","title":"Remains of lake sanford at tahawus, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve, which as been filled with titanium tailings from nl industries","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["557377","543813","557225","546073","546007","550694","552194","550672","550995","551156","548070","552246","550724","551576","550329","545053"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["factory","chute","surroundings","scenic","production","flora","issue","manufacturing","connection","buildings"]}
