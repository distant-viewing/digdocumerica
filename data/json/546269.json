{"path":"546269.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a scientific or medical experiment setup showing a close-up view of laboratory equipment and a human hand performing some type of procedure or adjustment. The primary piece of equipment featured is a complex apparatus mounted on a vertical stand.\n\nKey attributes and components visible in the image include:\n- A cylindrical black and pink structure, likely part of a mechanical or optical device, perhaps a microscope or part of a specialized medical machine. This structure is mounted on a support that allows positional adjustments.\n- A syringe pump mechanism (the cylindrical component labeled \"HAMILTON\") that is feeding a clear fluid through a plastic tubing system. This is connected to a smaller cylindrical component fitted with what appears to be a metal needle or probe.\n- Detailing includes various knobs, adjustment rings, and measurement scales (there's a ruler section visible), which suggests precision control is required in the process being conducted.\n- A human hand, partially visible, is adjusting the equipment. It appears that they might be administering the fluid in the syringe or adjusting the flow rate, possibly into a sample or a device under examination.\n- The backdrop consists of lightly colored, possibly metallic or laminated surfaces that suggest a sterile or controlled environment typical of a scientific lab or a medical facility.\n\nThe overall tone of the image, along with the visible machinery, suggests a meticulous, precise scientific or medical operation, focused on measurement, injection, or analysis in a laboratory setting.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory: the microbiology lab.
