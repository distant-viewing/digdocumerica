{"path":"554487.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene featuring a pair of small seaplanes parked on the shore. The image portrays a calm lake with gentle ripples on the water's surface, reflecting a slightly overcast sky.\n\nThe front airplane, predominantly red with a white stripe, is equipped with pontoons and parked just at the water's edge on what appears to be a makeshift ramp or dock area. The registration number \"N4957A\" is visible on its side. Behind it, another similar seaplane in orange and white is also parked, partially visible.\n\nThe shoreline is lined with trees, primarily conifers, suggesting a woodland area. The photo also captures a hint of some man-made structures amidst the trees, potentially cabins or small lodges common to lakeside resort areas.\n\nIn the background, the opposite shore of the lake is densely wooded, contributing to a quiet, secluded atmosphere. A few people can be faintly seen near the planes and further up the shore, indicating some leisure or maintenance activity but maintaining the peaceful setting.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo—using natural light, with a focus on the interaction between technology (seaplanes) and nature (lake and woods)—creates a tranquil, picturesque scene typical of a recreational or vacation spot.","title":"Seaplanes awaiting charter business at their landing at long lake, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554654","551219","554656","556909","543579","543527","557562","543547","544266","556905","547027","544031","544567","548469","556928","548185"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["shore","lakeside","lake","park","ramp","vacation","registration","resort","plane","airplane"]}
