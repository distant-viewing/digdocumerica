{"path":"543245.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a bustling fish packing scene inside a factory. Multiple workers, mainly women, are engaged in the task of handling and packaging fish. They are dressed in protective work attire, including pink and yellow aprons over their clothes, headscarves, and rubber gloves to comply with hygiene requirements.\n\nThe assembly line where the workers are stationed features a conveyor belt or table brimming with copious amounts of small, silvery fish. The women are busy sorting and placing these fish into styrofoam boxes, presumably for distribution or sale. The immediate focus is on the woman in the foreground, who is intently placing fish into a box, showcasing a routine yet meticulous operation.\n\nIn the background, more workers can be seen performing similar tasks. The interior of the factory is functional with basic industrial equipment and plain walls, which emphasizes the focus on the workers' activities. Overhead lighting illuminates the workspace, enhancing the metallic sheen of the fish and providing a vivid insight into the seafood processing industry. The scene is a testament to the labor-intensive nature of this industry, highlighting the teamwork and effort involved in preparing seafood products for market.","title":"Packing the catch","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["545064","545065","550316","550320","545202","545198","547551","552875","552635","545211","544995","558377","545284","554431","554095","551405"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["fish","worker","seafood","box","factory","industry","packaging","testament","woman","task"]}
