{"path":"543853.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a smiling woman standing outdoors. She is wearing a large, light purple floppy hat and is dressed in a layered outfit consisting of a greenish yellow buttoned shirt over a dark shirt, coupled with a black underlayer visible at the neck and wrists. She is holding what appears to be a pair of work gloves and a wooden handle, suggesting she might be engaged in some kind of outdoor or gardening activity.\n\nThe woman's expression is joyful and friendly, with a slight squint that suggests she might be smiling towards someone familiar. Her skin is fair, and she has dark hair peeking out from under her hat.\n\nThe background is blurred and nondescript, primarily in earthy tones that complement her attire, indicating an outdoor, possibly rural setting. The lighting in the image softly illuminates her face and hat, highlighting her cheerful expression and casual outdoor work attire.","title":"Young migrant worker weeds sugar beets from 7:00 a.m. until dusk for $2.00 an hour.","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["543864","547385","554923","544747","554051","554049","557039","557172","557114","556487","547281","556143","547372","543319","545742","553165"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["hat","smile","squint","wrist","gardening","glove","peek","expression","neck","skin"]}
