{"path":"554050.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a moment involving two individuals, likely farm workers, during an agricultural activity. They appear to be interacting with a piece of farming machinery under a cloudy sky.\n\nOne person, who is standing, is dressed in a jacket and a form of headscarf. This individual is climbing onto or stabilizing themselves on a red metal structure, perhaps a part of the machinery, which features a wheel and a chain. They are reaching out as if to receive something or to assist.\n\nThe second person, who is seated and also wearing a headscarf, seems to be in conversation or engaging with the standing person. There's a dark-toned bag hanging from their shoulder, suggesting they might be carrying supplies or personal items.\n\nThe background shows an expansive open field under a dramatic, cloud-filled sky, hinting at a vast agricultural landscape. The lighting is relatively dim, likely due to the overcast conditions, which adds a somewhat somber tone to the scene.\n\nOverall, the image portrays a moment of daily life in a rural, farm-based setting, highlighting the interactions and laborious activities of agricultural workers.","title":"Sugarcane workers in bonnets of a kind customarily worn by the Japanese who labored here a quarter of a century earlier; workers are now mostly Filipinos.","placename":"Maui (Hawaii)","location":"Maui, Hawaii","nn1":["554108","549036","543845","553093","557521","553665","544246","554203","554936","554047","544319","553659","554922","554049","555619","549259"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["headscarf","farm","worker","person","machinery","supply","chain","farming","wheel","shoulder"]}
