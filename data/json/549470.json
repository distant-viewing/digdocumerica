{"path":"549470.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph provides an aerial view of a marine construction or docking area. The image features a body of water, surrounded by artificial barriers and docking facilities. There are several key elements visible:\n\n1. **Water Body**: The predominant feature is the blue-green water, likely a sea or lake, which occupies most of the frame.\n\n2. **Docking Structures**: On the bottom left and extending towards the center, there are elongated structures protruding into the water. These appear to be docks or wharfs and are constructed with red parallel lines, possibly indicating lanes or specific docking sections.\n\n3. **Floating Platforms**: In the water, there are two noticeable floating platforms. One near the center right is more complex, perhaps a floating workstation or a pontoon equipped with machinery or cargo.\n\n4. **Construction Materials and Equipment**: Along the docks, there are various construction materials visible. These include piles of what appear to be either red bricks or containers. There are also vehicles and equipment scattered around, indicating ongoing construction or operations.\n\n5. **Breakwaters**: Surrounding parts of the water body are rock-lined breakwaters designed to protect the area from waves and stabilize the shoreline.\n\n6. **Vegetated Islands**: Towards the top part of the image, there are two small islands or constructed features with vegetation. These elements could serve purposes such as environmental protection or simply aesthetic enhancement.\n\n7. **Overall Activity & Purpose**: The area is clearly industrial or commercial, focused on marine operations, possibly related to shipping, construction, or maintenance activities.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, with its clear aerial perspective, helps emphasize the organization and scale of the human-made marine structures within the natural water environment.","title":"Recreation and boating area under construction on the Buffalo waterfront","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["549528","549484","552269","548783","544650","551976","546359","552007","548361","544635","551599","546823","550342","548628","545024","548777"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["construction","dock","docking","float","marine","platform","construct","workstation","water","purpose"]}
