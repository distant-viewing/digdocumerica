{"path":"554442.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant gathering of people sitting in an outdoor amphitheater. The individuals appear to be watching an event or a performance, given their attentive postures and the direction they are facing.\n\nIn the forefront, a man with a mustache and dark hair wearing a black T-shirt is sitting cross-legged on what looks like a red blanket. Next to him, a woman with sunglasses and long hair in a flowery top, along with a person donning a yellow shirt, appear to be enjoying the occasion together.\n\nMoving towards the background, the diversity in the crowd is evident through various ages and styles of clothing, ranging from casual T-shirts and jeans to more formal outfits and varied headwear, including caps and scarves. The atmosphere seems relaxed yet engaged, with some individuals leaning forward in interest, while others talk and smile among themselves.\n\nThe bleachers, built from logs, add a rustic, natural feel to the setting, suggesting this event could be a community meeting, local concert, or similar social gathering taking place in a park or similar natural locale. Verdant trees in the background hint at a summertime outdoor setting, enhancing the sense of a communal, leisurely outing.","title":"Participants lend attentive ear to competitor at \"Old Fiddlers' Contest\" at Old Forge.
