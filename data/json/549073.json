{"path":"549073.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and crowded indoor scene, likely depicting a community or organizational meeting, possibly in a rural or agricultural setting. The room is filled predominantly with men, many of whom are wearing wide-brimmed hats, suggesting a cultural or regional dress style, possibly related to cowboy or rural attire.\n\nThe men are densely packed into the space, standing and focusing their attention towards the center, where other men are seated around a small, cluttered table. The seated men appear to be leading or participating actively in the discussion. The majority of participants are engaged, either looking intently at the person speaking or discussing amongst themselves.\n\nThe room's interior is simple with panelled walls and modest lighting which casts a soft glow, contributing to the somber yet engaged atmosphere of the meeting. The decor includes minimal furnishings suggesting a functional space possibly dedicated to community gatherings or meetings of this nature.\n\nOverall, the composition and mood of the photograph depict a serious and perhaps pivotal moment, with community members actively involved in a discussion or decision-making process.","title":"Governor of mexican state of baja California, milton casteLlanos, meets with mexican cotton farmers in mexicali mexico on the agenda: poor quality of Colorado river water, a factor in the poor cotton crop","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["547365","552616","547407","547320","556450","552618","545384","547367","547284","557704","558393","551853","552617","557027","558262","556028"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Woman 1"],"terms":["meeting","discussion","community","room","decision","furnishing","man","decor","majority","cowboy"]}
