{"path":"550396.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This aerial photograph features a rugged and textured landscape predominantly characterized by steep mountainous terrains. The mountains are prominently marked by sharp cliffs and deep ravines, suggesting significant geological activity such as erosion. The color palette of the terrain ranges from dark brown to lighter beige, with variations in color likely due to differences in rock types and soil.\n\nThe mountains have a relatively bare surface with minimal vegetation, which could suggest a dry environment or one where the soil is not conducive to dense vegetation. The peaks and higher areas of the mountains are slightly smoother and less jagged compared to the deeply eroded valleys.\n\nIn the background, beyond the immediate mountain ranges, the terrain gradually levels out into what appears to be a flatter, more expansive landscape. This area has a hint of green, indicating the presence of grass or low bushes, which contrasts with the barren mountain fronts.\n\nThe composition of the image with its broad, sweeping view of the mountains descending into flat terrains and the variance in natural colors provides a vivid portrayal of an arid, dramatic landscape seen from above. This type of geography is typical of areas with significant past or current tectonic activity influencing the landscape's formation. Overall, the photograph captures a desolate yet striking natural scene, emphasizing the stark beauty and scale of mountainous terrains.","title":"Bluffs opposite sagwon, a commercial airstrip and oil exploration center south of prudhoe bay.
