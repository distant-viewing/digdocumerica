{"path":"548467.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures a relaxed and intimate scene at a scenic outdoor location, likely a park near an airport, based on the presence of large airplanes in the background. In the foreground, two people, likely a couple, are lying close together on the grass. Both are facing each other, and it appears they are engaging in a private conversation or a tender moment. The woman has her arm around the man, drawing him closer.\n\nThe surrounding environment suggests a sunny day, perfect for outdoor activities, as evidenced by others also enjoying the beach in the background. The water body and the green grass provide a pleasant and peaceful setting, despite the proximity to an airport, indicated by several planes in various stages of taxiing or takeoff. The vivid blue of the sky and the water contrast beautifully with the green of the grass, enhancing the calmness of the scene.\n\nFurther adding to the composition, there are other people visible in the further background, possibly enjoying the beach or swimming in the water. The overall feel of the photograph is one of leisure and relaxation, juxtaposed interestingly with the industrial background of aircraft operations.","title":"Constitution beach--within sight and sound of Logan airport's takeoff runway 22r","placename":"East Boston (Boston, Mass.)","location":"East Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["548464","548465","554901","549922","551945","547237","549755","552977","553065","549756","551027","548833","551682","558182","554900","548468"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["airport","grass","beach","enjoy","plane","airplane","calmness","aircraft","swim","relaxation"]}
