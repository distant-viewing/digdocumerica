{"path":"547625.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph depicts a large scrapyard filled with heaps of metallic waste and machinery parts. In the foreground, various disassembled and broken parts of machines, possibly from industrial or construction equipment, are scattered haphazardly. These parts include rusted circular gears, metal rods, and casing fragments. Some of the parts appear heavily corroded, indicating long-term exposure to the elements.\n\nThe middle ground shows an expanded view of the scrapyard with larger piles of similar waste, creating a mountainous landscape of metal. Among the debris, occasional recognizable objects like vehicle parts and white home appliances (possibly refrigerators or washing machines) can be seen.\n\nIn the background, the scene continues with even larger accumulations of scrap metal. Thereâ€™s a crane visible, suggesting ongoing activities related to organizing, moving, or possibly recycling the metal waste. The sky is partly cloudy, suggesting an overcast but bright day. Overall, the photograph captures a stark industrial environment focused on the collection and possibly the recycling of metal waste.","title":"Scrap metal yard on the waterfront","placename":"Providence (R.I.)","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","nn1":["554318","547611","547610","548147","554300","546256","545059","552740","546267","554301","554335","542585","557308","548109","546255","548110"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["waste","scrapyard","metal","machine","part","disassemble","recycle","refrigerator","washing","case"]}
