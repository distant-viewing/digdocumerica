{"path":"546232.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene in which a group of deer are gathered in a field. The field is sparsely covered with grass and dotted with blooming yellow flowers, possibly sunflowers, contributing bright splashes of color to the image. The deer are various sizes and mostly appear to be does and young deer, with a few prominently displaying antlers, suggesting they are bucks.\n\nIn the background, a dense line of trees, lush and green, provides a contrasting backdrop to the relatively open field. The trees cast shadows which contribute to the spread of light and shade across the scene, adding depth and dimension to the landscape. The lighting, which seems to be from early morning or late afternoon, creates a soft and warm ambiance.\n\nThis peaceful gathering of deer, undisturbed in their natural habitat, offers a glimpse into wildlife behavior and the beauty of a forest-edge ecosystem. The composition, with its focus on the group in the context of their environment, evokes a sense of tranquility and the simplicity of nature.","title":"Wild deer in garner state park","placename":"San Antonio (Tex.)","location":"San Antonio, Texas","nn1":["546198","542963","546088","542955","544914","542959","544114","545902","542961","553808","558368","554619","544571","543326","543369","543279"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","field","antler","blooming","behavior","dimension","covered","group","contrasting","splash"]}
