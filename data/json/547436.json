{"path":"547436.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph features a scene of agricultural activity, prominently displaying a large farm tractor equipped with a plow, working in a field. The setting of the photograph is characterized by a dusty, seemingly arid environment, as indicated by the large clouds of dust surrounding the tractor, which suggests soil disruption due to the plowing activity.\n\nThe background presents a soft, hazy horizon with low mountains or hills, which adds to the depth and expanse of the landscape. The sky occupies a significant portion of the frame, imbuing the scene with a warm, golden hue that likely indicates the photograph was taken either early in the morning or late in the afternoon, capturing the soft glow of the sun possibly at or nearing golden hour.\n\nThe lighting and color palette consist of muted earth tones, blending yellows, browns, and soft oranges, creating an overall impression of a warm, somewhat obscured and dusty environment. The framing and composition of the image enhance the feeling of remote, rugged agricultural work, and showcase the tractor dominating the right side of the image, with its outline slightly silhouetted against the lighter sky, emphasizing its importance and scale in this environment.","title":"Cutting barley in the Imperial Valley, south of the Salton Sea","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["544888","547297","544319","555878","553665","552577","547690","554204","547301","545893","554202","557521","555879","544323","554015","548903"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["tractor","disruption","importance","framing","dust","hour","yellow","farm","outline","glow"]}
