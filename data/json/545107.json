{"path":"545107.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a close-up of an animal skull heavily encrusted with barnacles and other marine organisms, suggesting it has been submerged in ocean waters for an extended period. The skull, possibly from a small mammal or bird given its size and shape, is placed on a wooden surface with a rough texture, possibly a piece of driftwood or a simple plank. The skull is oriented with the front facing towards the viewer, displaying empty eye sockets and a row of barnacle-encrusted teeth. The background is blurred but hints at a natural outdoor setting with soft, earthy colors that suggest a focus on the skull itself. The overall composition emphasizes the textures and intricate details of the marine growth on the bone, illustrating an intersection of life and death in a natural aquatic environment.","title":"Oysters are grown on sticks protruding from Newport estuary to protect them from \"ghost shrimp.\"  The shrimp disturb the oyster beds and suffocate the oysters","placename":"Newport (Or.)","location":"Newport, Oregon","nn1":["552691","553850","552866","552998","545161","545820","546138","545092","552867","546779","547003","557101","555060","546241","552941","548538"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["tooth","organism","driftwood","orient","intersection","outdoor","close","plank","up","bird"]}
