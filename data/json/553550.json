{"path":"553550.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures a street scene set in a residential area. The image depicts a row of houses on the left and a weathered two-story building with a classical facade on the right. This larger building on the right displays architectural details such as ornamental pediments and rectangular columns, giving it a somewhat dignified appearance, although it seems to be in a state of disrepair.\n\nA tree-lined street runs through the middle of the photo, with several cars parked along the curb. These cars appear to be models from the 1960s or 1970s, judging by their design. The street is bathed in sunlight, casting shadows from the trees onto the asphalt.\n\nOn the sidewalk, three people are visible. They are walking away from the viewpoint, scattered along the block, and seem engaged in their routine activities like walking or heading towards a destination.\n\nOverall, the image has a quiet, slightly nostalgic atmosphere, likely due to the combination of older architectural styles, vintage vehicles, and the natural lighting. The wear visible on the buildings and the serene street activity give a glimpse into everyday life in this neighborhood.","title":"Mulky Square houses, vacant now because they stand in the path of a new interstate highway (I-635).
