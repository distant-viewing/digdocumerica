{"path":"555424.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures the neon-lit signage of a venue named \"The Lilicum.\" The top part of the sign features a mountain peak silhouette in a circular frame, placed above the stylized, illuminated letters spelling out \"The Lilicum.\" Below this, in vibrant red neon letters, is the word \"COCKTAILS,\" indicating the venue serves drinks.\n\nBeneath the neon signage, there's a large, billowing marquee containing a humorous and perhaps metaphorical message in capitalized letters: \"OUR LIGHTS ARE OFF BUT WE ARE ON.\" The message implies that although the lighting might be down or minimal, the establishment is still operational. The background is a stark, dark black, helping the illuminated elements of the sign stand out prominently. This image exudes a nighttime atmosphere, primarily highlighted by artificial lighting and the distinctive glow of neon.","title":"The energy crisis in the states or Oregon and Washington resulted in attempts at humor by businesses with outdoor signboards.
