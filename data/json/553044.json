{"path":"553044.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant, action-packed aerial scene of crop dusting. In the foreground, there are dense, leafy grapevines under a bright blue sky. Hovering closely above these vines, a biplane is portrayed in mid-flight, distinguished by its dual-wing structure and traditional propeller at the front.\n\nThe biplane is actively spraying a large, billowy white cloud of pesticide or fertilizer over the crops. The dispersal of the spray is quite dramatic, highlighting the plane's primary role in agriculture for pest control and crop nutrition enhancement.\n\nThe angle of the photograph, looking upward from the ground, provides a dynamic view of the airplane, emphasizing its movement and the sweeping arc of the spray. The lighting accentuates the vivid contrast between the deep colors of the plane and the vines against the pale spray and clear sky. This scene not only captures the intensity and necessity of agricultural practices but also reflects a moment of human ingenuity interacting with nature.","title":"Dusting sulphur to retard mildew on grapevines.
