{"path":"553644.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a man working in a logging setting, surrounded by massive piles of cut logs. The man, who appears to be a worker given his attire, is wearing light-colored jeans, a sleeveless white shirt, and a protective white hard hat. He is positioned atop one of the logs, standing upright while holding a long hook or pike pole, commonly used in logging to move large logs. \n\nThe background features an immense stack of logs which fill the frame, showcasing the breadth and scale of the logging operation. The logs are unevenly cut and show various shades of brown and black, indicative of different types of wood and conditions. The natural texture and circular patterns of the cut tree trunks are prominent and form a rugged backdrop.\n\nThe lighting suggests this image could have been taken either early in the morning or late in the evening, as the light source highlights the worker and parts of the background logs, leaving other areas in shadow, which adds a dramatic effect to the scene.","title":"In August, 1973, a major forest fire swept through the western slopes of the Sierra Mountain range near Sonora, California.
