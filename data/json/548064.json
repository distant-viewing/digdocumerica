{"path":"548064.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a serene riverside landscape dominated by an imposing steel bridge that spans the body of water. The bridge features multiple arch sections and a larger vertical lift section near one end, suggesting it may accommodate boat traffic below. The water is calm, reflecting the bridge and the partly cloudy sky above.\n\nIn the foreground, a striking vertical composition of a vine-covered post is richly adorned with cascading yellow flowers, adding a vibrant splash of color to the scene. To the right of the flower-laden post, a variety of lush, green bushes and a singular tree with reddish foliage are also visible, contributing to the natural beauty of the riverside.\n\nThe overall composition of the image is balanced between the industrial structure of the bridge and the organic, flourishing plant life at its edge. The sky, tinged with shades of blue and white, casts a peaceful mood over the scene. This setting likely serves as a pleasant viewing or recreational point, given the enhanced focus on the aesthetic interaction between the man-made and natural elements.","title":"The interstate bridge which connects Portland and Vancouver, Washington, is the only Columbia River crossing for 50 miles.","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548087","551527","552598","557959","552052","555730","557096","544542","549469","547669","552247","548098","557974","557996","549068","558051"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["bridge","riverside","post","flourish","laden","vine","flower","accommodate","section","tinge"]}
