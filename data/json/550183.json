{"path":"550183.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph presents an industrial and somewhat ominous scene, captured in hues of brown and orange which suggest either a setting sun or polluted air. A multitude of electrical towers and power lines dominate the foreground and middle of the image, creating a dense network of vertical and diagonal lines against the sky. These metal structures are intricately interconnected, highlighting a complex electrical grid. \n\nIn the background, thick dark smoke billows upwards, obscuring parts of the sky and likely contributing to the murky, sepia-toned atmosphere. The source of the smoke is not visible, but it gives a strong indication of industrial activity, possibly from factories or power plants.\n\nThe lower part of the image shows a road or a highway lined with more utility poles and power lines. There are two cars on the road, which adds a human element to the scene, though the cars look small and somewhat insignificant amidst the overpowering infrastructure surrounding them. \n\nOverall, the composition and colour palette evoke a mood that might be described as bleak or dystopian, reflecting themes of industrialization, environmental pollution, and the overshadowing scale of human-made structures compared to the natural environment.","title":"Dark clouds of factory smoke obscure Clark Avenue Bridge","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["543006","550982","543007","550168","550179","549190","551030","557374","550185","550172","545447","550171","551033","550175","548850","543728"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["power","line","smoke","industrialization","indication","multitude","source","road","car","grid"]}
