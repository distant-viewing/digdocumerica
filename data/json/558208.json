{"path":"558208.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Haque, Abul","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of daily life featuring a yellow school bus labeled \"NEW ULM SCHOOLS\" parked along a curb. A school staff member, possibly the bus driver, stands in the open doorway of the bus, facing inward, slightly leaning towards the interior. On the sidewalk in front of the bus, two children are visible; one is about to board the bus and another is moving away from it. This suggests the children are either getting off or readying to board the bus.\n\nThe scene takes place in a suburban area, indicated by the presence of manicured lawns and residential structures in the background. The street is devoid of moving traffic, adding a calm, routine feel to the setting. The sunlight casts shadows of leafless tree branches onto the side of the bus, suggesting it's possibly either autumn or winter without snow. The photograph has a somewhat muted color palette, characteristic of the film photography of earlier decades.","title":"Students arriving by schoolbus at cathedral senior high school in New Ulm, Minnesota.
