{"path":"550576.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image features a vast aerial view of a river meandering through a densely forested landscape. The river, a broad waterway, exhibits a prominent s-curve as it flows through the valley. Its banks are varied, with some areas showing wide swathes of sandy shores.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is dominated by lush, green forests that cover rolling hills and low mountains. The difference in the vegetation density and the patches of either lighter green or brown areas suggest variations in the terrain's elevation, moisture, and possibly the type of vegetation growing there.\n\nThe photograph's viewpoint is from a high altitude, looking directly down into the valley carved by the river, encompassing a panoramic view that emphasizes the vastness and isolation of the landscape. No man-made structures or people are visible, suggesting a natural, untouched environment. The lighting in the photo suggests either early morning or late afternoon, as the colors are soft with subtle shadows that gently model the terrain.","title":"Salcha river crossing.
