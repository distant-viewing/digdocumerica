{"path":"545302.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a group of pelicans resting and congregating in a body of water at dusk. The image is tinted with warm golden hues, suggesting it is either dawn or sunset. The water surface reflects these warm tones, adding a shimmering texture to the image.\n\nThe pelicans are primarily in the middle ground of the image, distributed unevenly, with some closer and others further away from the viewer. Most of the birds face the same direction to the right, suggesting a uniform focus or common point of interest out of frame.\n\nThe foreground of the photograph is blurred, perhaps indicating a shallower part of the water body or the bank of the water body, with particles or debris floating on or near the water's surface. The background is out of focus but continues the theme of warm lit skies and tranquil water surface, emphasizing calmness.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, along with the lighting and the subjectsâ€™ orientation, evokes a sense of peace and the simplicity of a moment captured in nature.","title":"Pelicans and sea algae on the rogue river estuary","placename":"Gold Beach (Or.)","location":"Gold Beach, Oregon","nn1":["545187","548728","552912","552911","555554","550903","544500","552909","544609","547744","544597","548832","545991","543063","553875","547726"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["water","subjects","closer","orientation","particle","surface","distribute","peace","body","tint"]}
