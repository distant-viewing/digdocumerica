{"path":"542974.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of a sandy surface with a textured, uneven terrain. The ground is covered with what appears to be fine red sand, creating a series of small dunes and ridges, indicative of wind activity. Scattered across the sandy surface are various broken fragments of what might be pottery or ceramic material. These fragments vary in size and shape, some are larger with discernible curves suggesting they might have been parts of a vessel, while others are smaller, sharper shards.\n\nThe lighting in the image casts shadows from the fragments, emphasizing their shapes and the texture of the sand. There are no visible plants or other objects, and the background is uniformly the sandy surface, which stretches to the edges of the photograph. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of deep reddish-brown, contrasted by the lighter and darker tones resulting from the play of light and shadow. The scene does not include any people or animals; it focuses entirely on the natural landscape and the ceramic debris.","title":"Broken bottles on arcata beach in early morning","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["545678","545583","555200","552420","544401","545817","551232","545597","552923","545804","545587","542511","557417","553582","551233","552423"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["fragment","sand","lighter","shape","dune","surface","casts","result","ridge","vessel"]}
