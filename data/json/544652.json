{"path":"544652.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph shows a litter-strewn forest floor, depicting an unfortunate scene of environmental pollution. The ground is covered with pine needles and surrounded by tall, thin trees, creating a natural woodland backdrop. Amidst this forest setting, various discarded items can be seen scattered across the scene, including aluminum cans, glass bottles, and pieces of paper. Notably, some of the labels on the items, like one that reads “Class,” suggest these are old-style beer bottles and beverage cans strewn haphazardly among the foliage. Amid the unconcerned natural beauty of the forest, this litter acts as a jarring clash, demonstrating human disregard for natural spaces.","title":"Litter left by visitors in the taMiami canal area beside Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["544644","544640","544648","544651","544298","555228","543616","556942","551247","554538","550687","552100","551440","543589","550352","547525"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["can","bottle","strew","forest","disregard","aluminum","beer","item","beverage","needle"]}
