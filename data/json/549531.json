{"path":"549531.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph captures a striking aerial view of a tourist boat navigating a vividly blue body of water, likely a river or lake. The boat appears substantial in size, painted white with a red roof, and features what looks like open deck space where passengers can openly view their surroundings. It is creating a slight wake as it moves on the water, indicating it is in motion.\n\nIn the foreground, a prominent natural scene unfolds with a rugged coastline visible. This part of the coast is characterized by dark rocky formations giving way to rising steam or mist, suggesting close proximity to geothermal activity or possibly the area being near a waterfall, as indicated by the presence of a delicate rainbow in the mist. Wooden viewing platforms with various levels can be seen constructed along the coast, allowing visitors a closer view of the spectacle. The platforms are populated by several sightseers, barely visible as small figures standing and moving on the wooden pathways.\n\nThis scenery is both dramatic and serene, combining the steady, engineered movement of the tourist boat with the raw, natural power of the steaming landscape, inviting viewers to reflect on the interaction between human activity and natural wonders.","title":"At \"Cave of the Winds,\" at the base of the cliffs on Boat Island, tourists in yellow raingear look toward the American Falls out on the river, a \"Maid-of-the-Mist\" sightseeing boat plies between the American and Canadian shores.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["555693","555710","544142","555701","549532","549458","545057","545736","549066","551222","549561","548202","550825","549541","544383","555694"],"cl":[27],"cluster":["#27 &mdash; Natural Disasters"],"terms":["coast","tourist","boat","mist","platform","rainbow","wonder","spectacle","wake","waterfall"]}
