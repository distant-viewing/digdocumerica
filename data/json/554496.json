{"path":"554496.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph features a young child interacting with a taxidermy bear displayed outside a building. The child, dressed in a light green long-sleeve shirt and blue jeans, is reaching up to touch the bearâ€™s front paw. The bear, which is positioned on its hind legs, appears to be caught in a playful or animated gesture, with its mouth open and one paw extended toward the child as if in a handshake or greeting.\n\nThe setting is a wooden porch of a building named \"Klondike Kate's Floradora Dance Hall,\" as indicated by the signs above the entrance. This building is painted in a pastel green with white trimming and has multiple windows visible in the background. The wooden floor of the porch where the child and the bear are positioned adds a rustic feel to the scene.\n\nThe ambiance conveys a whimsical, albeit slightly surreal moment, combining elements of historical context (suggested by the name and style of the building) with a child's innocent interaction with a symbol of the wilderness. The overcast sky suggests a mild or cool weather condition during this encounter.","title":"Child pokes his finger at a stuffed bear in the Enchanted Forest at Old Forge, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["551807","543368","554457","554446","554456","543678","543780","549674","542605","555990","544207","547727","542767","546218","543365","543784"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["child","porch","trimming","gesture","symbol","building","mouth","leg","entrance","name"]}
