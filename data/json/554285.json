{"path":"554285.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a snowy scene at a ski resort. In the foreground, there is a large collection of luggage and ski equipment piled on the snow-covered ground. These items vary widely, including hard-shell suitcases, ski bags, and miscellaneous bags and boxes.\n\nThere is a group of people gathered in the midground, outside what appears to be a lodge or accommodation facility. These persons, predominantly dressed in winter and ski apparel such as parkas and knit hats, seem to be engaging in conversation or waiting, possibly for transportation or room allocation.\n\nIn the background, the scene shows a mountainous landscape, indicating the resort's location in a valley suited for winter sports. A cable or power line stretches across the scene partially, running parallel to the mountain slope, emphasizing the wintertime setting.\n\nThe architecture of the building seen in the image has a modern design typical of many ski lodges, featuring dark wood siding and large windows. The environment looks cold and wintry, with visible snow on the roofs and grounds, complementing the gathering of skiers well equipped for winter activities.","title":"On the ski slopes of Vail after trying out Aspen's trails","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554262","554235","554242","554276","554234","554275","554267","554236","554245","554263","554240","554257","554279","554238","554292","554269"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["ski","lodge","winter","resort","bag","snow","accommodation","apparel","waiting","suitcase"]}
