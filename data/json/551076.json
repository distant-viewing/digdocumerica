{"path":"551076.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a sunlit rural scene with a focus on two, possibly three, wooden structures that possibly serve as dwellings or storage sheds nestled amidst dense, lush greenery. The buildings have a rustic charm, featuring weathered wooden walls and metal rooftopsâ€”one colored a faded green and the others in darker tones. No visible windows are seen on the side of the buildings facing the camera, indicating a simple architectural style. \n\nIn the foreground, there's a muddy terrain strewn with various debris including small branches, leaves, and bits of unidentifiable refuse, suggesting recent outdoor activity or the aftermath of a weather event. The surrounding flora is vibrant, suggesting the photo was taken in a season of growth, possibly late spring or summer.\n\nTrees with thick foliage cast partial shadows over the area, contributing to the dappled sunlight effect on the buildings and ground. The image evokes a sense of quiet isolation, potentially hinting at a setting away from urban centers. The overall mood is peaceful yet somewhat untidy, indicating human presence and use of the area without overt signs of current activity.","title":"Water draining from old mining areas gives the kanawha its ruddy color.
