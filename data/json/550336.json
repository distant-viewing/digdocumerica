{"path":"550336.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene where a large industrial plant is visible across a body of water. The factory complex consists of several large structures, including high towers or smokestacks and multiple buildings with flat and rectangular profiles. Plumes of thick, white smoke pour vigorously from several chimneys, diffusing into the overcast sky above, suggesting heavy industrial activity.\n\nThe overall atmosphere appears gloomy or overcast, with dense clouds filling the sky, contributing to a somewhat somber or heavy industrial feel. The body of water in the foreground reflects some of the structures faintly, indicating it might be a calm river or lake.\n\nThe colors in the image are somewhat muted, with a dominance of grays and blues, reinforcing the industrial and somewhat bleak environmental theme. The edges of the photograph are marked with a black frame, typical for slide photos, adding a vintage quality to the image.","title":"Paper mill of Georgia Pacific Paper Company on the St. Croix River in Woodland","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["548068","546808","550344","550328","550869","546908","550956","545987","552179","550332","550868","546884","550676","557225","545447","552210"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["dominance","slide","profile","plume","chimney","smokestack","gray","complex","factory","tower"]}
