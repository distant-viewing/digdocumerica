{"path":"547209.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene on a park pathway, illustrating a group of three young males riding bicycles. The trio, in the forefront of the image, are positioned close together, pedaling towards the camera. Each rider sports casual attire suited for outdoor activity: t-shirts, jeans or shorts, and sneakers. The leader of the group, located in the center, is especially prominent due to his direct gaze towards the camera, adding an engaging element to the scene.\n\nThe background of the photograph features a lush, green park setting under a canopy of trees in full leaf, depicting a sunny day with dappled sunlight filtering through. The pathway is bustling with activity; visible in the background are other park-goers, including pedestrians and additional cyclists moving away from the camera, which offers a sense of bustling park life.\n\nThis natural and recreational setting is further enhanced by a body of water visible in the extreme background, alongside more verdant vegetation, contributing to a peaceful and leisurely atmosphere typical of park environments. Upper sections of the image show branches overhanging slightly, framing the scene naturally and drawing attention to the activities on the path.","title":"Bicycling along the Potomac River","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["550069","551545","552340","543719","543715","557410","555499","548574","547197","558131","546465","547241","558193","551736","551451","551713"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["park","pathway","camera","goer","cyclist","sneaker","rider","show","leaf","group"]}
