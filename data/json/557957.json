{"path":"557957.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph displays a serene sunset scene. The sun, large and prominently centered, casts a warm yellow and orange glow. Its light diffuses into the surrounding sky, which transitions into deeper reds and purples towards the edges of the image. Below the sun, the silhouette of a forested landscape stretches across the horizon, appearing as a dark, uninterrupted line that separates the sky from the land. The rest of the image is haze-filled, enhancing the atmospheric effect of a tranquil evening. The photograph evokes a sense of calm and simplicity through its minimalistic composition and soothing color palette.","title":"Spectacular views of sunsets are possible at Top of the World at Hampton Hills.
