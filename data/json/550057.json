{"path":"550057.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts the façade of the Mercantile Wharf Buildings, an aging and weathered multi-story structure. The building's exterior is covered with large, square stone blocks that show signs of wear and discoloration, possibly from exposure to the elements over many years. Some of the window panes are broken, boarded up, or covered with X-shaped tape, suggesting abandonment or lack of maintenance.\n\nThe structure features multiple rows of windows, some of which maintain their original frames and shutters, though many are visibly damaged. The words \"MERCANTILE WHARF BUILDINGS\" are prominently displayed across the center of the façade in bold, faded lettering, adding a historical or commercial character to the building.\n\nThe roof appears sloped with several visible layers, and includes elements like chimneys and vent pipes, which are common in older buildings. There is also visible rust and other signs of deterioration at various points, particularly around the metal and roof areas.\n\nOverall, this image captures the architectural style and the textured surface of an old wharf building, conveying a sense of historical significance and urban decay.","title":"Mercantile Wharf building is being Renovated.","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550049","546871","547894","550023","557139","545355","549864","551586","553479","557643","553478","557634","555902","544656","552135","543320"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["façade","tape","discoloration","deterioration","vent","shutter","pane","building","aging","roof"]}
