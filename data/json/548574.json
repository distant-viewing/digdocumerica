{"path":"548574.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and cheerful scene of a community bicycle ride on a sunny day. A group of people, including adults and children, are seen riding bicycles down a smooth, curved road. They appear to be in a convoy, enjoying the activity together.\n\nThe setting is suburban, with well-maintained two-story residential buildings featuring white exteriors and green gabled roofs aligned on either side of the road. In the background, there is a tropical ambiance evident from the presence of palm trees dotting the landscape. The climate seems warm, suggested not only by the palm trees but also by the participants' attire, consisting of shorts and light shirts, suitable for a sunny day.\n\nIn addition to the natural scenery, the neighborhood includes parked cars along the roadside, indicating a residential area. The sky is mostly clear with a few clouds, contributing to the brightness of the day. This tranquil and relaxed atmosphere adds to the joyous mood of the community event, promoting physical activity and social interaction among neighbors. The composition of the photograph, with its focus on the convivial group in a serene suburban setting, encapsulates a moment of communal leisure and enjoyment.","title":"Bicycle club of the Century Village retirement community meets each morning","placename":"West Palm Beach (Fla.)","location":"West Palm Beach, Florida","nn1":["548572","558131","548573","555500","551545","543715","555499","547209","550689","547241","548570","552340","543719","546545","557432","557290"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Community Gatherings"],"terms":["palm","bicycle","addition","community","ride","group","participant","roadside","day","brightness"]}
