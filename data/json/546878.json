{"path":"546878.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an environmental issue, showcasing a large number of discarded tires littering a body of water, possibly a river or a coastal area. The scene captures numerous old, muddy tires submerged in shallow water and scattered across the surface. The water appears murky and polluted, suggesting neglect and environmental contamination.\n\nIn the background, there is a clearer view of the water beyond the immediate pollution, featuring several docked boats and yachts, suggesting that this area may be near a marina or a boatyard. Some masts and boat structures are visible, standing against a predominantly clear sky with minor cloud cover, indicating a tranquil but contrasting backdrop to the foreground's pollution.\n\nA partially visible neon sign reading \"LADY BUG\" can be seen in the top left of the image increasing the sense of disorder and human presence in this environment. The area is not densely populated or busy in the visual, providing a serene but somber mood to the landscape's contaminated state. This setting underscores the negative impact of human waste on natural water bodies and adjacent commercial or recreational areas.","title":"Trash and old tires litter the shore at the Middle Branch of Baltimore Harbor.","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["547517","546838","547846","557973","551440","547590","546913","546820","552189","543559","551441","547907","552127","550352","548308","550812"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["tire","pollution","disorder","visual","yacht","increase","contamination","water","neon","boat"]}
