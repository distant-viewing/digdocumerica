{"path":"544021.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant and active scene on a large body of clear blue water. There are multiple sailboats spread across the scene, each at different positions and angles. Closest to the viewer, there is a small motorboat with four individuals engaging in an activity; it appears they are either setting up or managing their boating equipment. \n\nThe water is fairly calm with subtle ripples, and the clarity of the water allows visibility to rocks beneath the surface near the foreground. In the background, rolling hills with sparse vegetation define the horizon under a clear blue sky with a few light clouds. The afternoon lighting suggests this activity is taking place on a sunny day, emphasizing the serene outdoor environment. This setting appears ideal for sailing and leisurely water activities, promoting a sense of relaxation and enjoyment amidst natural surroundings.","title":"Labor day on lake pleasant","placename":"Phoenix (Ariz.)","location":"Phoenix, Arizona","nn1":["543994","547781","548555","552355","548513","552345","552050","544667","543059","555718","548204","543936","548508","549423","549392","552316"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["ligh","angles","motorboat","promote","boating","sailing","water","sailboat","clarity","clouds"]}
