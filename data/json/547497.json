{"path":"547497.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene featuring a series of large pipes extending along a narrow pier or platform over a body of water. The perspective is looking along the length of the pier from one end, showing the pipes running parallel to the pier towards the distant horizon.\n\nThe pipes are of various sizes, mostly metallic, and appear worn and weathered with some corrosion visible. They are supported by brackets that fix them to the surface of the pier, which is constructed from wood planks with a metal handrail on one side. The wood looks aged and weathered, consistent with an outdoor industrial setting.\n\nThe body of water is calm with sunlight reflecting off the surface, creating a sparkling effect. The view extends to a horizon where the water meets the sky. Along the distant part of the pier, there are some structures and possibly machinery, implying a form of industrial activity or construction.\n\nThe sky is clear with no visible clouds, suggesting a sunny day, which contributes to the overall brightness and high contrast of the scene. This setting communicates a functional, utilitarian atmosphere typically found in industrial areas used for logistics or utility operations.","title":"Pipelines from dock of Northeast Petroleum tanker terminal on Mt.
