{"path":"545593.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a rugged, natural landscape featuring a dry, rocky terrain. In the foreground, there is a shallow, muddy pool of water, reflecting light and surrounded by uneven, rocky ground scattered with small rocks, bits of dry vegetation, and some debris. The water appears stagnant, with pieces of organic material floating on the surface.\n\nBeyond this pool, the terrain ascends slightly. Sparse vegetation, primarily short shrubs and a few scattered trees, are visible on the sides. The middle ground shows a path or dried riverbed that leads towards a distinctive geological formation in the background. This formation is a flat-topped hill or mesa, prominently rising against the skyline. The hill is rugged and barren, with steep, rocky sides and a flat summit, typical of arid or semi-arid environments.\n\nThe sky above is clear and bright, hinting at a sunny, perhaps hot day. This scene likely depicts a desert or semi-desert region, emphasizing a sense of arid isolation and natural erosion. The overall mood conveyed by the image is one of stark, natural beauty and the harsh realities of a dry landscape.","title":"Big Water Spring is the only water source for a large area west of the Maze. It has been polluted by the cattle allowed to graze on this park land.
