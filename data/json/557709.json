{"path":"557709.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The photograph captures a vibrant scene that seems to be part of a parade or community event, set against a backdrop of lush greenery, likely in a park or street setting. At the forefront is a striking burnt orange-colored Chevrolet Corvette Stingray convertible. The car has a prominent sign on the door, saying \"Van White County Elementary 1973,\" possibly indicating it is part of a school celebration or local parade. Sitting atop the rear of the convertible is a young girl, wearing a patriotic outfit of red shorts and a flag-print top, complemented by a red headband; she looks pensively at something out of frame. Inside the car, visible through the open convertible top, is another young girl in a similar patriotic outfit, perhaps waiting or participating in the event.\n\nThe background features a group of people, likely spectators or participants of the event, standing and watching. Among the group, there is a mixture of adults and children, dressed casually suitable for a warm day. The group includes a woman in casual attire, a man in a light shirt and dark shorts, and other individuals who appear relaxed and engaged in the event. To the right, another car, dark in color, adds to the sense that this is a gathering or parade involving multiple participants.\n\nThe general atmosphere is one of leisure and celebration, suggested by the casual clothes, the decorated car, and the informal grouping of people in an outdoor setting. The image is imbued with a sense of time and locality, likely a small-town American event from the 1970s, reflecting community spirit and participation.","title":"Miss White County Elementary 1975 rides into Helen, Georgia in a sportscar in a Fourth of July parade down Main Street. Helen was a typical small mountain community of less than 300 until early in 1969 when town officials, businessmen and residents endorsed the Renovation of the business district with a Bavarian alpine theme. The project was a success and resulted in new businesses and a surge of tourism. The village is near Roberstown.","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["557715","546991","556538","543856","550152","554377","556282","552659","543947","557766","546817","554389","547495","547758","549570","557705"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["parade","event","celebration","participant","car","girl","group","outfit","short","locality"]}
