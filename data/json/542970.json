{"path":"542970.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a cluster of flowering plants. Numerous tall-stemmed flowers, primarily in shades of pink, dominate the foreground. Each flower features a dense cluster of tiny blossoms that form a round, slightly flattened head on top of a slender, smooth stem.\n\nThe color of these flowers varies from blush pink to deeper pink hues, and they appear to be healthy and vibrant. The plants' stems are green, progressing to some pale sections closer to the flower buds, which implies a gentle gradient of color. Some stems are topped with flowers in full bloom, while others have buds that are still closed.\n\nThe background is a clear blue sky, suggesting the photograph was taken on a clear day. There is a slight blur effect on some of the flowers due to the shallow depth of field, which brings the flowers in the central and upper part of the frame into sharper focus, enhancing the textures of the petals and the delicate structure of the flower heads.\n\nOverall, the composition and focus of the photograph create a dynamic and detailed exploration of floral beauty, emphasizing the colors and intricate structures of the flowers against a serene blue backdrop.","title":"Wild clover","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554595","554843","553366","557500","554111","543597","554574","557618","554587","553588","554576","545695","543200","547613","557167","544934"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","stem","bud","pink","head","cluster","flatten","blossom","petal","progress"]}
