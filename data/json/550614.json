{"path":"550614.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph shows an aerial view of a curvy road passing through a rugged, natural landscape. The road runs vertically through the image, with gentle curves and surrounded by dense vegetation. The predominant colors of the landscape are green and brown, indicating a mix of verdant areas, possibly indicating marshes or wetlands, and drier, more barren patches. On the left side of the image, close to the road, there is a small, dark blue body of water, likely a pond or small lake. The landscape has a wild, undeveloped quality, typical of remote areas. The photo appears to be taken from a considerable height, adding a sense of scale and isolation to the scene. No buildings, vehicles, or people are visible, emphasizing the natural and untouched nature of the environment.","title":"Intersection of pipeline with Richardson Highway.
