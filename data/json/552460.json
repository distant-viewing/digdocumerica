{"path":"552460.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph captures a quaint, small-town setting featuring a building marked as \"TOWN HALL.\" It's a day with clear skies, bright sunlight illuminates the scene.\n\n**Building**: The town hall, the central focus of the image, consists of a white facade with contrasting dark trim around the windows and doors. The architecture features a front gabled section which serves as the main entrance, presenting a classical small-town American look. There are two white doors visible—one slightly open—in addition to a few windows with one prominently displaying an air conditioning unit. The roofing appears to be shingled.\n\n**Foreground and Immediate Surroundings**: In the foreground, a prominent feature is an old metal water pump painted in red, situated beside a small, open utility box containing plumbing connections. Adjacent to it is a manhole cover, partially covered by a wooden enclosure which seems to be a protective makeshift arrangement. Also notable is a black sign on the lawn with white letters stating “PLEASE DO NOT WASH CAR ON GRASS,” adding a touch of local policy or regulation.\n\n**Background**: Behind the building, there are lush trees that seem to provide a backdrop and shade to the setting. It's likely summer given the vivid green foliage. The landscape is well-maintained with green grass surrounding the town hall.\n\n**Light and Atmosphere**: The image has a warm tone, likely due to the saturation of colors typical in film photography. This effect grants the photograph a nostalgic or timeless feel, reminiscent of mid-20th century rural America.\n\nNo people are visible in the image, emphasizing the stillness and quiet possibly typical of this small town environment. The scene encapsulates a slice of rural community life, punctuated by simple civic pride and local governance.","title":"La Rose Town Hall","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["552469","557156","552509","558030","558032","548245","558099","545870","544882","558109","546440","558037","549626","550319","549221","543580"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["town","hall","conditioning","door","pride","regulation","enclosure","addition","roofing","pump"]}
