{"path":"543873.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a powerful and dramatic silhouette of a bird, presumably a raptor, at the moment of takeoff. The setting is an outdoor scene during either dawn or dusk, evidenced by the soft, muted tones of the sky which transitions from a deep orange near the horizon to a darker blue higher up. The sun, which is not directly visible, backlight the scene creating a halo effect that illuminates the edges of the bird and highlights the contours and feathery details of its extended wings and open beak. The bird is positioned on the left side of the frame, lending a dynamic quality to the composition as it seems to be moving out of the frame. The background features gentle gradients of color and subtle cloud streaks, enhancing the ethereal and transient nature of the moment. Below the bird, indistinct outlines of foliage or grass can be seen, contributing to the overall wilderness vibe of the scene. The image conveys a sense of freedom and the majestic essence of wildlife.","title":"Colorado--near Telluride","placename":"Telluride (Colo.)","location":"Telluride, Colorado","nn1":["547593","557204","547322","543922","544609","553776","544605","551379","553875","544612","550382","544601","547318","548832","549095","543063"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","halo","extended","beak","evidenc","freedom","wing","streak","transition","orange"]}
