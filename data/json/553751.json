{"path":"553751.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is a photograph depicting a multi-level parking structure in the foreground with an array of parked cars. Each level of the structure has large red and white signages that read \"ALOHA MOTORS\" followed by phrases such as \"ROLET CARS AND TRUCKS\" and \"OK USED CARS\" indicating that the facility is likely associated with a car dealership. The topmost deck of the parking structure is open to the sky, and a variety of cars, presumably new or used for sale, are neatly lined up.\n\nThe background features a tall, multi-storied residential building occupying the entire backdrop. The building has many identical balconies and windows, suggesting a typical high-rise apartment structure.\n\nOverall, the image creates a strong urban feel, juxtaposing commercial functionality in the form of a car dealership with residential living represented by the high-rise apartments. The setting appears to be a densely populated city area, possibly emphasizing the interplay between living spaces and commercial enterprises in urban environments.","title":"Every foot of space must count on the island: 4-decker car dealer's showroom and high-rise apartments","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553750","555748","557292","546715","549875","547686","546699","556790","548432","546900","546708","546685","550100","549310","542635","556722"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Vehicle Traffic"],"terms":["dealership","car","apartment","parking","rise","enterprise","phrase","sale","functionality","balcony"]}
