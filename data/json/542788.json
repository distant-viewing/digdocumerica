{"path":"542788.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene where a man is engaging in forestry work, specifically tree felling. The man, wearing a hard hat and carrying a chainsaw, is looking up at a large pine tree, which shows signs of being cut at its base. He is dressed in work attire, including a long-sleeve shirt, pants, and a tool belt or harness.\n\nThe scene is set in a densely wooded area with tall pine trees, highlighting a forest environment. The background features additional trees and underbrush, hinting at a verdant, secluded setting most likely far from urban areas. There is visible debris and wood chips around the base of the tree being cut, indicating the recent activity of the chainsaw.\n\nLight filters through the canopy, casting patches of illumination and shadow across the scene, enhancing the natural, rugged atmosphere of the forested area. This setting portrays an aspect of forestry management or natural resource work, where trees are being selectively cut, possibly for timber or as part of a forest thinning process to maintain forest health.","title":"Logger gibson alee","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["542787","542769","553602","553604","542786","553608","542773","542770","542771","542785","542772","554414","554415","555472","553601","553614"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["chainsaw","forestry","pine","forest","base","work","tree","harness","chip","health"]}
