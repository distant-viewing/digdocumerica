{"path":"546759.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid scene of numerous birds, possibly starlings, in a chaotic yet fascinating flight above an agricultural setting. The image is composed in such a way that the foreground is predominantly occupied by a field covered densely with what appears to be crop stubbles, speckled with birds. Central to the image, a network of utility poles and multiple layers of wires stretch across, serving as perches for clusters of birds. \n\nThe middle ground shows more of these birds in various stages of landing or taking off, creating a dynamic interplay of motion with some birds captured as silhouettes against a lighter sky, and others more defined. Amidst this, scattered debris or perhaps more birds fill the air, adding a sense of movement and slight chaos to the scene. \n\nThe background features a somewhat blurred view of industrial or farm buildings and some sparse vegetation, under a sky that appears to be overcast, lending a cool tone overall to the image. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of bustling wildlife activity, highlighted by the stark contrast of industrial elements, under what seems to be the dim light of either early morning or late afternoon.","title":"Filters and birds at the back river sewage treatment plant this is the primary treatment facility for the Baltimore area","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["549757","557208","557123","557202","549738","544605","544834","557125","549742","549772","552238","553875","557124","544609","549744","544597"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","chaos","speckle","perch","flight","crop","define","wildlife","stage","wire"]}
