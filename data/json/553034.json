{"path":"553034.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"The photograph features two individuals in a clinical setting. On the left, an elderly man is partially seated and partially standing beside what appears to be an examination table. He is shirtless, revealing his bare chest and arms, both of which show signs of aging and multiple spots. The man's expression is solemn, and he looks slightly towards his right. He is wearing black trousers and has a predominantly slim physique.\n\nOn the right, a bald-headed male doctor, dressed in a white lab coat adorned with a stethoscope around his neck and a pen in his coat pocket, is examining the elderly man. He is using the stethoscope, which he holds with both hands, to listen to the elderly man's chest. The doctor, adorned with a tie, appears focused on his task, conveying a professional demeanor.\n\nThe background is simple and nondescript, featuring a pale wall and part of the examination table, enhancing the focus on the interaction between the patient and the doctor. The setting suggests a straightforward medical examination, emphasizing the themes of healthcare and patient care.","title":"Damaged lung patient. (From the Documerica-1 exhibition.
