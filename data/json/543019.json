{"path":"543019.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic coastal scene. It shows the edge of a sea or ocean with frothy white waves washing ashore in rhythmic patterns. The waves create distinct white lines as they recede, which contrasts sharply with the darker color of the wet sand and rocks. Several large, jagged rocks emerge from the water, suggesting a rugged coastline. One of these rocks near the middle of the image appears to have someone sitting on it, observing the sea, possibly reflecting or enjoying the natural setting. The overall composition emphasizes the contrast between the motion of the water and the stillness of the rocks, highlighted by the blue and white color palette dominated by the water and froth. The lighting conditions suggest either early morning or late afternoon, as indicated by the softness and direction of light.","title":"Coastal scene","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543253","543309","543092","545122","547609","547486","543308","543295","543250","543306","543060","543251","543139","543289","543243","547483"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["rock","wave","froth","sea","softness","wash","recede","emerge","stillness","coastline"]}
