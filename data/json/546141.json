{"path":"546141.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial facility with several distinct features. Prominent in the image are large smokestacks, one of which is emitting a thick plume of dark smoke that billows into the sky. The facility includes multiple structures with a complex arrangement of pipes and metal frameworks, typical of heavy industrial plants.\n\nIn the foreground, the natural environment contrasts with the industrial setting. There is lush greenery, including two prominent trees with dense foliage. Between these trees and the industrial structures, there appears to be a grassy area interspersed with patches of bare earth and patches that seem wet or muddy, possibly indicating recent rain or a water body. \n\nThe background is fairly open, with a hint of a forested area behind the facility under a clear sky. There are no visible human figures in the image, suggesting that the focal point is the environmental impact and industrial activity rather than human interaction. The overall composition underscores a juxtaposition between nature and industrial development.","title":"Smoke from the Atlas Chemical Co. covers neighboring communities with black soot.","placename":"Marshall (Tex.)","location":"Marshall, Texas","nn1":["548195","545113","550998","550329","550716","557302","551056","546005","543011","550981","557225","550694","550672","551567","543813","543733"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["facility","rain","billow","patch","plume","pipe","framework","smokestack","arrangement","underscore"]}
