{"path":"544870.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph presents a serene twilight or nighttime scene dominated by natural elements. In the backdrop, a slim crescent moon hangs low in the sky, emitting a soft white glow against the darkening blue sky. The moon is positioned at the upper center of the image, creating a focal point.\n\nThe foreground and middle ground are occupied by the dark silhouettes of trees and rugged terrain. The outline of a mountain or large hill is visible, with its slope leading into a densely forested area. The trees, which appear to be pine or fir, due to their pointed tops and dense branches, are starkly outlined against the sky, emphasizing their shapes and adding depth to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is simple yet evocative, capturing the quiet beauty of a moonlit landscape with a focus on the interplay of light and the natural contours of the wilderness. The image conveys a sense of tranquility and the vastness of nature under the night sky.","title":"Moon over forest","placename":"West Dolores River (Colo.)","location":"West Dolores River, Colorado","nn1":["554963","557603","545347","554644","543604","554403","557579","552142","543577","547705","557000","550646","543126","543590","543621","555119"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["moon","outline","fir","nighttime","darken","pine","night","twilight","contour","wilderness"]}
