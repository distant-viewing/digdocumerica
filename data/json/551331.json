{"path":"551331.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a striking contrast between the natural elements of a plant and rock formations. The central focus is a long, slender vine with delicate leaves, showcasing hues ranging from green to deep red. This vine traces a graceful, slightly curving path upward across the frame.\n\nThe background prominently features a large rock, characterized by its rich, red color and rough texture. A significant portion of the rock is covered with a contrasting pale gray or light lichen or moss, adding an interesting textural detail to the image. This lichen is speckled and clumpy, covering the lower part of the rock and spreading irregularly.\n\nThe lighting in the photo suggests a natural, soft light possibly filtered through a canopy of trees, highlighting the redness of the leaves and the rugged texture of the rocks. The composition is balanced, with the soft, organic lines of the vine providing a visual contrast to the solid, harsh lines of the rock surfaces.\n\nThe overall impression is one of natural harmony and the resilience of plant life in a seemingly inhospitable environment. This interplay of textures, colors, and life forms speaks to the enduring presence of nature amidst stark landscapes.","title":"Detail of crumbling interior of an abandoned tourist cabin by the side of Route 54 at New Linn Creek.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["545724","544887","554596","547635","545797","544440","555188","553358","550476","543195","542610","557580","550479","545589","555884","544341"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["vine","rock","lichen","texture","leave","harmony","plant","moss","resilience","line"]}
