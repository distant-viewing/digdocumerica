{"path":"553036.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man standing next to a car on a residential street. The man, who has short grey hair and is wearing glasses and a dark collared shirt, appears slightly out of focus due to the camera's depth of field. He is resting one hand on the open door of a large, light-colored car, possibly a sedan, which has a noticeable dusty handprint on its trunk.\n\nIn the background, houses can be seen along the street which has a tranquil, suburban feel. Trees line the area, contributing to a serene atmosphere. However, the calm is contrasted by what appears to be thick smoke in the sky behind the trees, suggesting there might be a distant fire, adding an urgent element to the otherwise peaceful residential setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its suburban setting and the juxtaposition of tranquility and potential distant disaster, creates a narrative that invites questions about what is happening beyond what is immediately visible. The mood is somewhat grim, reinforced by the overcast sky and the man's serious expression.","title":"Fairfield resident shows black soot wiped from his car. U.S. Steel plant is close by.
