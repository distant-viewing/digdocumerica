{"path":"550838.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph captures a summertime scene at a lake, with several people engaged in various leisure activities on a floating dock. The setting is picturesque with clear, blue water and a lush, green treeline in the background which suggests a tranquil, secluded environment, possibly a rural area.\n\nOn the dock, there are approximately ten individuals, both male and female, of various ages. These people are mostly clad in swimwear, suggesting they are engaging in or have been participating in swimming. Some of the individuals are standing and talking, while others are sitting and watching the surroundings. Notably, one person is in the process of diving into the water, illustrating a moment of action and enjoyment.\n\nThe dock is partly submerged, indicating it may be slightly overloaded or just very close to the water surface by design. Around the floating dock, the water has patches of algae, hinting at the natural ecosystem of the lake. The lighting and shadows suggest that this photo was taken on a sunny day, further emphasizing the outdoor summer activity theme.\n\nOverall, the photograph offers a glimpse into leisurely summer days spent by the water in a communal, relaxed setting, enjoying the natural environment and company of others.","title":"Youngsters swim from makeshift raft through patches of algae on the fox river","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["551543","543944","558233","544442","543943","549939","554516","554517","554611","554618","557772","550228","553445","548834","553446","556295"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["dock","summer","float","summertime","diving","swimwear","lake","treeline","water","algae"]}
