{"path":"549095.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a highly stylized and dramatic scene. It features a large, vivid silhouette of a bird, possibly a crane or another type of long-necked bird, perched atop a branch. The bird and the twisted, bare branches of the tree are set against the backdrop of a circular, glowing orb that resembles an immense, full moon. This orb radiates a bright yellow-orange hue that contrasts sharply with the deep red background of the photograph. The stark silhouette of the bird, coupled with its clear outline and the tree branches against the bold, monochromatic backdrop, creates a striking and almost surreal visual effect. The composition effectively utilizes the silhouette technique to emphasize the shapes and the dramatic interplay of light and dark.","title":"American egret roosting on tree in Colorado river indian reservation, south of parker","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["551378","549101","553776","548872","544612","544605","555013","557628","554069","554601","551379","547318","548832","544601","543873","544547"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["bird","orb","branch","moon","radiate","silhouette","technique","perch","neck","utilize"]}
