{"path":"551945.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The image portrays a tranquil and romantic scene set against the backdrop of a vast water body, likely a lake or ocean, during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset given the soft pink and purple hues in the sky. Two people, a man and a woman, are at the center of the scene, engaging in a tender embrace, suggesting a moment of affection or closeness.\n\nThe landscape is framed by a dark silhouette of a tree trunk on the left and thin, overhanging branches at the top, which adds a natural frame and depth to the composition. The gentle slope of the grassy area where the couple stands leads down to a paved curb that separates the green area from a sandy part, further leading to the water. There is no immediate vegetation or buildings near the couple or in the background, giving the space an open and serene feel.\n\nThe lighting in the image, combined with the coloration of the sky and the scene's overall composition, evokes a sense of calm and beauty, focusing the viewer's attention on the intimate moment shared between the two individuals.","title":"Affectionate couple in Lincoln Park on Lake Michigan","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["548833","554901","543203","543950","549471","552977","551967","548465","554477","543601","548467","549755","547624","553396","552226","549756"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Natural Landscapes"],"terms":["couple","affection","closeness","curb","coloration","sunrise","calm","slope","sunset","trunk"]}
