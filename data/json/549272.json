{"path":"549272.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"The photograph captures a moment of action in an outdoor setting featuring an adolescent boy and a damaged vehicle. The scene shows the boy in mid-motion, positioned as if he is throwing or hitting an object, which is blurred in mid-air, suggesting it is moving quickly. The boy is dressed in a casual, dark outfit consisting of a jacket and pants, and he wears light-colored shoes.\n\nThe car, which is the central object in the frame, appears to be an older model coupe with significant damage. Its paint is faded and it has apparent rust, along with dents and missing pieces, including the rear window which is completely gone. The car is positioned in a desolate-looking area with cracked ground, sparse vegetation, and some debris around.\n\nBehind the boy and the car is a chain-link fence, indicating a boundary. Beyond the fence, there is a backdrop that includes tall grass or reeds and a clear sky. In the distance, you can also see a heavy machinery vehicle, suggesting that this area might be near an industrial or construction site.\n\nThe setting gives off a feel of abandonment or neglect, highlighted by the state of the car and the undeveloped land. The action depicted, involving what seems like an old car possibly used for play or as an object of youthful curiosity, adds a dynamic element to the otherwise still and desolate environment.","title":"Logan Airport area.
