{"path":"552603.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph displays a scenic view dominated by a towering mountain range in the background. The mountains are steep and rocky, showcasing dramatic vertical erosion patterns which create deep crevices and ridges that are highlighted by the sunlight, giving them a variegated appearance of light and dark brown hues.\n\nIn the foreground, a suburban area stretches along the bottom of the photograph. The neighborhood consists of single-story houses, most with flat or slightly sloping roofs. Many houses feature light-colored exteriors, with varying shades of beige, white, and light brown; some houses have darker roofs than their walls, further adding to the visual contrast. The residential area is interspersed with patches of greeneryâ€”trees and well-maintained lawns add a touch of lushness to the otherwise dry terrain.\n\nThe environment suggests a quiet, residential setting, likely in a Western or Mountain state in the U.S., where such landscapes are common. The overall lighting suggests it could be either dawn or dusk, with soft lighting that enhances the tranquility of the scene. The absence of visible people or moving vehicles reinforces a serene, almost static atmosphere. The juxtaposition of a natural, rugged mountain backdrop and a man-made residential area offers a captivating contrast between the wildness of nature and human habitation.","title":"Rifle, the major community of the piceance basin, is a small town with a one-street business district.
