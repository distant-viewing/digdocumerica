{"path":"550852.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"The photograph depicts a tranquil river scene during twilight, casting a serene and somewhat somber atmosphere. The main focus is the calm, reflective water in the foreground, which mirrors the dark silhouettes of trees lining the riverbank. The water flows lightly and merges into a man-made waterfall or weir in the lower part of the image, where foamy water hints at a slight rapid.\n\nFurther in the background, there's more greenery and additional water features that divide the river, possibly smaller islands or vegetated plots within the river. A quaint, white house with a prominent roof is visible in the distance, positioned just at the river's edge, enhancing the picturesque quality of the environment.\n\nThere is minimal lighting, mostly natural, as the image captures the dimming light of dusk which subtly illuminates the scene, allowing for reflections on the water and the outlines of the natural and man-made elements to be gently visible. The overall composition effectively conveys a quiet evening by the waterside, emphasizing nature and tranquility.","title":"Fishing above dam on the fox river at montello.
