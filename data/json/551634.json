{"path":"551634.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"The photograph captures a lively outdoor café scene set in an urban environment. Several people, including both adults and children, are seated at red and black tables, dining and engaging in conversation. Most of the patrons appear to be in groups, though some are alone. They are surrounded by vibrant red flower arrangements that add a touch of color and freshness to the setting.\n\nThe café tables have black tops and red legs, and some of the tables are protected from the sun by large black umbrellas with a unique shell design. The chairs are simple and modern in design, matching the tables with red and black colors.\n\nIn the background, the architecture is characterized by large modernist buildings with tall glass and steel facades. The building directly behind the café has large, reflective windows and a series of vertical columns that break up the glass facade, reflecting the bustling city ambiance.\n\nThe atmosphere seems relaxed and convivial, with patrons enjoying their meals outdoors on what appears to be a pleasant day. The scene conveys a sense of casual urban life and the enjoyment of public spaces amidst a modern architectural setting.","title":"Lincoln center plaza is bounded by two theaters, an opera house and a concert hall.
