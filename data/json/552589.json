{"path":"552589.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph depicts a scene in which a group of children and a few adults are gathered outdoors, likely in a small town or rural setting. The focus of their attention seems to be a flagpole with an American flag, which is prominently displayed and fluttering in the breeze against a vivid blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds.\n\nThe background features several rustic buildings that appear to be made of stone and other materials, indicating an older architectural style typical of certain rural American areas. One of the buildings has a visible door where two adults can be seen watching over the children.\n\nThe children are varied in attire, suggesting the photo captures a casual, everyday moment rather than a formal gathering. They appear engaged and attentive, looking up towards the flag or the adults by the door.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a pleasant, communal outdoor gathering under a clear sky, emphasizing a sense of small community and patriotic display.","title":"Rock School, built in 1897, still serves the children of the Piceance Creek area. The one-room schoolhouse takes them from the first grade through the eighth. The building also functions as a community center.","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["549571","542581","554450","546817","557715","552654","544436","549626","557710","554072","545047","544334","544802","544806","557951","547751"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["adult","child","flag","gathering","door","flagpole","breeze","display","town","stone"]}
