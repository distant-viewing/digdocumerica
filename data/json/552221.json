{"path":"552221.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil nature scene focused on a small gathering of ducks on a body of water. In the foreground, two ducks are swimming close to the shore. They appear calm and are facing each other slightly while floating on the shimmering water. Further out, there is a scattered group of ducks, some of them partially submerged as if they might be foraging. The water has a dark blue hue and is gently rippling, suggesting a quiet, windless day.\n\nThe shoreline visible in the photo is muddy with some small branches and debris scattered around, typical of a natural lakeside or pond environment. In the lower right corner, you can see a portion of the bank that leads into the water, perhaps serving as a point of entry or egress for the birds.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, coupled with the calm water and the scattered placement of the ducks, evokes a peaceful, serene natural setting, typical of a wildlife refuge or a secluded lake area. The lighting suggests that this could be either early morning or late afternoon, as the sun's reflections are muted and gentle.","title":"Adult and baby mallard ducks on Juanita Bay, Lake Washington at Kirkland","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["552993","543663","555551","551501","548542","558092","553408","548840","551377","557490","552281","543918","552235","557493","544838","553346"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["duck","entry","water","lakeside","placement","pond","bird","wildlife","corner","bank"]}
