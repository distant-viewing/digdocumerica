{"path":"545359.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"This image showcases a traditional building painted in a pale blue color, possibly located in a region with adobe or Southwestern architectural influences. It features a stark contrast with the deep blue sky overhead.\n\nThe building's structure includes a flat roof with a notched parapet that runs along the roofline, adding a decorative element typical of Southwestern or Middle Eastern architectural styles. The walls appear sun-bleached and weather-worn, hinting at a dry, sunny climate. \n\nThere are two visible windows framed with dark material, possibly wood, and fitted with what looks like bars or grates for security. Electrical lines are connected to the side of the building, emphasizing a mix of traditional architecture with modern necessities.\n\nThe surrounding area includes a fence visible to the left of the image and electrical poles with multiple overhead wires, suggesting that the building is likely in a residential or semi-urban area. The ground visible is paved, indicating that it isn't a rural setting.\n\nOverall, the composition is simple and gives off an isolated, serene vibe, focusing attention on the textural qualities and characteristic architectural features of the building. Shadows and bright sunlight cast against the façade create a dynamic interplay emphasizing the building's angular and textured surfaces.","title":"Adobe structure near the railroad yard in the second ward, a classic \"barrio.\"","placename":"El Paso (Tex.)","location":"El Paso, Texas","nn1":["552966","545334","555286","545324","555340","556629","549221","544417","544911","556628","545355","555294","557156","552968","555321","545356"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["building","security","roofline","influence","overhead","bar","façade","vibe","wire","climate"]}
