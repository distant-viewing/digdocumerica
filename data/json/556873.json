{"path":"556873.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"In this photograph, the viewer's perspective is from atop a crane or similar heavy machinery, looking down onto a railway line. The main focus is on the railroad tracks which stretch into the distance, converging towards a vanishing point in the far center of the image, bordered by green landscape. \n\nOn the left set of tracks, a series of cargo or maintenance platforms loaded with various railroad supplies, such as rails and wood beams, are visible. These platforms each have small wheeled undercarriages that allow them to move along the tracks. A few individuals are seen in the distance; one of them is walking away from the camera, down the tracks, while another appears to be sitting or working on the platform loaded with equipment. These workers are wearing casual attire.\n\nTo the right, there's a clear track with no obstructions. Overhead, the metal structure of the crane from which the photo is taken partially frames the top and left side of the image. The crane's parts include a long, rusted beam and what seems to be a control or mechanism box with additional levers and wiring, hinting at the manual operation of this machinery.\n\nThe surroundings are rural, with the hint of fields and sparse development in the distance under an overcast sky, giving a serene yet somewhat industrial and utilitarian feel to the scene. The photograph captures both industrial activity and a tranquil natural backdrop, lending a sense of isolation and dedicated work environment.","title":"Southern Railway right-of-way work crew, exchanging old track for new quarter mile long sections of rail. On a good day when the crew doesn't have to stop work too many times to let trains pass on parallel tracks, they can lay slightly less than two miles of welded tracks per day. In 1974 Southern had an average of four crews numbering 50 to 55 men each working on the system's 10,531 miles of railroad.","placename":"Culpeper (Va.)","location":"Culpeper, Virginia","nn1":["556877","556902","556888","556856","556853","556889","556869","544324","547528","556874","556854","556783","556841","556851","556872","556895"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["track","platform","crane","railroad","beam","lever","distance","machinery","mechanism","supply"]}
