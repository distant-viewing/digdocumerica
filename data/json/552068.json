{"path":"552068.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene involving a man engaged in an activity by a large body of water, with an impressive bridge or series of bridges in the background. The man is in a dark boat, leaning over the side, and appears to be pulling a fish out of the water. He is dressed in a relaxed fashion, wearing a striped, short-sleeved shirt and dark pants.\n\nThe boat is equipped with various items suggesting a fishing trip, including a visible cooler and yellow ropes. The surrounding environment features calm water and a clear sky, with the well-structured bridges spanning across the water in the background, adding an industrial contrast to the natural setting.\n\nThe bridges are multi-leveled with the nearest one consisting of a complex truss structure, painted in white, which enhances its geometric details against the blue sky. Further behind, another bridge, which seems older with a rusty appearance, adds depth to the scene. The photograph beautifully blends elements of human activity, technology, and nature.","title":"Local EPA worker on a field trip points out a dying fish at the inner city viaduct area joining Kansas City, KS, and Kansas City, MO.","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["557971","548141","544542","553081","551236","546079","548301","552116","552045","551527","552308","552320","549935","546001","543938","550317"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["bridge","truss","boat","trip","pull","technology","water","one","rope","fish"]}
