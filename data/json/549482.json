{"path":"549482.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic natural scene featuring a turbulent body of water, which appears to be a river or a set of rapids. The water is characterized by swirling white foam and turbulent waves indicating strong currents. In the upper part of the image, the view shifts from the water to a hilly landscape. This hill is moderately dense with green foliage and is topped with thin, dark tree silhouettes that might be cypress or similar trees. \n\nJust over the cliff edge, there are visible structures that seem to be part of a small settlement or a series of buildings, hinting at human habitation nearby. These buildings are partially obscured by the vegetation but appear rustic, aligning with the natural environment. The sky, which occupies a small section of the top frame, appears overcast with a muted tone, suggesting either early morning light or an impending weather change. \n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph suggests a somewhat remote, possibly Mediterranean or similar climate location, combining wild natural elements with signs of human life, nestled unobtrusively into the landscape.","title":"Whirlpool rapids on the niagara river below the falls in the gRand gorge","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["550742","550367","550698","553416","549442","549550","547650","553855","544856","542743","553420","550658","549514","553653","550655","549515"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["swirling","rapid","shift","current","settlement","foam","habitation","align","muted","nestle"]}
