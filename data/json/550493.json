{"path":"550493.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lake setting under a gloomy sky. The foreground showcases a textured shore composed of small, dark particles, possibly wet sand or fine gravel, suggesting the photo may have been taken shortly after a rainfall or at a low tide. The lake itself occupies the middle ground, its surface reflecting the cloudy sky and the surrounding landscape. \n\nOn either side of the lake, gentle sloping hills stretch towards the horizon. These hills appear lush, painted in varying shades of green, indicating a rich, vegetative landscape that further enhances the calmness of the setting. The overcast sky above encompasses a mix of grey and white clouds, which diffuse the light, giving the entire scene a soft, muted look.\n\nThe reflection in the water mirrors the cloudy sky and the outlines of the hills, creating a symmetrical balance between the sky and the lake. This natural symmetry, combined with the expansive view of the landscape, evokes a sense of tranquility and vastness. There are no visible people or man-made structures, suggesting a remote or undisturbed natural location. The composition of the photograph, with its broad, panoramic view and emphasis on nature's quietude, conveys a sense of peaceful isolation.","title":"Atigun valley","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["554405","543611","552319","550735","550579","543546","554399","543643","545213","550745","548034","550778","543816","554527","550612","557569"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["lake","hill","symmetry","encompass","particle","quietude","tide","rainfall","calmness","gravel"]}
