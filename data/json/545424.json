{"path":"545424.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph features an older man holding out his hands towards the camera, displaying several medicine bottles and containers. The man is out of focus in the background, with his face partially shadowed and expression somber or contemplative. He is wearing a light-colored, short-sleeved shirt, and the background appears dark and indistinct, emphasizing the man and the items he holds.\n\nThe medicine bottles, which are the focal point, include a prominently displayed container of Vicks NyQuil and other nondescript medicine bottles, focusing on themes of health and perhaps illness. The setting appears to be indoors, with a low-key lighting that casts most of the frame in shadows, creating a mood that aligns with the theme of sickness or recovery. The composition uses a shallow depth of field to draw attention specifically to the medicines in his warmly lit hands against the darker, blurrier setting.","title":"Medications used by damaged lung victims","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["548998","547427","555253","545408","552105","553035","545420","545407","546291","545416","545412","544202","544232","553522","543834","552104"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["bottle","container","key","recovery","indoor","theme","health","hand","man","hold"]}
