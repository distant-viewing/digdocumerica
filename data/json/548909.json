{"path":"548909.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric sunset over a rugged landscape, featuring layered mountain silhouettes under a glowing sky. The image shows a river winding through the terrain, illuminated by the setting sun, creating reflective patterns on the water's surface. The foreground consists of dark outlines of land masses and water, which become progressively lighter in the distance. The sun sets in an orange and purple sky, creating a stark contrast against the darkened earth and water, highlighting the gentle curves of the riverbanks and the jagged mountain peaks. The landscape is devoid of any visible human activity or structures, presenting a pure and natural scene that evokes a sense of tranquility and grandeur. The composition emphasizes horizontal layers, from the water in the lower third, the middle ground filled with ridges and contours, and the vast open sky occupying the upper section, suggesting depth and the expansive scale of the natural setting.","title":"Colorado River at sunrise--30 miles north of Yuma","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["550646","553816","557560","548181","547731","548904","548910","545864","552338","548182","554759","544047","548123","546100","557447","552335"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["masse","sun","third","mountain","water","ridge","grandeur","contour","curve","riverbank"]}
