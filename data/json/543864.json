{"path":"543864.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph features a close-up of a woman outdoors during what appears to be a sunny day. She is wearing a light-toned, broad-brimmed straw hat with a textured surface and a subtle, shiny, patterned band around the base. The woman is dressed in a khaki shirt with buttoned cuffs and a flap pocket on the chest, suggesting a work-related or outdoor activity environment.\n\nThe woman's expression is focused and contemplative, with her gaze directed downwards towards something outside of the frame. Her skin is lightly wrinkled indicating mature age, and her facial features show deep concentration or concern.\n\nThe background is softly blurred but hints at a bright, clear sky, possibly indicating the photograph was taken in a wide-open or sparsely populated area. The overall composition centralizes the womanâ€™s face and upper torso, drawing attention to her expression and attire, which feels functional and suited for work or field activity. The natural light emphasizes the textures of her hat and shirt, enhancing the details of the photograph's subject.","title":"Migrant worker in field","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["554923","554051","543853","553499","557039","555530","554857","554858","548226","556414","553115","544409","553091","549120","550048","542613"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["woman","cuff","torso","khaki","hat","pocket","chest","straw","work","band"]}
