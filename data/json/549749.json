{"path":"549749.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The image captures a vivid scene at a landfill or waste management site. In the center of the photograph, a large garbage truck is tipping garbage into a pile. The truck is actively dumping its load, with a cascade of trash including paper, plastics, and other waste materials spilling from the raised bed of the truck. The plenty of debris and garbage not only fills the truck but also forms a large mound on the ground.\n\nOn the left side of the image, part of another garbage disposal area or container is visible with a sign that reads \"KEEP YOUR BOROUGH CLEAN.\" This suggests that the site is actively encouraging recycling and proper waste disposal.\n\nThe background is a clear blue sky, indicating that the photograph was taken on a day with good weather. Notably, there are no people visible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention entirely on the process of waste disposal and the large quantities of trash.\n\nOverall, the composition highlights environmental concerns related to waste management and the large-scale operations involved in handling community trash. The scene is a stark reminder of the volume of waste societies produce.","title":"Truck piling garbage in Hackensack Meadows dump behind Ft Lee. The dump serves 250,000 Bergen County residents.
