{"path":"543401.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a vivid coastal scene with lush vegetation and a distinct geological setting. The foreground is characterized by a vast expanse of blooming pink flowers covering a rocky, uneven terrain. The magenta-hued blossoms create a vibrant blanket of color presenting a dramatic contrast against the rugged stone surface beneath them.\n\nScattered amongst the flower-covered rocks are various green shrubs and succulents, adding diversity to the floral display and enhancing the naturalistic feel of the scene. These plants suggest a harsh growing environment, likely conditioned by the salty sea air and limited soil fertility.\n\nBeyond this natural foreground, the background shifts to a calm ocean view on the left side, where the gentle waves of the sea meet the rocky coastline. Further back to the right, a panoramic view of a coastal town stretches across the frame. This town is seen in the distance, featuring multiple houses and buildings, some with red roofs which stand out against the overall green and blue of the landscape.\n\nThe sky above is partly cloudy yet bright, suggesting a sunny day with ample light that helps enrich the colors of the natural and man-made elements within the photograph.\n\nOverall, the image captures a harmonious blend of rugged natural beauty and human habitation, presenting a serene yet vibrant seascape.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove, Monterey Bay","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543202","543196","543399","543199","547592","543346","543066","543404","543352","554081","542968","543363","554082","543389","553997","542917"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["town","flower","sea","blossom","present","seascape","enrich","shift","diversity","grow"]}
