{"path":"552258.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of an industrial or possibly post-industrial landscape with water bodies and various land formations. The foreground prominently shows a waterway splitting into several channels, with one main channel meandering through the land. On the banks, there are sparse wooded areas and some patches of cleared land. The presence of stumps and logs in these cleared areas suggests recent logging activities.\n\nTo the left of the photograph, there are narrower channels or ditches leading to or from the main waterway. Several small, flat areas that appear to be man-made are visible near these channels, possibly for storage or processing purposes. In the background, rectangular and square ponds or basins filled with water can be seen, which might be used for industrial processes like settling ponds.\n\nFurther back in the scene, infrastructure such as buildings and possibly a smokestack emitting steam or smoke into the air is noticeable, indicating industrial activity. Beyond the immediate industrial site, the landscape opens into a broader river or larger body of water. The horizon shows a mixture of natural terrain and industrial installations, blending into a densely tree-covered area and distant hills under a clear sky.","title":"Ebey island in the snohomish river estuary.
