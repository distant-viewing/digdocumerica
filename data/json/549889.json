{"path":"549889.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"The photograph captures a large ferry prominently painted in red and gold with the words \"Marine & Aviation\" written along its side. On the ferryâ€™s central part, there is a sign showing \"Marine & Aviation: New York.\" The ferry is moving on water, suggesting that the image captures active transportation, possibly across a river.\n\nIn the background, a city skyline is visible, densely packed with various buildings of differing architectural styles and heights. The skyline has a mixture of modern high-rise buildings and possibly older, historic structures. The setting appears to be during the early evening or late afternoon, as the lighting is somewhat soft and dim, indicating either dawn or dusk.\n\nThe water body on which the ferry travels has a gentle appearance, with slight ripples indicating mild movement. The overall tone of the image is quite serene, highlighting urban transportation against a bustling city backdrop. This scene is likely situated in a major city known for its ferry transportation system, such as New York City.","title":"The Staten Island ferry in New York Harbor's Upper Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549900","553797","549892","546925","548327","546840","549313","548390","555722","553865","547061","552268","551222","548403","555800","555726"],"cl":[18],"cluster":["#18 &mdash; Ship"],"terms":["ferry","transportation","city","skyline","gold","mixture","word","dawn","ripple","height"]}
