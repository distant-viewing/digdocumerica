{"path":"556107.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures the exterior of an Amtrak train station, characterized by its clean, modern architectural style. The station features a prominent Amtrak sign with the company's recognizable red, white, and blue logo, indicating the building's function as a railway station. The facade of the building combines gray stone and large glass windows that allow a view into the brightly lit interior. \n\nIn front of the station, there is an entrance with double glass doors, flanked by panels of plate glass, and supported by grey vertical beams that match the exterior stone. Over the entrance, there are mounted lights visibly illuminating the area. \n\nA uniformed Amtrak employee stands in the doorway, creating a sense of human presence and activity. He appears to be engaged in a task or waiting to assist passengers. Just inside the glass doors, seated benches are visible, providing a place for passengers to rest. Additionally, interior signage and what appears to be a timetable or bulletin board can be seen through the glass, oriented towards the needs of travelers.\n\nThe building strikes a balance between functionality and straightforward aesthetics, indicative of many transportation hubs designed for efficiency and high usage. The photograph provides a glimpse into the everyday operations and structure of a typical Amtrak station.","title":"Spokane, Washington, train station. Amtrak is working to refurbish many of the passenger terminals which came under their control in 1971 when they assumed major responsibility for U.S. intercity rail passenger service. Although the corporation operates the trains, they lease use of the tracks from the nation's railroads.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555960","556131","556063","556059","556649","556122","556073","555987","556024","555964","556701","556065","555984","556021","555963","556686"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Transportation Infrastructure"],"terms":["station","glass","passenger","entrance","stone","employee","door","efficiency","traveler","need"]}
