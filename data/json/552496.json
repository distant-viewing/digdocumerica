{"path":"552496.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at an archaeological excavation site. Several individuals are engaged in different activities related to the dig.\n\nAt the center, a young woman with a red bandana and a denim vest uses a shovel to work within one of the excavation trenches. Directly to her left, a man in knee-length cargo shorts, a gray t-shirt, and a white hat is focused on inspecting or reading some documents he holds, likely related to the excavation findings.\n\nOn the left side of the image, another individual, partially out of frame, is bending over, possibly examining or picking up something from the bottom of the trench. This person is not wearing a shirt and has a red bandana on their head.\n\nOn the right, there's a group that seems to be observing or waiting to perform their tasks. Notably, one young individual is dressed in a light-colored denim shirt and blue jeans, crouching by the trench while possibly discussing or examining findings with another individual in dark clothing.\n\nThe excavation site is arranged with multiple sections and divisions, likely to categorize or separate different areas and layers of interest. The ground is marked by lines and features labels of various sections. Various tools, buckets, and materials used for excavation like tarps and wooden planks are scattered around the site, which is an enclosed outdoor area under bright daylight.","title":"College students work with archaeologists at \"koster dig\" an ancient indian burial site","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["544162","552495","544366","544158","544984","544085","545567","542601","555824","547117","546271","552286","554856","557742","553383","544154"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["excavation","trench","bandana","denim","site","examine","division","shirt","section","crouch"]}
