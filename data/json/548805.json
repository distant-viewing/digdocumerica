{"path":"548805.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures a touching moment between an adult male and a young child on a beach. The man, wearing patterned blue shorts and no shirt, stands in shallow waters of what seems to be a calm sea. He is holding a blond toddler, presumed to be a girl based on the pink and white striped outfit and the style of white sandals. The man gently holds the child close to his chest, suggesting a comforting or protective gesture.\n\nThe scene reveals a sandy beach under a clear sky with thin white clouds scattered throughout. The sea is visible in the background with its tranquil blue waters, contributing to a serene and peaceful mood. The surroundings appear quite natural and undisturbed, hinting at a secluded or less crowded beach location. The lighting in the image suggests it could be taken during the daytime when the sun is bright, casting natural light that enhances the vividness of the surroundings and the subjects' presence in the environment.","title":"At bahia honda state park on bahia honda key","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["543517","548793","543499","548696","551544","546851","549105","553094","543515","543493","543214","552977","552975","550923","543225","547727"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","subjects","sea","toddler","sandal","child","surroundings","chest","vividness","gesture"]}
