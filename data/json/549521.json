{"path":"549521.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a serene lakeside area. The body of water is a significant and prominent feature, exhibiting a beautiful blue hue. The coastline is gently curved, and several docks extend into the lake, some with boats moored to them.\n\nAdjacent to the lake, a curving road can be seen hugging the coastline, flanked by areas of greenery and a smattering of buildings. These buildings vary in size and style but generally appear to be small, possibly residential houses or lakeside cabins. There is also a noticeable structure that could be a watermill or small factory based on its larger size and unique architecture, located close to the shore.\n\nThe area is relatively developed but maintains a lot of natural beauty and open space. Open patches of land, likely fields or undeveloped properties, separate some of the buildings. The overall setting has a peaceful, recreational feel, suggesting a community possibly geared towards vacationing or residing near the water.","title":"Niagara river, at GRand Isle across from north tonowanda shows water discoloration from industrial wastes","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["551523","556966","552915","548917","543527","556993","552987","552232","550640","543579","544557","555702","545896","556905","556994","543547"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lakeside","coastline","hug","size","vacation","lake","cabin","moor","separate","property"]}
