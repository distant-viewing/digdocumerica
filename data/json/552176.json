{"path":"552176.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph depicts a lumber mill's log pond. The area is bustling with numerous logs scattered across the water's surface. At a glance, the pond is cluttered with logs in various orientations, some partially submerged. These logs appear freshly cut, as evidenced by the bright hues of the wood's interior exposed on their recently-severed ends.\n\nOn the right side of the image are more organized operations, where a stack of sawn lumber is visible, neatly piled and possibly ready for shipping or further processing. Nearby, heavy machinery, likely used for moving and sorting the logs, is stationed on a wooden platform. This platform and others in the scene are constructed using hefty wooden beams, looking robust and utilitarian. \n\nThe background, while mostly obscured by the activities upfront, shows hints of a natural environment, possibly a forest or a wooded area, suggesting the millâ€™s close proximity to logging sites. The overall scene captures the dynamic, industrial aspects of logging and lumber production, spotlighted under a bright, clear sky which suggests favorable weather conditions for such operations.","title":"Logs lying in mud at chambers creek at low tide.
