{"path":"543405.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an intriguing industrial coastal scene. In the foreground, large, rounded boulders strewn with seaweed occupy the lower section of the image. These rocks are worn and smoothed, likely by the action of waves and wind over time. The rocks are interspersed with bits of rusting metal, possibly remnants of previous industrial activities or wreckage.\n\nThe central focus of the image is an intriguing, aged industrial structure built on stilts over the water. Its architectural style combines practical, utilitarian elements typical of mid-20th-century industrial facilities. The building features multiple levels with various enclosures, and it is constructed from timber and metal, showcasing signs of corrosion and weathering that emphasize its aging condition. Accessible by a series of ladders and walkways, it appears equipped to handle rugged oceanic conditions.\n\nIn the background, the open sea is visible under a relatively clear sky with few clouds. This setting suggests a remote or isolated location, where industrial operations might interact directly with natural marine environments.\n\nOverall, the image combines natural rugged beauty with human-made industrial elements, creating a stark contrast and invoking thoughts about the interplay between human activity and natural coastal environments.","title":"California -- Cannery Row, Monterey harbor","placename":"Monterey Harbor (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Harbor, California","nn1":["543359","543242","543288","543364","543320","551953","547581","543257","552167","547118","544976","544527","549338","547579","547040","543291"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["corrosion","seaweed","stilt","wreckage","ladder","enclosure","rock","timber","boulder","aging"]}
