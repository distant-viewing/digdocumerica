{"path":"550433.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a serene landscape characterized by vast, sloping grassy fields accented with natural hues of green, red, and brown. Dominating the composition is a winding river, reflecting light and creating a shimmering contrast against the darker, earthen colors of the surrounding terrain. The image conveys a natural, undisturbed environment where the smooth, flowing lines of the river intersects with the textured, sloping patterns of the grassland. This backdrop suggests a tranquil, remote setting, possibly in a highland or mountainous region. There are no visible human elements or structures, reinforcing the untouched, wild character of the scene. The perspective is from a higher vantage point looking down on the river, giving a comprehensive view of the intertwining natural forms and colors.","title":"The Atigun River two miles inside the Atigun Gorge from the pipeline crossing point.
