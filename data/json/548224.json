{"path":"548224.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man in a close-up portrait. He appears to be in a joyful mood, evident by his broad smile and twinkling eyes. The man's face is heavily lined, suggesting a life full of experiences, and his skin is weathered. He is wearing a dark-colored cap, which sits askew on his head, adding a playful element to his appearance.\n\nHe is dressed in a denim garment, likely a jacket, which is typical casual wear and suggests a relaxed setting. His right hand is partially visible near his face, hinting at a gesture or movement, possibly emphasizing a conversation or a point he is making.\n\nThe background of the image is softly blurred and provides no distinct features, ensuring the focus remains solely on the man. The lighting in the photograph highlights his facial features, especially around his cheek and the creases of his eyes, enhancing the emotive quality of the image. The overall mood is warm and inviting, capturing a moment of genuine human expression.","title":"The local CIL delivery man at Poole's Rexall Drugstore in Rockport","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["552103","547282","548218","548226","547179","548616","553605","547351","554857","558332","556563","553055","543701","548251","557056","552871"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["cheek","eye","garment","portrait","ensure","skin","face","gesture","denim","man"]}
