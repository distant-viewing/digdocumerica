{"path":"547644.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph provides a bird's-eye view of a coastal area featuring several individual structures and natural scenery. The structures, likely cabins or small homes, are arranged sporadically across the sandy terrain. There are about eight buildings visible, all sporting similar design elementsâ€”raised foundations, gabled roofs, and a compact, simple architecture. The buildings are primarily painted red, creating a striking contrast with the pale sandy environment around them.\n\nThe terrain itself is a mix of sandy beach and patches of vegetation, likely dunes or grassy areas adapted to seaside environments. The edge of the photograph shows the shoreline, where the gentle surf of a calm sea meets the land. The beach area is sparsely populated; there are a few figures visible in the scene, appearing quite small due to the altitude of the viewpoint.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, with its high vantage point and focus on the interaction between human habitation and the natural coastal environment, emphasizes a serene and somewhat isolated setting. The photograph captures both the beauty of the natural landscape and the modest human footprint within it.","title":"New housing on barrier beach dune","placename":"Westerly (R.I.)","location":"Westerly, Rhode Island","nn1":["547633","547641","547636","547645","543426","550314","543427","545110","543362","557453","545121","543437","557523","547984","556953","553982"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","surf","foundation","footprint","dune","habitation","cabin","viewpoint","altitude","terrain"]}
