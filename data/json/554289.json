{"path":"554289.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"The photograph captures a lively winter scene likely taken in Vail, Colorado. It features a group of people, mostly equipped with ski gear, gathered on a snow-covered street. One of the prominent objects in the image is a sign on the left saying \"SKIING IN STREETS OF VAIL PROHIBITED,\" indicating that skiing on the streets is not allowed.\n\nThe people in the photo are dressed in colorful winter ski attire, representing typical 1970s fashion styles with bright colors and patterns. The outfits include yellow, red, and blue ski jackets, some with fur-lined collars, and pants with a mix of colors such as red and orange. Several individuals are also wearing ski hats or helmets. There are ski poles and skis, some of which are held while others are stacked against what appears to be racks.\n\nMost of the people appear to be mingling or conversing, and a couple are walking. The crowd includes men and women, visibly engaged in social interaction or movement, all beneath a clear blue sky, contributing to the vibrant, bustling winter resort atmosphere.\n\nIn the background, there are partial views of buildings typical of a ski resort, featuring wooden and stone facades partially obscured by the gathering. The laid-back yet controlled environment reflects a common ski resort scenario where enthusiasts gather, exchange stories, or prepare for skiing, adhering to local regulations as implied by the signage.","title":"Skiers return to Vail village at the end of the day","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554243","554275","554279","554238","554262","554261","554244","554276","554237","554235","554267","554221","554259","554269","554214","554242"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["ski","resort","winter","gather","mingl","skiing","skis","exchange","enthusiast","regulation"]}
