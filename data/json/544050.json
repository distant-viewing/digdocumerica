{"path":"544050.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive view of a mature wheat field during what appears to be late afternoon, given the soft golden hues that pervade through the scene. The wheat, appearing rich in color with shades of gold, amber, and brown, stretches across the entire image, meeting a distant horizon.\n\nA significant visual element is a clear, well-trodden path that divides the field into two nearly symmetrical halves, leading directly toward the horizon. This path draws the eye forward, directing attention to the mountain range visible in the far background. The mountains are bathed in a soft, dusky light, suggesting either an early morning or late evening setting.\n\nThe sky, while occupying only a small portion of the frame at the top, shows a gradient of colors ranging from a deep blue to a lighter blue, possibly indicating clearing skies or the remnants of a sunset. There are no clouds visible, which contributes to the calm and serene atmosphere of the image.\n\nNo human figures or animals are visible in the scene, emphasizing a sense of solitude and focusing solely on the natural landscape and the cultivated field. The absence of wind or motion suggests a moment captured in stillness. Overall, the photograph exudes a tranquil yet vivid impression of rural farmland, highlighting the beauty and simplicity of agricultural landscapes.","title":"Cornfield and barn","placename":"Thatcher (Ariz.)","location":"Thatcher, Arizona","nn1":["544046","553810","545040","547288","549233","549141","549149","549156","549146","547432","549158","552458","548979","557183","555618","556990"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["wheat","field","pervade","tread","path","range","farmland","blue","gold","mountain"]}
