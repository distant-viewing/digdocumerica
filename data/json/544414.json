{"path":"544414.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque scene of a person riding a horse through a dust-filled path surrounded by trees. The image is backlit with warm, golden sunlight that filters through a canopy of leaves, creating a dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nThe rider, positioned at the center of the frame, is mounted on a brown horse, moving away from the viewer. The horse and rider are mostly in silhouette due to the backlighting, emphasizing their outlines against the surrounding environment. The rider appears calm and relaxed, leaning slightly forward on the horse, suggesting a moment of peaceful movement.\n\nThe background is composed of trees with dense foliage, and the sun creates a luminous effect as it shines through the leaves, highlighting bits of green against the otherwise dusky setting. The ground is covered with dust, which is stirred into clouds around the horseâ€™s hooves, adding a dynamic element to the stillness of the wooded environment.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a tranquil and somewhat timeless quality, evoking a sense of unity between the rider and the natural setting, highlighted by the interplay of light and shadow.","title":"HavaSupai campground","placename":"Supai (Ariz.)","location":"Supai, Arizona","nn1":["544308","543366","544362","557186","557988","543726","553118","557992","542810","556548","542800","554010","557051","542972","544420","542966"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["horse","rider","dust","unity","stir","backlighting","shine","leave","stillness","ride"]}
