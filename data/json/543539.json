{"path":"543539.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a housing development area, likely during the construction or renovation phase. In the foreground, there is a large blue trailer with white text that reads \"TOWNHOMES LAKE FOREST GLEN 2-3-4 BEDROOMS\" along with a phone number. The trailer is parked on a dirt road, signifying ongoing construction or recent development work.\n\nIn the background, there are multiple townhouses with a traditional design, featuring wooden siding in shades of brown, dark roofs, and visible vertical and rectangular windows. The buildings appear new or in a state of being refurbished, and there's construction material visible around one of the buildings, supporting this inference.\n\nTwo children, both on bicycles, add life to the scene. One child, in the foreground, is captured in motion, riding towards the left side of the frame. The other child is slightly farther away, and both seem to be enjoying a sunny day outdoors amidst the residential construction.\n\nThe environment is open and spacious, with a large clear sky and a few scattered mature pine trees, hinting that the location might be in a semi-rural or newly developed suburban area. The setting suggests a community in the midst of growth and development, intended to offer family housing with various bedroom options.","title":"Lake forest glen condominium town houses","placename":"Tahoe City (Calif.)","location":"Tahoe City, California","nn1":["547931","547863","544814","544118","546988","557455","557550","547433","553922","547837","552482","547664","558131","553941","556161","557456"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["construction","housing","trailer","development","child","renovation","townhouse","option","phase","phone"]}
