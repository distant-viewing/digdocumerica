{"path":"554136.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows a wooden boardwalk path extending directly into the distance. The boardwalk is made from multiple wooden planks laid horizontally, displaying a natural wood color with slight weathering, including some darker spots of aged wood and knots typical to timber. The path is contrasted against a dark surface on either side, which appears to be rough asphalt or possibly a soft ground like dirt, but the darkness and uniformity suggest it is more likely asphalt. The weathered appearance of the wood and stark contrast between the wood and the surrounding surface gives the image a slight rustic or abstract feel. The perspective is linear, focusing attention directly down the centerline towards an unseen endpoint, lending an element of depth and directionality to the composition. There are no visible people or moving objects in the scene, which evokes a still and somewhat serene ambiance.","title":"\"devastation trail\" is the name given to this boardwalk through skeletons of trees desTroyed by the 1959 volcanic eruption in Hawaii volcanoes national park","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554134","554135","555127","544285","554774","544632","557018","555215","546559","557976","547660","553464","553373","552532","544245","556976"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["boardwalk","wood","asphalt","rustic","path","uniformity","abstract","timber","weathering","darkness"]}
