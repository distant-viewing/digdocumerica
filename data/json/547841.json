{"path":"547841.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The image shows a large outdoor billboard featuring a colorful mural. The mural depicts a variety of scenes and elements, possibly representing local culture or features of a community named Greenbrook. The scene on the billboard illustrates a vibrant setting with a prominent red bridge resembling the Golden Gate, spanning across a body of water. Below the bridge, there are depictions of water currents and some posters or flyers that have been fixed onto the billboard's surface.\n\nTo the right side of the mural, a picturesque landscape with a neighborhood is depicted. This includes several houses, each painted in warm, inviting colors, surrounded by green trees and rolling hills. The rural or suburban scene also seems to feature wildlife, illustrated by a bird perched near one of the houses.\n\nIn the foreground of the shot, the natural setting appears undeveloped or possibly neglected, with what looks like muddy ground and sparse vegetation. There are also several commercial signs attached to the wooden structure supporting the billboard, one of which indicates that the land is for sale. The backdrop of the photograph adds a sense of place, showing other structures that may indicate a sparse residential or industrial area.\n\nOverall, this composition mixes elements of artwork promoting a community with signs of urban development and commerce in a possibly transitional phase.","title":"\"Cross the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and find good living in Staten Island\"-a theme of the developers'","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547845","545240","546187","548674","550141","543814","543714","548730","555911","550099","556231","557419","543641","556047","543106","545241"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Billboards"],"terms":["billboard","mural","bridge","phase","artwork","house","community","poster","commerce","current"]}
