{"path":"548046.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a group of individuals involved in a winter outdoor activity, probably related to environmental research or snow study. The setting is a snowy landscape, richly textured with thickly snow-covered trees in the background that impart a serene and chilly ambiance.\n\nThe scene focuses on four people, three of whom are visible in full and one partially obscured. They are dressed in winter clothing suitable for cold climates, including hats, gloves, and heavy coats, suggesting it is quite cold. Each person is equipped with skis, indicating the terrain might be challenging to traverse without them.\n\nA prominent feature of the image is a long tube-like instrument, possibly used for collecting snow samples or measuring snow depth. One individual is capturing or releasing snow from this metallic tube while others observe the process closely. The tube is capped with snow at the end, showing its use in the environment they are in.\n\nColors in the image include the blues and reds of the jackets against the predominantly white and grey snowy background, creating a contrast that visually emphasizes the subjects. The element of teamwork in a scientific or exploratory context is evident, as the group appears engaged and cooperative in their task.","title":"Members of the crag rats climbing club make winter snow surveys for the u.s.
