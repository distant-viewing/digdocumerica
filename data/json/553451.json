{"path":"553451.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view featuring an industrial setting dominated by the Fitchburg Paper Company. The industrial complex is expansive with multiple large, exclusively designed buildings interconnected, and with flat roofs. Two tall smokestacks, part of the factory, stand prominent against the landscape, releasing no visible emissions in the image.\n\nSurrounding the factory are various other components: a spacious parking lot filled with cars which suggests the image was taken during working hours, and several trucks parked in specific segments of the area, possibly for loading or unloading materials.\n\nThe geographical surroundings include a broad dirt area that curves around the factory, possibly a route used for transport or as part of the facility's infrastructure. Beyond the immediate vicinity of the factory lie residential areas with numerous houses, their dense arrangement typical of a suburban community. The houses are mostly single-story with some trees scattered among them, indicating a settled neighborhood.\n\nIn the background, more dense vegetation is visible, along with additional residential or small commercial structures, which blend more with the natural environment. The overall setting seems to represent an industrial area located close to or within a residential zone, integrating work and community living. \n\nThe photograph is older, evidenced not only by the color and quality of the image but also by the styles of vehicles and architectural designs typical of mid-20th century industrial and residential constructions. This image captures a vivid snapshot of industrial life and its proximity to residential living, featuring infrastructure, work-life, and community juxtaposition.","title":"Fitchburg Paper Company on the Nashua River","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["553461","550335","553460","551578","549727","550866","546122","549506","551579","550722","547126","550868","551569","557225","545437","551192"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["factory","living","community","unloading","house","infrastructure","segment","work","route","emission"]}
