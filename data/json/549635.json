{"path":"549635.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"The photograph showcases an outdoor scene centered around a large, circular water treatment facility. The facility consists of a sizable concrete basin filled with still water, reflecting the sky and the clouds above. The structure of the basin includes an inner curved barrier that appears to segment the basin.\n\nIn the background, a dense forest of tall pine trees is present, providing a natural green barrier. Just beyond the trees, majestic, snow-capped mountains extend across the horizon, adding a picturesque and serene backdrop to the industrial scene.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a building with a simple, modern structure possibly containing control or monitoring equipment for the facility. This side of the basin is also equipped with several street lamps and a metal guardrail, indicating a walkway or service path around the perimeter of the water basin.\n\nThe sky is partially cloudy, and the clouds are beautifully reflected in the water, giving the scene a tranquil and slightly surreal feel. No human activity or presence is observed in the photograph, emphasizing the isolation and functional nature of the facility within its natural surroundings.","title":"Water treatment plant at Lake Tahoe","placename":"Reno (Nev.)","location":"Reno, Nevada","nn1":["543524","552984","543568","543570","543571","543573","543574","549636","548151","548137","557249","543572","542982","547568","543809","553837"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["basin","facility","barrier","guardrail","perimeter","treatment","cloud","water","walkway","lamp"]}
