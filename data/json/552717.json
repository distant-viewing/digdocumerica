{"path":"552717.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph features a serene yet industrial scene consisting of a shimmering water body in the foreground and an industrial skyline in the far background. The water appears vibrant, reflecting sunlight that sparkles across its undulating surface, indicating strong sunlight, possibly during later afternoon hours.\n\nThe industrial backdrop is composed of silhouetted structures, including multiple smokestacks and high-rise frameworks possibly representing oil refineries or chemical plants. These silhouettes against the light sky hint at a distance between the viewerâ€™s location and the industrial facilities. The color tone suggests it could be either early or late in the day, contributing to the dramatic and somewhat muted lighting.\n\nNo human figures or moving objects are visible, giving the image a quiet, static feel. The focus remains largely on the interplay between the natural, shimmering beauty of water in the foreground and the man-made industrial essence in the background. This contrast might invoke themes of nature versus industry or the peaceful coexistence of both elements within a single frame. The composition successfully captures a moment of natural beauty overshadowed by human industrial activity.","title":"Mobil oil at paulsboro, New Jersey on the Delaware river seen from Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["550937","552040","545979","546118","545996","552179","552194","557376","546864","551576","547102","543004","556504","555792","552139","545430"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["overshadow","refinery","sparkle","invoke","sunlight","coexistence","oil","undulate","chemical","hour"]}
