{"path":"544950.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a striking landscape predominantly featuring rugged terrain with deep canyons and large rock formations. The composition captures a broad vista that includes a deep canyon snaking through the center of the image, surrounded by vast, erosion-sculpted sandstone cliffs. The canyon walls exhibit a myriad of colors ranging from beige to deep red, indicative of sedimentary rock layers.\n\nAt the bottom of the canyon, dense green vegetation, possibly including shrubs and trees, contrasts sharply with the arid, barren rock surfaces. This greenery suggests the presence of a water source in the canyon, likely supporting this localized ecosystem.\n\nThe upper parts of the image show expansive rock plateaus, with their surfaces appearing rugged, uneven, and weathered by elements. The horizon is visible in the distance, drawing the eye towards a clear blue sky, which indicates that the photograph was taken on a day with good weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition and the natural lighting highlight the dramatic geological features and provide a sense of the scale and the harsh yet beautiful natural environment of this desert-like region. Such landscapes are often found in areas like the American Southwest.","title":"White canyon near sipapu bridge Natural Bridges National Monument","placename":"Utah","location":"Utah","nn1":["545799","545800","544745","545796","552690","545754","544429","545765","545804","545787","544917","545750","545802","545789","545760","545764"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["canyon","rock","myriad","sculpt","plateaus","sandstone","vista","beige","strike","snake"]}
