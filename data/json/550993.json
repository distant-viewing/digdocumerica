{"path":"550993.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an intense and dramatic scene featuring two large water towers amidst a large amount of smoke. The smoke is thick and billows extensively across the scene, enveloping the structures and almost hiding them from view. The background is barely visible due to the dense smoke, but hints of a hilly terrain suggest a possibly rural or industrial setting. The sky above is obscured in parts by the smoke, but where visible, it shows the early or late part of the day with a somewhat dark blue hue. The water towers, central to the image, are industrial in design, constructed of metal and supported by four-legged structures. The overall atmosphere is one of emergency or disruption, characteristic of a large fire or industrial incident. The image is grainy, adding to the urgency and dramatic nature of the scene.","title":"Emission from the Union Carbide ferro Alloy plant darkens the sky at Alloy, WV","placename":"Charleston (W.
