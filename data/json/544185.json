{"path":"544185.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"","caption":"This vibrant photograph shows a group of six young individuals on a sunny day at a rustic waterfront setting. The scene is centered on a weathered wooden shack with a sloping roof and a dark, faded facade. There are two wooden pillars visible, and the edifice is directly adjacent to a body of water, indicated by the pier-like structures that the group stands on.\n\nThe composition of the group is quite lively and youthful. On the left, there are two girls in swimsuits—one in a two-piece blue and the other in a two-piece denim-like material—standing side by side. Next, slightly to their right stands another girl in a turquoise swimsuit with a halter neckline, with her arm around a boy who is the only male in the group. He is wearing a casual burgundy shirt with khaki pants. To his right, standing a bit in front, is another young girl in a patriotic bikini top with blue bottoms.\n\nIn the foreground, to the left, a smaller child, seemingly younger than the others, stands on a segment of the wooden pier with a shy or playful posture, holding onto the wooden structure. This child is wearing a grey tank top paired with striped shorts.\n\nTheir poses are relaxed and cheerful, suggesting a moment of summer leisure and camaraderie by the water. The scene is bright, likely captured in full daylight, with shadows indicating the sun's high position. The natural setting, casual attire, and rustic architecture contribute to an overall atmosphere of laid-back, youthful enthusiasm.","title":"Photograph of a Louisiana fisherman's family","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543944","550228","547688","547879","545267","551160","547009","553446","553447","544204","543534","548529","557772","543943","550838","558233"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["girl","swimsuit","group","pier","halter","neckline","enthusiasm","shack","child","piece"]}
