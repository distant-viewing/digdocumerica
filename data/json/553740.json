{"path":"553740.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a large cargo ship, prominently marked with the name \"Hawaiian Enterprise,\" moored at a dock. The viewpoint is from the dock itself, focusing towards the bow of the ship, which towers into the sky. The ship is a large ocean-going vessel with a sharply curved bow and is color-coated in a uniform gray. On the deck of the ship, some details like handrails and machinery, possibly windlasses or capstans, can be seen.\n\nTo the left of the ship, a large crane with a long boom and hook is visible. This crane, bearing the name \"Matson,\" is likely used for loading and unloading cargo. The crane's structure features steel framework and is positioned on a platform next to the ship.\n\nIn the foreground, thick ropes or mooring lines are prominently displayed. These ropes, secured around a bollard, appear worn, suggesting regular use in securing ships at the dock. The rough texture of the ropes contrasts with the smooth metal of the bollard and the rough wooden planks of the dock.\n\nThe background features a clear, blue sky scattered with a few wispy clouds, suggesting good weather conditions. Further back, some calm sea is visible alongside the dock area.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the industrial nature of the shipping industry, with a focus on the structures and equipment used in the operation of cargo loading and unloading at a maritime dock.","title":"Unloading supplies for the islands at Honolulu pier","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["548127","547474","548126","546934","551558","553739","546881","546828","551581","552303","546860","546919","552244","552008","551582","555260"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["ship","dock","bollard","cargo","rope","crane","bow","name","handrail","mooring"]}
