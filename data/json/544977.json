{"path":"544977.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features an outdoor scene with a human figure and natural elements under a clear blue sky. The composition centers on a large rock formation or possibly a small cliff. This rock is significant in size and has a flat, vertical face on which the word \"RENTON\" is spray-painted in red letters. The top of the rock supports several coniferous trees, adding a touch of greenery contrasted against the sky and the rocky surface.\n\nStanding in the foreground is a man, dressed in outdoor work attire. He wears a red hard hat, a blue and white plaid shirt, and dark pants. His posture suggests he is either walking or standing still and turning slightly towards the camera with a serious or contemplative expression on his face. He appears to be middle-aged.\n\nIn the background, beyond the rock, additional trees are visible, suggesting this location is either in a forested area or near a park. The presence of sand around the rockâ€™s base, and what could be a glimpse of water in the far left of the image, indicates this scene might be situated near a beach or coastal area.","title":"Francis mccrary, chairman of the quinault indian tribes fish and game commission.
