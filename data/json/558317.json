{"path":"558317.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Truman, Gary","caption":"The photograph depicts an elderly man in a domestic setting, concentrating on cooking with an old-fashioned, possibly vintage, stovetop. The stovetop is white and features four burners, with a kettle sitting on top. The man appears to be stirring or tending to something on one of the burners. He is dressed in a simple, light-colored shirt and darker pants.\n\nThe lighting in the image casts a warm, yellowish hue, contributing to an intimate, cozy atmosphere. A bare light bulb can be seen in the background, illuminating the scene from above. Behind the man, there is a partially visible doorway painted in a contrasting dark color which adds depth to the scene.\n\nOn the floor beside the stove, there is a pile of dark, cylindrical objects – possibly logs for burning – placed within a round, shallow container, perhaps a lid or tray. The scene suggests a rustic, possibly rural kitchen setting. The environment looks used and lived-in, enhancing the overall feel of simplicity and homeliness in the photograph.","title":"August vogel stands in front of the wood burning stove he and his wife use for cooking in the kitchen of their home.
