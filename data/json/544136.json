{"path":"544136.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The photograph shows a large roadside advertisement sign that reads “Join more than 6,150 other land owners” followed by “GRAND CANYON SUBDIVISION” in bold, black lettering against a white background. The sign stands on several white metal posts that provide support. The environment around the sign features a semi-arid landscape with a few scattered shrubs and trees typical of a dry region. The sky above is relatively clear, suggesting this photo was taken on a bright, sunny day. The sign itself appears slightly worn, indicating it has been in place for some time. This image is likely to have been taken in a rural or remote area given the natural surroundings and the presence of undeveloped land visible around the sign.","title":"GRand canyon estates","placename":"Arizona","location":"Arizona","nn1":["543637","545824","543641","549039","547648","543100","543724","557553","543115","544845","553669","543556","544118","554123","557419","545620"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","join","owner","land","roadside","lettering","advertisement","follow","post","shrub"]}
