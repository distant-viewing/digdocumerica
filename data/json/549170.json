{"path":"549170.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive landscape characterized by large-scale earthworks and geological formations. The area has a complex terrain featuring multiple layers of dug-up earth, creating a textured surface that varies in color from various shades of brown to gray. The patterns indicate heavy machinery usage, likely for mining or construction purposes.\n\nIn the midst of the rugged terrain, several green areas can be observed, possibly fields or patches of natural vegetation that contrast with the barren, excavated ground. These green patches appear to be arranged in terraces or segmented patterns, suggesting either agricultural activity or natural plateau formation.\n\nThere are roads or dirt tracks that wind across the landscape, enhancing access across the challenging topography. Near the top right of the image, there appears to be a body of water, potentially a small lake or a reservoir, which reflects the surrounding bare earth.\n\nThe backdrop of this scene is dominated by a soft blue sky with few visible clouds, giving a clear view of the entire area. This expansive view suggests the photograph was taken from an elevated perspective or an aerial vantage point, providing a comprehensive overview of the human impact on this natural landscape.","title":"Western energy strip mine and spoil piles, south of Colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["554804","550574","544418","549180","544498","555812","552422","554815","549255","555610","554817","552004","555865","555594","545533","543868"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["plateau","formation","earth","terrace","reservoir","excavate","overview","dig","usage","midst"]}
