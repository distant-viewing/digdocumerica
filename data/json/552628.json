{"path":"552628.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"In the photograph, an elderly man is seated at a dining table, smiling warmly towards the camera. He has silver hair and is dressed in a black sweater over a patterned shirt. His left arm is resting on the table, and he appears relaxed and content.\n\nThe table itself is covered with a partially completed puzzle, which depicts a colorful, scenic picture of what appears to be a nature landscape. Several puzzle pieces are laid out on the table, still unassembled.\n\nThe room has a simple and cozy ambiance. To the far left, there's a lamp on a stand, casting a soft glow. Above the man, on the wall, is a framed picture or photograph. There's also a small stack of books or boxes near the lamp, adding to the lived-in feel of the space.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a tranquil domestic scene, focusing on the elderly man's engaging expression and the leisurely activity of puzzle assembly, suggesting a moment of relaxation and enjoyment in his home environment.","title":"The E.
