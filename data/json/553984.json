{"path":"553984.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of an old, weathered wagon wheel. The wheel is predominantly wooden with a dark, rusty metal rim. It features wooden spokes that connect to a central hub, which is also metal and painted red, though much of the paint is chipped and faded, exposing rust underneath. Several of the wooden spokes show signs of wear and damage, with splintered ends and chips.\n\nThe wheel is partially sunk into the ground, surrounded by dry grass and bits of straw, suggesting it may have been abandoned in a field or a similarly rustic setting. The lighting in the image is subdued, with soft shadows, indicating either an overcast day or late afternoon, which adds a melancholic and somewhat nostalgic atmosphere to the scene. The background is blurred but consists of more dry grass and perhaps the edges of other agricultural equipment or debris, although details are indistinct, keeping the focus tightly on the wheel itself. This photograph captures a sense of forgotten history and the relentless passage of time.","title":"Remains of abandoned wagon rest beside road on the \"Pineapple Island.\" 95 per cent of Lanai is owned by Castle and Cooke (formerly Dole Pineapple).
