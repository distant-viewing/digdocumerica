{"path":"545903.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic desert landscape under a dramatic cloudy sky. In the foreground, there's a prominent, spindly ocotillo plant which is leafless with few flower buds at the tips of its branches, suggesting this might be either early spring or late winter. The plant adds a poignant textural contrast to the softer, rounded shapes of the clouds.\n\nThe middleground of the image spreads out into an expansive desert scrubland dotted with small bushes and sparse vegetation, indicative of arid conditions. This part of the scene is gently undulating, with the ground composed of rocks and sand.\n\nIn the distance, there are several distinct butte-like landforms which rise prominently against the horizon. The closest one is relatively rounded and dome-like, while others in the far distance appear flatter on top. The mountains contribute to a rugged silhouette against the sky.\n\nThe sky itself is dynamically filled with voluminous clouds, ranging from thick cumulus forms to wispy, streaky formations higher up. The clouds are dramatically lit, suggesting that the sun is hidden or partially covered, giving a moody and vivid overhead scene.\n\nOverall, this photograph captures the stark beauty and dramatic atmosphere typical of Southwestern desert landscapes, showcasing both the rugged terrain and the often-dynamic skies that characterize this climate and region. The scenery is devoid of human presence, emphasizing a sense of isolation and the enduring natural environment.","title":"Storm moving in over desert","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["549132","545771","545790","549183","548673","544016","544027","544429","544400","545754","544887","545895","544034","545789","544401","544376"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["desert","butte","cloud","cumulus","like","bud","hide","landform","endure","dome"]}
