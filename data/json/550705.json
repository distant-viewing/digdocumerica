{"path":"550705.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This image is an aerial view of a mist-covered town located beside a sweeping river. The composition beautifully captures the interaction between human habitation and natural landscape under the effects of possibly early morning mist or fog.\n\nStarting from the foreground, a long road flanked by trees runs parallel to the river, with a few scattered buildings noticeable along its length. Beside the road, parallel to it, lies the river, which appears dark and is reflective, hinting at its calm surface. On the opposite side of the river, there is a densely built-up area where the layout of the town is visible. The buildings are small and closely packed, representing a typical rural town setup. \n\nThe main body of the town extends along the river's curve and is enveloped partially in a layer of mist, which adds a mystic quality to the scene and obscures certain details of the town. The dense forest surrounding the town and along the rolling hills in the background emphasizes the town's seclusion and the predominance of nature in the region. The hills rise in the distance under a somewhat cloudy sky, completing a picturesque and serene landscape.\n\nThe colors in the photo are slightly muted, with earthy tones and shades of blue and green dominating, reflecting an overcast weather scenario. The overall effect is quiet, peaceful, and slightly solemn, hinting at a cool climate and possibly an early morning hour when this photograph was taken.","title":"Rumford and the Androscoggin River seen from the air emission comes from the chimneys of the Oxford Paper Mill just west of the town.","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["556425","552837","556985","557561","555536","557025","554647","556964","550560","552597","545140","557014","552318","554629","557091","557239"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["town","mist","river","dominating","effect","morning","seclusion","hill","fog","scenario"]}
