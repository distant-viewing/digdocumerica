{"path":"546720.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph you provided depicts an aerial view of a busy multi-lane highway winding through a lush, green landscape. One can clearly see that the highway is divided, with each direction consisting of multiple lanes that are crowded with numerous vehicles. The vehicular traffic is dense, indicating either rush hour or possibly a traffic jam.\n\nThe roadway itself curves elegantly through the scene, surrounded by dense trees and partially bordered by smaller, local roads and pathways. The surrounding area includes patches of green fields and darker forested areas, which suggest a semi-rural setting near or around areas of habitation.\n\nIn the far background, building structures are vaguely visible, nestled amid the tree cover, probably indicating residential zones or perhaps institutions. The overall atmosphere is typical of a highway scene viewed from a height, marked by the natural scenery contrasted with human-made transportation infrastructure. There's a body of water, possibly a river, reflecting light and running parallel to a section of the highway, enhancing the scenic beauty of the photograph.","title":"Looking south from Beltway bridge over the Potomac River, the Capital Beltway, circling the Virginia-Maryland suburbs, provides high-speed access to points in the District.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546603","546587","546733","546714","546571","546686","546721","546713","546607","546711","546583","546734","548391","552719","546612","546725"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["highway","traffic","institution","jam","rush","habitation","roadway","hour","lane","cover"]}
