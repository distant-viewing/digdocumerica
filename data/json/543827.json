{"path":"543827.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene and majestic natural landscape featuring a range of snow-capped mountains. The mountains are partially enshrouded by clouds, giving the scene an ethereal look. In the foreground, there are layers of vegetation that provide a contrast to the rugged mountains. The lower tier includes a dense forest of bare, thin tree trunks, likely aspens, which suggest early spring or late autumn as trees are without leaves. Above this forested area, there's a rolling hill covered partially in green, possibly grass, and partially in shades of brown, indicating sparse vegetation or possibly fall colors. On top of this hill, small, indistinct structures are visible, possibly houses or barns, suggesting some human presence in this otherwise natural setting. The overall composition creates a sense of depth, from the dense, dark forest in the front, over the textured midground hill, up to the stark, snow-covered mountains and the soft clouds wrapping around them. This serene yet dramatic natural environment is rich in texture and natural color contrasts.","title":"Dallas divide","placename":"Colorado","location":"Colorado","nn1":["544936","550415","554398","555660","544866","543582","552173","552144","554402","553811","542923","550628","555681","550516","543569","550609"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["mountain","snow","tier","forest","cloud","wrap","rolling","dense","barn","rugged"]}
