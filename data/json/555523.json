{"path":"555523.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a woman caring for plants on a high-rise balcony in an urban environment. The woman, centrally placed in the frame, wears a red short-sleeved top and blue jeans. She is watering white flowers using a yellow watering can on a sunny day. The scene is set on a balcony with red flooring that stretches across the photograph, and the railing is adorned with multiple planters filled with blooming flowers.\n\nThe balcony is furnished with a small, round table and at least one chair, suggesting a space also used for relaxation or possibly dining. Garden tools and additional watering cans are visible, arranged neatly on the balcony.\n\nIn the background, a perspective of a bustling cityscape with various buildings including residential structures and skyscrapers can be seen under a clear blue sky. The balcony overlooks other high-rise buildings and a busy street beneath, hinting at a dense, possibly downtown, urban area.\n\nThe combination of vibrant flowers and garden equipment with an expansive city backdrop creates a contrast between a personal, serene gardening space and the surrounding urban environment. This setting is evocative of city dwellers creating personal green spaces amidst concrete surroundings.","title":"Apartment terrace garden of a family at 170 West End Avenue in New York City","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["555522","551625","551705","551627","551780","551626","551701","551755","551628","551685","551490","551748","551743","551620","550055","557266"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["balcony","flower","garden","rise","dweller","space","flooring","planter","round","gardening"]}
