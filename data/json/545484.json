{"path":"545484.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph depicts two men engaged in conversation while sitting inside a church. The two individuals are seated within a pew that faces forward toward the altar. The man on the left is bald and wears dark sunglasses and a dark suit, whereas the man on the right, partially facing the viewer, sports glasses and a dark suit as well.\n\nThe church setting features wooden pews filled with congregants primarily dressed in formal attire. In the distance, the altar is subtly visible, and there is a choir assembled in white robes, concentrating on their performance. Above the choir, a large stained glass window, predominantly blue in color, allows natural light into the spacious, softly lit interior, assisting in creating a serene and hallowed atmosphere. The focus and positioning of the men in the foreground suggest a moment of private conversation or reflection amidst a larger group setting, possibly during a service or community event. The overall mood conveyed by the lighting and the activities is one of contemplation and communal engagement.","title":"Sixth avenue baptist church","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["558404","556450","552623","545377","558388","558400","558407","558406","558239","556238","558383","556234","558389","545381","558401","558391"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["altar","pew","church","suit","conversation","assemble","man","glass","positioning","concentrate"]}
