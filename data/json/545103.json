{"path":"545103.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph portrays an individual standing on a muddy shoreline, enveloped in a misty, atmospheric setting. This person, a young man, appears pensive and is potentially engaged in an activity, as he is looking down towards his hands, holding what appears to be a musical instrument, possibly a ukulele or small guitar.\n\nDressed in a dark jacket, blue jeans, and barefoot, the man's casual attire suggests a moment of leisure or informal exploration. The setting is tranquil and seemingly remote, with fog obscuring much of the landscape, enhancing a sense of isolation and quietude.\n\nIn the background, there is a body of water with wooden stakes protruding in a pattern, possibly part of an old dock or a related structure. Flanking this aquatic feature are thick woods, similarly shrouded in fog, which contributes to the eerie and serene mood of the environment. \n\nOn the ground, there is a mix of wet soil, rocks, and scattered debris, including what appears to be a black, box-like object nearby, further adding to the untamed nature of the scenery. The overall color palette is subdued, dominated by grays and muted greens, reflecting the cool, damp atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Environmentalist Paul Heikkila experiments with growing European and Olympia","placename":"Newport (Or.)","location":"Newport, Oregon","nn1":["550826","550268","545095","542556","552289","553341","545940","549012","543078","552306","552288","542976","543461","552290","542886","542887"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["fog","stake","guitar","quietude","instrument","shroud","protrude","envelop","box","scenery"]}
