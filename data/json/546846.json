{"path":"546846.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This image captures a dense grouping of dead fish floating on the surface of a dark water body. The fish, mostly pale with darker backs, appear tightly packed together, with some partially submerged while others are fully on the surface. The texture of the water is disrupted by the mass of fish and further agitated by smaller splashes and wavelets, hinting at recent disturbances.\n\nA small, rectangular item with what seems to be a red label or a patch — possibly a piece of debris or a marker — is visible among the fish, slightly off-center towards the left side of the photograph. This object contrasts with the natural appearance of the scene.\n\nThe backdrop and surroundings are not clearly visible due to the close-up focus on the water and fish, suggesting the primary emphasis of the image is on the phenomenon of these aquatic creatures. The mood conveyed is somewhat somber and could relate to environmental or ecological issues, highlighting an event like a fish die-off.","title":"Dead menhaden floating along the tide line just north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["546930","555560","547704","546784","547687","546782","546792","542985","546898","546779","547737","552067","550878","545063","546185","548142"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["fish","off","die","grouping","phenomenon","creature","mass","disrupt","marker","disturbance"]}
