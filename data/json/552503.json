{"path":"552503.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph showcases a dense, expansive field of small yellow flowers, likely a variety of wildflower or perhaps mustard plants, set against a somewhat indistinct background. The flowers dominate the view and exhibit a multitude of small, rounded yellow blossoms clustered atop thin, delicate green stems, interspersed with small green leaves. The stems appear lightly crowded, forming a thick carpet of green and yellow hues.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred due to the depth of field focus on the flowers, subtly suggesting more vegetation and a continuation of the floral spread without distinct features. The light appears natural, suggesting daytime, and enhances the vibrancy of the yellow flowers. There are no visible structures, people, or animals in the image; the focus is purely on the natural flora. The overall mood conveyed is peaceful and natural, emphasizing the beauty of a wildflower field in bloom.","title":"Field","placename":"Abingdon (Ill.)","location":"Abingdon, Illinois","nn1":["542704","550781","542641","544443","544574","544439","543596","542645","553076","557098","549158","548027","543206","544938","547642","545723"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","stem","wildflower","field","mustard","blossom","carpet","continuation","multitude","spread"]}
