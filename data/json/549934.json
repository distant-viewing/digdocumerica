{"path":"549934.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling scene on a body of water, likely a river or a bay, populated with numerous boats and recreational activities. The image shows a variety of boats, such as cabin cruisers and sailboats, densely packed in the water. There are several small motorboats, and some have open seating areas where people are visible. The photo includes individuals engaging in different leisure activities: some are swimming, others are on small inflatable rafts or kayaks, and a few appear to be diving or jumping into the water.\n\nThe backdrop consists of a hilly landscape dotted with houses and trees, suggesting that this may be a popular recreational or residential area near a large body of water. The sky is slightly hazy, which might be indicative of warm, humid weatherâ€”typical for a summer day filled with outdoor activities.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph conveys a sense of lively outdoor recreation and social gathering, with people enjoying the water and the company of each other in a scenic natural setting.","title":"Pleasure boats anchored in cove of Hudson River","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["549939","546856","546955","552316","548078","544006","543943","544021","544002","549088","551208","548736","543994","551218","554683","555718"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["cruiser","kayak","raft","water","motorboat","boat","seating","company","recreation","bay"]}
