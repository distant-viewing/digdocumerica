{"path":"542821.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This image appears to be an aerial view of a rugged landscape, possibly a forested mountainous area with various natural features visible. The image's orientation and perspective provide a top-down view which showcases the diverse topography and vegetation density.\n\nThe most prominent feature in the photograph is a dense, dark area that could be a forest or woodland. This area has a rich, dark brown and black coloration, suggesting it might be dense with trees and underbrush. The texture in this portion suggests that the foliage is thick and possibly mixed with areas of shadow, possibly due to the angle of sunlight or cloud cover.\n\nInterrupting the forested areas are lighter, irregular patches. These patches are likely snow or exposed rock areas, providing a stark contrast to the dark tones of the vegetation. The snow patches vary in size and shape, and their irregular patterns suggest that they are melting or sporadically distributed across higher elevations.\n\nThere is a visible curving line that seems to be a road or a trail cutting through part of the forest. This human-made feature snakes through the terrain, bordered on both sides by dark vegetation, indicating it might be a path used for vehicular access or hiking.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph conveys a remote, rugged, and natural environment, potentially useful for studying natural patterns, forestry, or environmental changes over time. The absence of any buildings or clear human settlements suggests the area is either uninhabited or only sparsely so, with the main focus being on natural landscapes.","title":"\"Clear cutting\"","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550540","553564","553568","550596","550538","555677","550642","556920","543772","557003","550643","550510","542836","550578","550629","543521"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["forest","snow","patch","melt","interrupt","orientation","vegetation","distribute","forestry","area"]}
