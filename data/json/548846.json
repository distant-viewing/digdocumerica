{"path":"548846.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph features a circular, white, hand-painted sign mounted on a dark post. The sign has irregular edges and shows signs of weathering with chips and scratches visible, revealing its exposure to elements. It bears the hand-painted black text \"NO TRESPES PRIVET PROPERTY NO FISHING ALLOW KEEP OUT\". The text has misspellings and untraditional abbreviation, which suggest a non-formal effort probably made by a private individual rather than an official entity.\n\nThe background of the sign is slightly blurred and features a natural, outdoor setting, likely a sandy terrain with footprints scattered throughout, indicating frequent activity or traffic in the area. The lighting in the photograph is bright, suggesting it was taken during daylight and provides a crisp detail to the forefront – the sign – while softly fading out the details of the sandy background.","title":"Sign along the Colorado River--misspelled but clear","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548836","548845","554103","544228","557441","547910","554001","543168","554038","549129","547123","557551","552076","544245","552084","557474"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","entity","text","scratch","chip","footprint","hand","detail","property","exposure"]}
