{"path":"548372.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph depicts a narrow urban alley scene with two men engaged in different activities. The setting appears slightly cluttered and is characteristic of an older city environment.\n\nOne man, located at the center of the frame, stands smiling at the camera. He is wearing a red polo shirt, light gray trousers, and a dark cap. He seems to be holding a shotgun casually in one hand, which adds an unexpected element to the scene. His posture and facial expression suggest he is in a jovial mood, and he is leaning against a makeshift barricade or railing.\n\nThe second man is on the right-hand side, at a slightly lower level (perhaps on the street or in a sort of pit), and his activity contrasts starkly with the other man. He is wearing a dark shirt and a lighter colored bucket hat, and he is deeply engaged in some kind of manual work. The area around him is cluttered with various objects like wood planks, a metal canister, and other debris, suggesting he might be fixing something or going through discarded items.\n\nThe background reveals a narrow passage between old brick buildings, typical of congested urban spaces. Metal railings and steps leading to doorways suggest residential access points alongside the alley. The scene captures a moment of daily life that hints at the social and economic undertones of the urban setting. The juxtaposition of leisure and labor underlines the complexity of urban social dynamics.","title":"Alley in harlem","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["545343","552971","549297","552969","551463","545315","545348","555909","546445","556220","548371","556177","545511","545546","556153","546551"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["alley","canister","undertone","barricade","polo","fix","man","pit","dynamic","go"]}
