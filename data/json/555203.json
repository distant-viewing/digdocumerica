{"path":"555203.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts a complex network of tree roots exposed against a dark earthy background. The roots are predominantly white and gray, creating a stark contrast with the dark brown soil. They twist and intertwine in intricate patterns, sprawling across the frame in various directions. The interplay of light and shadow accentuates the textures and contours of the roots, emphasizing their gnarled and weathered appearance. The image focuses solely on this natural detail, without any visible sky, horizon, or other elements that might provide context. This close-up view gives a sense of the intimate and chaotic beauty found in natural decay or the aftermath of environmental events that expose such root systems.","title":"Erosion lays bare tree roots in olympic national timberland Washington.
