{"path":"549159.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph showcases an old, dilapidated building located in an expansive grassy field under a blue sky with some clouds. The building appears to be constructed from wood and is painted white, though much of the paint is peeling, revealing the weathered wood beneath. Notably, one side of the building is covered with graffiti that reads: “BAN STRIPMINING KEEP SCARY [unreadable] RD OF WESTMORLANG GREEN AND MOORE”. \n\nThe main visible side of the building features a brick chimney that protrudes from the middle of the roof, suggesting it was once used as a residence or a facility requiring heat. The structure has a sloping roof and is surrounded by a few scattered trees, hinting at a rural or semi-rural setting.\n\nThe field around the building shows signs of being overgrown, with tall grasses and weeds, indicating that the area is not regularly maintained. The overall atmosphere is one of neglect and abandonment, highlighted by the political or environmental activism message painted on its side.","title":"Graffiti on abandoned school house states opposition to strip-mining near sarpy basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549160","554707","554785","543344","557344","543171","552455","547985","553548","551330","552515","551111","544820","549221","543339","552494"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["paint","activism","building","wood","residence","weed","heat","graffiti","field","require"]}
