{"path":"556462.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural landscape, likely taken from an elevated vantage point on a hill or mountain, looking down into a valley. The scene features a narrow road winding its way through the valley, lined on both sides by lush greenery, indicative of a verdant, forested area.\n\nThere are several houses dotted along the road, with varying designs and sizes. Some houses appear to be single-story constructions, predominantly white in color, with pitched roofs. These homes are spread out, not closely packed, allowing for ample yard space around each structure. Adjacent to some of these residences are smaller outbuildings, possibly garages or storage sheds.\n\nThe environment is predominantly green with dense patches of trees surrounding the houses and cloaking the hills in the background. The foliage suggests a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees, signifying a diversity of plant life typical of a temperate climate.\n\nThe overall setting conveys a peaceful rural life, somewhat isolated and nestled within a natural wooded landscape. There are no visible people or moving vehicles, which contributes to the stillness and quietude of the scene. The photograph evokes a sense of simplicity and a close connection to the natural environment.","title":"Road leading through red jacket, West Virginia, near Logan much of the town originally was owned by the island creek coal company, but is in the process of being sold to private ownership the old image of the coal company town is giving way as attitudes change.
