{"path":"550136.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph features an urban street scene focused on a somewhat worn-looking storefront with large, distinct signage reading \"SAM'S\" above and additional signs indicating the nature of the business, including \"GOLF,\" \"MONEY LOANS,\" and advertisements for \"WATCHES DIOMONDS.\" The two main window displays, although partially darkened or obscured, have varied items faintly visible, and one prominently features a sign with \"Mr. Conservative Dinner '72.\" \n\nOn the right side of the frame, a man is walking past the store. He is dressed formally in a suit and is carrying a briefcase, suggesting he might be on his way to or from work. His facial expression is not clearly visible, but his posture and pace imply purpose and possibly haste. \n\nThe ground on which the man walks casts long shadows indicating that the photo was taken either in early morning or late afternoon, typical times for longer shadows due to the angle of the sun. The quality of light suggests a clear day. The presence of the parking meter on the sidewalk adds to the urban character of the scene. \n\nThe composition uses the play of light and shadow effectively, with the man partially illuminated by sunlight, which contrasts with the shaded facade of the store. This contrast adds a dramatic touch to the everyday scene, emphasizing a moment in time within the context of city life.","title":"'Hard-to-miss pawn shop'","placename":"Cleveland (Ohio)","location":"Cleveland, Ohio","nn1":["550130","545368","546419","550114","546672","546034","547816","547820","556733","556328","550132","545333","550127","547310","550118","546097"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["store","golf","briefcase","meter","pace","walk","shadow","storefront","darken","time"]}
