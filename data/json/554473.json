{"path":"554473.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene twilight scene featuring a silhouette of a person and a dog in a canoe on a calm lake. The setting sun casts a soft, gradient sky transitioning from a deep blue at the top to a warm pink and light yellow near the horizon. The forest in the background is also in silhouette, indicating dense, bushy trees typical of a boreal or temperate woodland.\n\nThe canoe is positioned almost horizontally across the frame, slightly off-center towards the right, and is partially submerged in the tranquil water, creating a clear reflection. The person, presumably paddling, is seated towards the rear of the canoe, while the dog is in the front, both appearing calm and possibly enjoying the peacefulness of the scene.\n\nThis scene conveys a quiet moment of harmony with nature, emphasizing themes of tranquility, companionship, and the beauty of simple outdoor activities at dusk. The reflection of the canoe and its occupants on the smooth surface of the lake enhances the tranquil and almost symmetrical aesthetic of the photograph.","title":"Canoe on the North Branch of Moose River at sunset, below Rondaxe Lake in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554474","551280","547550","550822","554609","544031","549716","554404","547230","554397","550771","551214","550768","547245","552124","550674"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["canoe","dog","reflection","silhouette","lake","harmony","companionship","occupant","pink","woodland"]}
