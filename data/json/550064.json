{"path":"550064.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"The photograph depicts a bustling outdoor market scene set against a backdrop of modern mid-century buildings. A large crowd of people from diverse ages and styles are seen browsing through multiple stalls filled with fresh produce. \n\nIn the foreground, there are fresh green beans and other vegetables like peppers and tomatoes prominently displayed on market tables, likely to attract the attention of shoppers. The stalls are sheltered under different colored umbrellas or canopies, providing some shade for the vendors and their goods.\n\nMarket visitors include men and women dressed in a variety of clothing styles, from casual to more formal. Their attire suggests the image dates back to the mid-1900s. One man in the foreground, noticeable by his bald head and darker suit, is particularly focused on examining the tomatoes.\n\nThe background features high-rise buildings characteristic of mid-20th-century architectural styles. These buildings are mostly office towers with large windows, adding to the urban setting of the market. The blue sky indicates good weather, enhancing the vibrant and dynamic atmosphere of the market scene. Festive decorations are also visible strung across above the market, possibly indicating a special event or holiday period. The entire scene illustrates a typical day at a lively urban market, capturing a slice of city life during that era.","title":"Haymarket square - site of Boston's popular outdoor market","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["550040","551837","550036","550045","550032","551838","551749","550061","557131","550041","556211","546216","551691","557135","550028","551699"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["market","tomato","stall","shopper","vegetable","pepper","style","browse","holiday","string"]}
