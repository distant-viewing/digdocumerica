{"path":"548533.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant beach scene centered around a wooden pier. In the foreground, a woman and a man are lying on towels directly on the pier, sunbathing. The woman is wearing a two-piece bathing suit and sunglasses while the man is shirtless, wearing swimming trunks. \n\nThe mid-ground features several people engaged in various activities. On the left part of the pier, two people are sitting while talking to each other. Further along the pier, individuals are sunbathing; some are seated while others are reclined. There's a diving platform at the end of the pier where a few people are standing, presumably preparing to jump into the water.\n\nOn the right side of the pier, two individuals are standing, facing towards the camera. One of them, possibly a lifeguard or attendant, is poised with hands on hips, observing the area. People are visibly engaged in leisurely activities such as swimming, with one person floating on a tube in the water. \n\nThe background shows the open sea that extends to the horizon under a clear blue sky. The overall atmosphere of the picture reflects a typical sunny day at the beach, full of relaxation and recreational activities. The attire and styles suggest the photograph might be dated around the mid-20th century, giving it a vintage feel.","title":"Tourists and residents enjoy the southernmost swimming pier of the United States.","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["550243","546794","547503","550930","548529","546768","547507","547491","553683","548541","550929","547628","546874","557772","550936","547680"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["pier","swimming","beach","sunbathing","attendant","diving","jump","recline","sunbathe","hip"]}
