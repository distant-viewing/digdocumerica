{"path":"542593.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a striking large building nestled amidst lush green forested hills. The building, prominent in the foreground, appears to be a multi-story structure with three visible levels, painted in a light, possibly beige or pale yellow color. There are many symmetrically placed windows spanning across all floors. The architecture suggests a formal, possibly institutional style, typical of early 20th-century designs, which often features in educational or governmental buildings.\n\nThe surrounding environment is densely forested, featuring mainly coniferous trees. Rising steeply behind the building are forest-covered hills, which lead to a rocky mountainous backdrop that suggests this complex is situated in a mountainous region, possibly within a national park or similar protected area. The trees are a deep, vibrant green, indicating that the photo was taken during a season where the trees are lush and fully-leaved.\n\nIn the background, to the right side, there is a zigzagging path or road leading upwards into the mountains. This adds a sense of depth and activity to the scene, indicating pathways or access routes that might be used for hiking or access to other parts of this area.\n\nThe sky above the scene is clear and blue, suggesting a sunny day without any visible clouds, which contributes to the vibrancy of the natural colors in the photograph. This setting communicates a serene, secluded atmosphere, likely chosen for its tranquility and the natural beauty surrounding it.","title":"Southern California edison plant","placename":"Big Creek (Calif.)","location":"Big Creek, California","nn1":["546460","543587","549360","546464","543580","546702","548866","558056","546542","546473","546463","546456","544503","546534","546480","546472"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["access","forest","zigzag","choose","lead","hiking","building","communicate","hill","vibrancy"]}
