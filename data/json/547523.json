{"path":"547523.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph depicts a largely barren, muddy landscape dominated by deep ruts and tracks, suggesting heavy vehicle movement, likely from construction or excavation machinery. The scene is marked by a mix of mud, puddles, and scattered debris, including branches and rocks. There is a noticeable absence of vegetation, reinforcing the notion of recent significant disruption to the land.\n\nIn the background, the terrain continues to appear uneven and dug up, extending towards the horizon under a clear sky. Notably, there's a small red truck partially visible in the upper middle part of the image, positioned on what appears to be a dirt embankment or road. This truck provides a sense of scale, emphasizing the expansiveness and roughened condition of the landscape. The overall composition and elements in the image convey a raw, industrial feel, likely documenting a phase of construction or land clearing.","title":"Land development at point judith","placename":"Newport (R.I.)","location":"Newport, Rhode Island","nn1":["547979","549205","555882","545677","543112","552004","549180","552814","547591","552584","548807","543785","545533","547254","556456","549255"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["notion","truck","phase","expansiveness","embankment","construction","disruption","land","dig","puddle"]}
