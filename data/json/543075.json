{"path":"543075.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a hauntingly serene coastal scene, dominated by the intriguing forms of a large, weathered driftwood log in the foreground. The image has a moody, almost Gothic quality, emphasized by the dusky, purplish tones that permeate the scene.\n\nThe driftwood, heavily textured and gnarled, features large holes that resemble eye sockets, giving it an almost skeletal appearance. It rests on a sandy beach that looks smooth and damp, likely from a recent tide, which adds a reflective quality to the surface.\n\nBeyond the foreground, the beach leads into an array of scattered rocks that protrude from the sand, gradually leading out to the ocean. Several of these rocks are quite large, and their irregular shapes help to create a natural pathway leading the eye towards the sea.\n\nIn the background, the coast curves inward, flanked by steep, tree-covered cliffs that add a dramatic backdrop to the scene. The ocean itself is calm, stretching out into a hazy horizon where it meets a muted sky. There are small indistinct features that could be distant rocks or islets barely visible in the misty ocean expanse.\n\nOverall, the composition and color palette of this photograph convey a sense of solitude and the timeless interplay between land and sea. The setting appears isolated and tranquil, with the elements of nature quietly commanding the scene.","title":"Driftwood assumes fantastic shapes","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["542889","542886","542888","542887","542884","543069","543081","543078","543054","543052","542890","545111","544989","543068","542973","546961"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["driftwood","lead","rock","ocean","beach","islet","permeate","sea","command","hole"]}
