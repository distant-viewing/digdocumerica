{"path":"544426.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures an evocative rural scene of sheep herding. In the foreground, a child shepherd, partially turned away from the viewer, is moving briskly through the landscape. The child is dressed in traditional attire with a noticeable purple skirt and a red hat, and is accompanied by a border collie, suggesting a working relationship as they herd sheep.\n\nThe backdrop is a sparse, grassy plain that stretches widely across the frame, indicating a vast, open terrain typical of pastoral settings. Several sheep are scattered in the midground, grazing calmly under the expansive sky. The natural, subdued colors of the terrain—browns and soft greens—contrast with the brighter colors worn by the child, drawing attention to the human element in the rural landscape.\n\nThe image conveys a sense of isolation and the enormity of the natural environment, juxtaposed with the youth and energy of the shepherd and the dog. This scene illustrates a moment in daily rural life, emphasizing themes of nature, work, and tradition.","title":"Navajo herder and flocks struggle to find pasturage in arid land.
