{"path":"543274.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a large group of sea lions lounging on a rocky breakwater. The breakwater is composed of large, unevenly shaped stones, and extends diagonally from the foreground into the background towards the left side of the frame, partially submerged at points where it meets the calm blue water. The sea lions, varying in shades of brown and black, are seen in various poses: some are resting, others seem more alert, and a few appear to be interacting with each other. Throughout the breakwater, the sea lions take up most visible surfaces of the rocks.\n\nThe environment around the sea lions is natural and aquatic, with the ocean surrounding the rocky structure. In the background, the horizon line is visible with a clear blue sky meeting the darker blue of the ocean. A couple of seabirds are also visible; they are perched on the rocks among the sea lions, adding to the diverse wildlife scene captured in the photograph. The overall atmosphere is one of a busy, but peaceful, wildlife habitat.","title":"Seals on the rocks","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543272","543275","543280","553768","543263","549338","549353","543281","543278","547486","543139","545130","545122","543492","544500","545126"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["breakwater","sea","wildlife","ocean","rock","pose","habitat","couple","brown","stone"]}
