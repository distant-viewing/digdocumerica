{"path":"555233.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside what appears to be an office or a workspace, taken in a softly lit indoor environment. Three men are focused on various tasks, suggesting a setting of professional collaboration or a meeting.\n\nThe man on the left is seated and is listening or speaking to the man standing in the middle, who is leaning slightly over a table, pointing at a book or a document. This man in the middle is dressed in a dark suit and appears to be explaining something or discussing the content of the book.\n\nThe third man, located on the right side of the image, is seated behind the desk cluttered with various items including textbooks, papers, a calculator, and other small office supplies. He is looking down, possibly checking a document or making calculations, and appears engaged in his own task, slightly separated from the conversation happening to his left.\n\nThe office is lined with shelves full of books and jars, and there are several wall hangings that include maps and charts, which suggests this might be a technical or academic environment. The walls and furniture are typical of a mid-to-late 20th-century setting, providing a somewhat dated feel to the workspace. The setting is practical and no-nonsense, dedicated entirely to the task at hand without any personal decorative items visible. The lighting is dim, likely artificial, enhancing the sense of a serious, enclosed workspace.","title":"Environmental Protection Agency pesticides inspectors present themselves to a vice-president of the Valley Chemical Company, Greenville, Mississippi, before making a routine periodic inspection.","placename":"Mississippi","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555234","555247","557037","556383","552392","548237","552388","552616","557038","555290","546299","551897","547368","552387","551899","557682"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["workspace","book","office","document","task","man","collaboration","chart","jar","middle"]}
