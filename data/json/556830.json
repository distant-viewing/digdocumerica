The Amtrak passenger train leaves the station daily at 4 p.m. on its way to Washington, D.C., and New York City with stops in between. The train splits at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, early the following morning with one section going to New York, the other to Washington. The train has a history of not maintaining the schedule. Amtrak blames it on the poor upkeep of tracks it leases from the nation's railroads.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556091","556041","556093","555981","557909","556760","556827","555985","556074","556042","556678","556026","556044","555967","556706","556673"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","platform","woman","travel","station","arrival","footwear","departure","era","sandal"]}
