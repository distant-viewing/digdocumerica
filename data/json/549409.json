{"path":"549409.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a moment of sailing activity on a vibrant and somewhat choppy sea. It shows a sailboat at a tilted angle, indicating it is under way and possibly maneuvering or adjusting to wind conditions. The sailboat has a clean, white hull and is equipped with a white mainsail that is fully deployed. One individual, dressed in white attire, can be seen standing near the bow of the sailboat, looking out over the water. This person appears to be actively involved in sailing or possibly navigating.\n\nThe background reveals a blue, open sea that merges with a slightly lighter sky at the horizon. A few other sailboats are visible at a distance, showing a scene likely set during a regatta or a common sailing outing. The water around the featured sailboat shows movement and ripples consistent with a breezy day. The overall composition emphasizes action and the enjoyment of sailing, with a sense of tranquility and vastness given by the ocean expanse around.","title":"Chesapeake Bay","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549405","547463","549394","549392","549393","549404","549421","549426","549403","548526","548513","547456","544667","549388","549406","549386"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["sailboat","sailing","regatta","sea","bow","outing","hull","enjoyment","wind","way"]}
