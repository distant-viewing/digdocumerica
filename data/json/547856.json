{"path":"547856.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures the scene at a fish market stall. The image prominently features an elderly man, standing behind a counter where an assortment of fish is displayed for sale. The fish are laid out on oval-shaped metallic trays, and behind the trays, a scale is hanging, suggesting the weighing of purchases. The man, probably the vendor, is dressed in a plaid shirt, glasses, and appears to be wearing a wristwatch. He looks out from the stall with a neutral expression. \n\nThe market stall has a rustic and aged look, with its white paint chipping off around the edges of the service window. There are various objects visible inside the booth such as more scales, some food packaging, and other unidentified items, giving a somewhat cluttered appearance. The setup appears to be quite traditional and modest, providing a feel of a local, possibly seaside market environment where fresh fish are sold directly by local fishermen or vendors. The lighting in the photograph is natural, brightening the forefront while casting shadows within the interior of the stall, thereby creating a strong contrast that draws attention primarily to the fish and the vendor.","title":"Sheepshead Bay fish store","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["550320","554098","554095","550297","554093","548297","547848","552810","554945","551832","545284","545951","545274","550040","544995","543219"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["stall","fish","vendor","market","tray","packaging","wristwatch","brighten","fisherman","purchase"]}
