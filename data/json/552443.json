{"path":"552443.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph showcases a landscape featuring a striking conical hill or small mountain, with distinctly streaked red and beige colors enhancing its rugged appearance. The foreground consists of a tranquil body of water that reflects part of the hill, complementing the natural vista. Notably, a discarded tire is prominently positioned at the water's edge in the foreground, submerged partially in the water among other debris such as dried plant stalks and weeds, indicating environmental neglect.\n\nBeyond the water, the middle ground blends gently into the base of the vibrant hill, interspersed with sparse vegetation. The scene is framed under a clear blue sky, emphasizing the vibrancy and contrast of the hill against the surrounding landscape. Overall, the image juxtaposes natural beauty with a hint of human impact, conveyed through the presence of the abandoned tire.","title":"Mountain of clay and shale marks site of an abandoned deep mine near the town of standard","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["544042","543552","544174","549944","545534","547689","549179","547846","550353","551520","553038","545735","543600","550585","555594","555383"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["hill","tire","stalk","weed","vista","streak","vibrancy","water","dry","abandon"]}
