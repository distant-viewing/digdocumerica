{"path":"553441.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph shows a lively riverside scene on a sunny day. The image primarily captures families and groups of people enjoying the outdoors, engaging in various activities such as swimming and sunbathing. The foreground features a sandy riverbank where people of various ages are seen; some are in the water playing and splashing, while others relax on the sand, with towels and picnic items nearby.\n\nDominating the middle of the composition is a large willow tree, its sprawling branches creating a canopy that provides shade to some of the visitors beneath it. The river stretches horizontally across the photo, reflecting light and bordered by lush greenery on the opposite side.\n\nIn the background, a towering bridge with a steel structure extends across the full width of the image. This grand bridge is elevated high above the river and has vehicles visible on it, suggesting connectivity between different regions. The overall atmosphere of the photograph depicts a typical leisurely summer day where people have gathered to appreciate the water, weather, and company of each other.","title":"Here at Clinton, in the first quarter mile from its origin below the Wachusett Reservoir, the Nashua River is still safe for swimming. Beyond this point, up to its end at the Merrimack River in New Hampshire, the Nashua is polluted.","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["551499","545933","553439","550228","550232","551525","545941","557740","543943","548006","546811","557737","554475","543692","553436","543530"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["playing","sunbathing","bridge","connectivity","picnic","towel","people","width","swimming","company"]}
