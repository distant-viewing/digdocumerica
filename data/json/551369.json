{"path":"551369.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"The photograph depicts a single vibrant orange-yellow flower, likely a type of coneflower, with its petals drooping downward, finely silhouetted against a muted, light-colored background. The flower has a prominent dark, cone-shaped center and is seen in profile. It stands tall on a slender, upright stem. Below and in the foreground, there is a clump of dark, pointed green leaves, sharply contrasting with the soft and hazy setting.\n\nIn the background, more blurred images of similar flowers appear, suggesting a field or cluster of these flowers. However, these flowers are out of focus, creating a dreamlike quality and emphasizing the isolation and distinctness of the one sharp flower in the foreground. The color palette comprises mainly soft and pastel shades, contributing to the calm and tranquil feel of the image. This scene could be early morning or late evening, as suggested by the soft lighting and gentle hues.","title":"Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta) drooping now--at overlook of Horseshoe Bend","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["545699","555189","543596","545706","554840","555033","545695","544875","549230","542969","554580","555034","557167","551368","555186","550464"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","cone","clump","stem","petal","profile","cluster","evening","palette","isolation"]}
