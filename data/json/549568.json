{"path":"549568.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph portrays a vivid and bustling street parade scene involving multiple elephants and handlers. The image features a procession of elephants with at least four visible in the frame, each lavishly decorated with colorful costumes and headdresses, suggesting a celebratory or ceremonial occasion, possibly a circus or cultural festival.\n\nAt the forefront, the lead elephant is ridden by an individual dressed in an ornate blue and gold costume, suggesting a role of prominence, possibly a master of ceremonies or a notable figure within the context of the event. This elephant, which is significantly larger than others, also sports an elaborate headpiece and tusks adorned with jewelry.\n\nThe subsequent elephants are equally bedecked in vibrant cloths primarily in shades of red and gold, each accompanied by a handler dressed in a red uniform. The handlers march beside the elephants, maintaining order and guiding the animals through the parade route.\n\nThe setting is an urban street lined with traditional and modern buildings, including visible signage such as “Equitable Life Assurance Society” and various advertisements. The crowd of spectators, partially visible on the left, watches the procession under a clear blue sky, adding a communal atmosphere to the event. The scene captures a mix of excitement and tradition, set against the backdrop of a lively city environment.","title":"Vips--very important pachyderms--of the \"Old Milwaukee Days\" annual circus parade","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549566","549576","549580","549567","556274","549583","557712","549574","552653","552660","549581","552651","549577","556280","557710","553234"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["procession","costume","parade","gold","ceremony","jewelry","event","tradition","order","prominence"]}
