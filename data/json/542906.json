{"path":"542906.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene at a marina, focusing on a variety of boats moored at docks. Foreground prominently features an old boat with a weathered white and green hull, bearing the registration number \"CF 141248.\" The bow of the boat points towards the viewer, with ropes and nautical equipment such as nets and chains scattered over its surface. On the deck of this boat, a dog stands alert, looking towards the camera. The dog has a short, sleek coat which appears to be in shades of tan and black.\n\nThe background is filled with numerous masts of sailboats, towering skyward, indicating a bustling marina. These boats are tightly docked alongside each other, displaying different sizes and states of upkeep. The water is calm and the sky is clear and blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day. The overall setting suggests a busy, working marina, possibly focused on both fishing and recreational boating activities. The marina seems well-used with hints of rust and wear visible on the boats and equipment, telling tales of frequent use and exposure to the elements.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["542912","542871","543038","552028","542902","546877","546388","543247","548546","548075","548547","548535","548543","552027","542911","548078"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","boat","dog","dock","working","upkeep","registration","tell","boating","equipment"]}
