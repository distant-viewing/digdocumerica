{"path":"556095.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures the interior of a train carriage during what appears to be a daytime journey. The carriage is relatively full with passengers seated in a layout typical of modern trains, featuring rows of seats aligned in pairs on either side of a central aisle.\n\nThe seats are clothed in a subtle blue and reddish pattern, while the carpet lining the aisle is a solid deep blue, complementing the overall muted tones of the interior. Above the seats, there's an overhead storage area running the length of the carriage where passengers have placed various personal items like bags and wraps.\n\nThe passengers are diverse, each engaged in different activities which range from reading and looking out the window to resting. Notably, all the passengers visible are adults and appear to be occupied with their own thoughts or activities, adding a quiet and calm atmosphere to the scene. \n\nAt the far end of the carriage, the interior is gently illuminated by natural light, suggesting it's daytime. There is a fire extinguisher visible at the end of the carriage, indicating clear attention to safety measures within the train.\n\nOverall, the composition and lighting give the photograph a serene and somewhat nostalgic quality, capturing a moment of travel where every individual seems absorbed in personal solace amidst a collective journey.","title":"Scenery, sleep and reading occupy passenger car travelers on the Empire Builder enroute from Chicago to East Glacier Park Montana, and Seattle, Washington. Amtrak is responsible for most U.S. intercity passenger train service. It has been working to improve facilities by using some methods employed by the airlines. A steady decline in train travel since the end of World War II has been reversed since the corporation took control in 1971.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["555974","556062","556061","556671","556834","556097","556656","556833","556094","556781","556117","555977","549893","556081","555982","556096"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["carriage","passenger","aisle","train","interior","seat","journey","end","carpet","absorb"]}
