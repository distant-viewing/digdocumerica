{"path":"554249.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph depicts a snowy mountain landscape, likely taken at a ski resort. A significant portion of the image shows densely wooded areas with coniferous trees, partially covered in snow. Two prominent buildings, which appear to be lodges or ski facilities, are positioned on the slopes. These buildings have large, sloping roofs, likely to manage snowfall.\n\nSeveral ski trails are carved into the snow, winding through the trees and across open spaces, indicating the area is used for skiing or snowboarding. The slopes vary in steepness and are well-defined against the backdrop of forest-covered hills.\n\nIn the distance, beyond the immediate ski slopes, the terrain descends into a valley where the tree coverage becomes sparser. The valley opens up to reveal a wider mountain range that stretches across the horizon. These distant mountains have undulating ridges and are also covered with snow and patches of bare rock or earth.\n\nThe sky is overcast with a whitish-gray hue, suggesting cold, possibly snowy weather. The overall atmosphere is serene and isolated, typical of mountainous winter scenes in popular ski regions. The photograph likely aims to capture both the immediate activity of the ski resort and the expansive natural beauty of the surrounding landscape.","title":"Looking down at sam's knob restaurant from the top of snowmass mountain","placename":"Aspen (Colo.)","location":"Aspen, Colorado","nn1":["554253","554236","554213","543507","543640","554254","543755","542519","550501","554235","550408","555656","554257","550502","550406","542831"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["ski","resort","snow","slope","valley","skiing","aims","snowfall","sloping","descend"]}
