{"path":"557218.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph depicts a heavy industrial scene dominated by large structures of a steel mill or similar facility. The sky is filled with thick, billowing clouds of white and black smoke emanating from multiple tall smokestacks. The composition illustrates an overwhelming sense of pollution, as the smoke almost merges with the stormy sky in the background, creating an overcast and gloomy atmosphere.\n\nThe foreground is relatively barren, with some open land and sparse vegetation visible, suggesting the area around the factories might not be suitable for much else due to industrial use. The color palette is subdued with bluish and grayish tones, enhancing the somber and polluted atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph powerfully captures the environmental impact of industrial activities, highlighting a stark landscape heavily dominated by human-made structures and emissions.","title":"Pollutants hang in the air along the monongahela river at Clairton Pennsylvania, 20 miles south of Pittsburgh.
