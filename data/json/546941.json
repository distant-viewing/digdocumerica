{"path":"546941.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene at a lakeside setting. In the foreground, there is a grassy path scattered with white, oval objects that resemble stones or painted plates. This path leads toward the water's edge where three people are gathered.\n\nTo the left of the image, a bicycle lies on its side near the path, suggesting that the individuals possibly arrived by bike. The grass around the path is overgrown and tinged with spots of brown, indicative of a natural, untamed environment.\n\nAt the end of the path, near the shore of the lake, two children and one adult are present. One child, wearing a blue shirt, sits on the sand, gazing toward the water. Beside him stands an adult in a white shirt and dark pants, also looking out over the lake. The second child, wearing a light-colored top and shorts, stands a little apart from the others, holding what appears to be a fishing rod, engaging in or preparing for fishing.\n\nThe lake itself has a calm surface, reflecting a slightly clouded sky. In the distance across the water, a faint line of trees is visible, adding to the serene and somewhat isolated atmosphere of the scene.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of leisure and recreation by the water, in a setting that feels both peaceful and slightly rustic.","title":"Fishing at Seneca Creek.
