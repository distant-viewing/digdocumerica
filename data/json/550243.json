{"path":"550243.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph depicts a busy beach scene filled with people engaged in various activities. The beach is crowded with individuals and families, spread across a sandy shore and a concrete pier. The environment looks sunny and vibrant, suggesting summer.\n\nStarting from the sandy section of the beach, multiple groups are scattered around; some people are lying on colorful towels and beach blankets enjoying the sun, while others are sitting and talking, occasionally observing their surroundings. A few stray logs and rough patches of grass punctuate the sandy beach area, hinting at a natural, perhaps less manicured, seaside environment.\n\nThere's a part in the foreground where a young boy holding a shovel appears to be playing in the sand, isolated from groups. The beach transitions into a concrete pier where more people are sunbathing or seated, some facing the water. The pier appears aged and is slightly dilapidated, with stark rectangular blocks set against the waterâ€™s edge, serving as a place to relax closer to the water. This arrangement also informs us of perhaps limited coastal development or maintenance.\n\nThe water itself is filled with swimmers, ranging from children to adults. The density of people diminishes slightly farther out into the water. Along the horizon, a vast lake or sea stretches under a clear sky, with faint traces of other shorelines or landmasses visible.\n\nThis photograph captures the essence of a communal recreational space popular on warm, sunny days, showing a lively gathering of people involved in typical beach activities such as swimming, sunbathing, and socializing. The casual attire of the people and the assortment of beach accessories emphasize a relaxed, leisurely day at the beach.","title":"Huntington Beach on Lake Erie.
