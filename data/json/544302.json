{"path":"544302.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This image portrays a tranquil waterfront scene, likely taken during a sunny day given the bright light and clear sky. The photograph features two primary subjects near the foreground: two young children standing on a gravel and sand ground next to a body of water, possibly a bay. The child on the left is dressed in a white shirt and coral shorts, and is facing away from the camera, looking out at the water. The other child, dressed in a striped shirt and orange shorts, is also looking in the same direction towards the sea.\n\nThe background includes a large, expansive body of water under a mostly clear sky with a few visible clouds. On the right side of the image, there are two stilt houses built over the water; these houses have peaked roofs and appear somewhat aged or weather-beaten, adding a rustic charm to the scene. Between the viewerâ€™s vantage point and these stilt houses are numerous old wooden pilings sticking out of the water, remnants of what might have been a pier or another structure.\n\nOn the far left, a guardrail or wooden barrier is visible, marking the edge of the waterfront area where the children are standing. A small boat can be seen moving across the water in the distance, indicating some activity in this otherwise peaceful setting.\n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of curiosity or contemplation as the children gaze out at the water, surrounded by the coastal landscape and remnants of human infrastructure.","title":"Little Woods area","placename":"Pontchartrain, Lake (La.)","location":"Pontchartrain, Lake, Louisiana","nn1":["544200","547004","557423","546333","544203","552341","543875","550241","543493","547727","547009","544299","547676","552940","554499","549105"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["child","stilt","remnant","house","waterfront","water","short","coral","piling","guardrail"]}
