{"path":"542496.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is a photograph featuring a dynamic scene centered around a vintage biplane. The aircraft is depicted parked, with its distinctive two wings stacked one above the other, each supported by an intricate network of struts and wires. The planeâ€™s body and wings are primarily painted in a light yellow hue, accented by black markings and text, which suggests some form of identification or branding. It appears somewhat weather-worn, giving it a sense of historical significance or frequent use.\n\nA person, seemingly a pilot, is the focal point of the activity in the image. This individual is climbing onto the back of the top wing of the biplane, dressed in traditional aviator attire: a leather flight jacket, trousers, and a helmet with goggles. This outfit hints at the era of early aviation or possibly a demonstration of historical flight.\n\nThe pilot is captured in a moment of action, surrounded by a dramatic expulsion of smoke or steam, which envelops much of their lower body and adds a vigorous energy to the scene. This could indicate engine testing or part of a pre-flight procedure, where steam or smoke is being vented as a part of system checks or maintenance.\n\nIn the foreground of the photograph, we can see a part of another object, possibly another aircraft or a piece of ground support equipment. This element, combined with the smoke and the setting sun in the background casting an orange glow, enhances the nostalgic and adventurous feel of the image.\n\nThe setting appears to be an airfield, given the context of the aircraft and equipment. The time of day, suggested by the lighting, points towards either dawn or dusk, adding a dramatic and serene quality to the photo. The overall composition of this photograph, with its action, lighting, and historical elements, evokes a sense of the early days of aviation exploration and excitement.","title":"Preparing to sulfur-dust grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542500","542499","542498","548884","542501","542506","548881","548841","549072","553873","542793","542504","544491","542577","542720","545935"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["wing","aircraft","biplane","pilot","aviation","flight","smoke","steam","action","goggle"]}
