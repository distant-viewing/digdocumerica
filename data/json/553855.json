{"path":"553855.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic and rugged natural scene dominated by a fast-moving river. The water appears turbulent and frothy, reflecting light and creating a sense of motion and power. The river fills the foreground of the image, capturing the viewer's immediate attention with its swirling, silvery currents.\n\nIn the background, we see a dense forest of tall, closely packed trees which provide a dark, contrasting backdrop to the bright and shimmering water. The trees are predominantly coniferous with dark green foliage, indicative of a wilderness or mountainous region. The lighting suggests that this scene could be in the early morning or late afternoon, as the light seems soft and not overly harsh.\n\nOverall, this image portrays a serene yet vibrant natural environment, emphasizing the beauty and wildness of unspoiled landscapes.","title":"Uncompahgre National Forest, (from the sites exhibition.
