{"path":"544892.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph features a picturesque valley landscape. The foreground shows a lush green meadow that gently slopes upwards, filled with an abundance of grass and dotted sporadically with small bushes or shrubs. A small, winding stream can be seen meandering through the valley floor, reflecting the bright sunlight.\n\nThe middle ground of the image showcases slightly denser vegetation with both open areas of grass and clusters of coniferous trees, suggesting a mountainous region. These trees are dark green, indicating they might be pines or spruces. Shadows cast from the trees stretch across the vibrant green slopes, creating a patchwork of light and dark green hues. \n\nAs the terrain continues to ascend, it connects with background hills that appear more densely forested. These hills form a larger mountainous backdrop that frames the valley. The hills display varying shades of green, suggesting a composition of different types of vegetation and trees.\n\nThe overall scene is under a clear, bright blue sky with ample sunlight, enhancing the freshness and vivid colors of the natural landscape. This image communicates a serene and untouched environment, typical of a high-altitude mountain valley. The natural beauty and tranquility of the area are the main focus, with no visible human presence or artificial structures altering the pristine condition of this panoramic view.","title":"Alpine meadow","placename":"Uncompahgre National Forest (Colo.)","location":"Uncompahgre National Forest, Colorado","nn1":["550528","557531","557557","557537","550499","552582","552593","550516","545313","550497","549155","550441","549236","550509","549150","550513"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["valley","hill","alter","slope","from","freshness","abundance","patchwork","pristine","ascend"]}
