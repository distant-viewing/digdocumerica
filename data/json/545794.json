{"path":"545794.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a breathtaking aerial view of a sinuous river weaving its way through a rugged canyon landscape. The river, reflecting the sky above, forms a stark contrast against the rough, textured terrain of the surrounding cliffs and plateaus. These landforms display a rich palette of earthy tones, ranging from deep reds to lighter browns, interspersed with darker areas that may indicate vegetation or shadowed regions.\n\nThe topography is dramatically varied, featuring sharp vertical drops, layered rock formations, and scattered flat areas that plateau before dropping off again. The aerial perspective emphasizes the winding course of the river, highlighting the natural erosion and geological processes that have shaped this landscape over millennia.\n\nIn the distance, additional layered cliffs can be seen, suggesting this canyon is part of a larger, expansive rocky terrain. The sky is clear, casting bright light that sharpens the multitude of textures and shadows across the scene. This photograph not only captures the grand scale and isolated beauty of this rugged terrain but also subtly hints at the powerful natural forces that continue to shape our earth's surface.","title":"View over the canyonlands, looking west to the Green River gorge","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["544748","545765","545633","544744","545301","545798","545632","549021","545640","550414","545787","545802","545796","544752","544950","549456"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["drop","canyon","cliff","river","plateau","millennia","plateaus","varied","shape","breathtaking"]}
