{"path":"557464.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This is an aerial photograph of a coastal industrial facility. The landscape includes a large, active industrial plant on the shoreline, which features several distinct sections including large buildings, storage tanks, and complex infrastructure. A notable feature is a large, dome-shaped structure near the coastline. The industrial complex is adjacent to a highway, separating it from the rolling hills in the background, which appear barren and undeveloped.\n\nThe coastline is rugged and appears to be experiencing somewhat rough sea conditions, with white waves crashing against the shore. To the left of the facility, a small patch of water enclosed by a breakwater can be seen, possibly a small boat or ship harbor. \n\nThe sharp contrast between the industrialized area and the natural landscape highlights the intersection of human industrial activity with the natural environment. The image gives a broad view of how the facility sits within and impacts its immediate surroundings, particularly in such a potentially sensitive coastal area.","title":"Construction work on expansion of the san nofre nuclear generating plant.  The sea wall around the construction forces swimmers to detour and swim about 100 yards to reach the other beach area.  Regulatory commissions have been set up to rule on development within 1,000 yards of the coast because of the mounting land use pressures.
