{"path":"545765.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph showcases a breathtaking landscape scene of a vast canyon with numerous geological features and rich earthy colors. The focus is on the dramatic topography characterized by deep gorges and high plateaus. The terrain is saturated with varying shades of red and brown, punctuated by rugged cliffs and steep canyon walls.\n\nA significant feature of the landscape is a winding river, appearing vibrant blue, that snakes its way through the canyon, highlighting the erosion it has caused over millions of years. The river bends are clearly visible, reflecting sunlight and creating a striking contrast with the deep reds of the surrounding rock.\n\nThe viewpoint of the photograph is from a high vantage point, capturing the grandeur of the canyon with shadows casting dramatically across the landscape due to the position of the sun, which is either setting or rising, giving the sky a soft purple and blue hue. Wisps of clouds are scattered in the sky, adding depth and a sense of scale to the immense open space.\n\nThe left portion of the photograph is slightly darker, possibly because the sun is behind a large cliff, casting a shadow and adding a frame of natural silhouette to the composition. This perspective gives a feeling of standing on the edge, looking out over a vast, ancient landscape that stretches far into the distance. The overall mood of the photo is serene yet awe-inspiring, capturing the raw beauty of nature's artistry.","title":"Looking south over the Colorado river to Canyonlands National Park.
