{"path":"546382.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Vachon, John","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a rundown or neglected urban environment. A black dog with a pointy tail and ears stands at the center of the frame, drinking water from a puddle that reflects its image. The ground around the puddle is muddy and littered with debris, including pieces of paper and random trash. The background features a dilapidated setting with a couple of barrels, scattered debris, and parts of what appear to be makeshift structures. The area is unkept, suggesting it might be an abandoned or poorly maintained part of a city. The overall lighting suggests it might be late morning or afternoon, casting natural light across the scene which highlights the textures of the mud and the roughness of the environment.","title":"A village street","placename":"Ponce (P.R.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548307","548305","542541","550151","552228","544580","547901","551122","543630","545029","542954","546920","550756","543031","546854","544762"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["puddle","ear","tail","debris","barrel","mud","dog","trash","couple","paper"]}
