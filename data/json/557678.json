{"path":"557678.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph features an elderly man focused on an activity involving precision and craftsmanship. He is seated, wearing bold, red-tinted sunglasses and a colorful, patterned shirt with red, white, and blue stars. The man is using tools to manipulate a small object held over a fire or heat source, likely for shaping or soldering, suggesting a craft such as jewelry making or a related hobby.\n\nHe is using pliers in one hand to hold the object while the other hand operates a tool that directs the flame onto the object. The workspace is equipped with practical, possibly handmade, tool holders and a protective setup to safely contain the heat source.\n\nThe background is dark and nondescript, focusing all attention on the man and his task. This specific setting and the intense concentration of the man emphasize a scene of creativity, expertise, and dedication to a meticulous craft.","title":"Fritz Bachman, a glassblower, who lives in Helen, Georgia near Robertstown","placename":"Georgia","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548252","548231","555533","558356","549712","542664","553656","558324","558327","558376","556267","551590","546328","558303","557680","556633"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["heat","tool","craft","source","object","hobby","holder","expertise","making","jewelry"]}
