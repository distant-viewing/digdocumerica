{"path":"543883.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of a city during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, bathed in a reddish-pink hue. The setting is urban, with several discernible elements contributing to a busy cityscape:\n\n1. **Bridges**: There are multiple bridges visible, which span across a wide river, prominently displayed in the middle of the photograph. These bridges vary in style, including truss and arch types, and they connect different parts of the city, suggesting significant traffic and connective infrastructure.\n\n2. **River**: A large river flows horizontally across the frame, dividing the urban area and adding a natural element to the otherwise built environment.\n\n3. **Buildings**: Tall buildings, likely commercial skyscrapers, are situated at what appears to be the city center in the background. Their height and clustered arrangement signify a central business district.\n\n4. **Roadways**: Winding and intertwining roads and highways with visible vehicles on them indicate a well-developed transportation network. The roads loop and curve gracefully, with off-ramps and interchanges visible, showcasing urban planning to accommodate vehicular movement.\n\n5. **Surroundings**: Beyond the core urban elements, smaller structures, possibly industrial or residential areas, are visible. These are interspersed with patches of greenery, suggesting parks or tree-lined areas contributing to the urban landscape.\n\n6. **Atmosphere**: The overall atmosphere is somewhat hazy, which along with the light conditions, gives the city a muted, serene ambiance despite its evident size and complexity.\n\n7. **Color Tone**: The distinct reddish-pink color tone permeates the photograph, creating a uniform mood and possibly indicating the photograph was taken with a specific filter or film sensitivity to light at this time of the day.\n\nThis description captures the blend of natural and man-made environments in an urban setting, highlighted by the infrastructure and atmospheric conditions.","title":"Smog hangs over Louisville and Ohio river","placename":"Louisville (Ky.)","location":"Louisville, Kentucky","nn1":["548414","543957","548317","546669","548339","548416","548334","557274","546729","547429","548344","548407","548453","553559","548392","553846"],"cl":[25],"cluster":["#25 &mdash; Bridge"],"terms":["city","description","core","bridge","permeate","interchange","ramp","loop","accommodate","truss"]}
