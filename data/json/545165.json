{"path":"545165.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a fish being held in someone's hand. The fish appears vibrant, predominantly displaying dark blue and grayish colors. It has a sleek, streamlined body, typical of aquatic animals adapted to efficient swimming. The fish's mouth is slightly open, and its eye is prominent and clear, reflecting a sense of vitality.\n\nThe fish is being gripped firmly near its head by a hand, suggesting it has just been caught or is being examined. The hand holding it is partly visible with fingers pressing into the fish's damp, shiny scales, indicating a gentle yet firm hold.\n\nAttached to the fish's mouth is a piece of fishing equipment, specifically a dark, worm-like lure, which indicates that fishing activity is taking place. The lure is attached to a fishing line or leader, part of which is visible in the photograph.\n\nThe background is blurred with hints of water, suggesting that this scene is taking place near a body of water, possibly during a fishing expedition. The water's surface appears rippling, enhancing the outdoor, natural setting of the scene.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment of interaction between a human and a fish, highlighting aspects of recreational fishing and the natural beauty of aquatic life.","title":"A malachite green fungicide is applied to sockeye salmon which was injured in gill netting.
