{"path":"556212.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"This photograph depicts a lively street scene, possibly in an urban setting, featuring a group of African American individuals engaged in various activities. The foreground is dominated by a group of children and some adults gathered under a large umbrella, which is attached to a hot dog cart. The children are of varying ages, some are smiling, and they appear to be in casual, colorful clothing typical of warmer weather.\n\nTo the left, a woman is tending to the hot dog cart. She is wearing a dark top and has her hair styled in an afro. Next to her, inside the door frame of a building, there appears to be another woman watching the scene, partially obscured by a security bar door.\n\nThe backdrop of the photograph features blues skies with fluffy white clouds, and some urban structures can be vaguely seen. The overall composition of the photograph captures a vibrant community moment, likely centered around a simple, everyday event like enjoying food from a street vendor. The setting and attire suggest this could be from the 1970s or 1980s, providing a nostalgic look at community interaction and street food culture.","title":"Ghetto black children line up for snow cones from a sidewalk vendor on Chicago's West Side in the summer of 1973. This portion of the city was hard hit by riots and fires in the mid and late 1960's and was slow to recover. Help came when black businessmen, with federal help, reached an agreement with several national franchises which resulted in $20 million worth of jobs to residents by 1974.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["551731","551836","547026","556223","556221","553142","553204","551513","556214","551689","551835","556291","553804","556211","551833","552411"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["cart","dog","food","street","afro","door","security","child","vendor","community"]}
