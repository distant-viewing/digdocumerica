{"path":"548202.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene on a large body of water, with a significant congregation of boats. Numerous boats, varying in size but mostly small motorboats, are navigating the waters, some moving towards the camera and others scattered across the frame. Many of the boats are generating white trails of wake behind them, indicating their speed and movement through the water.\n\nIn the background, a significant natural landmark dominates the viewâ€”an impressive, snow-capped mountain, likely a volcanic peak, rises majestically against a blue sky. This mountain is sharply tapered and symmetrical, suggesting it might be a stratovolcano.\n\nThe landscape between the water and the mountain includes a flat shoreline that appears to be densely populated with low-lying buildings, indicative of a coastal town or city environment. The vegetation visible on land is minimal, suggesting an urban setting.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph offers a dynamic contrast between human activity (represented by the bustling movement of boats on the water) and the tranquil permanence of the natural environment, embodied by the mountain in the distance. The image seems to capture a moment of leisure or a boating event, underscoring the relationship and proximity of human settlements to natural features.","title":"Fishing craft crowd the Columbia River between Vancouver, Washington, and The Dalles, Oregon.
