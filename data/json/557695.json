{"path":"557695.jpg","date":"July 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph shows an indoor scene of what appears to be a modest office or study room. The room has light-colored walls and a white ceiling with wooden beams running horizontally. On one of the walls, multiple framed certificates and a large vertical poster of a waterfall scene are displayed. The arrangement of the wall decor is orderly and spans the length of the room.\n\nA wooden desk occupies the foreground of the image, laden with various items including an open book, papers, envelopes, and a briefcase, suggesting recent or ongoing work. The desk chair is pushed slightly away from the desk, positioned as if someone just stood up or is about to sit down.\n\nTo the left of the photo, there is a traditional rocking chair with spindles, which is empty but casts a shadow on the wall, indicating that the scene is lit by natural or artificial light coming from the left side. At the far end of the room, near the corner, is what appears to be a wooden cabinet or shelf with more papers and possibly books or office supplies stacked untidily.\n\nThe right side of the room features a dark-wood grandfather clock, showing the time as approximately 10:10, and a framed picture or portrait above a small heating unit with metallic finish. Next to it, there is a wicker chair with a cushion, implying additional seating for visitors or personal usage. The closed door in the background on the right suggests this room is private, possibly isolated from the rest of a building or house.\n\nOverall, the room's functional arrangement and personal touches suggest a space frequently used for work or meetings, preserving a sense of organization amidst a busy professional or academic life.","title":"Office of the late attorney c.n.
