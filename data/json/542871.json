{"path":"542871.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling marina filled densely with various types of boats and yachts. Dozens of masts stand tall and clustered, punctuating the sky with vertical lines. The foreground features closely packed boats of differing designsâ€”some are sailboats with tall masts and intricate rigging, while others are motorboats with enclosed cabins. The color palette of the boats includes mostly white and subtle shades, with a few boats displaying colored stripes or accents.\n\nTo the right at the waterfront, miscellaneous marine equipment, storage units, and possibly a small office with signage that reads \"Bait\" can be seen, all indicative of maritime activity often found near such docks. Vehicles including a couple of vintage cars and trailers are parked at the marina, suggesting accessibility and usability of the area.\n\nThe backdrop features a large body of tranquil, blue water extending to a low-lying horizon. Land or a thin strip of an island is visible across the water, further enhancing the coastal ambiance. The sky is partly cloudy yet bright, spreading natural light across the scene and enriching the colors of the marina and its surroundings.\n\nOverall, the image presents a vivid tableau of marine life, capturing a moment in a lively harbor where both the tranquility of the sea and the busy endeavors of its visitors coexist.","title":"The Bodega Bay area is slated for intensive housing development.","placename":"Bodega Bay (Calif. : Bay)","location":"Bodega Bay, California","nn1":["546877","542912","552028","546853","552027","548078","542902","548547","548075","556191","542904","546388","557450","548969","543246","548543"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","boat","mast","dozen","bait","yacht","rigging","accessibility","tableau","motorboat"]}
