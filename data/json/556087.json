{"path":"556087.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man, dressed in a uniform consisting of a dark jacket and trousers, performing a task on a train. The man, wearing a cap, is leaning towards an open train door. He seems to be in the action of either examining something inside the door or is involved in operating it. Notably, he wears glasses and has a badge and name tag on his jacket, suggesting he might be a conductor or a train worker.\n\nThe train itself is large and metallic, with a series of windows reflecting a pale blue sky, indicating the photograph is taken during the day. The body of the train features riveted panels, with labels that state \"LACKAWANNA\" which likely indicates the name of the train line or company. The ground beside the train is visible, and it appears to be a gritty, gravel-covered track area which is typical of a railway environment.\n\nThe overall scene is set outdoors, and the lighting in the image suggests a clear sky, contributing to the visibility in the photograph. The activity captured is a common railway operation, possibly during a stop or a check, drawing attention to the routine yet pivotal duties that keep train operations running smoothly.","title":"Fireman on the empire builder passenger train checks the brake boxes for overheating during the trip from Chicago to east glacier park, Montana, and Seattle, Washington.
