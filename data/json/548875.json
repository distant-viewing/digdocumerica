{"path":"548875.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph shows an agricultural scene with large-scale irrigation equipment in action. In the foreground, a piece of farm machinery, likely a tractor or a specialized vehicle for agricultural irrigation, sits idle on the left side of the frame. This piece of equipment is darkly silhouetted against the lighter background.\n\nIn the middle of the image, expansive farmland is being watered by multiple large sprinklers. The irrigation system, consisting of long spans, extends horizontally across the photograph. Powerful jets of water are being sprayed over a green crop, creating arcs and mists of water that catch the light, contrasted starkly against the darker tones of the landscape and equipment.\n\nThe background features a range of mountains with soft, undulating contours. The mountains are somewhat muted and hazy, likely due to the distance and possibly the spray or dust in the air. Above, the sky is clear, suggesting it might be a sunny day, contributing to the serene yet industrious agricultural setting.\n\nThe overall tone of the image is relatively muted with a focus on darker hues and silhouettes, reflecting perhaps the time of day being either early morning or late evening. The composition balances the technology of farming with the natural landscape, highlighting the interplay between human agricultural activity and the natural environment.","title":"Farming in the Parker Valley area","placename":"Yuma (Ariz.)","location":"Yuma, Arizona","nn1":["548877","548869","548991","549178","548950","546825","553432","543650","546949","548953","554014","553652","543777","548901","548907","554015"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["irrigation","equipment","arc","span","piece","jet","farmland","tractor","mountain","spray"]}
