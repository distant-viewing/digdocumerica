{"path":"547761.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene lakeside scene. A horse stands in the foreground on the left side of the image, quietly grazing near the waterâ€™s edge under a large, partially silhouetted tree. The horse is dark in color with its head down, possibly nibbling on the grass or foliage.\n\nThe middle of the image includes a wide expanse of water that fills most of the view. There are multiple sailboats scattered across the lake, their sails fully hoisted, reflecting a sense of leisure and sport. The sails are predominantly white and they vary in size. The sunlight seems to brighten some parts of the sails more than others, suggesting a bright, sunny day with some clouds possibly filtering the sunlight intermittently.\n\nIn the background, on the other side of the lake, there is a line of dense greenery, likely a distant forest or a park along the opposing shore. Above the greenery, the sky is a clear blue, adding to the calmness of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition contrasts the tranquility of a static horse with the dynamic motion of sailboats on a bright day, creating a peaceful outdoor tableau.","title":"Sunday afternoon at White Rock Lake, one of the city's most popular weekend resorts","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["553069","547750","544290","547754","547757","543726","551229","547781","548118","552345","542622","547273","542956","557186","543626","552501"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["horse","sail","sailboat","lake","tableau","lakeside","calmness","sunlight","greenery","sport"]}
