{"path":"542554.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant natural scene, presumably in a wetland or pond area. The focal point of the image is a pond that is partly covered with what appears to be floating water plants, possibly lily pads or duckweed. Surrounding the pond is a wealth of tall, dense green vegetation, which includes various types of bushes and grasses, contributing to the lush appearance of the landscape.\n\nThe natural setting is further enriched by trees visible in the background, suggesting a diverse ecosystem supporting different foliage types. The sky, barely visible, hints at clear weather with ample sunlight, which accentuates the rich greens and the reflective quality of the water surface.\n\nForegrounding the image, dry grass and broken branches add a contrast to the liveliness of the pond, providing a textural difference that hints at natural decay amidst growth. This intricate mixture of flora suggests a secluded, perhaps minimally disturbed wildlife habitat, alive with potential unseen aquatic and terrestrial life.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, using natural framing with vegetation in the foreground and the pond as a central element, draws the viewerâ€™s attention to the water body and the life it supports, encouraging an appreciation for these often-unseen ecosystems. The clear, bright day enhances the visibility of the details and colors in the dense landscape.","title":"Growth of water hyacinths in the Merced River and slow flow from Exchequer Dam cause siltation, making the stream more shallow and blocking migration of fish.","placename":"Merced County (Calif.)","location":"Merced County, California","nn1":["543561","554591","550786","547509","547639","550670","558009","557498","542582","545387","543558","544765","550785","554603","545008","550783"],"cl":[50],"cluster":["#50 &mdash; Wetland Environments"],"terms":["pond","ecosystem","lily","difference","liveliness","pad","type","appreciation","grass","framing"]}
