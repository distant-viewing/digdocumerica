{"path":"549784.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures an urban environment, and the focus seems to be on an intersection plagued by litter and debris. In the foreground, thereâ€™s a significant amount of trash scattered across what appears to be a broken section of pavement. Among the debris, we see various discarded items like a mattress, empty bottles, cans, a box that resembles a chassis of an electronic device, papers, and miscellaneous garbage.\n\nIn the mid-ground, a man is walking along the street, dressed in dark clothing. He seems to be crossing the street or walking alongside it. This part of the image also shows a partly visible street sign reading \"Einstein Loop\" against tall residential buildings in the background. These buildings are high-rise, probably typical apartment blocks, and dominate the skyline.\n\nThe environment suggests a possibly neglected urban area, with the debris indicating a lack of regular maintenance or garbage collection. The presence of the man and distant cars gives a sense of daily life continuing amidst urban decay. Lighting conditions and the image's overall mood suggest it might be a cloudy day, which adds a slightly gloomy tone to the scene.","title":"Empty lot strewn with trash at 108th street and Lexington avenue, Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["549785","550246","549839","550253","549840","552750","548214","545506","549786","549843","550264","549833","545494","557345","549958","549957"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["garbage","debris","street","chassis","walk","apartment","pavement","can","intersection","bottle"]}
