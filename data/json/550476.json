{"path":"550476.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a close-up view of a textured surface, showcasing distinct geological and botanical elements. The main focus is on a rock formation that has an intricate pattern of red and yellow lichen spreading across its surface in a pattern reminiscent of a branching or coral-type structure.\n\nThe lichen is dense and appears to be thriving, indicating a possibly moist environment or one that supports such growth. It is presented in rich shades of red, orange, and slight hints of yellow, adding a colorful contract to the grayish-white, crystalline texture of the rock itself, which could be quartz or a similar mineral due to its sparkling, grainy appearance.\n\nThe background is softly blurred and features warm tones that suggest a natural, outdoor setting, possibly during golden hour lighting which enhances the warmth of the image. The blend of sharp detail in the foreground with the soft, indistinct background focuses the viewer's attention firmly on the textures and colors of the lichen and the rock.","title":"Lichens and mineral salt crystals on a rock in the Atigun Gorge, 5 miles east of the pipeline crossing of the Atigun River","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554594","555182","550484","550474","543151","554410","545589","555018","550483","543149","544907","543147","551331","545558","545797","549228"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["lichen","rock","warmth","mineral","pattern","one","hour","yellow","texture","growth"]}
