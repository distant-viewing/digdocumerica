{"path":"544320.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph depicts workers engaging in industrial activities, likely related to the assembly or maintenance of a large cylindrical structure. The structure, which dominates the frame, is composed of thick metal and has an immense diameter. It is open at the top, where numerous support beams and yellow guidelines crisscross, aiding in the orientation and safety of the workers.\n\nInside and just outside the structure, at least four workers are visible. They are spread around the edges of the culvert-like structure and on the scaffolding positioned around it. The workers are equipped with safety helmets and are seemingly involved in precise tasks, with one of them taking measurements or inspecting a junction point.\n\nThe environment around the structure is mostly barren, with a reddish dry soil that suggests an outdoor location possibly in a spacious industrial yard or construction site. The overall setting and activities suggest a focus on engineering, construction, or repair, with attention to detail and safety protocols evident in the arrangement of the workspace and the gear used by the laborers.","title":"Navajo workmen at salt river project plant","placename":"Page (Ariz.)","location":"Page, Arizona","nn1":["554426","544153","544826","553385","556893","544159","557388","553384","546929","544022","556376","544053","556503","547949","554930","544018"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["worker","safety","protocol","junction","orientation","measurement","scaffolding","construction","assembly","structure"]}
