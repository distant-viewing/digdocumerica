{"path":"549469.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"The photograph depicts an expansive aerial view of a large bridge crossing over a river. The bridge, appearing majestic in its structural design, is made of concrete arches that support a wide roadway. The roadway on the bridge is filled with numerous vehicles, suggesting it is a busy route.\n\nThe river underneath has a slightly dark shade of blue and is marked by a few white crests and ripples, indicating either currents or small waves in the water. The two banks of the river are quite contrasting; one side appears to be more developed with infrastructural elements such as roads packed with vehicles, parking lots with cars neatly arranged, and smaller structures that could be either commercial or administrative. There are some trees dotted around this more developed area.\n\nThe opposite bank of the river is covered with dense greenery, likely a forested area, showing minimal signs of human activity. No structures or significant clearings are visible through the trees, suggesting it is a natural or protected area.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, taken from an aerial perspective, includes both man-made and natural elements, highlighting a blend of busy human activity and natural serenity. The image captures the interaction between a human-engineered structure and the natural landscape, underlining themes of connectivity and environmental contrast.","title":"Aerial view of Niagara River below the falls, showing Rainbow Bridge which joins the American and Canadian sides.
