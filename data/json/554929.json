{"path":"554929.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This image depicts an outdoor scene taking place during a time of day when the sunlight casts a warm glow, likely occurring near sunset or sunrise. The setting is a natural, earthy terrain covered in what appears to be dry, sparse grass or field.\n\nCentral to the scene is the interaction between three subjects: a human hand, an armadillo, and a dog. The human hand appears to be gently touching or handling the armadillo's tail, suggesting a moment of contact or possibly aid. The armadillo, characterized by its unique leathery armor shell, is positioned in the foreground and appears somewhat in motion, perhaps trying to walk away or explore.\n\nBehind the armadillo, slightly blurred due to movement and depth of field, is a white dog with dark patches. The dog is dynamic, with its front paws lifted off the ground, suggesting it is either playing around or startled.\n\nThe lighting conditions, combined with rising dust or mist close to the ground, contribute to a somewhat ethereal, soft-focus quality that envelops the subjects and adds a tranquil yet lively atmosphere to the scene. The gentle interaction portrayed showcases a moment of interspecies connection within a serene natural environment.","title":"A dog attacks an armadillo on a farm near Leakey, Texas near San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543040","554532","554497","554537","543780","554559","549716","554932","543070","543678","554126","553585","542629","546218","556549","543395"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["dog","subject","contact","shell","tail","field","sunrise","hand","interaction","dust"]}
