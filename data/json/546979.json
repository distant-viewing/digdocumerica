The stand features a large menu board with various food items such as hot dogs, ice cream, chicken baskets, and drinks including milk and beer prominently displayed. The boards are divided into two sections, each listing different food offerings in black text on a white background.\n\nIn front of the counter, there is a group of people engaging in various activities. Some individuals appear to be placing orders, while others are in conversation. The dress code is casual beach attire, with several individuals wearing shorts and tank tops, indicating warm weather.\n\nThe concession stand has a wood-paneled exterior and a simple, functional design with open service windows. The floor is made of wood decking, consistent with outdoor, possibly beach-related architecture.\n\nOverall, this gathering spot seems to provide a relaxed and social atmosphere where people can enjoy a variety of typical beachside or fairground foods. The image captures an essence of summer leisure, social interaction, and casual dining by the water or at a similar outdoor venue.","title":"A refreshment stand on the boardwalk of Isle of Palms, the popular ocean resort.","placename":"South Carolina","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554495","554708","554187","548540","543987","551888","554217","556816","551485","545457","548529","545154","543227","546874","548544","550921"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["food","board","fairground","code","milk","menu","beach","offering","wood","beer"]}
