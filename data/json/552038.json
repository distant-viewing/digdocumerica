{"path":"552038.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene over a body of water, likely a lake or river. The sun is positioned in the upper left corner of the image, casting a golden hue across the sky and reflecting shimmering light on the water's surface.\n\nA sailboat with a single white sail is positioned slightly off-center to the right, gracefully sailing across the water. This adds a calm and leisurely activity element to the scene.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a silhouette of foliage, possibly part of a tree with leaves that are softly blurred, framing the right edge of the photograph and giving a sense of depth and natural beauty. Additionally, there is what appears to be a buoy or small marker in the water near the center-bottom of the image.\n\nThe background across the water presents a distant shoreline that appears tranquil and lightly wooded, enhancing the peaceful and secluded feel of the setting. The overall composition of the image, with its warm tones and tranquil subject matter, evokes a sense of quiet and relaxation.","title":"Evening sail on the niagara river","placename":"Buffalo (N.Y.)","location":"Buffalo, New York","nn1":["552293","551215","552039","543613","557447","548118","543143","543880","550303","552294","550299","551206","553990","554404","543133","550296"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["sail","matter","water","buoy","marker","shimmer","position","sailboat","relaxation","woode"]}
