{"path":"550700.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic natural landscape primarily dominated by a large river. The river emerges extensive and tranquil, its surface reflecting a mute hue that varies from dark blue to almost black, possibly due to overcast weather. Bubbles and minor ripples detail the river's flow, suggesting gentle movement.\n\nFlanking the river are dense forests, primarily coniferous trees, which emphasize a lush, unspoiled wilderness ambiance. The trees, a deep green color, are thickly clustered, stretching towards the edges of the river.\n\nThe backdrop features rolling hills or low mountains, further enhancing the sense of a secluded natural retreat. These hills are similarly covered in verdant vegetation, showing no signs of human interference and presenting varied gradients and contours that add depth to the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with the river centrally placed and flanked by forests against a mountainous backdrop, presents a serene and untouched natural environment suggesting a remote or protected area. The viewpoint seems to be elevated, looking down upon the river, giving a broad perspective of this tranquil wilderness.","title":"Looking along the Androscoggin River from the bridge at Gilead","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550656","550682","550680","550542","542653","544861","555075","550531","550625","542844","550658","555076","548156","550562","555661","550560"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["river","wilderness","interference","bubble","retreat","forest","hill","viewpoint","gradient","contour"]}
