{"path":"554925.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures two elderly men, both sporting cowboy hats, examining a collection of animal furs and pelts laid out in a sunny outdoor setting. The man on the left is wearing a red plaid flannel shirt and a stetson-style cowboy hat, while the man on the right is dressed in a greyish-blue shirt, dark pants, and a darker cowboy hat.\n\nThe furs are spread on the ground, mostly consisting of large, dark patches which may be from various animals. The lighting suggests it is a bright day. Additionally, one of the hides exhibits distinctive spots, possibly identifying it as that of a particular species.\n\nIn the background, there's a light-colored pickup truck parked by the roadside, partially visible behind the man on the left. Further in the distance is a landscape typical of a small rural town with scattered trees, open grassy areas, and a small building or houses with noticeable rooftiles visible under a clear sky.\n\nThe scene seems to be set in a typical rural or small-town environment, reflecting a moment of everyday life where local wildlife hunting or farming could be a common activity. The interaction between the men and the animal pelts indicates they might be discussing or inspecting the quality or type of the furs, potentially for trade or sale purposes.","title":"Fur buying and selling is brisk during the hunting season in Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio.","placename":"Texas","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554934","554939","554860","554952","546094","546131","554943","554944","552587","557042","544349","557145","554675","554926","557061","546137"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["fur","cowboy","animal","hat","man","town","flannel","hunting","trade","pickup"]}
