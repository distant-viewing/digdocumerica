{"path":"543352.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a striking outdoor scene by the coastline. The foreground features rugged, gray rocky terrain directly adjoining a cliff's edge, where a man is seen sitting on one of the larger rocks, looking outwards, potentially toward the sea which is not visible in the image. Behind him, the middle ground is dominated by a vibrant pink carpet of flowering ground cover, possibly succulent plants, neatly sectioned by a low stone wall that appears to run the length of the slope. This planted area climbs upwards along the sloping ground.\n\nBeyond the lush and colorful flora, there is a row of residential houses, which seem characteristic of mid-century American architecture, each painted in different subdued colors. These houses appear well-maintained, suggesting a suburban coastal community. Some of the homes feature visible front yards with similar xeriscaping to that seen on the slope, integrating local flora. You can also see parked cars and utility poles, adding to the suburban feel.\n\nOverall, the composition provides a contrast between the rugged natural landscape and the organized human habitation, highlighting an interface where natural beauty meets residential development. The abundance of pink plants gives the scene a vibrant and picturesque quality, suggesting a well-established coastal garden.","title":"Southern California -- Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543401","543196","543202","543346","543399","543404","543066","543199","543389","557429","543204","543188","547592","543363","554081","554102"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["flora","slope","adjoin","integrat","sitting","sloping","interface","abundance","climb","carpet"]}
