{"path":"546646.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a city street scene during twilight or early evening. The composition is atmospheric and creatively uses blur and focus to draw attention to different elements of the image.\n\nIn the foreground, out of focus, a large yellow traffic light dominates the right side of the frame, glowing intensely with a hexagonal pattern covering the light, possibly from the cameraâ€™s aperture.\n\nOn the left side, sharply in focus, we see a figure dressed in a distinctive, bright red jacket and dark pants, facing away from the camera. This individual is walking between a row of parked or slow-moving vehicles, which include vintage cars typical of late 20th-century designs, suggesting an older setting.\n\nThe environment is an urban street with visible lane markings on the road. In the distant background, more traffic lights and city infrastructure can be faintly seen under a dimly lit sky, perhaps during dusk. The overall lighting of the scene is subdued, highlighting the bright colors of the traffic light and the person's red jacket against the darker, more muted surroundings.\n\nThe mood conveyed is somewhat solitary and introspective, with a focus on routine urban life and the movement within it.","title":"Traffic officer at busy intersection","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546642","547051","557277","553822","555930","555446","556983","545368","557882","545352","553188","544009","551864","546739","549916","543957"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["traffic","jacket","light","city","blur","street","camera","marking","focus","lane"]}
