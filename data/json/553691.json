{"path":"553691.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant outdoor scene featuring several groups of people engaged in canoeing activities at sea. The focus of the image is on four canoes, each carrying multiple individuals. The closest canoe in the foreground has approximately nine occupants who are actively paddling. These occupants, a mix of men and women, are dressed in swimwear, indicative of warm weather and a recreational setting.\n\nIn the background, there are other canoes, also packed with people, visible amidst the shimmering blue waters. The sea itself is relatively calm, with small waves visible in the distance under a clear sky, suggesting it might be a sunny day.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is lively and suggests a communal or team event possibly related to a race or a group training session. The composition of the image, using a soft focus, emphasizes the activity in the foreground while allowing a glimpse into similar activities ongoing in the background. The natural lighting and the vastness of the water body frame the subjects beautifully, enhancing the sense of openness and activity.","title":"Waikiki beach visitors enjoy the outrigger canoe","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["554469","554468","553806","549996","551546","553690","552982","550659","554465","556295","547213","550309","552283","549939","558069","553343"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","occupant","training","sea","session","swimwear","race","team","paddle","openness"]}
