{"path":"548622.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features a middle-aged man standing on a sandy beach area, posing with his fists raised in a playful boxing stance. He has a broad smile and is looking directly towards the camera. He is wearing white swim trunks and is barefoot. His tanned skin and relaxed demeanor suggest he is enjoying a sunny day outdoors.\n\nThe background is tropical, highlighted by several tall palm trees swaying slightly under a blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. There appears to be a building partially visible in the distance, likely a beach resort or apartment complex.\n\nThe man is standing near what seems to be a low, rough-textured wall made of coral or a similar material, which separates the sandy beach area from a paved path seen on the left side of the photo. Behind him, just to the side, is another person who is partially cut off by the frame of the photograph. This beach scene suggests a location well-suited for vacationers or a leisurely day out near the water.","title":"South beach has the longest stretch of public beach in the Miami area.
