{"path":"557291.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"The photograph depicts a person in an outdoor setting, surrounded by fallen leaves that blanket the ground. The scene has an autumnal feel, due to the variety of leaves in shades of orange, brown, and yellow. The person, whose gender is not clearly identifiable from this angle, is captured in a side profile while walking. They are carrying a large, bulging sack over their shoulder, which suggests they might be engaged in work or collecting something, possibly even the fallen leaves themselves.\n\nThe person is wearing a cap and dark clothes that blend with the dusky, perhaps late afternoon, lighting. Behind them, the trees are only partially visible in the shadows, enhancing the depth and focusing the view on the figure moving through this carpet of leaves.\n\nOverall, the photograph conveys a sense of solitary labor or endeavor, set against a serene, natural backdrop fading into the twilight.","title":"Suburban dweller in the Mt.
