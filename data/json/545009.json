{"path":"545009.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph captures a rural landscape under a striking sky filled with fluffy white clouds against a blue backdrop. In the foreground, rolling fields exhibiting varying shades of greens and browns create a patchwork pattern on the land. This suggests agricultural activity, likely fields of different crops.\n\nIn the middle of the scene, there is a plume of smoke rising dramatically, suggesting a fire or some form of burn-off in the area. The smokeâ€™s grey coloring contrasts with the natural tones of the landscape and draws attention as a focal point against the serene rural setting.\n\nDotted across the landscape are several structures, possibly farm buildings, which are typical of rural agricultural areas. These buildings, predominantly white, are nestled among scattered trees, reinforcing the farming theme.\n\nThe background is framed by a range of hills or low mountains, providing a natural boundary to the landscape and adding to the scenic quality of the photograph. The overall composition gives a vivid portrayal of rural life, juxtaposed with an element of disturbance indicated by the smoke.","title":"Pulp mill air pollution","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545025","545048","545051","544962","552483","554030","549181","543668","553978","545042","554027","549191","556341","545020","551061","549142"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["smoke","off","coloring","patchwork","burn","portrayal","field","disturbance","landscape","farming"]}
