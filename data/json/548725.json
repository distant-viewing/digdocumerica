{"path":"548725.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph you're referencing captures a close-up of a man outdoors during the daytime. The man is wearing a white and red keffiyeh on his head, styled with the ends draped around his neck. He has sunglasses with round, dark lenses, which add a striking contrast to his outfit. His attire includes a white t-shirt that appears slightly faded, suggesting casual, practical wear. The man is leaning against a white, possibly metallic surface, which could be part of a boat or a vehicle, indicated by a portion of a black strap like those from a backpack or safety harness seen over his shoulder.\n\nThe man is looking directly towards the camera with a slight smile, giving an impression of friendly engagement. His body language, with one arm relaxed and the other pointing with a bent elbow, helps in creating a laid-back, approachable demeanor.\n\nIn the background, there's a blurry glimpse of a natural, light-colored environment that could possibly be sky or sea, hinting that the photograph might have been taken in an open outdoor setting, likely near water given the hints of maritime equipment.\n\nOverall, the image conveys a moment of leisure or a break in an outdoor setting, with the man dressed appropriately for a sunny, warm environment, possibly involving water activities.","title":"A shell oil scientist at john pennekamp coral reef state park the protected ocean waters of this underwater park provide excellent opportunities for the study of coral and the formation of coral reefs","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["552873","549080","548299","551300","556622","545219","548302","554048","552864","546298","549120","547023","552871","553418","547679","552872"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["man","elbow","reference","pointing","harness","language","strap","backpack","relax","neck"]}
