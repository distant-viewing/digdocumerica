{"path":"544466.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene that appears to be in the aftermath of a storm or similar natural event. In the foreground, there are several fallen and damaged trees; the branches are barren and spread across the grassy ground. Among the debris, thereâ€™s a visible object that resembles a part of a white structure, possibly fallen from one of the trees. \n\nThe middle ground of the image shows a field of grass that leads up to an elevated highway. This highway seems intact and rises prominently in the scene, supported by multiple concrete columns. There are no visible vehicles on the highway, suggesting either a moment of low traffic or a distant view that does not capture finer details.\n\nThe overall environment is bright and sunny, indicated by the shadows cast by trees and the clear blue sky background. This contrast heightens the sense of calm in the weather following the apparent disruptive event observed in the devastated trees. Overall, the image captures a blend of natural disturbance and durable human-made infrastructure.","title":"Part of widespread damage caused by flooding of Guadalupe River","placename":"New Braunfels (Tex.)","location":"New Braunfels, Texas","nn1":["545966","557993","544583","545254","556445","555872","544455","544587","554548","545264","544468","555142","555207","547653","557008","544458"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["highway","heighten","fall","event","storm","disturbance","tree","aftermath","calm","follow"]}
