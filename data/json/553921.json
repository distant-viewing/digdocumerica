{"path":"553921.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a man engaged in construction work. He is outside, standing amid wooden beams forming part of a larger structural framework, likely in the early stages of a building's construction. The man, exhibiting a focused demeanor, is seen from behind and slightly to the side. He wears a sleeveless white tank top, shorts, and striped athletic socks pulled up just below the knee. His muscular build and tanned skin are apparent. His hair is pulled back with a paisley bandana, and he has a utility belt around his waist, equipped with tools and supplies typical of construction work.\n\nThe environment around him includes uncovered earth and scattered construction materials. The focus on the worker in the midst of a skeletal wooden structure underlines a sense of physical labor and the manual assembly involved in the building process. The lighting in the image suggests it is a sunny day, casting harsh shadows and highlighting the dirt and grit of the construction site.","title":"Hawaii-kai, built on a swamp and a hillside, is a fast growing area east of downtown Honolulu.
