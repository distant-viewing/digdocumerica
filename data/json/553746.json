{"path":"553746.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a statue of King Kamehameha I, standing on a white pedestal. The statue is shown in a prominent and heroic pose, with one arm raised high, holding what appears to be a spear, while the other hand holds a cloak draped around his shoulders. The figure is adorned with a traditional feather helmet and cloak, indicative of Hawaiian royalty.\n\nLocated on the base of the statue is a large plaque that bears the inscription \"KAMEHAMEHA\" in bold letters, emphasizing the significance of the figure depicted. The base also displays an elaborate bronze relief panel that seems to depict a scene relevant to Hawaiian culture or perhaps a specific event in Kamehameha's life; it features palm trees and undulating terrain.\n\nThe background reveals the exterior of an imposing, colonial-style building with large balconies and arches that suggest a setting of official importance, likely a governmental or historically significant structure. A few clouds are visible in the sky, indicating partly cloudy weather, and a vintage car is seen parked in the vicinity, adding a mundane, everyday life aspect to the otherwise grand depiction.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo captures a blend of historical reverence in a setting that integrates elements of both past and contemporary elements.","title":"Statue of King Kamehameha the Great who ruled Hawaii from 1795 to 1819.","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553747","558115","558114","548288","549676","552736","554152","553769","544076","558041","555599","558269","549980","553163","554063","557059"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["statue","base","plaque","bronze","reverence","relief","pedestal","inscription","feather","figure"]}
