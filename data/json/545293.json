{"path":"545293.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor setting with several people and elements that contribute to a relaxed, leisurely atmosphere. It appears to be taken during a sunny day, enriched with vibrant natural colors and landscapes.\n\nForeground: In the lower left corner of the image, there are two individuals caught in a moment of relaxation. They are lying on the ground, one seemingly reading while the other rests beside them. Nearby, there’s a bright orange tent set up, suggesting this is a camping spot. The ground is covered with brown pine needles, giving a rustic and natural feel to the setting.\n\nMiddle ground: In the center and extending towards the right, we see a myriad of evergreen trees with thick trunks and lush, green foliage that partly obscures the sky and casts shadows on the ground, contributing to the dappled sunlight visible in the scene. \n\nBackground: Beyond the trees, a calm and inviting body of water stretches across the frame. The water reflects the bright blue of the sky. On the opposite shore, which is visible through gaps in the foliage, there are more dense forests and what appears to be additional camping or recreational areas.\n\nThe far right side reveals a partially hidden scene involving small boats moored at the water’s edge, indicating the recreational nature of this location, possibly used for boating or fishing.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph—the juxtaposition of the relaxed individuals, the tent in the natural forest environment, and the presence of tranquil water—paints a picture of a peaceful retreat into nature, ideal for relaxation and enjoyment of the outdoors.","title":"Campground on San Juan island","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["542732","545229","558093","543579","545780","552033","549716","554679","548537","549450","546293","548749","543547","548796","543892","543536"],"cl":[13],"cluster":["#13 &mdash; Water 2"],"terms":["tent","camping","relaxation","outdoor","ground","myriad","hide","retreat","gap","boat"]}
