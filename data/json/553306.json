{"path":"553306.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph features a nighttime scene centered around a tall building illuminated in such a way that it appears to depict a giant figure of a person raising its right arm. The building's lights create the silhouette and details, mimicking the shape of the head, torso, and raised arm against the dark sky.\n\nIn the foreground, a bustling urban environment can be observed. There are numerous people gathered, some seemingly in groups, around what appears to be a public square or plaza illuminated by ambient street lighting. Visible among these are hints of trees which suggest some greenery in the space.\n\nOn the left side of the frame, there is a significant piece of art or sculpture that is also illuminated. This sculpture includes clearly defined, sculptural details that suggest movement or interaction.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is vibrant and active, with the visual focus being the building and its unique light display, portraying an almost celebratory or festive mood in this nighttime urban setting.","title":"D'aug Days (pronounced dog) is a month-long presentation of all the arts at downtown Cincinnati's immensely popular public plaza, Fountain Square.
