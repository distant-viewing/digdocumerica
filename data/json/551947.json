{"path":"551947.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph captures an outdoor scene featuring a person operating a large yellow Caterpillar bulldozer. The bulldozer is in the middle of a dirt area characterized by rough and muddy terrain with evident tracks and disruption likely caused by the heavy machinery.\n\nThe person operating the bulldozer is visible atop the machine, dressed in a dark-colored winter jacket and a hood, suggesting the weather might be cold. The terrain is uneven and colored in hues of dark brown and gray, indicative of wet soil or mud, which could be due to recent weather conditions.\n\nIn the background, there is a glimpse of a water body, suggesting that this activity is taking place near a lake or a large river. The sky is clear and blue, and there are no other visible structures or people in the vicinity, giving a sense of isolation to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition of the image highlights the scale of the bulldozer against the vast, rugged terrain, emphasizing the impact of human operations on an expansive natural landscape.","title":"Bulldozer gouges a channel between trapped flood waters and Lake Michigan in Zion.","placename":"Chicago (Ill.)","location":"Chicago, Illinois","nn1":["547254","551262","543114","547939","554544","555601","545665","545664","543760","543107","545662","545652","543105","549950","544138","545950"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Construction"],"terms":["bulldozer","operate","terrain","disruption","hood","mud","person","cause","vicinity","weather"]}
