{"path":"549658.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside what appears to be an underground tram station. There is a green tram visible in the right-hand side of the picture, partially inside the frame, with passengers visible through its windows; some are seated and at least one person is standing, possibly a driver or conductor in the front. The interior of the tram is warmly lit, contrasting with the relatively dim lighting of the station.\n\nTo the left of the image, a uniformed station attendant is standing by the tracks, facing the tram, suggesting they might be there for operational reason or to ensure passengers' safety. Beside the tram tracks, a prominent sign reads \"DAS ÃœBERSCHREITEN DER GLEISE IST VERBOTEN\", which translates from German as \"Crossing the tracks is prohibited\". This warns passengers against crossing the tracks, emphasizing safety within the station.\n\nIn the background, there are steps leading up to another level of the station, and at least one person appears to be ascending the stairs. The station walls are plain and functional, with minimal decoration and functional lighting, giving off a mid-20th century urban transport vibe.","title":"An underground trolley beneath Vienna's town hall","placename":"Vienna (Austria)","location":"Vienna, Austria","nn1":["551909","549650","551889","549655","551876","556844","549675","551908","556815","556846","551879","551887","551862","556774","556026","556670"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Public Transportation"],"terms":["tram","station","track","passenger","safety","reason","attendant","conductor","stair","person"]}
