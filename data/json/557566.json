A woman in a red-orange shirt and dark pants is interacting with a large dog on a leash. There are several different types of mailboxes varying in sizes and colors, including a notably large yellow mailbox and several traditional metal and white painted ones. Each mailbox is marked with addresses and names, suggesting a personalized and community-oriented atmosphere. \n\nThe backdrop consists of luscious green trees and a clear blue sky, implying a sunny, pleasant day. The road is quiet and paved, running alongside the mailboxes and indicating a tranquil setting typical of a rural or suburban area. \n\nOn the ground, there are scattered newspapers next to the mailboxes which add to a sense of daily life and routine in this area. The perspective of the photograph is wide, capturing an immersive view of this simple yet intriguing roadside scene.","title":"Clustered mailboxes help the mailman whose route takes him to the Malibu Lake area in the Santa Monica Mountains near Malibu, California, which is located at the northwestern edge of Los Angeles County. The mountains contain the last semi-Wilderness in Los Angeles County. This area so far has escaped intensive development pressure. Some 84 percent of the state's residents live within 30 miles of the coast, and this concentration has resulted in increasing land use pressure.","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["549006","556984","552468","557760","542702","557950","549005","547290","554132","557759","550991","547296","551000","546992","557287","552476"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["mailbox","roadside","leash","address","newspaper","routine","dog","one","name","orange"]}
