{"path":"557244.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph presents a dramatic and intriguing scene dominated by vibrant colors and contrast. In the foreground, partially occupying the left side of the image, is a flag fluttering against the backdrop. The flag is regal blue and bears an emblem in gold with the word \"PATROL\" written underneath in large, bold, yellow letters.\n\nThe background features an industrial setting with a dark, possibly metallic structure that gives a gritty, urban feel. Beneath this structure, there is a noticeable waterfall, crashing down from a concrete opening into a body of dark water, creating white frothy waves at its base. This waterway appears slightly turbulent, dotted with foam or floating debris, enhancing the image's dynamic feel.\n\nThe lighting in the image seems natural but slightly dim, possibly indicating overcast weather or a setting sun, which casts an overall moodiness to the scene. The overall composition, including the contrast of the serene, dignified flag against the more chaotic and industrial background, creates a striking visual narrative.","title":"Pennant from a Pennsylvania state patrol boat frames an outfall of a blast furnace at the jones and laughlin steel corporation in the second avenue area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania the black-brown discharge empties into the monongahela river","placename":"Pittsburgh (Pa.)","location":"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","nn1":["545047","548577","547238","547112","553354","542581","550710","548061","545882","548225","549303","551519","550854","551230","544675","548870"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["flag","flutter","emblem","gold","crash","waterfall","write","foam","opening","bear"]}
