{"path":"545643.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an early evening scene at a rugged outdoor location, possibly a lakeshore. The terrain is rocky and sparse, with patches of vegetation. There are several key elements distributed throughout the scene:\n\n1. **People**: Multiple individuals are scattered across the foreground, engaged in various activities which appear to involve setting up or managing equipment.\n\n2. **Lighting and activity**: Near the center of the image, there is an area illuminated by lights that might be a small working area or a campsite. It includes a structure that resembles a tent and appears to be a focal point of activity.\n\n3. **Boat**: There is a large boat docked at the waterâ€™s edge. It looks equipped for transport or possibly for carrying supplies, with portions of its superstructure visible including what looks like control rooms or cabins.\n\n4. **Landscape**: The backdrop is dramatic with rolling hills and rocky formations under a cloudy sky. The landscape suggests a remote or wilderness area, adding a sense of isolation and ruggedness to the atmosphere.\n\n5. **Water body**: The presence of a calm water body adjacent to where the activities are taking place adds to the scenic quality of the photograph. The water reflects some of the light from the campsite, adding a subtle shimmer to the image.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a mix of human activity within a natural setting at dusk, highlighting interactions between people, their activities, and the environment. The mood is somewhat industrial yet adventurous, typical of an exploration or fieldwork scenario in a remote location.","title":"This log boom in Monument Valley, Utah, was the site of intensive clean-up operations following a heavy oil spill into the San Juan river.
