{"path":"543182.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph showcases a close-up view of a sunflower sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides) being held by hands, partially visible, with a dark-colored wristband or strap visible on one wrist. The sea star is characterized by its multiple robust, armored arms covered in small, spiny protuberances, and stubby spines. It has a dense, granular texture on its surface, and the overall color is a mix of brown, tan, and yellow hues, enhancing its appearance of a living, dynamic creature of the sea. The background of the image is out of focus, highlighting the intricate details and the vibrant, natural composition of the sea star against a soft, muted backdrop. The sea star appears vivid and somewhat moist, suggesting recent removal from its aquatic environment for observation or study.","title":"Starfish at Hopkins Marine Institute (Stanford), where marine life of Monterey Bay waters is studied.","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["552943","546321","546115","543897","544579","557594","545706","552285","551622","545157","555023","543180","555060","553913","543178","555022"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["star","sea","sunflower","spine","removal","wrist","creature","strap","observation","living"]}
