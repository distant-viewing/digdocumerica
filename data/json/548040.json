{"path":"548040.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a street scene in a small town. Prominently featured in the foreground and hanging from a white building on the right side of the image is an oval-shaped, vintage illuminated sign that reads \"Cathlamet Fire Hall\" in ornate red and yellow text with embellishments. Attached to the sign is a smaller sign that says “Job's Daughters.”\n\nThis right side of the street is lined with two- to three-story buildings with simple, utilitarian architecture. On the left side of the image, a yellow two-tone Chevrolet pickup truck is parked heading out of the scene, indicating a road that's used by both parked and moving vehicles which include various cars from what appears to be the 1970s to early 1980s era based on their design.\n\nThe middle ground of the photograph shows more cars parked along the street and a few buildings of similar architectural style. The road seems to bend slightly ahead, leading towards a treeline and a hill in the background under a sky dotted with white, fluffy clouds. Power and utility lines intersect slightly above street level adding to the small-town, mid-century American vibe.\n\nOverall, the photograph has the feel of a quiet, possibly midday moment in a quaint, rural town with an atmosphere typical of the Pacific Northwest, evidenced by the architectural styles and natural background.","title":"The Riverside town of Cathlamet boasts a population of 656.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552526","550319","557155","557655","556564","556460","552602","551117","551106","558037","558028","546436","544882","554032","545610","548889"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["town","street","embellishment","treeline","sign","1980","pickup","midday","road","car"]}
