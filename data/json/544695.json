{"path":"544695.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a serene yet industrial landscape, dominated by elements of water, sky, and man-made structures. The foreground presents textured, mud-like terrain that appears slightly cracked and damp, reflecting some of the sky's light, which implies it might be wet or covered in shallow water.\n\nIn the middle distance, the focus shifts to a large body of still water that mirrors the sky and objects above it. A prominently featured electricity pylon stands directly in the water, with several power lines trailing off into the distance. The pylon's reflection in the water creates an almost symmetrical image cut by the horizon.\n\nFurther in the background, additional pylons recede into the distance alongside what appears to be a long, narrow causeway or bridge that bisects the water body horizontally, aiding in drawing the viewerâ€™s eye straight through the middle of the scene towards the horizon. The sky above is clear, suggesting early morning or late evening due to the softness and angle of the light, which casts a warm hue over the entire scene.\n\nThe overall composition and elements in this photograph create a tranquil scene but also subtly hint at the encroachment of industrial elements into natural settings.","title":"Leslie salt ponds","placename":"San Francisco (Calif.)","location":"San Francisco, California","nn1":["544673","545979","544690","552040","545167","558107","545862","544675","552717","543728","546109","553086","543058","552256","545854","544709"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pylon","featured","traile","water","distance","encroachment","bisect","electricity","softness","recede"]}
