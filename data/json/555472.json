{"path":"555472.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene of outdoor labor, primarily involving the cutting of large timber. In the foreground, a prominent cut log with visible rings sits horizontally, showing signs of recent sawing near its end. The bark of the tree is rough and patchy, indicating it has been exposed to elements or decay.\n\nBehind this log, there is a person dressed in a brown jacket and pants. The person is bending over while handling a chainsaw, evidently in the process of cutting another large log. The worker's head is not visible, focusing attention more on the action of sawing than on the individual.\n\nIn the background, there is a pile of similarly large logs and timber debris scattered around, suggesting a logging site. Also partially visible is a red vehicle, possibly used for hauling the logs, parked amidst the timber piles.\n\nThe entire scene is set in a bright daytime environment, casting sharp shadows and highlighting the textures of the wood and rough terrain around the work area. The setting looks somewhat remote due to the natural, undeveloped surroundings and the lack of any modern infrastructure aside from the logging equipment itself.","title":"Sawing and splitting of logs tossed on the beach near Lincoln City, was done to conserve electricity and find a way to beat prices of firewood which doubled during the months of the energy crisis in 1973-74","placename":"Lincoln City (Or.)","location":"Lincoln City, Oregon","nn1":["542773","542769","553608","542623","553602","553614","554415","542787","542786","554414","554411","554419","554416","542770","542785","542788"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","timber","cut","chainsaw","cutting","haul","pile","ring","logging","person"]}
