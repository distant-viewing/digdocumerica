{"path":"543828.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene from a landfill site filled with heaps of waste and debris. In the foreground, there is a muddy pathway, possibly from recent rain, giving the ground a slick, wet appearance. A prominent pile of garbage dominates the picture, composed of a mix of various items such as bags, discarded metal pieces, papers, and possibly some organic waste, reflecting a diverse accumulation of refuse.\n\nTo the right, partially buried in the waste, is a heavy machinery vehicle, likely a bulldozer or a similar type of equipment, which is mostly covered by trash but recognizable by its tracks and a part of its metallic structure visible at the top. This machinery is emitting smoke from its exhaust, indicating it is in operation despite being partially obscured by the trash, suggesting active work in progress at the site.\n\nThe background presents a semi-barren, open landscape with a hint of sparse vegetation, typical of a distant rural setting. The horizon shows a clear sky without any significant cloud cover, shining bright and indicating a sunny day, which contrasts with the grim and cluttered conditions of the landfill in the foreground. \n\nOverall, the composition captures not just the environmental impact of waste but also highlights ongoing efforts to manage and possibly compact the trash using heavy machinery, set against a natural and open landscape.","title":"Boulder County's landfill dump.
