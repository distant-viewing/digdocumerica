{"path":"542914.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph features a marine scene showing a waterfront building with the signage \"A. PALADINI\" prominently displayed. The building, which appears to be a warehouse or processing facility related to marine activities, is rustic, constructed from wood, and painted gray, with red accents around the balconies and windows. It is attached to a large wooden pier, extending out into a body of water.\n\nThere are several men visible; two are seated on crates on the pier, and two others are engaged in tasks around pallets stacked with additional crates. These crates suggest some sort of goods being loaded, unloaded, or stored, possibly related to fishing or other marine trade given the context of the location.\n\nThe water itself is calm, reflecting a tinge of blue from the sky, and the backdrop features lush green trees, forming a line atop a slightly elevated terrain. The scene conveys a busy, yet serene setting typical of a working dock area in a coastal community. On the right side of the image, beyond the pier, there are glimpses of other buildings and what appear to be power lines, indicating the proximity of a more populated area or town. The overall atmosphere is one of daily life and activity within a maritime community.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["548764","545061","545005","547033","550293","543465","548229","552216","548037","543409","548763","546998","550342","546871","550306","550307"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["crate","pier","pallet","trade","unload","tinge","community","relate","accent","balcony"]}
