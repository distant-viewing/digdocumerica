{"path":"542827.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph provides an aerial view of a heavily logged forest area, highlighting the extensive environmental impact of logging activities. The scene is characterized by a chaotic scattering of felled trees, branches, and stumps, covering the muddy ground extensively. The remaining standing trees are sparse compared to the quantity of timber that has been cut down, emphasizing the scale of deforestation. The terrain visible includes streaks and patches of brown earth intermixed with remnants of green foliage, indicating that the area may have once been densely vegetated.\n\nThe photograph also shows winding dirt tracks possibly used by logging vehicles, as indicated by the clearing paths and the central dirt road visible in the image. These tracks are muddy and seem to be wet, suggesting recent activity or rainfall in the area. The lighting appears dim, either from the time of day or due to overcast weather, casting an overall gloomy and somber mood on the scene. Additionally, some equipment or vehicles, appearing as small specks due to the aerial perspective, can be observed, potentially involved in ongoing logging operations.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment that exemplifies human intervention in natural landscapes, portraying the aftermath of extensive logging with a focus on environmental disruption.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542949","542832","545143","550354","542823","542828","542833","542947","542850","545272","542852","542948","542834","555085","555208","545138"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["log","fell","track","exemplify","scattering","quantity","deforestation","dirt","disruption","speck"]}
