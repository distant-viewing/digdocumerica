{"path":"542524.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a dominating presence of a large metal electricity pylon standing on a sparse hillside. The pylon is constructed from steel beams arranged in a lattice structure, and it supports multiple high-voltage power lines that extend across the frame. The background shows a dramatic landscape with a curving river cutting through a valley surrounded by forested mountains. The river appears to be in a gorge, with its banks partially exposed, suggesting low water levels. The scene is set under a clear blue sky and the natural environment suggests a remote, wilderness area. The terrain surrounding the pylon is rugged and covered with dry grass and small bushes, indicating a possibly arid or seasonally dry climate. The photo seems to capture a juxtaposition of human industrial development within a natural landscape.","title":"California--north fork of Kings River","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["544277","548136","547936","557977","543728","549110","548146","544355","542643","555574","544300","544613","545050","544296","553028","544695"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["pylon","gorge","voltage","lattice","electricity","river","hillside","steel","climate","beam"]}
