{"path":"551480.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and intriguing scene set in an urban environment, likely on a sunny day judged by the brightness and shadows evident.\n\nIn the foreground, a unique geometric water fountain made up of irregularly placed granite blocks creates a partial frame for the image. Some of these blocks channel flowing water that leads the eye towards the center of the image. Among these blocks, three young women are seated intimately on the ground around a collection of shopping bags and parcels, giving the impression they are on a break, possibly discussing their purchases or sharing plans. The woman on the left is eating, adding to the casual, relaxed atmosphere of the scene.\n\nIn the background, a bustling city street stretches across the frame. The street is lined with people across its width, suggesting an event that has gathered a crowd, or a busy urban area during peak hours. The crowd includes individuals who are walking, and the scene conveys a dynamic urban lifestyle.\n\nOverall, the composition effectively contrasts a serene, personal interaction in the foreground with the busy, less personal public space in the background, which highlights themes of private and public life in urban settings. The choice to capture the image through the granite elements of the fountain adds a textured, almost abstract quality to the setting, emphasizing the blend of natural and constructed elements in city spaces.","title":"Lunching and studying on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["551663","551449","550747","551647","551661","557258","553207","551772","553224","550762","550748","551793","553289","551858","551658","550752"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["block","fountain","crowd","parcel","purchase","eat","choice","width","shopping","discuss"]}
