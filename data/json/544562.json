{"path":"544562.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This aerial photograph depicts a picturesque waterfront residential area, characterized by a neat layout of homes and abundant greenery. The scene is captured during the day under clear blue skies which enhance the vibrancy of the environment.\n\nAt the center of the image lies a unique peninsular plot, around which the canal-like water body curves. This central peninsula is adorned with well-maintained tropical landscaping, featuring multiple species of palm trees and other lush plants, which add a rich green contrast to the scene. Positioned strategically on this land are several houses, each appearing to possess large windows and terraces aimed towards embracing the waterfront view. One notable structure has a prominent A-frame design, suggesting an architectural preference that complements the tropical, holiday-resort-like ambiance of the area.\n\nAdditional houses line the waterfront to the left of the peninsula. These homes appear similar in architectural style with flat roofs, light-colored walls, and generous outdoor spaces. Many properties can be seen equipped with personal docking facilities, indicating a boating culture among residents. The orderly arrangement of the houses along the water's edge demonstrates a well-planned community layout, aimed at maximizing the scenic view and accessibility to the water for every home.\n\nBeyond the immediate vicinity of the waterfront, denser vegetation can be observed, hinting at the less developed land or protected zones that provide a natural backdrop to this residential enclave. This natural buffer zone likely enhances the feeling of seclusion and exclusivity in the area.\n\nOverall, this photograph showcases a serene and affluent waterfront neighborhood, where both architecture and landscape design have been carefully executed to create a harmonious and attractive living environment.","title":"Waterfront development","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["544558","546951","552232","553931","553919","553928","546831","553925","557422","545896","553062","548781","547636","557454","548784","548780"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["waterfront","peninsula","home","aim","house","layout","zone","preference","buffer","maximize"]}
