{"path":"543368.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment involving a young girl and a deer in a rustic, outdoor setting. The girl, who appears to be in her early pre-teen years, is kneeling on a neatly maintained dirt path. She wears a bright red sleeveless top and navy blue shorts, complemented by classic white and blue sneakers. Her long brown hair is loose, and her posture and expression suggest a blend of quiet fascination and gentle composure as she observes the deer.\n\nThe deer, positioned on the other side of a weathered wooden fence, leans over towards the girl. It is a sizable animal, possibly a young buck, based on its lean frame and the visible small antlers. The deer's coat is smooth and is primarily of a brown color, blending harmoniously with the natural surroundings.\n\nThe setting is evidently pastoral and possibly part of a park or wildlife reserve, with verdant grass visible in the background and lush green foliage partially filling the scene. The wooden fence, rugged and worn, adds a charming, rustic touch to the composition. The atmosphere is tranquil and beautifully illuminated by what seems to be soft, natural sunlight, enhancing the calm and quiet interaction between the girl and the deer.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["543847","543279","544916","554619","545902","550802","546163","558368","554621","550803","546218","543839","542963","544114","553808","542955"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["deer","girl","fence","antler","navy","sneaker","reserve","year","wildlife","coat"]}
