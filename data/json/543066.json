{"path":"543066.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene coastal scene. In the foreground, there is a vibrant display of wildflowers and grasses that display a variety of colors, including reds, yellows, and purples. These plants are growing haphazardly, giving a wild and natural feel to the front of the image.\n\nThe middle ground features a dark sandy beach that curves gracefully along the coastline. The waves gently break into white foam as they approach the shore, creating rhythmic patterns on the beach. The sea appears calm and reflective under a clear blue sky.\n\nIn the background, atop a cliff overlooking the sea, there is a scattered group of houses and buildings, possibly a small coastal community. The houses are mostly white, which contrasts with the natural greenery of trees and bushes surrounding them. The overall setting is peaceful and picturesque, suggestive of a quiet and scenic retreat away from the bustle of city life.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554081","542968","547592","543399","543401","554082","543346","545101","543184","557429","543255","543363","553805","545215","543196","543199"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["beach","sea","bustle","retreat","house","foam","wildflower","purple","yellow","coastline"]}
