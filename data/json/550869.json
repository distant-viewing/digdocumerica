{"path":"550869.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene featuring a large factory complex. Prominently, a tall smokestack releases a thick plume of white smoke into the air, which curls and drifts against a pale blue sky spotted with light clouds. The factory buildings are robust and metallic, with multiple sections and visible infrastructure, including pipes and external staircases.\n\nIn front of the factory, there is a body of water, suggesting that the factory is located alongside a river or lake. On the near side of the water, there are piles of materials such as scrap metal or wood, indicating industrial operations or storage facilities nearby. The general atmosphere conveyed by the image is one of heavy industry and manufacturing, with a focus on the environmental impact highlighted by the smoke emission.\n\nThe color palette of the photo is a mix of industrial grays and blues, contrasted with the stark white of the smoke and the natural light blue of the sky. The scene is devoid of people, focusing instead on the industrial architecture and environmental elements.","title":"Charmin paper company at green bay contributes its share of smoke and sulfite odor to the heavily industrialized bay area.
