{"path":"552057.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"The photograph shows a close-up view of tangled and intertwined roots possibly from an uprooted tree. The roots vary in thickness and length, forming an intricate mesh. Most roots appear dark, some with hints of earth-tone colors, suggesting they may be covered in soil or perhaps they are naturally dark in color. There is no obvious soil or water visible around the roots, which could mean they have been cleaned or are suspended in some way.\n\nThe overall color palette of the image is quite dark, focusing on the natural and muddy tones of browns and blacks, enhanced slightly by hints of lighter beige or silver from some roots that catch the light. The background is blurred and nondescript, enhancing the focus on the detailed texture and organic chaos of the roots themselves. There appears to be no human activity or any other object in the frame that distracts from the primary subject of the tree roots. The composition and the subdued lighting give an almost abstract quality to the image, making the roots appear as a natural sculpture.","title":"Trees and brush uncovered by the receding waters of the Kansas River in the area of the 12th Street bridge sewer outlet.
