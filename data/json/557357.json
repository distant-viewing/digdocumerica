{"path":"557357.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"This photograph captures two young girls seated on a porch swing. The older girl, on the left, wears a black and white striped dress with long sleeves and clutches a metal chain supporting the swing. She has a serious expression, and her long, dark hair falls loosely around her shoulders. The younger girl, on the right side, wears a sleeveless orange dress with a pattern of white dots and trim. Her dark hair is also long and she has a playful, squinting smile. She rests her arms on the porch railing, also formed of weathered, white-painted wood similar to the material of the swing.\n\nThe setting suggests a relaxed, homey environment. The porch is rustic, with visible wear on the wood surfaces and chipped paint, lending to the casual and comfortable atmosphere of the scene. The background includes part of the porch railing and a hint of the yard beyond, overgrown and green, indicating a rural or suburban setting. Daylight illuminates the girls, casting soft shadows and reinforcing a warm, inviting tone to the photograph.","title":"Sandy Watkins left, and sister, Diane, enjoy the porch and swing at their new home. The family was forced to move when their house in the Mulkey Square area of Kansas City, Missouri, (across town) was condemned as a part of an interstate highway project. The Watkins are happy with their new home because the heating system is better and the place is cleaner than the old house. It took the family two months to find rental housing within their price range ($80 per month).","placename":"Kansas City (Kan.)","location":"Kansas City, Kansas","nn1":["557363","545436","551005","556546","553498","555580","548965","553500","546781","555941","553484","543538","543875","553502","550109","543854"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["swing","girl","porch","railing","dress","wood","dot","hair","trim","chain"]}
