{"path":"544500.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of multiple brown pelicans in varying stages of flight and landing on the surface of a blue sea. The pelicans dominate the image with their large, outstretched wings and distinctive long beaks, some of which are pointed downwards as though they are attempting to catch fish. Splashes of water rise around the birds, emphasizing their vigorous movement.\n\nThe background features a calm sea merging with a clear sky on the horizon. The lighting indicates a bright sunny day, casting vibrant shades of blue over the sea and sky, which contrast sharply with the earthy tones of the pelicans. The energy and chaos in the birds' actions provide a lively focal point, conveying the wildness and immediacy of nature in action.","title":"Pelicans on Little Pavillon Key at 10,000 Islands","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552911","555554","550903","552238","545302","552909","548728","544611","552912","544559","553347","557125","545187","550889","544609","543273"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["pelican","sea","bird","action","immediacy","wildness","beak","landing","chaos","wing"]}
