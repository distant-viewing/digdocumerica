{"path":"542573.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This image features a detailed view of young plants emerging from the soil. In the center, there are two primary sprouts, characterized by elongated, capsule-like tops that are dark in color, possibly brown or black. These structures are likely seed pods or protective covers for the developing plant. Each of these stems is surrounded by slender, green, needle-like leaves that gracefully arch outward in a fountain-like manner, adding a delicate texture to the composition.\n\nThe background of the photograph is softly blurred, providing a mix of neutral tones that range from light brown to gray, accentuating the sharp focus on the plants in the foreground. The earth in which the plants are growing appears rich and organic, scattered with bits of decayed wood, small fragments of litter, and what looks like the remains of old plant matter. This detailed close-up perspective not only highlights the intricate early growth stages of the plants but also captures the natural environment of a forest floor or a similarly fertile outdoor setting.","title":"Seedlings","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["543622","555053","553361","542574","555004","553074","552428","555039","555040","557617","554993","558079","543620","552111","555884","555093"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["plant","sprout","seed","like","matter","fountain","needle","fragment","stem","emerge"]}
