{"path":"554980.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph depicts an intricate and densely vegetated forest scene. The scene is covered with a mix of tree branches, some of which are bare and leafless suggesting it might be either wintertime or a seasonal shedding period. Others are cluttered with thick patches of green foliage, evident of a healthy undergrowth possibly in a moist or temperate climate.\n\nThe trees are covered in a variety of moss and lichen, adding a vibrant green texture and indicating high moisture in the air, typical of forested areas that receive ample rainfall. Additionally, there are clusters of small white flowers blooming on some of the shrubbery, adding a contrast to the predominantly green palette.\n\nIn terms of composition, the image has a slightly dark tone, with natural diffused lighting that seeps through the dense foliage, highlighting the intricacies of the forest undergrowth and tangled branches. There is no visible sky, due to the thickness of the canopy above.\n\nThere are no human figures or man-made structures visible in the image, offering a pure view of natural wilderness. The focus is entirely on the natural elements, creating a sense of depth and complexity through the intertwining of branches and leaves.\n\nThis photograph can evoke a feeling of being enveloped in nature, capturing the lush, sometimes chaotic growth patterns of a forest environment, and emphasizing themes of growth, decay, and the cycle of nature.","title":"Vine maple covered with club-mosses in the Queets Corridor of the Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["555054","554961","555058","554976","555043","554985","555183","545285","546947","554425","543487","554958","558012","542958","555000","554975"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["undergrowth","branch","growth","forest","thickness","intricacy","cycle","foliage","rainfall","shrubbery"]}
