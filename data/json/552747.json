{"path":"552747.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a young girl standing in an empty urban lot. She is wearing a red long-sleeve top and red and white checkered trousers. She is positioned slightly off-center to the left of the frame, looking towards the camera with a neutral expression.\n\nThe background is dominated by a large wall, smeared with various graffiti in multiple colors, creating a vivid and somewhat chaotic backdrop. The graffiti is illegible, consisting of various scribbles, marks, and amateur tags that do not form any recognizable words or images.\n\nThe ground is strewn with debris and patches of grass, suggesting neglect or disuse of the space. The overall atmosphere evokes a sense of abandonment and urban decay, providing a stark contrast to the presence of the child, who seems out of place against the rugged backdrop. The lighting in the image indicates it might be either early morning or late afternoon, casting soft light across the scene. The setting, combined with the subject and condition of the backdrop, evokes a narrative of resilience or defiance in a rough urban environment.","title":"Boy in back alley in North Philadelphia","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["552758","552763","556164","547182","553476","553506","551926","556166","551924","551727","553501","549865","552961","552957","553495","553494"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["graffiti","tag","backdrop","disuse","mark","resilience","word","girl","lot","narrative"]}
