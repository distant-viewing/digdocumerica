{"path":"543737.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a male individual in a crouching position examining a scaled urban model. He holds a small brush or similar tool in one hand, suggesting he is either adjusting or cleaning the model. The model includes various block-like structures that are likely representing buildings, streets, and other elements of an urban landscape. The structures are of different sizes and arranged in a seemingly planned layout, mimicking a cityscape.\n\nThe lighting in the scene casts multiple shadows and highlights on the model, emphasizing its three-dimensional aspect and adding depth to the photograph. The background is dimly lit, focusing the viewer's attention primarily on the central activity in the foreground.\n\nNotably, some of the blocks are labeled (e.g., one reads \"FOURTH ST\"), indicating that specific locations or streets are being represented in the model. This detail suggests the model is used for urban planning or architectural purposes, allowing for a detailed examination and modification of city layouts. \n\nThe overall ambiance is slightly futuristic yet meticulous, capturing a moment of careful consideration and planning in the realm of urban development or study.","title":"Experimental wind tunnel device built at Colorado state university.
