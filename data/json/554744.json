{"path":"554744.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a cluster of plants, specifically focusing on their leaves. The leaves are elongated and have a complex interplay of colors. The predominant color palette ranges from deep burgundy to reddish-purple, with some leaves featuring hints of green, especially around the veins. The texture of the leaves appears somewhat leathery, and each leaf has a visibly pronounced vein structure that adds to the depth of the photo.\n\nThe background is blurred but consists of similar tones, perhaps indicating a ground covered in fallen leaves or bushland, lending a sense of denseness and lushness to the scene. The image has a naturalistic feel, with soft, diffused lighting likely from an overcast or shaded environment, which enhances the rich colors of the leaves. The composition is tightly framed, bringing viewers into an intimate proximity with the flora, almost as if placed within the undergrowth of a forest floor. The focus and detailing on the leaves suggest a celebration of seasonal change, possibly autumn, evidenced by the vibrant hues and the mature state of the foliage.","title":"Low cranberry in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"Adirondack Mountains (N.Y.)","location":"Adirondack Mountains, New York","nn1":["551356","557168","554743","544731","552693","546011","542686","554993","557539","555192","555041","557593","543620","542688","550461","555093"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["leave","vein","burgundy","lushness","undergrowth","celebration","leaf","flora","change","proximity"]}
