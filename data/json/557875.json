{"path":"557875.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"The image captures a scene at a vehicle inspection station. The focal point of the photograph is a light-colored Volkswagen Beetle car, parked inside a garage with an open gate. There are two large 'STOP' signs, one on either side of the entrance wall, directly visible to the car driver and echoing the instruction. Directly above each 'STOP' sign are signs that state \"INSPECTION FEE $3.75.\"\n\nOn the left side of the frame, placed slightly away from the garage entrance, is a wooden, A-frame style barricade. A man, possibly a worker at the station, is seen walking away from the garage on the right side, heading towards the outdoor area illuminated with sunlight. The garage itself has an industrial look, with a simple, robust construction and functionality clearly emphasized.\n\nIn the background, just beyond the garage, is a street scene visible through the opposing garage doorway where other vehicles and traffic lights are evident, indicating that the location is likely urban or suburban. The environment features bright, natural daylight contrasting with the shadowed interior of the garage, highlighting the different areas within the photograph. The overall ambiance is utilitarian and straightforward, centered around everyday transportation activities.","title":"Car has just entered the safety lane at an auto emission inspection station in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["557825","557839","557905","557853","542763","557921","557850","557824","557924","557852","557845","557836","557887","557902","557903","557859"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["garage","inspection","stop","entrance","station","barricade","echo","instruction","sign","gate"]}
