{"path":"554304.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The image is a close-up photograph of numerous compressed metal blocks, likely taken at a scrapyard or recycling facility. Each block is tightly compressed with various types of scrap materials including twisted metal, chunks of different metals, possibly parts of machinery or vehicles. The colors of the metal vary from shiny silver to rusted browns and even some patches of color from painted surfaces. The dense packing of the materials suggests the use of a powerful baler or compactor that has crushed these items into neat, albeit irregular, cuboid shapes.\n\nNotable elements in the image include visible fragments like bent wires, crushed cylindrical objects, and wrinkled sheets of metal, reflecting light differently due to their uneven surfaces. Additionally, some numbers (like '2091') and fragments of text can be seen on the surfaces of some blocks, possibly identifiers or remnants from the original objects before they were compressed.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph focuses on the texture and varied color tones of the metal scraps, giving a visual testament to the process of industrial recycling and waste management. The dark spaces between the blocks add contrast and depth to the image, emphasizing the three-dimensional forms of the densely packed metal blocks.","title":"Auto scrap yard","placename":"Jersey City (N.J.)","location":"Jersey City, New Jersey","nn1":["554301","557308","554358","554317","547611","551517","548753","554318","554357","546261","554300","545151","550880","554320","547610","554352"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Industrial Waste"],"terms":["block","metal","recycling","fragment","scrap","compactor","testament","chunk","scrapyard","surface"]}
