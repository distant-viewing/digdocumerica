{"path":"542942.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph presents a high-angle aerial view of an industrial logging facility. The scene is densely packed with various elements mainly associated with timber processing and storage. The center of the image features several large buildings with metal roofs, possibly warehouses or processing units, which are surrounded by an assortment of heavy machinery, piles of logs, and lumber stacks. These structured piles of timber are arranged in clear, rectangular zones, some covered with bright yellow tarpaulins, likely for protection against weather conditions.\n\nA distinct smoky column rises from what seems to be a small burner or incinerator near the center of the composition. This introduces a textural contrast in the image, with the smoke diffusing into the somewhat overcast sky.\n\nDark forested areas surround the facility, providing a natural border and emphasizing the human intrusion into the landscape. The darker tones of the trees also serve as a backdrop that highlights the industrial activities and man-made structures. A winding dirt road, possibly serving as the main access point to the facility, appears from one edge and snakes through to the buildings, dotted with vehicles which provide a sense of scale and operation.\n\nThe photograph is taken during a daytime setting given the visibility and shadows, with lighting that appears natural yet slightly subdued, possibly due to cloud cover, contributing to the somber and industrial ambiance of the scene.","title":"Lumbermill","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545011","542940","542941","542945","545256","543749","552163","552162","545260","546236","552199","542944","542515","552198","542921","552140"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["timber","facility","burner","pile","serve","intrusion","lumber","introduce","protection","logging"]}
