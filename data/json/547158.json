{"path":"547158.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"The photograph captures a moment at a beachfront where a man, dressed in a dark jacket, is interacting with a bicycle on a concrete seawall or pier. The man appears to be holding onto the bicycle, which is partly covered by the water, suggesting that perhaps the bicycle was retrieved from or is being protected against the incoming waves.\n\nThe background features rough, turbulent seawater with waves cresting and foam forming as they crash near the shore. The sky is clear with few clouds, indicating a windy but sunny day. The composition emphasizes the contrast between the stationary man and bicycle against the dynamic, forceful movement of the sea.\n\nThe colors in the image are somewhat muted, giving it a slightly vintage or aged feel, typical for film photography, which adds to the dramatic and somewhat solitary mood of the scene. The horizon is visible, slightly off-center, enhancing the sense of openness and breadth of the seascape. There are some vertical poles sticking out of the water near the seawall, probably part of a structural barrier or old pier remnants, adding a sense of depth and layering to the image.","title":"Wave crashes over seawall, taking an elderly bicycle rider by surprise.","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["548531","545086","547595","547139","547155","554002","554004","543497","550826","547913","547143","547091","547118","545077","557535","543073"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["bicycle","pier","beachfront","wave","breadth","layering","seascape","openness","photography","foam"]}
