{"path":"543517.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil moment between two people on a sandy beach. The image shows a man and a child, both seated on the sand close to the water's edge. The man is reclining back, with one arm resting along his leg and the other presumably supporting the child. The child embraces him from behind, resting their chin on his shoulder. Both individuals are casually dressed, suitable for a leisurely day by the sea. The man wears sunglasses, a plaid shirt, and dark pants, while the child is in a light green top and dark headband. \n\nThe lighting suggests it's either early morning or late afternoon, casting long shadows and a soft, warm glow on the sand. The beach itself appears peaceful and uncrowded with only the smooth, gentle lapping of water at the shore visible behind them. The composition emphasizes a serene and intimate connection between the two, amidst the natural beauty of the beach setting.","title":"Nevada -- lake tahoe, California","placename":"Tahoe, Lake (Calif. and Nev.)","location":"Tahoe, Lake, California","nn1":["552977","548805","543499","548696","548793","545194","554901","543493","547877","548465","550923","546413","551544","543225","547009","552975"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["child","beach","sand","headband","rest","recline","embrace","chin","man","plaid"]}
