{"path":"555668.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph captures a small, alert ground squirrel standing upright on a rocky mountainous terrain. The foreground shows a sloped surface covered with patches of snow. The main focus, the squirrel, is positioned on dark, jagged rocks, which dominate the middle portion of the image. The squirrel has a light brown fur coat with a paler belly, and it is looking intently towards something outside the frame, possibly sensing danger or surveying its surroundings.\n\nThe background consists primarily of more dark, rugged rocks that form a natural barrier that appears both chaotic and structured due to the angular formations of the stones. The color palette of the scene is predominantly shades of dark grey from the rocks and white from the snow, providing a natural contrast that highlights the presence of the small mammal in this harsh environment. The imagery evokes a sense of solitude and the adaptability of wildlife in rugged terrains.","title":"This parka squirrel makes his home among the Boulders at the foot of Worthington Glacier.
