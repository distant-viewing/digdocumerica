{"path":"545234.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph features a stunning sunset scene at a beach. The sun is visible as a large, round, glowing orb positioned close to the horizon, with its light reflecting brilliantly on the water's surface and the wet sand. It is partly obscured by a distant rocky headland which protrudes into the water and is silhouetted against the bright sky. This headland is topped with dense, dark green foliage, contrasting dramatically with the warm tones of the sky.\n\nThe sky itself gradates from a deep, fiery orange near the sun, blending into softer shades of yellow and then to a dusky pink and darkening upwards into a deeper blue at the top of the frame. Small, subtle clouds are scattered near the position of the sun, bathed in its radiant light.\n\nIn the foreground, a large expanse of water reflects the golden hues of the sky. A section of the beach is visible with its smooth, reflective wet sand creating a mirror image of the sunset colors. There is a lone figure in a small boat, which is positioned near the middle of the image on the water, adding a sense of scale and human element to the vast natural landscape. The scene is tranquil and serene, suggestive of a quiet, reflective moment in a natural setting. Additionally, a series of vertical stakes, possibly part of a disused aquatic structure, jut out of the water near the boat, creating some geometric interest and leading the eye back towards the figure and the sunset.","title":"Fisherman beaches his boat at sunset at the river mouth of the quinault river","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["550288","550296","545238","543144","550292","547479","553990","543143","543880","557447","548123","552294","544251","551215","544711","550303"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","sun","sand","position","beach","orb","stake","water","figure","boat"]}
