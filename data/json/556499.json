{"path":"556499.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This photograph captures a tall industrial chimney whose exterior is wrapped in red and white stripes, emanating a thick plume of white smoke against a mostly clear blue sky with few scattered clouds. Adjacent to the chimney is a large industrial building complex with exposed steel frameworks and sections enclosed by grey paneling. There are multiple levels visible in the building's structure, suggesting a complex of considerable size and function, likely part of a power plant or manufacturing facility. In the foreground, a parking lot filled with cars of various colors suggests the size and operational capacity of the facility, indicating a significant workforce. A standalone street lamp post is also visible in the foreground, lending an urban infrastructure feel to the setting. The general atmosphere of the photograph conveys industrial activity and environmental impact, framed under a broad daylight setting.","title":"Tennessee Valley Authority steam plant at Cumberland City, Tennessee, near Clarksville, one of the most modern in the world.
