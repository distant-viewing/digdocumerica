{"path":"544540.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a dense mangrove forest intersected by a network of water-filled channels and pathways. The scene captures the rich greenery of the mangroves extending into the horizon under a bright sky. The channels, appearing dark compared to the vibrant surrounding foliage, twist and turn as they carve their way through the forest. The pathways, likely used for access and possibly for maintenance, run straight, dividing the forest into sections while providing contrast with their lighter color against the dark and green tones of the natural landscape. No human activity or constructions are visible in the immediate view, highlighting the untamed and natural state of this ecological environment.","title":"Saga development","placename":"Perrine (Fla.)","location":"Perrine, Florida","nn1":["544506","548787","544786","544493","558046","545114","544556","544624","554964","556906","550626","548603","547011","550601","544649","550620"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["mangrove","channel","pathway","forest","twist","carve","intersect","divide","compare","access"]}
