{"path":"555691.jpg","date":"August 1974","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This image captures a picturesque landscape dominated by a wide, possibly glacial river in the foreground. The river exhibits a milky turquoise hue possibly due to mineral sediment. Across the river, an industrial or commercial waterfront can be seen, consisting of various buildings, tanks, and sheds, perhaps indicative of a small port or processing facility. \n\nBeyond this human activity area, majestic mountains rise abruptly. These mountains are lush with greenery at lower elevations, transitioning to rockier and possibly snow-capped peaks. The mountains’ dramatic slopes and ridges suggest a rugged and possibly volcanic topography, adding a striking natural backdrop to the scene.\n\nThe lighting suggests it is a clear day with few clouds, casting sharp, well-defined shadows and contributing to the vividness of the river’s color and the detailed texture of the mountains and vegetation. The composition effectively blends industrial elements with natural beauty, showcasing a harmonious interaction between human development and the environment.","title":"A sea level view looking southeast toward the terminal site and Valdez.
