{"path":"554056.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph showcases an expansive agricultural field captured from a high vantage point, emphasizing the vastness and organized structure of the cultivation. The field consists of multiple long, parallel rows that appear to be various crops or possibly covered crops as indicated by alternate strips of darker soil or mulch. The earth is richly colored, suggesting the soil might be fertile and perhaps freshly tilled.\n\nA dirt path snakes through the farm, enhancing the structured appearance of the landscape. On this path, one person is visible walking along it. They appear small compared to the enormity of the field, emphasizing the scale of agricultural operations. This person looks like a farmer or field worker, possibly inspecting the crops or heading to another part of the farm.\n\nThe overall environment is bathed in a warm, possibly late-day light, casting a gentle, hazy glow across the scene and enriching the earthy tones of the soil and vegetation. This lighting adds a soft, serene quality to the busy agricultural setting.\n\nThe image captures the essence of large-scale farming and the meticulous effort involved in maintaining such an extensive area of cultivated land. It provides a visual narrative of agriculture, rural life, and the interplay between human endeavor and natural landscape management.","title":"Aerial view of a tract of pineapple saved from urban development.
