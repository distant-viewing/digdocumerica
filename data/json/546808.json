{"path":"546808.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene featuring a large factory or plant located near a body of water. The composition focuses on several tall smokestacks emitting thick plumes of white and gray smoke into the sky. The atmospheric conditions suggest pollution, contributing to a somewhat hazy and overcast sky. The plant itself is densely packed with multiple structures, including buildings and more stacks, and appears to be active, indicated by the smoke emissions.\n\nIn the foreground, the calm water adds a contrasting natural element to the industrial activity. All elements are within a single frame, giving a comprehensive view of the industrial landscape's impact on its surroundings. The color palette is somewhat muted, with industrial grays, blues, and the white of the smoke dominating the scene. This photograph could be from a historical period, as indicated by the apparent age of the film and its aesthetic, capturing the environmental impact of industrial activity.","title":"Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrows Point","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["548068","550869","550336","550956","550329","546908","550868","550875","552210","550328","546884","543005","550716","551026","550981","552179"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smoke","impact","plant","emission","film","white","plume","smokestack","gray","factory"]}
