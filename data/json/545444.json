{"path":"545444.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a vibrant carnival or fair. In the foreground, a woman stands holding a large stack of colorful rings intended for a ring toss game. She has short hair, and is dressed in a polka dot shirt, glancing pensively to her side. Her expression and body language suggest a moment of quiet or reflection amidst the bustling activity around her.\n\nThe background is lively and chaotic, crowded with people and an abundance of bright colors. To the left, there is a light-colored decorative balloon with the text “SEX I tried it. I like it” printed on it, reflecting the bold and perhaps cheeky atmosphere of the fair. To the right, a sign partially visible reads \"1 RING 3 RING BLU,\" hinting at the rules or prices of a game booth, potentially the one the woman is operating.\n\nMultiple inflatables and other carnival prizes can be seen hanging around the booth, adding to the festive and cluttered look of the setting. The lighting is dim, suggesting that the photo was taken in the evening, which adds a warm and moody feel to the image.\n\nOverall, the picture captures a typical moment of leisure and entertainment at a carnival, highlighted by the expressions and activities of the people within it, as well as the vividness of the fairground environment.","title":"State fair","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["545454","551385","545460","545461","545464","551298","551689","545465","551688","545449","545459","558295","551808","551299","551325","558252"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["booth","ring","game","festive","rule","like","try","glance","entertainment","balloon"]}
