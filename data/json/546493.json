{"path":"546493.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"The photograph shows a scene with an architectural and human element. A woman is walking towards a large, modernist building with a distinct urban feel. The building is constructed with a dark brick façade, featuring tall, narrow windows set between vertical concrete pillars. These windows are reflective, mirroring some trees and open sky.\n\nThe woman is captured from behind, walking up a series of wide shallow steps towards the entrance of the building, suggesting that she may be heading to work or an appointment there. She is dressed in a professional manner, wearing a dark skirt and a light-colored blouse under a dark vest, paired with dark shoes. She also carries a dark handbag.\n\nIn the background, aside from the building, there is a hint of greenery and another part of what looks like a parked bicycle to one side, hinting at this being a public or semi-public space, possibly an educational or corporate campus. The setting is bathed in sunlight, indicating that the photo was taken on a clear day. The overall atmosphere is quiet and orderly.","title":"Cleo Rogers Memorial Library","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546506","546489","546518","546498","546531","546539","546528","546464","549916","546532","553537","546515","546526","546431","551723","557281"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["campus","handbag","walk","pillar","building","vest","bicycle","façade","manner","skirt"]}
