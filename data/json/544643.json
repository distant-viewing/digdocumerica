{"path":"544643.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a large industrial operation, likely related to dredging or similar activity, in a flooded or aquatic area. The central focus is a large industrial barge equipped with heavy machinery, including cranes and silos. The barge is surrounded by murky water and appears to be connected to several long floating barriers - possibly aimed at controlling sediment or contaminants.\n\nSeveral narrow land strips or makeshift pathways are visible, some have equipment or small structures on them. To the left, thereâ€™s a bridge-like structure running parallel to another structure that seems to be supporting a conveyor belt system, likely used to move materials.\n\nThe surrounding area is predominantly water, with patches of green vegetation. The body of water is quite large and seems to encompass mostly undeveloped land, visible in the distant background, hinting at a secluded or industrial-dedicated area. The overall scene is busy with industrial activity but isolated, focusing mainly on the operations occurring on and around the barge.","title":"Reclaiming land at Marco Island","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552206","550960","555808","544636","551565","548361","544639","547129","552208","548200","552209","552836","551980","548641","548356","544646"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["barge","dredging","land","operation","silo","sediment","strip","belt","barrier","pathway"]}
