{"path":"552741.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial or waste disposal setting contrasted with elements of nature. In the foreground, there's a focus on a slender plant with sunlit, yellow flowers and green leaves, growing seemingly out of a ground scattered with debris and rubble. This gives an immediate impression of resilience and life amidst desolation.\n\nDominating the midground is a large pile of what appears to be scrap metal or industrial waste, suggesting the area could be a dumping ground or recycling facility. Parts of this pile have a dark, rusty color, indicating oxidation and exposure to elements over time. Essentially, this pile divides the background from the foreground, creating separate visual segments in the composition.\n\nThe background features a structural setup that further points to an industrial environment. There’s a light-colored factory or processing plant, equipped with machinery and different processing levels. The buildings are semi-obscured by the mounds of waste, but their presence signifies ongoing industrial activities.\n\nOverhead, the sky is clear and blue, providing a stark contrast to the earthy and metallic tones of the industrial waste below. There are no visible human figures or movement in the scene, focusing the viewer's attention on the interplay between industrial activity and natural resilience showcased by the growing plant amidst harsh conditions.\n\nThis juxtaposition powerfully highlights themes of environmental impact and nature’s persistence, prompting reflection on human industrial practices and their consequences on the natural world.","title":"Flowers bloom in a junkyard","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["545993","546056","545989","551521","550995","544519","546055","557283","542552","557377","546409","552154","543687","543013","548194","552544"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["waste","pile","grow","resilience","processing","prompt","plant","consequence","recycling","rubble"]}
