{"path":"555616.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor landscape dominated by soft, rolling hills and a clear blue sky. In the foreground, there is a field of scattered rocks and stones, suggesting rough, uneven terrain. The middle ground features more rolling hills, some of which are covered with light green vegetation, creating a contrast with the barren foreground. A prominent feature in the photo is a large hill or mound on the right, characterized by a steep, exposed cliff face that reveals geological layers. This formation hints at possible erosion or other natural processes shaping the landscape. The top of this hill and others in the background are smoother and covered with grass, contrasting with the rugged features below. The horizon meets a clear, unclouded sky, suggesting a tranquil, remote setting far from urban areas. This composition underscores a sense of isolation and the extensive scale of natural environments.","title":"New landscapes are created in southeastern Ohio after coal companies have strip mined.
