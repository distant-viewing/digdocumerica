{"path":"545020.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts an expansive outdoor landscape viewed under a sky partly covered with clouds, creating a dramatic effect with areas of blue sky and cloud shadows. The scene captures a wide, flat valley with several large industrial facilities emitting plumes of smoke or steam, which are clearly visible against the sky and contribute to a sense of ongoing industrial activity.\n\nIn the foreground, the landscape consists primarily of greenery which could be fields or low vegetation, and hints at a rural setting. There is also a view of calm water, likely a river or lake, which reflects the sky and adds a visual contrast to the industrial elements.\n\nIn the more distant background, the terrain rises gently into what appears to be a low mountain range or hills, partially obscured by haze or mist. This backdrop gives a sense of depth and scale to the scene, emphasizing the expansive nature of the environment. There are no visible people or moving objects in the scene, directing the focus entirely on the interplay between nature and industry. The overall mood conveyed by the image is somewhat serene yet underscored by human activity, highlighting a juxtaposition between natureâ€™s calmness and industrial endeavors.","title":"Looking across the Columbia River toward Longview, where the Kaiser Aluminum plant and the Weyerhauser pulp mill create smog.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545013","547539","543668","545048","551555","545042","543981","550672","545112","543813","549191","546073","552190","551061","557374","551026"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["nature","endeavor","calmness","plume","steam","mist","haze","valley","industry","interplay"]}
