{"path":"557269.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Alexandrowicz, John L.","caption":"This photograph depicts a city park setting that showcases a blend of natural, historical, and modern urban elements. The foreground is dominated by a historical marker plaque, providing information about the preservation of the remnants of the original rampart walls of the Music Bastion and curtain wall from Fort Pitt, excavated and restored in 1965. Slightly behind the plaque, there is an overgrown earthen mound, presumably part of the historic fortifications mentioned on the plaque.\n\nBeyond the historical features, the scene opens up into a spacious grassy area lined with pathways, leading up to a backdrop of large high-rise buildings. Prominently featured among these buildings is the one labeled \"Hilton,\" indicating it's a Hilton hotel. The architecture of the buildings is typical of mid-20th-century design, featuring clean lines and a somewhat boxy appearance. \n\nThe sky is partly cloudy but allows enough sunlight to brighten the scene, giving the urban park a welcoming and open feel. On the left, a vehicle, which seems to be a tram or a light rail, moves along the street, adding an element of urban transportation to the scene. The overall composition of the photograph captures the interplay between the city's past heritage and its modern development.","title":"Bastions of historic Fort Pitt are marked by a plaque in the Gateway Center area of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania park-like settings stressing plantings of various kinds, sculpture and pools were features during the urban renewal renaissance program of the early 1950's.
