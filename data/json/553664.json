{"path":"553664.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features an older model, yellow tractor on a dusty, unpaved road. The tractor is equipped with large rear wheels and smaller front wheels, displaying signs of wear and use. A man, wearing a dark long-sleeve shirt and pants, steers the tractor. Attached to the back of the tractor is a plow, suggesting that it might be used for agricultural purposes.\n\nThe setting is a dry, arid landscape with rolling hills in the background, covered sparsely in short, sparse vegetation indicative of a desert or semi-desert region. The sky is partly cloudy, which provides a mildly overcast but bright daylight, casting soft shadows on the ground. The road ahead runs straight into the distance, bordered by the rugged terrain. This scene implies a rural or remote area, focused on agricultural activities.","title":"Buddy Vidovich, Paiute electrician and farmer, drives his John Deere seeder along road bordering the Truckee River near Wadsworth.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["542533","547436","555878","553665","553662","555879","554204","544319","557521","544323","555565","554203","555619","543671","545893","557697"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["tractor","wheel","road","desert","daylight","model","wear","back","sleeve","purpose"]}
