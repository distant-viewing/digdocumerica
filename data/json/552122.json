{"path":"552122.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Paik, Kenneth","caption":"In the photograph, there is a man standing in a small boat, actively engaged in the process of fishing. He is in the midst of casting his fishing rod, with his posture and arms extended, suggesting a dynamic motion. The man is wearing casual attire which consists of a light-colored shirt, dark pants, and a light-colored hat, which appears to be a Fedora.\n\nThe boat is equipped with various fishing and boating gear. Notably, there is a submerged box-like object tied to the side of the boat, potentially a bait or catch container. Additionally, there are visible elements such as a small round table, another fishing rod propped up, a bucket, and a lit lantern providing light, which might suggest it's early morning or late evening.\n\nThe surrounding water is calm with small ripples, indicating a serene environment, possibly a lake or a slow-moving river. The background is filled solely by the expanse of water, emphasizing the solitude and the singular focus of the person fishing. The overall ambience is quiet and concentrated, typical of a fishing scenario. The color palette of the photo leans towards darker and purple hues, feeding into the tranquil and dimly-lit setting.","title":"Warren Freeman, 50, built a cottage on an island in the Kansas River.
