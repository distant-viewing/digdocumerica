{"path":"547982.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"The photograph depicts two men standing amidst a vast landscape of debris and wreckage. There's a sense of desolation in the scene, emphasizing a disaster or aftermath scenario. The ground is littered with fragmented pieces of metal, wood, and other unidentifiable materials that give the impression of a severe incident, possibly an explosion or crash.\n\nThe man on the left wears darker clothing and stands facing away from the camera, looking towards the other man or perhaps surveying the area. He seems contemplative or focused on the situation at hand. The man on the right, wearing lighter clothing, stands with his side facing the camera, holding what appears to be a stick or a small tool, possibly used to sift through the wreckage.\n\nThe background is relatively barren and flat, emphasizing a remote or desolate location. The sky is overcast, casting a dull light over the scene and contributing to the grim atmosphere. There are minimal features or landmarks in the distant background, which focuses attention on the two figures and the extensive spread of debris.\n\nThis photo evokes a strong sense of urgency and the harsh realities of disaster recovery, highlighting the human element amid chaos and destruction.","title":"Men hunt for scrap metal in debris of landfill operation on Jamaica Bay","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551089","551949","542547","551088","554437","556445","547868","553639","545685","555872","553611","547906","545520","545649","555852","544583"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["wreckage","disaster","incident","survey","recovery","clothing","urgency","man","reality","chaos"]}
