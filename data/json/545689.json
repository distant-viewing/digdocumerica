{"path":"545689.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a group of tourists at a scenic overlook, likely within a canyon or desert area. There are five individuals in the frame, each wearing casual outdoor attire and hats, suitable for a sunny day. Four of these people are seated or standing at the edge of a cliff, gazing out over a vast landscape, while one person stands slightly apart from the group on a rocky edge, also enjoying the view.\n\nThe landscape depicted is dramatic and expansive, characterized by deep red and orange rocky cliffs that form rugged terrains and steep canyon walls. A winding river cuts through the canyon base, enhancing the visual depth of the scene. The river's meandering path is visible in multiple areas due to the high vantage point of the photograph.\n\nIn the background, the canyon extends into the distance under a clear blue sky, with no significant vegetation visible, emphasizing the arid environment. This setting suggests a location that could be part of a larger national park or protected area known for its unique geological features and breathtaking views.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its wide-angle perspective on nature's grandeur contrasted against the human figures taking in the scenery, evokes a sense of awe and scale. This is a vivid portrayal of outdoor exploration and the enjoyment of natural landscapes.","title":"The view from dead horse point: canyonlands and the Colorado river","placename":"Dead Horse Point State Park (Utah)","location":"Dead Horse Point State Park, Utah","nn1":["553964","553965","553962","545782","545780","544903","545700","545702","545694","545601","544917","545705","545693","545764","544931","554491"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","cliff","awe","portrayal","tourist","group","know","overlook","river","protect"]}
