{"path":"549338.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil coastal scene with a striking rocky shoreline. A series of large, irregularly-shaped white rocks form a rugged breakwater that stretches into the body of water, which appears to be a lake or a calm sea. The rocks are massive and have sharp, angular surfaces that suggest they are likely quarried and placed there as part of a shoreline protection scheme or as a breakwater structure.\n\nTo the left of the image is a small, simple structure with a flat roof, possibly a storage shed or a small boathouse, standing near the water's edge. This building has a humble design, and its proximity to the shoreline suggests it may serve a functional purpose related to maritime activities.\n\nIn the background, gentle hills can be seen rolling subtly under a cloudy sky. These hills, along with sparse vegetation, frame the scene and add a sense of quiet isolation or tranquility to the landscape.\n\nThe water adjacent to the rocky breakwater is dark, hinting at a significant depth or the presence of shadow cast by the rocks, contrasting with the lighter tones of the rock's surfaces which are highlighted under the overcast sky. This creates a dramatic natural interplay of textures and colors, emphasizing the ruggedness of the shoreline against the placid water.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a serenity and steadfastness, showcasing the enduring interaction between human-made structures and the natural environment.","title":"Pollution along the Adriatic Sea coast","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["547602","544284","543291","547486","543289","545173","543242","545122","554102","549353","543295","550361","550362","543359","543068","545130"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["breakwater","shoreline","rock","boathouse","protection","serenity","ruggedness","hill","scheme","shed"]}
