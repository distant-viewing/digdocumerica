{"path":"553095.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph features a man holding a large fish with both hands, examining it closely. The man appears focused on the fish, which he is possibly about to process or examine in detail. He is dressed in a light-colored, long-sleeve shirt.\n\nThe setting is outdoors, with a blue tarpaulin providing some shade in the background. Behind the man, there's a hint of an outdoor environment with trees and perhaps a rural setting. The atmosphere suggests a sunny day given the bright lighting and shadows visible. The presence of wooden structures and a basin-like container with water, where the fish may have been kept, adds to the natural, outdoor fishery or farm-like scene.\n\nThe photograph captures a moment of interaction between the man and the fish, highlighting a task potentially related to fishing, aquaculture, or environmental work. The overall composition focuses on the action and the central figure, drawing attention to the fish and the man's handling of it.","title":"Ralph o'neil is holding a cui-ui fish at the hatchery near Sutcliffe, Pyramid Lake indian reservation, Nevada.
