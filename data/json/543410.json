{"path":"543410.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and somewhat somber landscape under a dusky sky. The central focus is a large glowing sun, which appears softened and somewhat obscured by haze or mist, creating a diffuse light effect across the scene. The sun is positioned slightly off-center towards the left side, surrounded by a gradient of orange and yellow hues bleeding into darker tones at the edges of the frame.\n\nOn either side of the image, silhouettes of various trees create a framing effect. On the left, there's a dense, cluttered tree that merges into the dark foreground, adding to the image's depth. To the right, there are a couple of prominently shaped trees, possibly pine trees, with distinct, sprawling branches that stand out against the sky.\n\nBelow these trees, the lower part of the photograph shows an indistinct landscape that hints at a residential area, suggested by the silhouette of a utility pole and power lines.\n\nOverall, the composition and muted colors convey a quiet, almost melancholic atmosphere, with nature's elements—tree silhouettes and a setting sun—dominating the scene, highlighted against the backdrop of a human-impacted landscape.","title":"California -- Pacific Grove","placename":"Pacific Grove (Calif.)","location":"Pacific Grove, California","nn1":["557588","547719","542678","554731","557957","542680","557629","542625","555164","553844","547705","557447","552338","549106","552335","549847"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["sun","silhouette","tree","effect","pine","soften","merge","framing","gradient","couple"]}
