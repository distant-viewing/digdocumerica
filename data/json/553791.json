{"path":"553791.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph provides a panoramic aerial view of a densely populated urban coastal area under a partly cloudy sky. On the left side, numerous tall buildings are situated closely together along the shoreline. Some buildings are high-rise residential or commercial structures with a uniformly rectilinear architecture suggesting a modern urban landscape.\n\nThe middle of the photo features a large marina filled with numerous boats and yachts neatly arranged in rows within the sheltered docking area. The water in the marina appears calm, reflecting the surrounding buildings and boats, creating an organized and bustling waterfront scene.\n\nOn the right side of the image, the coastline curves into a beautiful sandy beach that fronts a peaceful bay. The bay is sheltered by a distinct volcanic crater, known as Diamond Head, which dominates the background on the right. The craterâ€™s presence provides a natural and striking contrast to the urbanity of the high-rise buildings.\n\nThe environment shows a blend of natural beauty and developed land, depicting a lively yet serene metropolitan seaside setting. The layout and landscaping along the shoreline indicate well-maintained urban planning and a focus on recreational activities, like boating and beach-going, as significant aspects of daily life in this area.","title":"Hawaii--downtown, Honolulu (Oahu i)","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["553677","553790","555756","553672","555757","553671","557462","544638","549480","553748","553675","553676","549505","552133","553679","557422"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["marina","bay","shoreline","beach","yacht","seaside","docking","boat","boating","landscaping"]}
