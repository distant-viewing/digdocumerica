{"path":"542820.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a deforested landscape, where large areas of land have been cleared of trees. The foreground shows a hillside extensively covered in dark brown soil, with tree stumps and scattered debris visible, indicating recent logging activity. The ground is furrowed and uneven, likely from the movement of heavy machinery.\n\nNo human figures are present in the scene. The middle portion of the image continues to show the barren hillside, but some trees that have not been cut down can be seen standing sporadically on the hill's ridge, creating a stark contrast to the cleared areas.\n\nIn the background, a dense forest on the opposite hill can be observed, which gives an untouched, lush green appearance against the cleared brownish hill in the foreground. This juxtaposition highlights the impact of the logging operation.\n\nThe sky is visible at the top of the photograph and looks clear, suggesting fair weather conditions when the photo was taken. The overall composition of the image focuses on the environmental impact of logging, showcasing the transformation from a once forested area to a deforested landscape.","title":"Clear cutting","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["555094","555150","542865","545138","555221","545143","555136","555085","555208","542840","555107","542834","555104","542833","542827","555148"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["deforest","clear","hillside","log","hill","furrow","transformation","impact","stump","logging"]}
