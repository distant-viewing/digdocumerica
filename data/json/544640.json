{"path":"544640.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"The photograph captures a ground area heavily littered with various discarded items, primarily focusing on a natural, outdoor setting. The ground is covered with pine needles and some scattered patches of leaves and small plants, suggesting a forest or wooded area. Numerous empty and rusted cans, some still bearing recognizable logos, are strewn across the scene, along with broken pieces of glass and possibly other debris that blend into the dirt and vegetation.\n\nIn the background, there is a single tree trunk visible, surrounded by dimly lit greenery, which indicates a somewhat dense forest environment. The lighting in the photograph is natural, possibly filtered through tree canopies above, giving the scene a shadowed, somewhat muted appearance. The overall impression is of neglect and environmental pollution, highlighting an issue of waste disposal in natural settings.","title":"Litter left by visitors in the taMiami canal area beside Everglades National Park","placename":"Florida","location":"Florida","nn1":["544648","544644","551246","544652","544298","551247","543616","551440","550352","556640","557307","544651","552102","543589","547525","549944"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["disposal","needle","forest","can","bear","strew","issue","logo","discard","waste"]}
