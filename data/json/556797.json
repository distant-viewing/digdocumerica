{"path":"556797.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures the interior of a bus filled with passengers. The shot is taken from the rear of the bus, looking forward toward the front, showing various individuals seated or standing. The passengers vary in age and attire, suggesting a casual setting, possibly during a daily commute or a group tour.\n\nThe bus itself has features typical of older models, such as rounded ceiling edges and large, rounded windows which offer a partial view of a green, leafy exterior, suggesting a rural or suburban route. The overhead compartment is visible, and it appears to have a few items stored inside small recesses.\n\nThe passengers are engaged in different activities: some are conversing with each other, while others seem to be looking out of the windows or are lost in thought. The seating is typical of public transit buses with rows of forward-facing, cushioned benches, separated by a central aisle.\n\nThe atmosphere within the bus appears calm and routine, with passengers settled into the ride. The lighting inside the bus is diffused, soft, possibly filtered through the windows, casting gentle shadows and giving a serene feeling to the scene. The overall impression is one of everyday travel, capturing a moment of transit in the lives of these individuals.","title":"Commuters aboard a Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) bus in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1974 the system carried 73,727,000 passengers, an increase of 27 percent from 1970. Almost 90 percent of the increase came from the sector of population who had not ridden the bus before. They were attracted by a combination of a fare decrease from 40 to 15 cents, new buses, new routes, night service, passenger waiting shelters and fringe parking.","placename":"Atlanta (Ga.)","location":"Atlanta, Georgia","nn1":["556745","556795","554264","556756","555978","556789","554241","556748","556743","556034","556739","549893","553796","546601","556740","546593"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["bus","passenger","transit","recess","window","aisle","settle","lose","commute","tour"]}
