{"path":"552579.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a young man dressed in typical ranch attire including a cowboy hat, long-sleeve button-up shirt, jeans, and boots. He appears to be standing in a corral, holding a lasso in his hands, with the rope partially coiled and ready for use. His pose and expression suggest he is focused on something outside of the frame, possibly related to the activity of roping or managing livestock.\n\nThe background features a rustic wooden fence which encircles what appears to be a pen or corral area. Beyond the fence, hints of thick green foliage suggest the setting is somewhat rural and lush, likely in a countryside environment. A horse, partially visible in the background, reinforces the rural and agricultural setting of the scene. The lighting indicates it might be early morning or late afternoon, giving the photograph a warm and natural ambiance.","title":"At the oldlands' summer cow camp, fifteen miles south of their piceance creek ranch.
