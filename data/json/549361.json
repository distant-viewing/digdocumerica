{"path":"549361.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures the serene ambiance of a well-appointed library. The setting is filled with rich wooden bookcases, reaching from the floor towards the high ceiling. On the left, there is a towering bookshelf, packed with countless rows of books, hinting at the breadth of knowledge contained within. The majority of these books appear aged and well-used, evoking a sense of scholarly history.\n\nIn the background, a massive, multi-tiered bookcase can be seen stretching across the wall, similarly filled with volumes of books, and punctuated by a visible pull-down metal library ladder. This offers functional access to higher shelves, emphasizing the practical design features of the space.\n\nThe lighting is soft and seems to emanate from overhead sources, casting a homely and inviting glow. In the center of the room, there are several large wooden tables surrounded by matching chairs, where individuals can sit and read or work.\n\nA person is visible sitting at one of these tables, appearing focused on their work. They seem engaged in reading or studying, surrounded by open books and papers. This solitary figure contributes to the tranquil and scholarly vibe of the environment.\n\nTo the right, there is a row of wooden catalog drawers with small round knobs, presumably containing a card catalog for navigating the library's extensive collection.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph conveys a sense of quiet intellectual activity and the timeless appeal of a traditional library setting.","title":"The physics and math library of the Ruder Boskovic Institute","placename":"Zagreb (Croatia)","location":"Zagreb, Croatia","nn1":["546560","549337","546549","553763","546553","552592","555316","553535","546500","558025","546511","552647","546564","546478","546479","557695"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["library","book","table","contain","bookshelf","card","breadth","knob","row","ladder"]}
