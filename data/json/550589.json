{"path":"550589.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph presents a dramatic and expansive aerial view of a mountainous landscape, most likely captured during either dawn or dusk given the soft lighting.\n\n1. **River and Streams**: Dominating the scene is a wide, meandering river that snakes through the valley, its waters reflecting light and creating a silvery pathway. Numerous smaller streams and tributaries branch off from the main river, intricately weaving through the terrain and contributing to a complex network of waterways.\n\n2. **Mountains and Snow**: Encircling the valley are tall, rugged mountains, some of which are capped with snow. The mountain peaks appear majestic against the darker sky, providing a stark contrast to the softer tones of the valley below.\n\n3. **Vegetation**: The valley floors between the waterways show signs of vegetation, which is probably sparse and adapted to the high-altitude environment. The coloration suggests it could be either late spring or early autumn, as the greenery is not lush but still visible.\n\n4. **Clouds and Sky**: Overhead, a dramatic sky with heavy clouds adds a moody ambiance to the scene. The clouds appear to be breaking in places, allowing natural light to flood through and highlight portions of the river and mountain slopes.\n\n5. **Light and Shadow**: The lighting is a critical aspect of this photograph, casting shadows and creating a play of light that enhances the textural details of the landscape â€“ from the rippled surfaces of the river to the rugged mountain facades.\n\nThis scene is devoid of any visible human activity or constructions, emphasizing the natural and untouched aspect of the landscape. The overall composition skillfully captures the raw, serene beauty of a remote, mountainous region, enveloping the viewer in a sense of tranquility and awe.","title":"Denali fault region. View southwest to the Black Rapids Glacier. In 1938 this glacier was called the \"galloping glacier\" because it was advancing many feet a day. Had it not stopped, it would have severed the overland route between Valdez and Fairbanks. Route here runs parallel to the Delta River and east of Richardson Highway.","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550630","550497","555673","550634","550509","550417","550415","550592","550441","543750","550394","552593","550629","550511","550518","555676"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["valley","mountain","river","waterway","aspect","awe","overhead","coloration","cloud","altitude"]}
