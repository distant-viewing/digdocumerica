{"path":"558214.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Stroble, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a classroom during a lecture. The image focuses on a group of students seated in traditional wood and metal desks, attentively facing toward the front where a male teacher is standing. The students, primarily young adults, appear engaged, some taking notes and others listening intently. The students are mostly dressed in casual attire typical of a school setting, including sweaters and shirts.\n\nThe teacher stands near a chalkboard filled with mathematical equations and diagrams, indicating the subject matter being discussed is likely mathematics. He gestures with one hand, possibly emphasizing a point or explaining a concept, while holding a piece of chalk in the other. His attire is casual-professional, wearing a light-colored sweater over a collared shirt.\n\nThe classroom is equipped with green chalkboards and a wooden podium, typical of educational institutions. The interior walls are plain, enhancing the focus on the educational activity. Overhead, fluorescent lighting illuminates the room, and there doesn't appear to be any windows, suggesting this might be an interior room.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on the interaction between the teacher and the students, captures a lively educational moment, highlighting the learning environment and educational dynamics within a classroom.","title":"Students and teacher in a classroom at cathedral high school in New Ulm, Minnesota.
