{"path":"558333.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Haque, Abul","caption":"This photograph captures an elderly man standing outdoors near a wooden shed. The man appears to be in his later years, wearing a weathered hat, glasses, a dark zip-up jacket over a shirt, and denim overalls. His expression is serious and his hands are partially tucked into the pockets of his overalls. He is standing next to a large, old-fashioned wooden wheel, possibly part of a cart or agricultural machinery, which has metal rims and spokes painted white.\n\nBehind him, the environment is rustic and rural. The wooden shed is aged, with faded paint and a small window visible. Thereâ€™s an assortment of items around, including what looks like a metal ladder leaning against a tree, a wooden platform with miscellaneous debris on it, and chunks of wood scattered across the ground.\n\nThe setting is sunny with shadows cast across the ground, indicating either an early morning or late afternoon. Trees can be seen around the area, contributing to the rural, rugged feel of the scene. The overall atmosphere suggests a quiet, pastoral life, possibly a farm or a similarly remote setting.","title":"Senior citizens find that New Ulm, Minnesota, is a good place to retire.
