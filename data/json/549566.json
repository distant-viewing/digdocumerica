{"path":"549566.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and traditional street parade scene. At the center of the image, there is a large ornate float being pulled by a team of horses. The float appears highly decorative, adorned with golden sculptures and intricate architectural elements, contributing to its regal and festive appearance. The horses are also richly decorated, with elegant harnesses.\n\nIndividuals in traditional costumes or formal attire are visible on and around the float. These seem to be handling the horses or engaging with the crowd. The presence of handlers in historical or ceremonial dress adds to the pomp and elegance of the parade.\n\nThe background of the photograph reveals a cityscape, with various storefronts and signs partially visible, suggesting this event is taking place in an urban setting. An American flag is displayed prominently, aligning with the parade's celebratory and possibly patriotic nature.\n\nOn the sides of the street, crowds of onlookers, including children and adults, are seated or standing to watch the parade. The scene is bathed in strong sunlight, casting deep shadows and highlighting the vivid details and colors of the parade float and participants. This setting and activity suggest a festival, national holiday, or cultural celebration, capturing a moment of communal festivity and tradition.","title":"Among the soul-stirring sight of the \"old milwaukee days\" annual parade are the magnificently carved and gilded circus wagons, of which the one shown here is an outstanding example","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"Wisconsin","nn1":["549576","557712","549574","549583","552660","557716","552657","556274","556280","557710","549581","557046","552651","546991","552654","552653"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Ski"],"terms":["parade","float","horse","crowd","festivity","costume","holiday","harness","team","tradition"]}
