{"path":"548308.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts a waterway heavily polluted with various kinds of debris and garbage. The scene includes a large amount of floating waste such as plastic bottles, plastic containers, a tire, pieces of wood, and miscellaneous trash scattered extensively across the water surface. In the foreground, prominently featured is a \"NO DUMPING\" sign, which stands as an ironic statement given the extensive pollution visible in the water.\n\nIn the middle of the waterway, there is a large pile of branches and natural debris, likely gathered there naturally by the water's flow, surrounded by various man-made objects. Several large items are visible, including barrels and a white appliance that resembles a washing machine or refrigerator.\n\nThe background shows dense greenery lining the riverbanks, indicating that this area might otherwise be a naturally beautiful setting if not for the pollution. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is somber and serves as a poignant commentary on environmental neglect and the consequences of improper waste disposal.","title":"Lake Pontchartrain spills over onto illegal dumping ground.
