{"path":"549251.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a lush, verdant field densely populated with tall green grass or cereal, covering most of the frame. The view is from a low perspective, almost level with the grass, highlighting its height and the density of the stalks, some of which are in the process of seeding. \n\nIn the background, the landscape gently rises into a rolling hill that appears smoother and is blanketed with a more manicured-looking green vegetation, possibly a mowed field or pasture. Dotting the crest of the hill are a few sporadic trees and what looks like small structures or distant buildings barely visible due to the distance.\n\nThe sky above is clear and vibrantly blue, indicating a bright, sunny day, which casts vivid light and creates a sense of warmth over the scene. The quality of light suggests either morning or late afternoon, given the gentle yet bright illumination on the field. The composition and rich, natural color treatment emphasize the serenity and the expanse of the agricultural or natural landscape. There are no people or animals evident in the image, enhancing its stillness and quiet beauty.","title":"Wheat field on the redding ranch in sarpy basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549158","549233","557191","549141","556990","557104","549232","549146","549218","555567","551370","545040","546154","545069","549142","549229"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["field","pasture","stalk","verdant","crest","serenity","treatment","hill","warmth","illumination"]}
