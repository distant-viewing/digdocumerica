{"path":"550129.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph depicts an old, dilapidated building, possibly an apartment or office block. The structure is three stories high, with each level featuring multiple windows. The building walls are made of dark bricks, and almost all the windows are broken, leaving jagged glass in the frames. On the façade, there’s a decorative crest between the second and third floors.\n\nIn front of the building, there are two boarded-up doorways, emphasized by large wooden boards, suggesting abandonment or disuse. A considerable amount of debris and rubbish is piled up before the entrance, consisting of branches, leaves, and various unidentifiable objects, giving the scene a sense of decay and neglect.\n\nA pathway leads up to the door, flanked by overgrown grass and weeds, suggesting the building has been in this state for some time. A man stands in the center of this path, directly in front of the building's entrance. He appears to be observing the property or the general scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photo is somewhat eerie and melancholic, highlighting themes of urban decay and the passage of time. The surrounding trees and greenery further envelop the building, enhancing the feeling of abandonment.","title":"Vacant building at 1311 E.
