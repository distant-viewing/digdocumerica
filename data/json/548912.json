{"path":"548912.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a space shuttle in flight, captured from an aerial or possibly spaceborne perspective against the stark backdrop of space. The space shuttle is seen from above, its white body contrasting sharply with the surrounding darkness. It is traveling from the right side of the image to the left, leaving behind a turbulent trail of exhaust and clouds that swirls dynamically in the black void.\n\nThe space shuttle is detailed, showing the tiles on its surface and identifiable markings including what appears to be a flag and the letters \"USA\". The exhaust forms a dramatic, widespread plume across the frame, emphasizing the speed and power of the shuttle.\n\nIn the background, numerous small, bright dots scatter across the dark field, suggesting stars. These dots add a celestial feel to the scene, enhancing the impression of the shuttle flying through outer space. The overall composition is dynamic and emphasizes human technological achievement in space exploration.","title":"Boating on Lake Mead","placename":"Mead Lake (Nev.)","location":"Mead Lake, Nevada","nn1":["552918","553067","549109","545983","543790","542717","542720","542719","542718","548914","553803","542793","550916","544606","547810","557611"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["space","exhaust","dot","achievement","tile","star","flight","speed","marking","darkness"]}
