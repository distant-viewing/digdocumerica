{"path":"552432.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph features a landscape dominated by two large, insulated pipelines running parallel across a barren, sandy terrain. The pipes, wrapped in a material that appears to be protective insulation, are supported intermittently by wooden blocks placed directly underneath them. A red sign, attached to a metal post in the foreground, reads \"DANGER\" in white letters, possibly signaling warnings or restrictions related to the pipeline.\n\nThe background of the image reveals a dry, sparse environment with a few small bushes scattered across the hilly landscape. The sky is clear and brightly lit, suggesting a sunny day without clouds. The color tones of the sand and vegetation are muted, mostly in shades of beige and green, which contrasts with the grey of the pipelines. The overall setting implies a remote or less frequented area, possibly a region used for industrial or utility purposes. The photograph captures the stark and somewhat harsh reality of industrial elements imposed upon a natural landscape, highlighting themes of development and environmental alteration.","title":"The Chicago sanitary liner ships much of its waste (sludge) by barge down the Illinois River to the small town of Liverpool. From there it is piped 12 miles inland to a large tract of land: called the Weir Farm. The sludge is then pumped into huge holding basins and later used to spray experimental corn fields.
