{"path":"549534.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a picturesque view of a large waterfall, which appears to be Niagara Falls based on its distinctive features. The waterfall, with vast amounts of water cascading down, generates a mist that rises above the falls, adding a mystical quality to the scene. The water at the top is turbulent, with waves indicating the powerful flow.\n\nIn the foreground of the photo, several people are leisurely seated on a grassy slope overlooking the falls, making it a relaxed and scenic observation point. On the left side, two individuals are sitting closely together, one dressed in a bright red outfit, and the other in blue, both absorbed in the view. Further towards the center, two more individuals are also seated, facing away from the viewer, with one wearing white. On the far right, an isolated figure in red observes the falls while seated on the grass.\n\nIn the background, across the falls, a lush, tree-lined bank is visible, along with some buildings that peek through the tree cover, suggesting a park or urban setting adjacent to the natural attraction.\n\nOverall, the composition of the image, combining nature's grandeur with human interaction, creates a serene and contemplative atmosphere, highlighting the appeal of such a significant natural landmark.","title":"Tourists at park on Goat Island enjoy a spectacular view of \"Horseshoe Falls,\" the Canadian half of Niagara Falls.","placename":"Niagara Falls (N.Y.)","location":"Niagara Falls, New York","nn1":["549535","549563","549546","549536","549557","549552","553397","549530","549467","549558","549544","549560","549466","550979","549562","549554"],"cl":[49],"cluster":["#49 &mdash; Weather Phenomena"],"terms":["fall","waterfall","attraction","appeal","landmark","observation","amount","grandeur","cover","mist"]}
