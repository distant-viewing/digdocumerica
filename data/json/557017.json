{"path":"557017.jpg","date":"March 1975","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a silhouette, under a dramatic sky, of a person working on the roof of a building that appears to be a barn. The photo is taken at a time of day when the sky behind is bright, setting a high contrast that almost entirely darkens the structure and the figure. The person on the roof is bending forward in a posture that suggests they are installing or repairing roofing material.\n\nThe barn features a large gable with some geometrical openings that might be for ventilation or windows, underlined by the silhouette of the roofline which includes roofing slats that are clearly visible. To the left, there are leafless branches and a post with three parallel lines running vertically, likely utility poles, all casting stark shadows against the sky.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is somewhat dramatic and moody, emphasizing themes of hard work and isolation in rural settings, conveyed by the stark contrasts and minimalistic detailing.","title":"New commercial construction adjacent to Highway #305 at Poulsbo. Increased construction activity in this area and others like it is expected when the Navy's Trident submarine base is built nearby. A \"new city\" is proposed to house a substantial portion of the projected 27,000 people who will move into the area when the naval installation is completed.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["555296","547293","556185","547315","557310","543343","547307","552537","554821","546451","552515","554782","554421","546771","547311","547128"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["roofing","barn","slat","silhouette","ventilation","roofline","gable","roof","detailing","opening"]}
