{"path":"544985.jpg","date":"August 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph presents a serene, atmospheric view of a coastal scene, most likely taken during sunrise or sunset. The image is dominated by warm, muted tones, and the silhouette of land and sea features creates a striking contrast.\n\nForeground: The foreground is somewhat shadowy and features what appears to be dark outlines of grass or small shrubs. These silhouetted forms lend a sense of depth and natural ruggedness to the scene.\n\nMiddle ground: The central part of the image is occupied by a wide, flat beach that reflects the light, creating alternating bands of light and shadow that stretch horizontally across the frame. A single, distinct rock formation rises from this reflective surface, adding vertical interest and a point of focus.\n\nBackground: In the background, massive rock formations emerge from the ocean. These are also in silhouette, standing starkly against the lighter horizon. The one on the right is particularly large and cliff-like, while the one on the left is smaller and more irregular in shape. Beyond these formations, the ocean is visible with waves that appear white and frothy, suggesting a dynamic marine environment.\n\nSky: The sky is layered with shades of gray to gold, transitioning smoothly and imbuing the scene with a quiet, contemplative mood. The light in the sky suggests the sun is low, casting long shadows and soft light across the landscape.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its horizontal layers of beach, sea, and sky, and vertical elements of the rock formations, creates a balanced and tranquil image that reflects the natural beauty and serene atmosphere of a coastal environment at dawn or dusk.","title":"Sunset on the beach","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542890","543081","543068","547483","543060","551553","553805","557510","551554","542808","545173","543091","557508","553852","543085","553910"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["formation","one","rock","ocean","beach","like","sea","silhouette","gold","light"]}
