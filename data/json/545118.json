{"path":"545118.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a lighthouse situated on a rugged, rocky island surrounded by the sea. The lighthouse, constructed with multiple tiers and a lantern room at the top, stands on a sharply jagged promontory that is being washed by foamy sea waves. The scene captures a dramatic interface between the sturdy architectural structure and the dynamic natural environment. The lighthouse appears quaint and somewhat worn, indicating its battle against harsh elements over time.\n\nThe skies above are overcast, suggesting a cool or stormy atmosphere, and hinting at the isolation and challenging conditions faced by such remote locations. The sea surrounding the island is rough, with white waves breaking against the rocks, enhancing the sense of turbulence and the relentless nature of the ocean.\n\nAdditionally, there are birds visible, likely sea birds, circling above or near the island, adding a touch of life to the otherwise stark and desolate scene. The color palette of the scene is a mix of cool blues and greys, which dominates the photograph, reinforcing the cold and lonely ambiance.\n\nThe vantage point of the photo suggests it was taken from an elevated position, possibly from another part of the coast or cliff, giving a broad and commanding view of the sea and the lighthouse. This perspective allows the viewer to appreciate the full scale and positioning of the lighthouse against the vast ocean backdrop.","title":"Rocky coastline","placename":"Seaside (Or.)","location":"Seaside, Oregon","nn1":["543086","547131","544996","547154","550361","550362","543403","550360","543141","547916","551600","543291","546151","545226","550314","547118"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["lighthouse","sea","island","bird","ocean","wave","lantern","turbulence","tier","interface"]}
