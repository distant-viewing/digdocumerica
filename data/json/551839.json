{"path":"551839.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph features an outdoor market stall, primarily characterized by its bold black and white striped awning which covers an array of goods. On the front side of the stall, facing the camera, there are small plants in pots, clearly priced with small signs.\n\nAn eye-catching deep pink umbrella adorned with intricate patterns, possibly floral, is positioned to the left side of the frame, partially open and leaning against the stall. A black bag is hanging from the edge of the stall near this umbrella.\n\nThe market is located on a street with visible shopfronts in the background. One discernible sign reads \"HIRMER\" which suggests the shopping area might be located in a German-speaking country, since Hirmer is known for men's clothing in Germany. In the far background, blurred by focus, pedestrians can be seen walking past the stalls, and a glimpse of other market activity is noticeable.\n\nBeyond the stall and on the street, cars from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s era are parked, indicating the period when the photograph might have been taken. The setting gives the impression of a busy, urban environment, likely possibly damp or rainy given the presence of the umbrella. The overall ambiance is one of a vibrant, active marketplace.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgangerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people.
