{"path":"548515.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil marina scene. In the forefront is a weathered wooden walkway leading out into the water, flanked by private docking areas that berth several sailboats. Each boat is equipped with tall, slender masts and some feature protective canvases in different colors such as blue and red. The image captures the boats neatly aligned along the docks, indicating a well-maintained and organized setting.\n\nAt the entrance to the jetty, there's a sign that reads \"PRIVATE MEMBERS ONLY,\" indicating restricted access and suggesting that this is a private yacht club or marina reserved for its members. Beyond this sign, the viewer can see the boats moored in calm waters with more docked boats in the background.\n\nIn the background to the right, there are glimpses of white buildings with blue roofs and trim, likely facilities or clubhouses associated with the marina. These shore facilities and the lush green trees further suggest an affluent, well-landscaped environment. The sky above is clear, reflecting a sunny and pleasant day, perfect for boating and marine activities. The atmosphere in the photo is serene, focused on leisure and the enjoyment of yachting and sailing.","title":"Chesapeake bay marina","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549407","546388","542871","543246","542904","543545","544248","556191","546935","552028","546877","548763","548639","548969","546853","557450"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Boat 2"],"terms":["marina","boat","member","forefro","club","yacht","docking","jetty","reserve","facility"]}
