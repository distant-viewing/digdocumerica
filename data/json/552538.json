{"path":"552538.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant and colorful flower nursery or farm. In the foreground, a vast field of vivid pink flowers dominates the scene. The focus includes a large, round, mustard-yellow pot filled with lush, blooming pink flowers that appears slightly to the left, enhancing the richness of the scene with its contrasting color.\n\nIn the middle ground, the dense blanket of pink flowers stretches toward several white-greenhouses and farm buildings visible in the background. These structures, possibly used for storing tools or growing less hardy plants, have a functional, rustic appearance and are surrounded by trees, which provide a natural boundary and contrast to the colorful floral expanse in the foreground.\n\nThe setting is sunny with clear, blue skies hinting at ideal weather conditions for flower cultivation. The overall composition of the photograph, with its vibrant foreground and practical background structures, suggests a well-maintained commercial flower farm dedicated to growing and possibly selling these beautiful flowers. The scene is peaceful, flourishing, and evokes a sense of thriving nature meticulously cared for by human hands.","title":"Field of flowers","placename":"Peoria (Ill.)","location":"Peoria, Illinois","nn1":["554111","542970","542641","542642","542645","554595","544574","555372","543200","542707","542704","550781","542706","552503","555186","544934"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["flower","farm","grow","greenhouse","mustard","richness","sell","cultivation","pot","thrive"]}
