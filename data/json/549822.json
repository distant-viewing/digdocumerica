{"path":"549822.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a tugboat pulling two large barges filled with garbage. The barges are densely packed with mounds of assorted waste, predominantly featuring a mix of indistinguishable refuse that suggests a broad variety of materials. The scene takes place on water, as evidenced by the surrounding dark blue surface of the ocean and the white foam and ripples created by the movement of the vessels through the water. The perspective of the photo is taken from above, looking down at the tug and barges as they navigate forward, leaving a trail of wake behind them in the water. The lighting, likely natural sunlight, highlights the texture of the trash and the deep hue of the ocean, while the details of specific waste items are mostly blended together due to the distance of the shot and the heaps of garbage.","title":"Part of the 26,000 tons of solid waste that New York city produces each day.
