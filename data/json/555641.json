{"path":"555641.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This image shows a vast, open landscape predominantly occupied by a newly cultivated field. The foreground features young, sparse plant growth emerging from a soil rich in small rocks and clumps of earth, possibly indicating recent plowing or tilling activities. A faint path or trail runs slightly from left to right, hinting at human or equipment movement across the field.\n\nThe middle part of the landscape inclines gently upwards and rounds off to form a broad, slightly mounded horizon. On the right and stretching into the distance, we observe a large body of water nestled between low hills. The water appears calm and reflects a clear sky above, hinting at serene weather conditions.\n\nThe background is mostly dominated by hazy, intermingling shades of blue and green, suggesting distant hills or forested areas. The sky takes up the top fifth of the photograph and is a clear, pale blue without any visible clouds, indicating good visibility and possibly dry weather conditions.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph points to a peaceful, rural setting with an emphasis on agricultural development and natural landscapes.","title":"Land recontoured and seeded after strip mining by the Ohio Power Company near Chandlersville","placename":"Chandlersville (Ohio)","location":"Chandlersville, Ohio","nn1":["549181","554027","554055","555618","545040","549141","552466","554030","557087","553978","553668","552858","552903","553652","549252","549182"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["run","clump","weather","field","hill","condition","trail","emphasis","growth","visibility"]}
