{"path":"548032.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"In the photograph, two individuals are involved in a snow-related activity, presumably skiing, in a snow-covered forest setting. Both are equipped with ski gear. The person on the left is younger, wearing a black and white checkered jacket, black gloves, black pants, and dark ski boots; he has blond hair and is wearing sunglasses. He stands slightly facing the camera, holding a silver ski pole and observing the other person.\n\nThe person on the right is an older man, wearing a dark cap, glasses, a predominantly dark jacket with a hint of lighter colors underneath, brownish gloves, and dark colored pants and boots. He's focused on another silver ski pole, apparently adjusting or examining it, aided by the younger person.\n\nThe background is tranquil and predominantly white due to the snowy conditions, with fir trees partially covered in snow creating a picturesque winter scene. This setting suggests they could be in a mountainous or forested area suitable for skiing. The atmosphere is overcast, with diffuse lighting that enhances the wintry feel of the scene.","title":"Members of the Crag Rats climbing club make winter snow surveys for the U.S. Soil Conservation Service at Tilly Jane Camp Ground on Mt.
