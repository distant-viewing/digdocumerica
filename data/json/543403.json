{"path":"543403.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a coastal landscape featuring a large, rocky headland that plunges into the sea. The main focal point of the image is a sharp, prominent peak covered with lush greenery and topped with several buildings, which appear to be structured parts of a lighthouse or a lookout facility. On the peak's right side, near the edge, there is a lighthouse with a red roof and a tall antenna standing next to it, distinguishing it as potentially a navigational aid for maritime endeavors. \n\nThe surrounding area of the headland is rugged, with steep cliffs facing the ocean, presenting a dramatic drop to the blue waters below. The turbulent sea around the base of the cliffs suggests strong coastal currents or waves. The ocean itself extends into the horizon, merging seamlessly with a clear sky. These geological and constructed features combined create a scene that suggests isolation and the interface between human-built structures and the natural environment. The composition and the perspective hint that the photograph might have been taken from a higher vantage point or possibly from the air, emphasizing the commanding view of the structures over the surrounding seascape.","title":"California -- between Monterey and Big Sur","placename":"Monterey County (Calif.)","location":"Monterey County, California","nn1":["543086","544996","543067","543291","550361","545226","550362","543426","550360","545118","543080","545122","542917","543300","543428","543422"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["lighthouse","cliff","peak","plunge","ocean","sea","drop","interface","antenna","seascape"]}
