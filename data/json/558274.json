{"path":"558274.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a group of individuals dressed in historically accurate military uniforms, likely part of a Civil War reenactment or historical demonstration. The scene is set outdoors, under a clear blue sky, atop a grassy hill that gently slopes towards the horizon.\n\nTo the left of the image, a cluster of men are standing in a line; they are dressed in dark coats with light-colored trousers and dark hats, typical of the mid-19th century military attire. One individual among them is holding a flag on a flagpole, prominently displaying a red field with stars, which possibly represents a historical battle flag.\n\nTo the right, there is a traditional field cannon, mounted on wheels and manned by four men. These individuals are actively engaged in demonstrating the operation of the cannon, with one man holding a rammer to tamp down the cannon's charge. Their attire matches that of the group on the left, reinforcing the period accuracy of the scene.\n\nThe simplicity and openness of the background, devoid of modern elements, along with the historical attire and cannon, all suggest this photograph was taken during a reenactment or a ceremonial tribute meant to educate or commemorate historical military events. The photograph has a somewhat grainy texture and a slightly faded color palette, which gives it a vintage feel, further enhancing the historical atmosphere of the scene.","title":"Members of the New Ulm battery, one of the major historical heritages of New Ulm, Minnesota, getting ready to fire a salute.
