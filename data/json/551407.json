{"path":"551407.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"The image depicts a man standing outdoors, leaning slightly against a metal railing. He is dressed casually in a white t-shirt and black pants, supported by a black belt. The man has curly dark hair and is looking to his side, with a somewhat contemplative or distracted expression.\n\nIn his right hand, he holds a can, which he appears to be either holding idly or about to drink from. His other hand rests on his lower back, perhaps hinting at discomfort or merely serving as a relaxed pose.\n\nThe background is blurred but seems to show an overcast day, possibly in an outdoor park or near a waterfront, given the grays and muted colors which suggest a lack of sunlight. There are subtle hints of structures or distant objects in the background, but they are too indistinct to identify clearly. The overall atmosphere is quiet and somewhat somber, amplified by the overcast sky and the solitary figure of the man.","title":"Annual smelt run at singing bridge, tawas city.
