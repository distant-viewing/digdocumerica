{"path":"552198.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a large logging operation. The image shows numerous neatly organized rows of stockpiled logs across a wide area. Several puddles and muddy pools are scattered around the log stacks, reflecting past or recent rainfall.\n\nA central dirt road divides the area, branching off into smaller paths around the log piles. Near the center of the image, a large white building stands adjacent to several heavy machines, possibly loaders or forklifts, which are used for moving logs. Nearby, smaller buildings or structures can also be seen, perhaps serving as offices or storage facilities.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes patches of forest, suggesting that the logging site is situated close to the source of timber. There are no visible people in the image, emphasizing the scale of the operation and the focus on the resources and machinery.\n\nOverall, the image captures the extensive nature and organization of the logging industry, highlighting the interaction between human activity and the natural environment.","title":"Cold deck log storage near olympia.
