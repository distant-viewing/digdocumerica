{"path":"542858.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a somber, moody scene with a logging truck carrying large logs on a wet, winding road. The shot is taken from an elevated perspective, likely from the back of the truck or another vehicle, providing a view of the truck's load and the road ahead.\n\nThe road curves gently to the left and is flanked on both sides by a thick forest, significantly obscured by fog or mist, creating an ethereal, almost surreal, atmosphere. The surrounding trees are tall and dense, and their tops fade out into the grey fog, enhancing the sense of depth and solitude in the image.\n\nOn the logging truck, you can see securely fastened logs, the texture of their rough bark clearly visible. There's an evident moisture on the road and on the logs, suggesting recent rain or mist. The overcast sky and the subdued natural light contribute to the overall cool and damp visual tone of the image.\n\nThe composition and the elements within this photograph together convey themes of isolation, man's interaction with nature, and perhaps the desolateness of industrial activities in natural settings.","title":"Logging trucks move through park from cutting near park boundary.","placename":"Redwood National Park (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["545930","555154","542855","553629","542925","542780","554416","553627","542854","556429","547659","542856","542609","556986","542953","553628"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["log","truck","road","mist","damp","logging","moisture","fog","bark","rain"]}
