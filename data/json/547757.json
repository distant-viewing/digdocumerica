{"path":"547757.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Smith, Bob","caption":"This photograph captures a serene lakeside scene where several sailboats are leisurely floating on the calm waters. Four sailboats are visible, each adorned with a white sail; two of these sails are marked with the numbers \"758\" and \"921.\" The sailors appear to be in a relaxed mode of navigation, enjoying the tranquility of the water.\n\nThe foreground features a willow tree with weeping branches that elegantly frame the top and left sides of the image, enhancing the composition's natural and peaceful feel. Beneath the tree, on the near shore, there are hints of low brush and grass at the water’s edge. On the far side of the lake, the land is lined with a row of lush, green trees, reflecting subtly in the lake’s surface, suggesting a quiet, secluded area.\n\nAdditionally, there is an unoccupied small motorboat or dinghy parked on the shore in the lower right corner of the image. It appears new or well-kept, with a shiny surface that catches light.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is calm and serene, indicating a perfect day for sailing, enveloped by the beauty of nature and the gentle embrace of a sunny day.","title":"Sailing at White Rock Lake, a highly popular weekend playground for the citizens of Dallas","placename":"Dallas (Tex.)","location":"Dallas, Texas","nn1":["547754","547781","552297","544669","548555","552345","543936","547273","548118","557562","543994","543941","543626","548247","552355","552039"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["sail","sailboat","shore","sailor","mode","lake","brush","motorboat","navigation","sailing"]}
