{"path":"546999.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Conklin, Paul","caption":"The photograph displays an aged two-story mansion nestled in a lush park setting. The architecture of the building features a colonial design, marked by symmetrical windows with white framing, and a red tile roof. The exterior walls of the mansion look weathered and are painted white or a light pastel, though some areas show signs of peeling or discoloration.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a vast stretch of green grass, hinting at a well-maintained lawn, leading up to the mansion. Guardrails or a low fence seem to run along the edges of a raised foundation or porch that encircles the lower level of the house.\n\nLarge, mature trees dominate the landscape, including live oaks draped with Spanish moss, adding a serene and slightly gothic atmosphere to the setting. These trees are scattered around the property and frame the house, partially obscuring it from direct view in some angles. The background additionally includes hints of more foliage and possibly other park features, suggesting that the mansion is situated within a larger, wooded park area.\n\nThe overall mood of the image is quiet and perhaps a bit nostalgic, evoking a sense of the past held within the walls of the grand old building. The setting is tranquil, without any visible people or modern disturbances, offering a snapshot that feels both historical and timeless.","title":"Jekyll Island, a millionaire's retreat in the 19th century, is now a state-owned public park.
