{"path":"547648.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"This photograph showcases a natural, somewhat barren landscape under a clear blue sky. In the foreground, there's a collection of overgrown foliage and scattered large stones. Dominating the middle ground is a large, eye-catching advertisement sign for \"Eastward Look\", indicating that it’s a plot of 135 acres for residential and commercial development. The sign includes an illustrated figure, resembling a maritime captain or sailor, with a white beard and mustache, wearing a captain’s hat and holding a ship's wheel. The sign promotes homesites for sale with amenities like sewers, drainage, water, and ocean view, and also mentions a minimum lot size being 10,000 sq. ft. The sign is branded by \"Ocean State Improvement\".\n\nIn the background, there's a visible water tower, indicating some existing infrastructures. The area around looks undeveloped, with trees and brushwood here and there, creating an impression of an empty and somewhat rugged terrain ready for development. The overall setting is sunny and clear, emphasizing the potential of the area advertised on the sign.","title":"Developer's sign at Point Judith on Block Island Sound","placename":"Narragansett (R.I.)","location":"Narragansett, Rhode Island","nn1":["554123","557419","549039","557553","543101","543637","543100","545049","543115","544136","554133","544118","548730","553831","544780","543641"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["sign","potential","sailor","development","drainage","amenity","mustache","plot","beard","sale"]}
