{"path":"542500.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic scene featuring a biplane in flight. The plane, which is a dual-wing aircraft, is depicted in a steep, angled ascent, trailing gray smoke from its rear, suggesting either a maneuver or mechanical issue. The setting sun gently illuminates the scene, giving the sky a warm, soft glow and highlighting the edges of the plane, making the smoke appear more pronounced.\n\nIn the foreground, blurred flowers and foliage are visible, suggesting that the viewer is watching this scene from a ground perspective within a field or garden. The lower part of the image includes the tops of plants, and these elements are sufficiently out of focus to keep the main attention on the aircraft.\n\nThe background is a muted blend of dusky sky tones that provide a subtle contrast to the brighter, more vivid colors of the sunset and the dark silhouette of the airplane and its smoke trail. There are no buildings or other distinct man-made structures visible in the shot, which isolates the plane in the composition, emphasizing its motion and the dramatic effect of its smoke trail.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a vintage or retro aesthetic, reminiscent of early aviation days, enhanced by the grain and texture of the image which might suggest it was taken with film. This setting and composition evoke a sense of nostalgia and highlight the adventurous spirit of early flight.","title":"Sulfur-dusting of grape vines","placename":"Fresno (Calif.)","location":"Fresno, California","nn1":["542501","542496","548884","542506","542793","549072","542717","553873","548841","548215","542718","548883","544491","542719","542504","548881"],"cl":[3],"cluster":["#03 &mdash; Barn"],"terms":["plane","smoke","flight","aircraft","trail","biplane","traile","aviation","angl","spirit"]}
