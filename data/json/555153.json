{"path":"555153.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph depicts a serene natural landscape, likely taken in a forested mountain area. The composition focuses on a small stream that meanders through a rocky bed surrounded by dense foliage and forest debris. In the foreground, a large fallen log, covered in moss and showing signs of decay, spans across the stream, acting as a natural bridge. The log's dark, wet surface contrasts with the lighter colors of the flowing water below, which reflects a white, cloudy sky.\n\nAround the stream, the ground is littered with rocks, smaller twigs, and leaves, suggesting a natural, undisturbed environment. Tall, mature conifer trees flank the stream, their trunks rising vertically and framing the scene. These trees indicate a temperate or possibly a sub-alpine climate.\n\nThe background features a steep, forested mountain slope which fades into a misty, indistinct haze, giving the image a sense of depth and mystery. The overall mood is tranquil and somewhat somber, enhanced by the overcast sky and the moist, reflective surfaces of the forest.\n\nThe photograph also shows signs of being taken during a damp, possibly rainy day, as evidenced by the wet surfaces and the overall moist atmosphere. This setting is typical of a lush, densely wooded forest ecosystem, often found in mountainous regions.","title":"Buffer strip in Olympic National Timberland, Washington near Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550351","555218","554525","555222","555076","554406","554603","555211","542844","547011","558085","555216","554717","555075","550345","550347"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Water Bodies"],"terms":["stream","log","forest","surface","twig","mountain","mystery","bed","moss","ecosystem"]}
