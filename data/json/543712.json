{"path":"543712.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph features a dramatic landscape under a dynamic sky. The composition is divided into several horizontal layers, each contributing to an overall serene yet majestic atmosphere.\n\nThe foreground shows a flat, sparsely detailed expanse that could be grassland or a field, stretching across the frame. This flat zone sets a calm baseline for the composition.\n\nIn the midground, a series of mountain silhouettes layer behind each other, ranging from dark purple to a lighter blue shade, which creates a sense of immense depth. Each successive mountain ridge is lighter in color, giving the impression of increasing distance.\n\nAbove the mountains, the sky dominates much of the composition. It is filled with large, heavy clouds that appear almost tangible. These clouds are darker at the top and become whiter towards the center where sunlight dramatically breaks through. The rays of light piercing through various cloud openings create a spotlight effect, highlighting parts of the mountain.\n\nOverall, the scene is enveloped in a somewhat dusky or stormy light, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon. This time of day, along with the interplay of light and shadow, contributes greatly to the dramatic and moody ambiance of the photograph.","title":"Colorado--near Fort Collins","placename":"Fort Collins (Colo.)","location":"Fort Collins, Colorado","nn1":["543023","544905","545375","555378","545907","550390","557575","542923","550610","550421","552927","544944","544070","550592","552483","555131"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["mountain","spotlight","ray","increase","grassland","layer","become","opening","cloud","ridge"]}
