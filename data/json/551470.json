{"path":"551470.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph captures a scene with three people seated at a table, engaged in conversation, surrounded by vibrant pink and red geraniums. The setting appears to be outdoors during daytime, suggested by the natural lighting and shadows, along with a glimpse of a brick building in the background.\n\nOn the left, there is a woman with curly hair, who is wearing a dark blazer over a light shirt. She appears to be engaged in a deep conversation or making a point, as suggested by her expressive facial expression and body language.\n\nIn the middle, a man wearing a light-colored shirt with a patch on the sleeve indicating some form of uniform or official role, is turned towards the left, listening or responding to the woman.\n\nOn the right, another woman with long hair styled in braids and wearing a dark blouse with a vibrant floral pattern looks away from the group, directing her attention elsewhere, her hand placed thoughtfully on her cheek.\n\nThe overall composition and the presence of abundant flowers suggest a casual, perhaps leisurely, context, like a market, cafe, or public gathering area designed for social interaction. The flowers in the foreground are lush and add a colorful, lively touch to the scene, contrasting with the more subdued clothing of the people and enhancing the naturalistic feeling of the setting.","title":"Postal workers take their afternoon break on nicollet mall","placename":"Minneapolis (Minn.)","location":"Minneapolis, Minnesota","nn1":["553167","549924","557175","551698","551482","550027","557030","546209","557031","553164","551433","557036","551718","551028","551834","551460"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["braid","woman","cheek","flower","conversation","cafe","language","blazer","hair","market"]}
