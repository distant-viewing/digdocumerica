{"path":"547057.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph presents a serene and moody seascape under a cloudy sky at what appears to be either dawn or dusk. The sea is calm and expansive, stretching across the entire frame. The sky, covered in heavy clouds, allows just enough light through to create a dramatic effect. A distinct beam of sunlight penetrates the clouds and reflects off the water, leading to a bright, shimmering path across the sea's surface.\n\nThe lighting is dim, hinting that the sun is low on the horizon. The colors are mostly subdued shades of blue and gray, contributing to the calm and somewhat melancholic atmosphere of the scene. There is a sense of vastness and solitude conveyed by the open water and the overcast sky.\n\nA few birds are faintly visible in the sky, adding a touch of life to the otherwise still and quiet setting. The overall mood is tranquil and reflective, with the central focus being the interaction between the light and the water.","title":"Lake Michigan from Bluffs","placename":"Muskegon (Mich.)","location":"Muskegon, Michigan","nn1":["547047","555713","548241","550391","547638","553857","543025","554002","543138","547044","544701","550291","548705","555396","553852","548754"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sea","penetrate","seascape","cloud","bird","dawn","beam","subdue","vastness","allow"]}
