{"path":"551748.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a young woman squatting amidst a vibrant garden of yellow and orange flowers. She wears a long-sleeve, patterned jacket and glasses, and her dark, shoulder-length hair cascades around her face. Her attention seems focused on a specific task within the flower bed, as she extends her hand towards a flower, possibly in the act of gardening.\n\nIn the background, an urban setting unfolds with multi-story buildings lining the street. One significant building, painted in a stark blue with white trim around the windows, contrasts with the darker colors of the neighboring structures and bears a sign for \"Scandia Glass.\" Other signs and details of a typical city street are visible, including shards of everyday urban life like the fronts of shops and parked cars.\n\nThe scene is rich with colors and texturesâ€”from the lush greens and bright blooms in the foreground to the varied architectural styles and urban elements in the background. The setting suggests a public or communal garden nestled within a city, emphasizing a blend of nature and urban life.","title":"Volunteer worker in the garden opposite St. Vincent's Hospital at Seventh Avenue and 11th Street. Property had been acquired by the hospital for future expansion but community pressure brought about a stay and the garden was a temporary solution. Maintained by volunteers its great variety of plants makes a splendid display.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551780","551705","551743","551701","551620","551623","543319","551702","551728","550055","551744","551621","552401","551775","551698","551745"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["flower","garden","neighboring","gardening","act","city","street","bloom","bed","shop"]}
