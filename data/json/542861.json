{"path":"542861.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph depicts a natural landscape under a clear, blue sky. In the foreground, there is a sloping hill covered with golden-yellow grass, which has a shimmering, sunlit appearance. Halfway up the hill, the earth transitions to rockier, more uneven terrain with some green and brown vegetation scattered across the area.\n\nAtop the hill, positioned prominently against the vivid blue sky, are two notable barren trees. These trees are leafless with pale, silvery trunks and branches, giving them a stark, skeletal appearance that contrasts with the surrounding greenery of smaller trees and bushes at the base of the hill. \n\nThe background is mostly the deep blue sky, which occupies the upper half of the photograph. The scene is tranquil, highlighted by the starkness of the tree trunks and the vibrant hues of the grass and sky.","title":"Northern California","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555639","549186","544019","549134","556473","555589","549248","549238","552903","555616","554780","549227","542644","546157","555642","552914"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["hill","trunk","starkness","appearance","half","tree","grass","occupy","bush","transition"]}
