{"path":"556957.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and serene rural scene, enveloped in a subtle, misty atmosphere. The composition is spread over a large field that showcases various elements harmoniously integrated into the natural landscape.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there is a solitary horse standing in the middle of the field. The horse appears calm and is a central focal point amidst the expansive nature around it.\n\nMoving towards the right, the field is dotted with wildflowers and shrubs, which introduce spots of white and green, adding a touch of vibrancy to the predominantly dark green and brown hues. These plants provide an untamed, natural feel to the foreground.\n\nFurther right, there is a quaint white house with a typical gabled roof, possibly a farmhouse, suggesting a residence or a functional building related to farm activities. Adjacent to the house is a small, dark-colored shed or barn, which contributes to the agricultural vibe of the scene.\n\nIn the background, you can see a dense line of trees which might be part of a forest bordering the field. These trees are shrouded in mist, which gives the image a slightly mysterious and ethereal quality.\n\nThe sky above is overcast, with a soft diffusion of light that spreads evenly across the scene, emphasizing the tranquil and somber mood of the photograph.\n\nOverall, this image captures a moment of quiet rural life, with an emphasis on solitude and the beauty of a natural, foggy landscape. The mood is peaceful and somewhat introspective, reflective of a typical misty morning or late afternoon in a pastoral setting.","title":"View of the home of Jerri Fisher in the countryside near Poulsbo. The \"first generation\" home is the white structure at the upper right portion of the photo. Beyond it at the extreme upper right is his \"second generation\" home. These houses are in an area which will be affected by population growth when the navy's proposed Trident submarine base is built nearby.","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["557013","557023","554161","557025","543726","556985","557186","542622","556958","550311","554721","555577","554767","546154","555537","552562"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["field","horse","diffusion","farmhouse","residence","house","shed","vibrancy","wildflower","barn"]}
