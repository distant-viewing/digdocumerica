{"path":"545462.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant night scene on an urban street lined with businesses illuminated by a multitude of neon signs and streetlights. Notably, the large \"ALABAMA\" marquee sign, adorned in a vertical array with bright lights, dominates the left side of the frame, suggesting the presence of a prominent theater or similar landmark.\n\nAs the eye moves further right, various other neon signs are visible, including those for \"LAWRENCE PLACE,\" and \"Goldstein's Furs.\" Businesses advertising wigs, loans, and a \"Sensational Movie\" can also be seen. The background is dotted with more subtle, glowing streetlights and additional faintly lit signs, contributing to the bustling nightlife of the cityscape.\n\nThe photograph depicts an array of parked cars along the curb and the street appears to be busy with both vehicular and pedestrian traffic, typical of a busy urban setting at night. The blur of a few headlight trails indicates motion, enhancing the dynamic feel of the city's active life after dark. The overall composition, with its gleaming lights against the dark backdrop, encapsulates the energy and buzz of an evening in the city, full of entertainment and commercial activity.","title":"Night time street scene","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["555446","551321","551322","549014","549009","550127","547798","555381","547073","551239","547051","549017","555425","549022","551135","545216"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["streetlight","neon","night","sign","business","array","theater","entertainment","multitude","dark"]}
