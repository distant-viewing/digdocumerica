{"path":"555145.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph displays a landscape dominated by a dense coniferous forest primarily comprised of tall, slender trees. The image captures an aerial view of a distinct pattern of deforestation. A large, arrow-shaped expanse has been cleared from the forest, pointing downwards and intruding from the upper middle part of the frame toward the bottom center. The cleared areas display sparse vegetation or barren soil, contrasting sharply with the surrounding lush greenery. The ground within these cleared areas is irregular, covered with remnants of felled trees and debris, suggesting recent logging activities. The surrounding forest forms a thick border around the cleared sections, highlighting the stark difference in vegetation and land use. The background hints at more forested areas and possibly rolling hills, but it primarily focuses on contrasting the deforested areas with the untouched woodland around them.","title":"View of recent clear-cuts on the Canyon River drainage system in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542833","542841","555085","545143","542834","556922","542839","542840","555146","542832","542823","557001","545289","555148","542828","542826"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","difference","deforestation","arrow","logging","woodland","border","remnant","vegetation","expanse"]}
