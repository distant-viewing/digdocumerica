{"path":"550423.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"The photograph captures a striking aerial view of a mountain range. The mountains are characterized by their rugged, craggy features with deep crevices and undulating peaks. A fresh layer of snow accentuates the contours and textures of the landscape, creating a dramatic interplay of light and shadow. The snow is more densely packed on some slopes and sparser on others, suggesting variations in elevation and the angle of sunlight. The overall color palette is a mix of muted earth tones and stark whites, which enhances the sense of wilderness and natural beauty.\n\nThere are no visible signs of human activity or habitation; the area is seemingly untouched and pristine. The perspective suggests that the photograph was taken from a considerable height, possibly from an aircraft, giving an expansive view of the terrain below. The image conveys a sense of isolation and the majestic scale of the natural environment.","title":"Folded horizontal strata in the Brooks Range on the east side of the Atigun Valley","placename":"Alaska","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550515","542519","550501","550514","552144","550422","550413","555690","550500","550419","542830","542831","542520","542842","552173","550416"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Mountain Landscapes"],"terms":["snow","crevice","mountain","aircraft","elevation","variation","habitation","white","contour","height"]}
