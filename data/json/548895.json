{"path":"548895.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a river canal cutting through a vast, sandy desert landscape. The canal appears as a vibrant blue ribbon curved gracefully against the predominant beige and light brown tones of the surrounding sand dunes. A road bridge spans the canal, featuring a relatively simple design with a straight path supported by what appears to be a series of pillars. Alongside the canal, there are service roads that parallel its course, providing access points at various intervals. The topography consists predominantly of smooth dunes, showcasing a texture highlighted by the soft shadows and curves formed by natural winds. The desert extends to the horizon, suggesting a remote or isolated region, under a clear sky which adds a calmness to the setting. This image likely illustrates a significant feat of engineering, emphasizing human intervention within a natural desert environment.","title":"The All-American Canal transformed the Imperial Valley from desert to farm land with water from the Colorado River.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["549076","548896","542510","548928","548924","544658","545329","548941","549032","548925","548192","552733","548933","543976","544752","544654"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["canal","dune","desert","interval","ribbon","course","beige","pillar","intervention","calmness"]}
