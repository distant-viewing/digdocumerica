{"path":"553238.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a lively street performance, specifically focusing on a male performer who is energetically playing an improvised drum set made of what appears to be blue plastic containers. The performer, sporting a dark beard and mustache, with long unkempt hair, is dressed in a vibrant yellow T-shirt featuring some black text on the front. He is intensely focused on his drumming, depicted in a motion-filled moment with his hands blurred as he strikes the containers with drumsticks.\n\nThe setting seems to be an outdoor public space, possibly during an event, considering the crowd of spectators that can be seen in the background. Onlookers are varied, with adults and potentially children, standing and enjoying the performance. The clothing styles suggest a casual outdoor event atmosphere. The background is faint and out of focus, emphasizing the performer and his action in the forefront.\n\nThis image not only captures a unique form of artistic expression but also the communal experience of a street performance, highlighting the interaction between the artist and his audience.","title":"August brings the \"d'aug days\" to fountain square.  \"d'aug days\" is a month long festival of arts presented to, for, and sometimes by, the people.
