{"path":"548084.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph captures a congested traffic scene on a highway during what appears to be a sunny day. The point of view is from an elevated or bridge position, looking down the length of the highway which is filled densely with vehicles.\n\nThe composition focuses on a mixed lineup of vehicles including several semi-trailer trucks boasting logos like \"Western Freight\" on their containers, and numerous cars of various models and colors typical of 1960s and 1970s automotive design. The cars feature a range of colors - red, blue, white, and green, among others.\n\nThe traffic is composed of multiple lanes, with vehicles of different sizes - from small cars to large trucks - indicating a mix of commercial and personal transportation. Notably, all the vehicles are oriented in the same direction, suggesting a one-way traffic flow. The road itself has clear lane markings, and the barrier in the middle separates the directions of traffic.\n\nThe background beyond the road is harder to discern but includes some greenery and possibly a slight hill or a sloped area, contributing to the indication that this photograph might have been taken in a suburban or semi-urban area. The light and shadows indicate a bright day, possibly enhancing the heat effect typically associated with traffic jams.\n\nThis snapshot not only captures the era's automotive culture but also highlights infrastructure and traffic management challenges of the time.","title":"Approaching interstate bridge over the Columbia River on Route 1-5","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["557229","555505","545884","549903","553726","550089","553018","553727","542764","555437","557228","556194","547569","553019","545455","549890"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["traffic","lane","vehicle","highway","direction","lineup","boast","jam","car","truck"]}
