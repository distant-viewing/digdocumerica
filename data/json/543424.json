{"path":"543424.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures a stunning coastal landscape. It appears to be taken from an elevated perspective, offering a broad view of a coastline where land meets sea. The scene is characterized by a series of jagged cliffs and rocky outcrops that form a rugged coastline. The water near the shore breaks into white waves, suggesting a dynamic and possibly windy environment.\n\nThe landscape is dominated by large hills or mountains, which slope down to the coast. These mountains are covered in golden-brown grass, hinting at either a dry season or naturally arid regional climate. Scattered across the hills are patches of darker vegetation, possibly shrubs or small trees, providing a contrast to the dominant grassy terrain.\n\nA winding road hugs the contour of the hills, enhancing the sense of isolation and untouched natural beauty. This road curves gracefully along the coastline, bordered by a thin barrier, likely for safety. The roadâ€™s presence suggests human access to this otherwise remote and natural region, potentially serving as a scenic route for travelers.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph is dramatic, with the angle of the sun casting long shadows and highlighting the textures of the landscape, which adds depth and a vividness to the scene. The overall mood is serene yet vibrant, a testament to the untamed beauty of coastal terrains. No people or moving vehicles are visible, which emphasizes the tranquility and untouched nature of the area. The photograph could possibly be taken during golden hour, given the warm lighting, enhancing the rich colors of the landscape.","title":"California -- Monterey","placename":"Monterey (Calif.)","location":"Monterey, California","nn1":["543435","543431","543428","543304","543300","543328","543051","543430","543374","543184","543432","543085","543297","543433","553775","545230"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Coastline"],"terms":["coastline","hill","road","testament","jagged","hug","traveler","outcrop","coast","mountain"]}
