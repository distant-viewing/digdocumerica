{"path":"558171.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"McTaggart, James","caption":"The photograph captures a touching and caring moment likely in a hospital setting. It features two individuals situated in a narrow corridor. The person on the left, presumably a nurse or a medical professional, wears a surgical cap, a mask hanging under her chin, and a protective gown. She is crouched beside the second individual, a young mother sitting on a red chair, dressed in a white hospital gown with blue polka dots and holding a newborn baby wrapped in a white blanket. The background is blurred but shows the busy, possibly hectic environment of a hospital with other people moving in the corridor, possibly other medical staff or visitors.\n\nTheir positions and the nurse's attentive posture suggest a moment of support or guidance, possibly the nurse assisting or giving advice about handling the newborn. The warm lighting and the composition of the image emphasize a sense of intimacy and care within a clinical environment.","title":"A new father holds his child for the first time in Loretto Hospital in New Ulm, Minnesota. There are two hospitals in the town: Union, which is non-denominational, and Loretto, which is Catholic. They have divided their services to specialize and give more efficient service. New Ulm is a county seat trading center of 13,000 in a farming area of south central Minnesota. It was founded in 1854 by a German immigrant land company that encouraged kinsmen to emigrate from Europe.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558172","558166","552638","558170","558175","543906","558167","554849","556294","556233","558405","558409","557368","550090","553545","556299"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["hospital","gown","corridor","guidance","professional","mother","polka","staff","baby","chin"]}
