{"path":"545093.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph portrays two individuals engaged in fishing-related activities aboard a boat. The setting seems to be on calm waters, possible with a hint of early morning or late afternoon light judging by the cool hue of the scene.\n\nThe boat is split into two main sections visible in the image. The foreground of the boat is filled with a large number of crabs, tightly packed together, giving a sense of a successful catch. These creatures sport dark, muddy shells, hinting at their likely habitat.\n\nIn the middle section of the boat, a large metallic bin is overflowing with what appears to be smaller fish or aquatic creatures, further indicating the boat's bountiful harvest. Next to this bin, a man, likely a fisherman judging by his attire which is typical for maritime activities with a white T-shirt and shorts, is bending over, perhaps sorting through the catch or managing the equipment inside the bin.\n\nNear the stern of the boat, another individual, wearing a plaid shirt and a cap, is handling a tool that might be used for fishing or handling the catch. The stance suggests he is actively engaged in work.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph includes elements vital to the fishing industry—tools, catch, and manpower—all encased in the confined yet organized space of a fishing boat. A sense of diligent labor and the nautical environment is well conveyed through the artifacts and activities depicted.","title":"Commercially harvested dungeness crabs","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["554200","545178","544264","544256","546758","552273","552877","546053","552298","545175","547563","552324","547552","546301","545185","547557"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["bin","boat","catch","fishing","creature","judge","handle","crab","fisherman","encase"]}
