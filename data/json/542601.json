{"path":"542601.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts three individuals engaged in some type of manual labor or exploration activity in a rugged terrain setting. They are situated within a large trench or excavation site, which has steep and rough earthen walls composed of a reddish-brown soil. This brown and rugged soil dominates the foreground of the image, indicating either a dry climate or the upheaval of earth that hasn't been exposed to much weathering.\n\nThe individuals appear to be working or observing the surroundings as they climb or navigate through the site with attentive postures. Their clothing, which seems practical and rugged, including what could be boots and work pants, suggests a focus on functional attire suited for outdoor or labor-intensive activities.\n\nThe backdrop shows a somewhat sparse forest landscape on rising terrain, with tall coniferous trees that are somewhat thinly spread out. This area highlights a mixture of natural greenery and cleared patches, possibly indicating logging activity or other forms of land use. The sky is clear and bright blue, suggesting a sunny day.\n\nOverall, the composition combines elements of human activity and natural landscapes, telling a story of labor, exploration, and perhaps environmental impact, characteristic of many rural or undeveloped areas undergoing change.","title":"California--Sierra National Forest","placename":"Sierra National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sierra National Forest, California","nn1":["553093","552545","554804","545776","544003","555824","552687","554856","549255","553112","545534","545592","553639","556893","555610","543850"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["labor","exploration","soil","trench","site","tell","undergo","climb","weathering","work"]}
