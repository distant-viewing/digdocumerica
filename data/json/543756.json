{"path":"543756.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph showcases a dramatic cave interior with striking geological formations. The scene is richly textured, characterized by craggy cave walls encrusted with mineral deposits. These formations include an assortment of sharp, elongated stalactites that hang from the ceiling, resembling icicles. They vary in size and shape, some appearing as large, thick columns while others are slender and pointed.\n\nThe colors in the cave are deep and varied, dominated by dark browns and shadows that hint at the depth and uneven surfaces of the rocky walls. Some areas glisten with a wet sheen, possibly indicating recent water activity, which could be responsible for the growth of the stalactites.\n\nAt the lower part of the image, there is a body of still water, reflecting the ceiling's formations with a slightly blurred effect. This adds a mystical and serene quality to the image, enhancing the otherworldly and tranquil atmosphere of the cave.\n\nThe overall composition immerses the viewer in the secluded and natural beauty of this underground setting, portraying a quiet moment beneath the earth's surface where nature's slow architecture continues to unfold.","title":"Acid and radium 226 leak from uranium mill tailings pond into the san miguel river","placename":"Uravan (Colo.)","location":"Uravan, Colorado","nn1":["551358","551359","544937","555047","556512","549244","550428","545584","553770","545567","555556","544898","556519","555225","543766","543656"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["cave","formation","ceiling","immerse","unfold","wall","sheen","deposit","glisten","assortment"]}
