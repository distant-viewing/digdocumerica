{"path":"547452.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Lien, Mike","caption":"This photograph captures a dramatic seascape scene where a red sailboat is shown maneuvering on choppy waters. The sailboat, labeled \"WANDELAAR,\" features a white sail that is fully hoisted and filled by the wind, indicating it is actively sailing. On deck, several individuals can be seen attending to the sailing tasks, ensuring proper navigation and control of the sail.\n\nBeside the sailboat, a much larger freight ship dominates the composition. This ship has a black hull and a superstructure featuring two large, gray smokestacks. The freighter is equipped with large cargo cranes and appears to be either a cargo or industrial ship. Its massive scale contrasts starkly with the smaller, more fragile-looking sailboat.\n\nThe background is subdued with gray, overcast skies suggesting a somber or challenging weather condition. The waters are rough, with waves visibly churning, adding to the dynamic and somewhat tense atmosphere of the setting. The juxtaposition of the small sailboat against the large, industrial vessel in this environment highlights both the challenges and the adventures of sailing.","title":"The racing sloop Wandelaar passes close by a large cargo ship in Chesapeake.","placename":"Annapolis (Md.)","location":"Annapolis, Maryland","nn1":["549432","547464","547449","547461","544667","547456","549394","547463","544717","552010","549403","549431","547467","549405","549426","549404"],"cl":[24],"cluster":["#24 &mdash; Maritime And Fishing"],"terms":["sailboat","ship","sailing","sail","cargo","superstructure","freight","seascape","navigation","challenge"]}
