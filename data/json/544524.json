{"path":"544524.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Ward, Fred","caption":"This photograph depicts a peaceful natural scene, primarily of a calm freshwater environment. The focus is on a dense cluster of tall reeds and other aquatic plants along the water's edge. These plants are predominantly vertical with slight leaning and are a mixture of green and beige, indicating different stages of growth and possibly some decay. The background behind the reeds is a bit obscured, maintaining the focus on the aquatic vegetation.\n\nThe water in the foreground reflects the reeds and plants. This reflection adds a symmetrical element to the image, with the plants above the water mirrored by their reflections below. The water itself appears calm with a slight ripple, which may be caused by a gentle breeze.\n\nThe photograph has a quiet and tranquil mood, likely aiming to capture the serenity of a natural aquatic setting without any visible human presence or disturbance. It gives a sense of seclusion and untouched nature, ideal for viewers appreciating environmental and ecological themes.","title":"TaMiami Canal area","placename":"Everglades National Park (Fla.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543561","550750","557442","557445","544525","550783","545008","551352","547532","543558","550786","550389","549641","557111","552525","558009"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["reed","plant","reflection","serenity","seclusion","breeze","ideal","disturbance","water","mixture"]}
