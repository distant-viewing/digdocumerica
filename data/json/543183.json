{"path":"543183.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a rocky tidal pool environment with a focus on its natural features. The scene is composed of various jagged rocks, which display a rough texture and predominantly dark coloration, possibly due to moisture or organic growth such as algae or moss. Between these rocks, there is a small pool of water, which is partially illuminated by sunlight, highlighting its clarity and the presence of underwater algae or seaweed. The water appears to be still, suggesting it is a sheltered spot, possibly captured during a low tide when water movement is minimal.\n\nThe sunlight enhances the contrast in the photograph between the illuminated portions - casting glare on the water and brightening patches of the rock - and the shadowed areas which are almost black. No human activity or man-made objects are visible in the image, emphasizing the natural and untouched aspect of this environment.\n\nThe picture generally conveys a serene yet rugged coastal scene, typical of tidal pools which serve as microhabitats for various aquatic species, and suggests a sense of isolation from human interference. The image seems that it might have been taken from an elevated angle looking almost directly down into the crevice, offering a topographical view of this small ecosystem.","title":"Algae on coastal rock","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"Point Lobos State Reserve, California","nn1":["547471","543135","543984","547486","543292","543142","543186","549353","547602","543289","545095","542583","555626","543295","545173","543243"],"cl":[10],"cluster":["#10 &mdash; Ocean"],"terms":["pool","algae","rock","interference","brighten","glare","seaweed","crevice","tide","coloration"]}
