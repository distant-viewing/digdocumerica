{"path":"543778.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of a lizard in a natural, rocky environment. The lizard, central in the frame, has a vibrant blue and green coloration that contrasts strikingly with its surroundings. Its body is elongated, with distinct scales visible on the skin, and it sports a long, slender tail. The lizard's head is raised slightly, and it seems to be looking off to the side, giving a sense of alertness and curiosity.\n\nThe ground on which the lizard stands is rough and scattered with small rocks and pebbles, typical of a dry, arid landscape. There's minimal vegetation; however, a small patch of green grass is visible in the bottom left corner of the image, adding a touch of life to the predominantly brown and rocky terrain. The lighting in the photograph is bright, indicative of a sunny day, which casts clear shadows and highlights the texture of both the lizard and the ground.\n\nThe focus and detail of the photograph emphasize the lizard, making it the clear subject of the image, while the background remains out of focus, ensuring that the viewer's attention remains on the lizard. The overall composition and setting suggest a natural, possibly wild habitat suited for reptiles such as this.","title":"Colorado--near Nucla","placename":"Nucla (Colo.)","location":"Nucla, Colorado","nn1":["545553","551366","544622","544904","555065","551250","544908","555196","549459","557585","549144","544280","555066","549145","550476","554602"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["alertness","pebble","tail","coloration","skin","curiosity","habitat","corner","bottom","head"]}
