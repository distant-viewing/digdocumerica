{"path":"546525.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts an urban alleyway bathed in shadows and sunlight, creating a play of light and dark across the scene. The alley is framed by tall buildings on both sides, with one side featuring a vertical corrugated metal pattern and the other a textured concrete or stone surface. Both sides of the buildings cast dramatic shadows onto the walkway, generating a geometric pattern.\n\nA prominent feature in this image is the metal staircase running alongside one of the buildings. It is a fire escape type, with visible stairs and landings that add a linear element to the composition. Light filters through the staircase, casting grid-like shadows that enhance the urban aesthetic of the scene.\n\nAt the end of the alley, the outdoor light brightens the area, contrasting with the predominantly shaded foreground. There are a few people visible in the distance, suggesting the alley is a passageway or connected to a busier street or area.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures an architectural and human environment where light plays a significant role in defining the space, providing a stark yet dynamic visual texture likely in a city setting.","title":"Greenhouses are part of the new addition to the Irwin Union Bank.","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["546514","545361","550145","552967","543360","545356","545542","546510","543575","545315","544072","555930","545343","549880","555909","546450"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["alley","staircase","alleyway","brighten","play","landing","escape","shadow","generate","stair"]}
