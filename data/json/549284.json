{"path":"549284.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Manheim, Michael Philip","caption":"This photograph captures a lively baseball game featuring children, likely in a local or community league. The players, all wearing yellow team shirts with the name \"Spiral Cleaners,\" are actively engaged in the game within an enclosed field surrounded by a tall chain-link fence. The team shirts and red caps create a uniform look among the players.\n\nIn the foreground, a boy is captured mid-pitch with his arm extended, releasing the ball. Nearby, another player, standing at the base, is poised and ready, glove in hand, to respond to the play. Other players are scattered across the field, positioned for the game, demonstrating the active dynamics of youth sports.\n\nBehind the fence, a scoreboard and a sign showing sponsors, including recognizable names like \"Coca-Cola\" and “Royal Crown Cola,” elude to the local support and sponsorships typical of community sports. The scoreboard displays an inning breakdown, adding to the authenticity of the competitive environment.\n\nThe background of the photo reveals a flat, expansive landscape, possibly hinting at a suburban or semi-rural setting, with sparse industrial or commercial buildings in the distance and a clear sky overhead.\n\nOverall, the photo evokes a sense of community and the enjoyment of a classic American pastime, capturing a moment that exemplifies teamwork, youth engagement, and active participation in sports.","title":"Logan Airport area.
