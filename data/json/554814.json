{"path":"554814.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a scenic, desolate quarry landscape. The image focuses on a large water-filled pit, which reflects a vivid sky-blue color, contrasted by the surrounding earthly tones. The quarry appears deep, with steep, rugged cliffs surrounding the water. The terrain varies in color from dark browns to lighter sandy hues, suggesting different layers of earth and rock.\n\nOn the cliffs and the surrounding area, sparse vegetation can be seen, primarily consisting of small bushes and a few leafless trees, indicating that the photo might be taken in late autumn or early winter. The sky above is partially cloudy, with white clouds floating in a light blue sky, suggesting a cool, calm day.\n\nThe perspective is from an elevated view, looking slightly downwards towards the quarry, giving a broad and encompassing view of the landscape. The overall mood conveyed is one of quiet solitude and the raw, untouched aspect of a post-industrial landscape.","title":"Strip mine pit filled with water in an apparent violation of Ohio law.
