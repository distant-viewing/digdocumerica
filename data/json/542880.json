{"path":"542880.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph displays a rugged landscape dominated by a meandering river cutting through a deep valley. The river appears silty or muddy, hinting at a wide and possibly shallow flow, reflecting a light grayish-blue color influenced by sediment. The surrounding terrain is steep and mostly covered by forests. There are clear indications of logging activity, visible as large, cleared patches where trees have been harvested, leaving a drastically altered landscape. The affected areas exhibit a mottled texture of light browns and sandy colors, contrasting sharply with the dark green of the untouched forested sections.\n\nThe upper portion of the image shows more dense and uniform forest cover, suggesting this area has not been logged as heavily, if at all. The sharp delineation between the forested areas and the logged sections provides a stark visual commentary on the impact of human activity on natural environments. There's a sense of seclusion and remoteness conveyed by the absence of any visible infrastructure or human presence apart from the effects of logging. The atmosphere of the photograph is likely one of quiet, with only natural sounds pervading, underscored by the visual testament to human intrusion into nature.","title":"Stripped woodland","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["542881","550593","550580","550623","555214","550559","550576","550527","543739","555223","550625","542822","557002","550577","550698","550622"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["delineation","mottled","sound","testament","remoteness","grayish","intrusion","section","indication","harvest"]}
