{"path":"553450.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This photograph presents an aerial view of an industrial area juxtaposed with a natural environment. The scene includes a large area dominated by bare land with patches of exposed soil and some greenery, possibly indicating excavation or construction activities. There are several visible tracks of dirt roads winding through this barren area.\n\nA serpentine river winds through the landscape, dividing the industrial and natural elements. Alongside the river, there are dense patches of trees, illustrating a stark contrast between the developed and undeveloped regions.\n\nIn the lower right of the image, thereâ€™s a water treatment facility, identifiable by its structured circular tanks and rectangular ponds arranged in a symmetrical pattern. Adjacent to these water treatment structures are small buildings, likely offices or operational facilities for the plant. Parking spaces with a few cars parked in them are also visible, suggesting operational or maintenance activity.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph skillfully captures a blend of human industrial activity within a natural setting, highlighting the interaction and often the imposition of human structures on nature. The muted colors suggest it might be overcast or the image may be slightly faded, giving a serene, albeit somewhat stark, aesthetic to the contrast between industrial development and the surrounding greenery.","title":"Leominster town dump is adjacent to the leominster water treatment plant--on the banks of the Nashua river","placename":"Fitchburg (Mass.)","location":"Fitchburg, Massachusetts","nn1":["544471","550860","550327","542933","543768","551194","556977","550856","545996","551192","551173","551611","551174","551196","550706","551197"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["treatment","wind","facility","greenery","river","excavation","pond","patch","divide","office"]}
