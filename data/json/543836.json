{"path":"543836.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an old mining landscape, characterized by scarred earth and remnants of industrial activity. The scene includes a series of soil and rock mounds that vary in size, dominating the middle ground of the composition. These mounds appear as heaps of spoil â€” the waste material removed during mining operations, typically containing rocky and earthen debris. \n\nIn the background, rising slightly above the mounds, is a hill equipped with what appears to be a wooden headframe, used historically in mining to support the hoisting mechanism for lifting ore and workers in and out of the mine. This structure stands stark against the sky, suggesting the mine might have been significant in size.\n\nTo the left in the foreground, there is a dilapidated wooden building, likely an abandoned structure from the mining operation. Its walls and roof show signs of severe weathering and decay, indicative of long-term exposure to the elements and abandonment.\n\nSurrounding the scene are patches of sparse vegetation, hinting at a rugged, perhaps mountainous location. The lack of dense vegetation could be a result of the environmental impact of mining activities which often disrupts soil composition and local ecosystems.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is somber, with overcast skies and a sense of desolation from the abandoned industrial infrastructure. The color palette is mostly earth tones, with the grays and browns of the mounds and buildings contrasting mildly against the softer blue of the sky. This image captures a snapshot of the environmental and architectural remnants of an era of robust industrial activity, now quiet and forgotten.","title":"Tailings pile from gold mill which was abandoned in the 1930's","placename":"Cripple Creek (Colo.)","location":"Cripple Creek, Colorado","nn1":["543848","545529","554628","544168","554763","554816","554804","554811","554764","554768","554769","544139","551036","554815","549148","555610"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Mining"],"terms":["mining","mound","mine","remnant","ore","soil","earth","size","result","operation"]}
