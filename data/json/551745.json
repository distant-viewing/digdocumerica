{"path":"551745.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph captures a scene set within an urban garden space, lush with a diversity of floral species, predominantly featuring marigolds, roses, and other shrubs in full bloom, showcasing a mix of yellows, reds, and greens. In the foreground, an elderly individual, presumably male, is engaged in the act of painting, positioned before an easel which displays a canvas. He is wearing a light-colored hat and shirt, deeply focused on his artistic endeavor.\n\nThe garden is demarcated partially by a low fence, and beyond this naturalistic and colorful sanctuary, the stark reality of the urban environment encroaches. This includes a view of a busy street filled with diverse vehicular traffic such as cars and a truck, potentially indicating a busy intersection. Architectural structures typical of an urban setting, including a mix of mid-rise commercial and residential buildings, define the background. An Exxon gas station sign and an unoccupied billboard offer telltale signs of the period and commercial activity, suggesting a juxtaposition of the tranquility of the garden against the bustling city life around it. This dynamic layers the scene with a profound contrast between the bustling urban environment and the serene activity of painting within a peaceful garden.","title":"Painter in the garden opposite St. Vincent's Hospital at Seventh Avenue and 11th Street. Property had been acquired by the hospital for expansion purposes, but community pressure brought about a stay and the garden was a temporary solution. Maintained by volunteers, its great variety of plants makes a splendid display.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551747","551743","551746","551744","551704","550059","544295","551739","551780","551775","548442","551705","551702","551625","551620","551623"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["garden","painting","rose","canvas","reality","mix","billboard","act","endeavor","bloom"]}
