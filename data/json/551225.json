{"path":"551225.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a summer scene with two young boys engaging in outdoor activity near large cylindrical concrete pipes. The setting appears to be a construction site or an area where building materials are stored, possibly beside a water body as suggested by signs of dampness and reflections in the background.\n\nIn the foreground, one boy is positioned on the left, shirtless, standing on the rim of a wooden platform that overlooks the pipes. His hands are placed on the edge of the structure as he leans forward, observing the scene below. His posture suggests curiosity or careful monitoring of his surroundings.\n\nThe other boy is partly visible in the middle ground, standing within one of the exposed grey concrete pipes. Like the first boy, he is also shirtless, which fits the atmosphere of an informal, possibly spontaneous exploration of the area on a warm day.\n\nAround these central activities, the environment features green vegetation, indicating either summer or a location with perennial greenery. The overall ambiance feels adventurous and exploratory, common in scenarios where children interact with semi-industrial environments during leisure time.\n","title":"Workers at Port Arrowhead Marina are replacing old flotation Barrels with the required styrofoam Barrels. Aim is to eliminate oil and chemical leakage that came from old Barrels. Fear is that styrofoam will chip with wear and leave a non-biodegradable floating mess.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["545953","544805","555950","555931","544221","546940","543991","556163","543677","546018","545338","557987","544299","545959","551032","551857"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Child"],"terms":["boy","pipe","summer","dampness","rim","monitoring","fit","overlook","curiosity","scenario"]}
