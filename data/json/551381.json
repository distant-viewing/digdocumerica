{"path":"551381.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a monarch butterfly perched delicately on a cluster of bright orange flowers. The butterfly's wings are strikingly patterned with a black, white, and orange coloration, typical of the monarch species. The foreground of the image shows the butterfly prominently, centered in the composition, with a focus on its intricate wing patterns and the texture of its body, which includes white polka dots on a black field running down the butterflyâ€™s head and torso.\n\nThe butterfly appears to be sitting on small, vibrant orange flowers, possibly Asclepias (milkweed), which are known to be vital for monarch survival and breeding. These flowers have dense clusters of petals, which are visible in great detail, contributing a lush, lively feel to the image.\n\nThe background is softly out of focus, primarily in green tones that complement the vivid colors of the butterfly and flowers, giving depth to the scene and emphasizing the subject in the foreground. The overall composition beautifully frames the delicate relationship between the butterfly and its natural habitat, highlighting the texture and colors with a soft, natural light filtering through.","title":"Monarch butterfly sips the honey of the fragrant butterfly weed (asclepias tuberosa)","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544479","544553","543603","544619","544566","544514","547818","544618","544603","548284","544517","544614","548281","548283","554839","557585"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["butterfly","flower","wing","survival","torso","cluster","polka","relationship","coloration","petal"]}
