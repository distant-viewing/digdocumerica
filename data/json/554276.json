{"path":"554276.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Hoffman, Ron","caption":"This photograph captures a lively outdoor winter scene, likely at a ski resort based on the context. In the forefront, multiple pairs of skis are leaning against each other in a chaotic fashion, forming an informal barrier that partially obscures the view of the people behind. These skis, featuring a variety of colors and brands, suggest the popularity and active use of the location.\n\nBeyond the skis, there is a group of people gathered, possibly skiers taking a break or socializing after a day on the slopes. The crowd consists of several individuals wearing winter attire suitable for skiing, including sunglasses, ski caps, and insulated jackets. The colors of their clothing are vivid and varied, adding a vibrant touch to the snowy environment.\n\nTwo women can be seen more clearly amidst the group; one is wearing a bright pink headband and sunglasses, and the other is dressed in a dark coat. They are surrounded by others who are slightly blurred due to the focus primarily on the skis in the foreground.\n\nThe background features what appears to be a wooden building, typical of ski lodges or resort facilities. There is snow on the ground, consistent with the winter setting, and leafless trees that indicate it is a cold season. The atmosphere seems cheerful and busy, aligning with what might be expected during peak visiting hours at a ski resort.","title":"Outside donovans cafe","placename":"Vail (Colo.)","location":"Vail, Colorado","nn1":["554242","554235","554237","554262","554238","554267","554292","554275","550017","554221","550004","554279","554245","554244","554269","554236"],"cl":[41],"cluster":["#41 &mdash; Horse"],"terms":["skis","resort","winter","popularity","socialize","skiing","headband","skier","visit","suitable"]}
