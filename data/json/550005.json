{"path":"550005.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph captures a rustic and somewhat cluttered yard setting with a variety of elements that suggest rural life or a junkyard scene. In the foreground, there's a small brown horse standing beside an old, pale blue car with noticeable dents and missing its hood emblem, suggesting the car has been through considerable use or has been neglected.\n\nThe horse is cozy against the car, possibly using it as a windbreak or out of curiosity. The vehicle is a classic model, possibly from the 1960s based on the body style, characterized by its long, straight lines and a distinctive fin on its rear side.\n\nBehind the scene, there are several other vehicles spread out in various states of disrepair. Most noticeable is an aged, rusty truck with the hood open, revealing it's possibly undergoing repairs or has been abandoned mid-project. Several other cars are partially visible, including one red car that looks compact and somewhat newer compared to the others, possibly from the 1970s.\n\nIn the distance, there are at least three people gathered around the truck, engaged in either a conversation or inspection of the vehicle. Trees and greenery hint at a wooded or rural type of area, providing a natural backdrop to the assembled automotive and equine scene.\n\nThe overall composition tells a story of rural life, perhaps a snapshot of daily existence in a place where vehicles and animals co-mingle, combining elements of decay with those of ongoing use or habitation.","title":"Obsolescence in the junkyard - pony or auto?","placename":"New Bedford (Mass.)","location":"New Bedford, Massachusetts","nn1":["552995","557701","543166","553488","544395","550098","557670","546230","553489","544641","544425","546177","553008","555492","550797","554561"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["car","hood","horse","vehicle","existence","dent","truck","junkyard","fin","use"]}
