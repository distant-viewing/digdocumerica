{"path":"548977.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a field with active burning in progress. The foreground shows a lot of dried plant material, primarily sugarcane residue, which is in various stages of being consumed by fire. Small flames and smoke are visible, indicating that the burning is ongoing. The middle ground reveals blackened earth, signaling that the fire has already passed through this area, leaving a charred landscape. The background is less distinct but features a relatively clear sky with minimal clouds and some diffuse smoke rising upwards, signaling a broader view of the fire's impact on the area.\n\nThe horizon is flat, providing a sense of the expansive agricultural land, and there seem to be a few sparse trees or structures in the far distance, though details are not clear. This controlled burn, often used as a method to clear fields for new planting or to remove pest infestations and diseases, creates a stark contrast between the golden remnants of plants in the foreground and the scorched earth in the middle. The overall tone of the scene suggests the harsh reality of agricultural practices that involve burning and the transformation of the land following such events.","title":"Burning cut straw to clear the field for another planting--west of El Centro in the Imperial Valley","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547736","542712","548853","547728","548592","558310","545051","553128","548595","548854","544962","553565","542819","548591","551243","553843"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["burning","fire","burn","signal","char","consume","blacken","residue","earth","planting"]}
