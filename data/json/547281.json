{"path":"547281.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a mature woman engaging in gardening in a rural setting. The woman is kneeling on the ground, likely planting or tending to small plants in a freshly tilled soil. She is wearing glasses and is dressed in a plaid shirt and dark pants, looking directly at the camera with a mild smile.\n\nIn the background, a rustic, wooden barn and a tractor with a trailer attached can be seen. The barn is large and weathered, suggesting it might be old and used for storage or farm activities. Next to the barn, there are sparse trees and some hints of additional outbuildings, possibly part of a larger farm.\n\nThe overall setting appears to be quite spacious, with open land suggesting a focus on agricultural or rural life. The cloudy sky and the muted colors of the environment give the scene a serene and somewhat moody atmosphere, typical of rural landscapes. The image portrays a moment of daily life, emphasizing a connection to nature and agriculture.","title":"Planting a vegetable garden in Garland","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547372","547086","547385","557696","554051","547304","554203","556487","544323","556961","555541","543667","543319","556541","557113","558106"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["barn","farm","planting","outbuilding","gardening","tractor","trailer","agriculture","woman","smile"]}
