{"path":"544416.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph captures an indoor setting where two individuals are engaged in the traditional craft of weaving. The room has a rustic, workshop-like quality with visible structural beams and wooden supports. The environment is illuminated by industrial-style hanging lamps. \n\nThe central focus is a large, upright loom holding an intricate woven piece featuring geometric designs and a palette primarily of neutral tones complemented by bursts of black and red. The person seated in front of the loom appears to be a woman; she is dressed in casual clothing and seems to be either weaving or adjusting the loom.\n\nOn the right side of the image, another individual, also likely a woman based on clothing and hairstyle, is sitting on a low stool. She is focused on either reading or crafting, surrounded by boxes and scattered materials, which suggest ongoing work or supplies storage.\n\nBelow the loom and around the room, large woven rugs or textiles are spread out on the floor, adding a vibrant array of patterns and colors to the scene. The setting suggests a blend of functionality and creative expression, typical of a crafting workspace dedicated to textile arts. Overall, the photograph portrays a moment of cultural craftsmanship, emphasizing tradition and manual skill.","title":"Navajo women weave a rug at the Hubbell Trading Post, first trading post on the Navajo reservation.","placename":"Ganado (Ariz.)","location":"Ganado, Arizona","nn1":["544431","544360","557153","551659","551654","558325","557151","558327","552649","558341","543928","558339","558336","555290","544364","558378"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Children Playing"],"terms":["room","stool","burst","clothing","tradition","skill","craftsmanship","reading","craft","black"]}
