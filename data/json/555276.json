{"path":"555276.jpg","date":"March 1974","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"This photograph captures a man sitting at a desk cluttered with a variety of objects, indicating a busy work environment. He is focused on stamping or signing documents, using a stamper in his right hand while organizing papers with his left. The desk features several items including a nameplate labeled \"M. Matarazzo,\" a round logo of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and what seems to be a small potted plant imaged on said logo.\n\nThe man is dressed professionally in a plaid suit jacket and a dress shirt with a decorative pattern. His attention is fully directed towards the paperwork in front of him. Apart from the desk clutter, there are several items of note around him: books, possibly reference materials, a tape dispenser, a stapler, a calculator, and personal photographs. One of the books is labeled \"Licensed Chemical Dictionary.\"\n\nOverall, the setting suggests a professional office environment, possibly in the 1970s or 1980s given the style of the decor and wardrobe. The presence of the EPA logo implies that his work is related to environmental regulations or similar fields.","title":"Environmental Protection Agency customs inspector approves reports on pesticides which have passed laboratory analysis.
