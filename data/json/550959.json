{"path":"550959.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial scene where heavily polluted water is being discharged into a river. The background features a substantial industrial structure with multiple levels, characterized by metal frameworks and piping. The structure casts a shadow over the scene, indicating either early morning or late afternoon lighting.\n\nIn the forefront of the image, the focus is on a mound of dark soil or industrial waste material that forms an uneven barrier between the discharging water and the river. Water is spurting out from several points on this mound, creating powerful jets that stir up the muddy water, suggesting a forceful expulsion of the water. Notably, some jets generate a white, foamy appearance as they impact the river, indicating aeration and possibly the presence of chemicals or pollutants.\n\nTo the left side of the image, a partial view of a barge can be seen, suggesting that this area might be used for transporting industrial materials or waste.\n\nThe composition of the photograph, coupled with its subject matter, communicates a strong environmental message about the impacts of industrial activities on natural water bodies, possibly focusing on themes like pollution or environmental management practices.","title":"Hot water flows into the Kanawha River from the FMC Corporation's South Charleston plant.
