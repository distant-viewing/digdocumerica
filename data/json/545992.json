{"path":"545992.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an expansive industrial scene, likely a factory or processing plant. Numerous large, interconnected metallic structures dominate the image, featuring silos, smokestacks, and complex networks of pipes and conveyor belts. The color palette includes muted grays, blues, and ochre, indicative of metals and possibly corrosion or weathering.\n\nIn the foreground, there are piles of raw materials or waste, with scattered vegetation suggesting a somewhat arid environment. This area appears slightly rugged and undeveloped, contrasting with the industrial complex.\n\nMidground showcases several buildings, some of which seem to be administrative or utility structures. These are smaller, more colorful buildings, like the pink and blue ones, which provide a visual break from the metallic tones of the main facilities.\n\nThe background fades into a hazy sky, blurring the line between the plant and the environment, possibly indicating dust, smoke, or mist in the air emanating from the operations of the plant.\n\nOverall, the scene is devoid of visible human activity, focusing instead on the industrial architecture and its integration into, or imposition upon, the natural landscape. This suggests the photograph might be intended to document the facility or address environmental, industrial, or architectural themes.","title":"Kaiser aluminum plant with industrial dumping area in foreground","placename":"Baton Rouge (La.)","location":"Baton Rouge, Louisiana","nn1":["546122","545998","546108","547010","545841","557387","546055","545442","546085","542705","552544","557374","557392","546107","557225","557293"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["plant","corrosion","address","integration","facility","conveyor","weathering","silo","break","belt"]}
