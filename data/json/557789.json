{"path":"557789.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene under a large tent with a red and white striped canopy. In the foreground, an elderly couple is dancing energetically on a wooden stage. The man is wearing traditional attire, possibly of European origin, which includes lederhosen, a white shirt, knee-length socks, and black shoes. The woman is dressed in a green skirt, a white blouse with embroidery, a red kerchief around her neck, and black shoes.\n\nThe tent appears to give a festive or celebratory atmosphere, likely part of a cultural or folk festival. Beside the dancing area is a band stage with musicians performing; one can see a person in traditional attire playing an accordion.\n\nIn the background, under the shade of the tent and beyond it, spectators are sitting on folding chairs, watching and enjoying the performance. Trees surrounding the area suggest that this event is taking place in an outdoor, possibly rural setting. The audience seems engaged and delighted by the dancing couple's performance, adding to the joyful ambiance of the event.","title":"Couple from the german club of Birmingham, Alabama, dances to authentic bavarian music at the fifth annual oktoberfest held in helen.
