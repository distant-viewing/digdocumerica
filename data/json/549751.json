{"path":"549751.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of waste management activities in an urban setting. At the center, there is a large, ornately decorated garbage truck painted in black with gold trim. The truck has the text \"Trade Waste\" and \"Durite\" on its side, indicating the company handling the waste. Attached to the garbage truck is a mechanical arm, actively lifting a large metal container filled with trash.\n\nNext to this main garbage truck, another, less decorated white garbage truck is parked. The landscape around these vehicles is cluttered with an extensive amount of trash scattered across the ground, ranging from bags and boxes to miscellaneous rubbish.\n\nIn the immediate foreground, a man wearing a red shirt and jeans is standing amidst the piles of waste, suggesting active participation in the waste management process.\n\nIn the background, high-rise apartment buildings loom over the scene, densely packed and towering, indicating this location is likely on the outskirts of a densely populated urban area. The tall buildings and the concentration of waste in one area underscore potential issues of urban waste management and environmental concerns in heavily populated cities.","title":"Municipal dump in the Bronx reaches almost to the doorstep of \"co-op city\" (background).
