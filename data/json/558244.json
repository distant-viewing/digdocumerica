{"path":"558244.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photo features a young person standing in a dense cornfield. The individual, who holds up one hand as if to gesture or wave, wears a red, long-sleeve, button-up shirt securely tied at the waist, black pants, and a blue jean cap. The person has short blond hair and looks slightly concerned or focused.\n\nThe corn around them is tall, lush, and green, with several tassels visible. The field extends deeply into the background, under a partly cloudy sky, suggesting it's a vast agricultural area. In the distant background, there are hints of a rural landscape with faint outlines of buildings or farm structures, and possibly trees or other vegetation on the horizon.\n\nThe overall feel of the image is one of immersion in nature, likely taken during a late stage of the crop's growth cycle given the maturity of the corn. The rural setting and the attire of the individual suggest an exploration or work scenario in a farming environment.","title":"Teenage worker detasseling corn in a field during the summer near New Ulm, Minnesota. The hybrid corn seed for the following year is obtained in this manner. It is one way for young people to make money from the seed corn companies. The youths earn their pay. It can be cold, wet work early in the morning when the tall corn plants are covered with heavy dew. Then it can get hot and muggy as the sun climbs overhead.","placename":"New Ulm (Minn.)","location":"New Ulm, Minnesota","nn1":["558242","557937","558245","558243","557160","555648","544250","558106","544246","557696","546262","548997","554047","549077","543871","547734"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Agriculture"],"terms":["corn","maturity","immersion","cycle","waist","person","button","scenario","farming","crop"]}
