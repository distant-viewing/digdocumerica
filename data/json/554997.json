{"path":"554997.jpg","date":"December 1964","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph presents a close-up view of a natural scene, focused on the roots of a tree and the surrounding environment. At the center of the image, there are several intertwined tree roots, some of which are covered with a layer of moss, suggesting a moist or damp environment. The roots are prominent, forming intricate patterns and are anchored visibly in the soil. Above these roots, a large tree trunk spans horizontally across the frame, also covered in patches of moss and shows signs of aging or decay.\n\nThe background and foreground are cluttered with natural forest floor debris including smaller twigs, dried leaves, and bits of earth, which blend together to create a textured, organic composition. The environment suggests a dense forest setting due to the damp earthiness and the presence of foliage debris. The overall lighting in the photograph is subdued, possibly indicating the image was taken under the canopy of the forest, which filters out much of the daylight. This dim lighting enhances the moody, mysterious aura of the scene. There's a hint of a dark cavity or a small hole under the large tree trunk, adding an element of curiosity to the setting.\n\nNo human presence or activity is evident in the photograph; it purely captures a slice of nature's quiet, unaltered state. The composition focuses on the natural forms and textures, creating a vivid impression of a typical forest ground ecosystem.","title":"Western red cedar nurse log with spruce roots growing into it in Olympic National Park, Washington","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["552057","555203","555205","555204","550792","555183","555008","554976","554985","554961","557580","543488","555006","557622","542749","552058"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["root","forest","moss","trunk","aura","hole","twig","intertwine","anchor","debris"]}
