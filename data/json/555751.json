{"path":"555751.jpg","date":"May 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a detailed and vivid scene of the Manhattan Bridge during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, as hinted by the soft lighting. The towering structure of the bridge dominates the composition, showcasing its intricate architecture and the engineering feats of its construction. The bridge's steel blue color contrasts beautifully against a softer, dusker sky, imbuing the scene with a serene yet industrial feeling.\n\nThe bridge's suspension cables run parallel in a vertical fashion, creating a repeated linear pattern that draws the eye across the photograph. Beneath the main level of the bridge, you can see another tier that features a series of bright, illuminated trusses. These lights add a warm, glowing effect that starkly contrasts with the cooler tones of the bridge and the sky. \n\nBelow the bridge, the lower part of the image shows a glimpse of a cityscape, which includes several rows of buildings with uniform, rectangular windows. These buildings have a somewhat muted, dark color palette, suggesting they are probably residential apartments.\n\nOverall, the photograph combines structural grandeur with subtle detailing, under a dramatic lighting that highlights the bridgeâ€™s prominent role in the urban landscape. The mood is somewhat calm and introspective, with a strong emphasis on the interplay of light and architectural features.","title":"Subway train on the Manhattan Bridge in Manhattan, New York. The problem of how to move people and goods is ultimately bound up with the quality of life everywhere. The lands adjacent to the bight, rivers flowing into it, and bays and estuaries edging it have direct impact upon the environment of the coastal water. The New York, New Jersey metropolitan region is one of the most congested in the world.","placename":"Manhattan (New York, N.Y.)","location":"Manhattan, New York","nn1":["555937","555725","555933","546865","557096","546810","548207","555730","550955","542804","552598","548415","544722","547669","543050","548339"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; Bridges/Overpasses"],"terms":["bridge","suspension","tier","truss","apartment","detailing","engineering","cable","emphasis","grandeur"]}
