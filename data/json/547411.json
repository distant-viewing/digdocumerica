{"path":"547411.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts two elderly men, possibly in their late 60s or early 70s, standing outside of a building that has architectural features resembling a church, indicated by arched windows with white frames in the background. The foreground man is slightly out of focus and smiles at the camera, exuding a warm and pleasant demeanor. He is stylishly dressed in a finely tailored, striped gray suit and holds a book or binder with his hands clasped in front of him. He also sports a matching gray fedora.\n\nThe man behind him, partially obscured by the first manâ€™s presence, shares a similar sense of style, also wearing a gray suit and a gray fedora, though his facial expression is less discernible than that of the man in the forefront. They are standing on what looks to be a stone pathway, hinting they could be departing from or arriving at the church-like structure in the background.\n\nThe setting gives a gentle, dignified air to the scene, possibly after a church service or community meeting, emphasized by their formal attire and the serene, unobtrusive backdrop. The overall composition of the photograph, with its soft focus, muted colors, and timeless fashion adds a nostalgic, almost timeless quality to the image.","title":"After Sunday morning service at Immanuel Lutheran Church near Garland","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["547443","557079","549293","553558","549291","553176","547410","547425","554845","549294","547415","554097","548240","553208","558330","549292"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["church","fedora","suit","man","60","depart","tailor","arrive","clasp","70"]}
