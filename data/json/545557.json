{"path":"545557.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a dynamic scene of a rabbit in motion, portrayed with a blurred effect that emphasizes its rapid movement. The rabbit, centrally located in the image, appears to be sprinting across a flat surface with its body blurred due to the speed of its movement. The background and foreground merge into streaks of colors mainly in tones of brown and muted greens, possibly indicating a natural terrain like a dirt path or a field. The blurring technique used in the photograph creates a sense of speed and motion, which conveys the swift agility of the rabbit as it moves rapidly across the frame, likely escaping or moving swiftly through its environment. The combination of movement blur and natural colors creates a visually intriguing image that captures the essence of motion in the natural world.","title":"Desert cottontail","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["543675","544738","551376","543694","542951","553908","552671","554360","542961","547270","545466","543265","549111","550377","551303","543786"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["speed","motion","movement","technique","streak","blur","world","combination","essence","path"]}
