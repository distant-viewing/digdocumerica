{"path":"554478.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant scene at a campground filled with recreational vehicles (RVs). In the foreground, there is a large beige and yellow RV with a prominent over-cab sleeping area and tinted front windows. Behind the steering wheel, a dog can be seen sitting, partially visible through the windshield, adding a quirky touch. The RV's utility side, facing the viewer, is equipped with various connections and a power line is plugged into an electrical outlet at the campground. A small, black and white dog lies on the ground beneath the driver's side of the RV, appearing to rest in the shade.\n\nJust behind and to the side of this RV, another similar smaller camper is parked. In the background, there are two more RVs, each attached to vehicles that seem to tow them. The farthest trailer is white and hooked up to a blue and white van, while the nearer one is larger with accents of orange and brown, hitched to a substantial brown vehicle.\n\nThe setting is a densely wooded area with tall, leafy trees that provide speckled sunlight and shade to the camping area. The ground is covered in dirt, typical of an established campsite. The atmosphere appears tranquil and idyllic for camping, highlighted by a sense of outdoor adventure and mobility that RVs bring to recreational outings. The essence of a laid-back, communal outdoor living situation is palpable, suggesting the users of these vehicles are enjoying a time of relaxation and natural escape.","title":"Motor home stopped at a Kampground of America (KOA) campground near Old Forge, New York, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["545160","542746","557514","551428","554181","548668","545590","544449","548795","548802","554681","548796","554479","554480","553133","545594"],"cl":[40],"cluster":["#40 &mdash; Camping"],"terms":["camping","dog","vehicle","outlet","escape","campsite","mobility","camper","cab","windshield"]}
