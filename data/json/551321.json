{"path":"551321.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a vibrant nighttime scene along a commercial street. The main focus is on the brightly lit signs along the roadside.\n\nOn the left, there is a prominent sign that reads \"PALM READER & ADVISOR\" highlighted by surrounding light bulbs; it has an image of a palm, suggesting a business offering palmistry services. The light from this sign is reflected on the hood and windshield of a car parked on the street, capturing the same palm and text in reverse on the reflective surface.\n\nThe streetscape extends towards the right, with a long exposure capturing the red and white light streaks of passing vehicles, creating a dynamic sense of movement on the road.\n\nFurther down the street, other illuminated signs are visible, advertising various businesses like drive-ins and diners. The night sky is dark, contrasting sharply against the artificial lights.\n\nOverall, the scene captures a typical bustling American street at night, highlighted by the glow of neon signs and the life of the city reflected in the motion of traffic.","title":"Streaks from autoMobile lights on \"the strip\" at night beginning at bagnell dam, \"the strip\" winds for a mile or so along the ridge tops to the south","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["545462","555446","551239","549014","549017","551322","547073","555381","547798","553017","549113","550127","549009","551494","555438","545216"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["palm","street","sign","night","business","streetscape","diner","in","bulb","neon"]}
