{"path":"552727.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a daytime scene of a group of older men seated on a public bench. The location appears to be an urban park or sidewalk area. The bench spans the width of the image and is occupied by men who are mostly dressed in casual and semi-formal attire, indicative of styles perhaps from the mid to late 20th century. Many of them wear hats, and their clothes range from suits and ties to light jackets and trousers.\n\nIn the foreground to the left, a noticeable focus is given to a trash can filled with assorted refuse such as paper, cans, and a visible pile of cigarette butts directly in front of it on the ground. This detail introduces a candid, somewhat gritty aspect to the scene.\n\nThe background shows hints of greenery (trees and shrubs), suggesting the setting might be near a park or a landscaped public area. Other pedestrians are faintly visible in the far background, contributing to the public, outdoor ambiance.\n\nThere is a strong element of daily urban life captured here, with the group of men seemingly engaged in casual conversation or simply enjoying a moment of rest. The overall composition and presence of the trash can also subtly comment on the environmental or social aspects of the location.","title":"John f.
