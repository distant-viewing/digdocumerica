{"path":"545549.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a charming scenario featuring two small chipmunk-like animals interacting with a silver cooking pot in a natural, rocky setting. The center of the image shows a pot placed on a smooth, flat rock surface. One of the animals is inside the pot, seemingly eating or searching for food, while only its hind quarters and fluffy tail are visible. The other animal stands at the edge of the pot, peering inside, with its tail extended out for balance.\n\nA stainless steel spoon lies on the rock next to the pot, suggesting that humans might be nearby, or that this scene is in a campsite. The background is composed of uneven, naturally lit red-brown rocks that blend into a soft focus, emphasizing the animals and their immediate surroundings.\n\nThe setting appears to be arid and outdoor, likely a rocky desert or mountainous area, which is typical habitat for such wildlife. The lighting is natural, with strong sunlight casting shadows and highlighting the texture of the rocks and the fur of the animals. The overall scene is an intriguing glimpse into wildlife behavior, possibly prompted by human activity in a natural environment.","title":"Chipmunks find food in camping area of Dead Horse Point State Park.","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545564","545560","545556","542629","550472","554597","554599","557615","542726","545786","555668","543265","554537","550468","545497","545523"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["pot","animal","tail","rock","wildlife","quarter","behavior","cooking","campsite","fur"]}
