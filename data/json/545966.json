{"path":"545966.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an outdoor scene showing the aftermath of a significant event, likely a storm, that has resulted in a large tree being uprooted. The main focus is the fallen tree, which dominates the middle and right parts of the image. The tree has a thick trunk and sprawling branches, some of which are still leafy, suggesting the event occurred fairly recently.\n\nThe background includes a clear blue sky and other trees that appear intact, indicating that the damage may be localized or that not all trees were affected equally. On the left side of the image, part of a residential building can be seen, featuring a light-colored facade. This suggests the setting is in a suburban area.\n\nThe foreground of the image features a well-maintained grassy area, and part of a paved pathway or patio is visible leading up to the fallen tree. Debris and leaves are scattered across the grass, further signifying recent disruption.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph captures a tranquil yet abruptly disrupted setting, highlighting the sudden and powerful impact of natural events. There are no people visible in the image, focusing the viewer's attention solely on the environmental impact and the serene yet disturbed setting.","title":"A 100-year-old oak tree is uprooted to make way for the driveway of a new house being built on this lot.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544466","542570","544587","555204","545254","555207","557008","545264","544464","548692","555086","555152","546969","551328","557993","555142"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Forest"],"terms":["event","tree","patio","impact","disruption","storm","aftermath","damage","part","pathway"]}
