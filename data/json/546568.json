{"path":"546568.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Haun, Declan","caption":"This photograph depicts a large array of spherical, chrome-plated objects mounted on a wall or ceiling. Each sphere acts as a reflective surface, and many of them contain a small, repeated image of what appears to be a light bulb structure reflected within them. The bulbs are likely part of the ambient environment, turned on to emit light, and they are captured within the reflections of these spherical objects.\n\nThe entire scene has a dark background, enhancing the contrast between the luminous bulbs and the reflective surfaces of the spheres. The composition suggests a pattern, with the spheres arranged in a grid or matrix-like formation. The viewpoint is slightly angled, with more spheres visible on the left side gradually diminishing in visibility toward the right side, indicating some perspective and depth to the arrangement of the objects.\n\nThis image could potentially be an art installation or a decorative feature in a contemporary or modern setting, leveraging the visual play of light and reflections to create a dynamic and engaging visual effect.","title":"Interior of Cummins corporate office","placename":"Columbus (Ind.)","location":"Columbus, Indiana","nn1":["556641","546487","557314","555314","551488","547763","555838","556632","555155","543696","546483","555317","557391","549111","555374","546482"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["sphere","bulb","object","reflection","art","chrome","installation","viewpoint","ceiling","grid"]}
