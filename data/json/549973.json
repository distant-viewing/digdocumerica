{"path":"549973.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Swanson, Dick","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene on the steps of a building with rich architectural detail. The primary focus is on a middle-aged man sitting on reddish-brown steps in front of what appears to be an urban brownstone. The man, who has a weary or contemplative expression, is dressed in rolled-up dark pants, a white shirt, and dark shoes. He has slicked-back gray hair and is caught in the act of lighting a cigarette.\n\nAbove him, there is a sign that reads \"AMERICAN RESCUE WORKERS TACERNACLE Rehabilitation Center,\" suggesting the building serves a communal or supportive purpose. The surrounding details of the building include a wooden double doorway framed by ornate stone arches with intricate carvings.\n\nThe side of the photo shows other buildings and a distant view of a street, typical of a dense urban area. The overall atmosphere seems reflective, highlighted by the quiet and somewhat solemn posture of the man combined with the aged and textured surroundings.","title":"Inner city","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["547812","547313","555529","548458","556156","552724","553517","547816","557078","556457","550257","558330","549335","552971","552751","545974"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["step","slick","carving","solemn","cigarette","building","doorway","act","man","detail"]}
