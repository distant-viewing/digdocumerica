{"path":"545414.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene of industrial activity at sunset, characterized by multiple smokestacks silhouetted against a vibrant sky. The stacked chimneys emit thick, dark smoke that blends into the sunset's orange and warm tones, suggesting heavy pollution. The sun, positioned near the center, is partially obscured by one of the larger stacks, which highlights the contrast between natural beauty and industrial impact.\n\nIn the foreground, various industrial structures and power lines add to the complexity of the scene, presenting a landscape heavily modified by human engineering. The power lines crisscross the sky, adding an additional layer of human influence on the natural environment. The overall mood is somewhat somber, reflecting on the environmental cost of industrial progress. The lighting from the sunset casts everything in warm hues, juxtaposing the darkness of the smoke with the natural glow of the setting sun.","title":"U.S. steel plant.
