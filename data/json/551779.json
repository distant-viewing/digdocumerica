{"path":"551779.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Szasz, Suzanne","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant and colorful flower shop display on a city street. A man stands to the side, partially behind a lush, multi-colored array of flowers arranged in various containers ranging from buckets to pots. The flowers present include a mixture of pink, yellow, red, and white blooms, possibly chrysanthemums, tulips, daffodils, and other varieties.\n\nAbove the display, the storefront sign reads “Sunshine Florist,” and another part of the signage displays “Shoes” suggesting a dual-business location or adjacent shops. The shop's frontage is glass, reflecting urban buildings and life outside its confines. The display spills out onto the sidewalk under lights that focus on the vibrant colors of the flowers.\n\nThe man, wearing a light-colored shirt and dark pants, gazes towards the camera with a slight smile, giving a welcoming appearance. On the sidewalk, a wet patch hints at recent watering of the plants, further highlighted by the shiny pavement. The overall scene is lively and quaint, presenting a slice of urban life entwined with the beauty of floral commerce. The setting has an inviting atmosphere, drawing passersby's attention to the freshness and variety of the flowers on offer.","title":"Flowershop at Third Avenue and 66th Street in Midtown Manhattan.
