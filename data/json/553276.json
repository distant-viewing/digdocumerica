{"path":"553276.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This is an urban street scene captured from an elevated or angled perspective looking down a bustling city street, possibly in the United States judging by the style of the cars and street signs. The street is filled with vehicles including cars and buses, suggesting a busy traffic time. Most cars appear to be from the 1960s or 1970s based on their designs. There are multiple lanes of traffic, and the street is lined with a variety of shops and businesses as indicated by numerous brightly colored signs. Prominent signs include those for a loan and jewelry store, camera shop, and multiple clothing stores. \n\nPedestrians are walking on the sidewalks, adding to the urban environment's vivacity. The scene also includes a variety of street signs, including directional arrows and a crosswalk sign prominently displayed in the foreground. Overhead, more signs indicate one-way streets and directions. The architecture of the buildings, while not in sharp focus, shows a typical mid-20th-century American cityscape with multi-storied buildings close to the street, creating a canyon-like effect. The image captures a vibrant, densely packed urban setting typical of a mid-century American city.","title":"Looking north along Vine Street from the overhead walkway at Fountain Square","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["545216","551135","551125","548399","548388","553301","548369","547369","554297","546626","549872","550139","556224","542586","556724","549874"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["street","sign","shop","store","jewelry","traffic","car","arrow","variety","city"]}
