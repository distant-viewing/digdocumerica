{"path":"547399.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts two men in an indoor setting, possibly involved in a medical or health-related activity. The man on the left appears to be a patient, sitting calmly with his shirt unbuttoned at the collar and his head slightly tilted. He is wearing glasses with a translucent frame and sports short-cropped, dark hair.\n\nThe man on the right, likely a healthcare professional, is leaning towards the patient with a stethoscope. He is wearing eyeglasses, a white or light-colored polo shirt, and is focused on conducting what looks like a medical examination, possibly listening to the patient's heart or lungs.\n\nThe background is dimly lit, offering a cozy atmosphere, and features wooden panel walls which give the space a somewhat dated or classic appearance. The overall ambiance is intimate, with a focus clearly on the interaction between the two men, emphasizing the medical examination that is taking place.","title":"Geneva physician Dr. Charles Ashby checks patient, a local businessman","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["553034","545395","556567","548463","545482","556556","553035","545552","545478","558167","556570","545486","543906","545485","556575","558173"],"cl":[32],"cluster":["#32 &mdash; Man"],"terms":["patient","examination","healthcare","professional","eyeglass","polo","man","heart","health","collar"]}
