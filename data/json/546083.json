{"path":"546083.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial scene viewed from across a body of water. In the foreground, there is water that shimmers slightly, suggesting either a lake or a calm sea. The middle ground of the image is dominated by a rugged, rocky shoreline that appears barren and devoid of vegetation. \n\nOn this shoreline, there are several industrial buildings. One large building stands out due to its significant size and distinct rectangular shape. This building is grey or off-white, with a flat roof and multiple large windows. It is equipped with three vertical exhaust stacks that suggest it may be some kind of processing plant or factory. Adjacent to this main building are smaller structures, possibly offices or storage facilities, and there are visible staircases and mechanical equipment, which indicates active industrial operations.\n\nThere are various poles and thin structures, possibly electrical poles, intermittently scattered through the area, running parallel to the buildings. The overall setting appears isolated and functional, with little emphasis on aesthetics. The sky above is partly cloudy with a hint of blue, suggesting the photo was taken on a day with mixed weather conditions. The overall atmosphere of the photograph conveys a sense of industrial activity in a remote or less populated location.","title":"Yellow material in foreground is the remains of sulphur stockpiles at the Freeport Co. sulphur mine on Lake GRande Ecaille.","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["544527","546006","546007","551576","546087","552179","548070","551998","545987","544999","549508","551994","555769","546080","546103","557392"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["shoreline","pole","building","exhaust","staircase","kind","emphasis","stack","office","factory"]}
