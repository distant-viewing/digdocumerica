{"path":"556654.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside what appears to be a subway car, shown from a darker, shadowed perspective that frames the brighter interior. We see several passengers standing; the setting includes stainless steel poles and reflective surfaces typical of a subway carriage. A central, standing man with dark hair and a beard looks toward someone or something outside of the frame, fostering a focal point amid the otherwise nondescript group. His expression appears engaged and possibly in conversation. The image is bathed in artificial light from within the car, casting deep shadows and creating a contrast between the bright interior and the murky exterior through which it is viewed. This contrast emphasizes a sense of momentary capture and intimacy within the public setting.","title":"Passengers aboard the New York City Transit Authority subway in the Lexington Avenue line wait for the car to pull out, a new line is under construction at 2nd Avenue at an estimated cost of $2 billion. When proposed in 1967 the cost was estimated at $151 million. Some $300 million already has been committed to the project. Controversy has arisen because the new line was to decrease crowding on the Lexington Avenue line, but the need has decreased because of fewer riders.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554327","554326","556669","556665","548256","554328","553823","556817","556780","556660","556661","556691","551895","548261","556671","554370"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["subway","interior","carriage","intimacy","capture","beard","car","steel","passenger","exterior"]}
