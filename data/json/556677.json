{"path":"556677.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling indoor scene, likely at a train or bus station, with passengers gathered near a gate. The setting features a dim ambience with retro yellow and brown tones dominating the scene, typical of the vintage style of the 1970s or 1980s.\n\nOn the left side of the image, a sign prominently displays \"Turbo to Boston\" above an entranceway, indicating that passengers are queueing for travel to Boston. The gate is surrounded by dark tiled walls and an overhanging structure that partially obscures the ceiling.\n\nThere are several people in the image, mostly adults, dressed in winter attire, which suggest a colder season. The crowd displays a variety of styles: men predominantly in coats and a few in suits, while women are seen in coats and scarves. Most individuals face away or toward each other, suggesting interactions or conversations as they wait.\n\nIn the foreground, specifically on the left, a woman with blonde hair wearing a light-colored coat stands out due to her proximity to the viewer and her apparel contrasts against the darker backdrop. Nearby, a man in a bright red coat is speaking to another man dressed in a dark suit, indicating a possible information exchange or conversation. The remainder of the crowd is a blend of moving and stationary figures, adding a dynamic feel to the image, reflected by some blurred movements.\n\nNoteworthy is the overall mood of anticipation or routine that envelops the scene, a common trait in transit locations where people from various walks of life converge in their commutes. The photograph, likely taken to document everyday life or travel habits, encapsulates a moment frozen in time, detailing the human condition in a public commute setting.","title":"Amtrak passengers at the Pennsylvania Station in New York City wait for the announcement that will let them board.
