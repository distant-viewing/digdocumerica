{"path":"554947.jpg","date":"December 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a rooster standing on a ground covered with dead leaves and twigs. The rooster has a striking appearance, with rich reddish-brown feathers on its head and neck, transitioning into white and black feathers on its body and tail. Its comb and wattles are bright red, standing out against its colorful plumage. The background is quite plain and nondescript, mostly consisting of similar ground cover and a few dark areas that might be shadows or holes in the ground. The setting suggests a rural or farm environment. The lighting appears natural, possibly from an overcast day, enhancing the vivid colors of the rooster's feathers.","title":"Gamecock on a farm near Leakey, Texas, and San Antonio","placename":"Texas","location":"Texas","nn1":["554927","554914","554946","551326","549115","547043","557576","544477","544489","548885","553777","546158","544478","552696","544547","550431"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["feather","comb","plumage","hole","twig","tail","ground","neck","farm","cover"]}
