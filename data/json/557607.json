{"path":"557607.jpg","date":"NA 00NA","photographer":"","caption":"The image features a close-up view of a branch with pine cones encased in ice. The pine cones and branch are centered in the frame, sharply detailed against a highly contrasting background. The ice enveloping the branch and cones has formed intricate, crystal-like structures that appear both rugged and delicate. These ice patterns radiate outward with a feathery, frost-like texture, enhancing the cold, wintery feel of the scene.\n\nThe background is uniformly dark, which makes the ice's blue and white hues stand out vividly. Small specks, possibly additional ice particles or snowflakes, are scattered across the background, adding depth and a sense of ongoing snowfall to the composition. The overall effect is one of natural beauty and frozen stillness, capturing a quiet moment in a winter landscape.","title":"Close-up of alder catkins on the ice of Tin Mine Lake, Washington, near Seattle, Washington.
