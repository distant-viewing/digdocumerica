{"path":"548681.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"The photograph captures an underwater scene presumably in a coral reef environment. At the center, a diver equipped with flippers, a wetsuit, and scuba gear including an air tank and mask, is seen hovering above a large coral formation. The diver appears to be examining or interacting with the environment, possibly conducting scientific research or simply scuba diving for recreation.\n\nThe coral formation on which the diver focuses is massive and bulbous, covered with textures and patterns indicative of a healthy reef. The surrounding area is populated by a variety of marine life, including numerous fish that swim in close proximity to the coral.\n\nThe backdrop shows more coral formations and aquatic plants, contributing to the visual depth and biodiversity evident in this thriving underwater ecosystem. The water is clear, and sunlight filters through from the surface, creating a play of light and shadow that adds to the tranquility and beauty of the scene. The surface of the water is visible at the top of the image, rippling gently and reflecting sunlight. \n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph showcases the interaction between humans and marine ecosystems, emphasizing exploration and the serenity of the underwater world.","title":"Snorkeling at john pennekamp coral reef state park near key largo.
