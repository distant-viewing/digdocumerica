{"path":"554888.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of numerous sheep tightly gathered in an enclosure. Most of the sheep have a rich, dark fleece, with a few having spots or patches of white. In stark contrast, there is one prominently visible sheep with a predominantly white and partially sheared body standing out amongst the others due to its distinctive coloring and less fluffy appearance.\n\nAll the animals are facing various directions, suggesting a lack of uniform movement or possible mild congestion within the space. The sheep appear to be in a penned area, hinted by the visible wooden barriers at the right edge of the image that form part of the enclosure.\n\nThe lighting in the photo is subdued, focusing more intensity on the white sheep and creating a slight gleam on the coats of the darker sheep, enhancing the textural details of their wool. The environment appears to be outdoors, as suggested by the shadow and natural lighting conditions, likely in a farm setting designed for livestock management.\n\nOverall, the composition uses the contrast between the sheared white sheep and the darker, fully coated sheep to draw the viewer's eye, making the white sheep the focal point of the image. This arrangement highlights the individuality within a crowd, creating a visual narrative about diversity and uniqueness even in a homogenous group.","title":"Sheared and unsheared sheep on a ranch near Leakey, Texas and San Antonio.
