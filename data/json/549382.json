{"path":"549382.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The image depicts a haunting, atmospheric scene focused around a stone sculpture of two figures. The sculpture captures a poignant interaction; one figure is sitting with its legs drawn up, head buried in its hands, conveying a sense of despair or sorrow. The other figure embraces the first from behind, offering comfort through a gentle hug around the shoulders. This intensity is underscored by the figure’s contemplative or consoling expression.\n\nThe composition is imbued with a sense of solitude, emphasized by the tranquility of the muted, natural color palette, primarily consisting of greens and blues. An impression of seclusion, or a setting removed from bustling activity, is suggested by the blurry outlines of foliage framing the subjects, indicating that this might be a garden or a park setting.\n\nIn the background, part of a geometric structure – possibly a window with blinds or a shelving unit – is visible, contrasting with the organic shapes and the soft, diffuse textures of the vegetation and the sculptures.\n\nThe photograph has an overall dreamy quality achieved through soft focus and delicate lighting, giving the entire scene a melancholic and introspective atmosphere, inviting the viewer to reflect on themes of comfort, sorrow, and the human condition.","title":"The mestrovic statue of ruder boskovic in the garden of the institute which bears his name.
