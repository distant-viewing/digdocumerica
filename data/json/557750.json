{"path":"557750.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"This image is an aerial photograph featuring a rural landscape scene. At the center of the image, there is a large building with a bright red roof divided into two sections; the upper section features a white structure with multiple windows, suggesting it might be a residential house. The architecture is distinctive with its bold, contrasting colors and multiple stories.\n\nTo the left of the main building and slightly below in the image, there’s a garden or small field with neat rows of crops that add an element of agriculture to the scene. This indicates that the land might be used for small-scale farming or gardening.\n\nThe surrounding area of the house has densely packed trees, predominantly green, suggesting a rich, natural environment. These trees cast shadows, giving depth and texture to the landscape.\n\nAt the top left corner of the image, there's a small, peculiar structure situated on an isolated mound of earth or small hill, surrounded by a larger expanse of grassy land. This smaller structure appears quite simplistic, possibly a gazebo or small shelter, with a white exterior and a red pointed roof, which matches the main building’s roof, creating a visual connection between them. The presence of this structure adds a whimsical or picturesque element to the overall scene.\n\nA pathway or a small road runs horizontally across near the top boundary of the image, with signs of infrequent traffic evident from its relatively undisturbed surface.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph is balanced with a mix of architecture, agriculture, and natural elements. The perspective from above provides a comprehensive view of the living and functional spaces within this rural setting.","title":"Farmhouse and outbuildings owned by former Georgia governor hardeman who now lives in Florida and has the farm managed by an overseer.
