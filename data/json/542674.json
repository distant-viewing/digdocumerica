{"path":"542674.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This is an aerial photograph showing a vast urban landscape with distinct features and a mountainous backdrop. The foreground is crowded with dense residential areas characterized by many small, compact houses clustering around a network of streets and avenues. Prominent roadways crisscross the scene, with a major highway running vertically through the image, splitting the residential areas from larger plots possibly used for agricultural or recreational purposes.\n\nIn the middle distance, more developed areas are visible with what appear to be larger buildings, possibly commercial or industrial, alongside patches of green possibly representing parks or undeveloped land. Towards the horizon, a slight haze blurs the details, blending the cityscape seamlessly with the natural surroundings.\n\nThe background features a range of tall mountains that tower over the urban area, providing a striking contrast between the natural and man-made environments. The mountains are rimmed with a light dusting of haze, likely caused by the distance or atmospheric conditions. The overall composition is a balanced mix of nature and urban development, illustrating the interface between human habitation and natural landscapes. The color palette of the photograph leans towards cooler tones, with the blues and greens evoking a somewhat serene yet vibrant setting.","title":"Smog","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["544073","553728","557516","553060","557518","542673","546407","544791","553059","553936","545625","553935","552186","553938","552171","553724"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["haze","avenue","dusting","interface","rim","split","crisscross","mountain","plot","cause"]}
