{"path":"543098.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a striking night scene that focuses on bushes or shrubbery coated in ice or dew, illuminated by either moonlight or artificial light. The leaves and branches appear delicate and fragile, highlighted by the luminescence of the freezing droplets or ice crystals that glitter like tiny stars scattered throughout the dark atmosphere. The lighting emphasizes the intricate details of each branch and frozen droplet, creating a contrast against the deep, dark blue of the night sky in the background. The scene conveys a sense of cold winter elegance, and the dense clustering of the branches adds texture and depth to the image. Overall, the photo holds a mystical or magical quality, reminiscent of a quiet, frozen winter night.","title":"Klamath River","placename":"Humboldt County (Calif.)","location":"Humboldt County, California","nn1":["557200","543560","557579","554981","557199","543607","547166","557197","557607","554585","543562","543167","551365","557603","555112","543755"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["night","droplet","ice","branch","winter","glitter","crystal","freeze","dew","elegance"]}
