{"path":"555816.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Alexander, Hope","caption":"The photograph captures a person at work in an industrial setting. The individual is wearing a yellow hard hat with earmuffs attached to it, and the name \"FRANK\" is written across the front sticker on the helmet. The person is dressed in a navy blue work shirt and holds a clump of a granular substance in their right hand, seemingly examining its texture or quality. \n\nThe scene appears quite dimly lit, highlighting mainly the central elements while the background remains rather dark and ambiguous, hinting at a complex environment perhaps typical of a factory or production plant with pipes visible.\n\nThe focus on the worker and the granular substance in the hand suggests the photograph might be documenting some aspect of labor or material handling within the facility. The worker's downward gaze adds a thoughtful or investigative element to the composition, suggesting an analytical or inspectional task.","title":"Worker at the Somerset Raritan Valley Sewage Treatment Plant in New Jersey in the metropolitan New York area.
