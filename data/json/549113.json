{"path":"549113.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a bustling street line abundantly crowded with colorful signs from the mid-20th century in America, typifying a scene that might be found on the historic Route 66 or a similar busy urban area. The scene is saturated with vibrant, diverse advertising signs reaching towards the sky, announcing motels, gas stations, and various services.\n\nForeground:\n- The foreground of the image shows vintage cars, likely from the 1950s or 1960s, driving through or parked along the street. The cars are characteristic of the American automotive design of the time, featuring sleek, elongated bodies and prominent chrome detail.\n\nSignage:\n- Numerous signs compete for attention, each adorned with bright colors and bold lettering. The signs represent a variety of businesses including motels like \"KICKCHESTER MOTEL,\" gas stations branded with names like \"CHEVRON\" and \"TEXACO,\" and other services such as \"DUCRS APARTMENTS\" and \"FAMILY UNITS.\"\n- The signs feature words like \"AIR CONDITIONED,\" \"SWIMMING POOL,\" \"FREE TV,\" highlighting the amenities offered, indicative of the burgeoning car culture and the American road trip phenomenon.\n- Some signs are also directional (\"TURN HERE\"), adding a functional element to their promotional purpose.\n\nEnvironment and Background:\n- The backdrop shows a stark contrast between the dense clutter of commercialism and the natural landscape. Arid mountains and a clear sky suggest a location possibly in the southwestern United States, a region known for such geographic features.\n- Despite the busy street, there's a striking clarity in the air, perhaps due to the photographic quality and the lighting conditions, which cast deep shadows and enhance the vividness of the signage.\n\nOverall, the photograph is a rich tableau of mid-century American life, showcasing the vibrancy and dynamic nature of commercial strips during that era. The composition is dense and detailed, offering a glimpse into the past's advertising strategies and urban layout.","title":"Street scene in East Las Vegas","placename":"Las Vegas (Nev.)","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada","nn1":["549014","549017","553017","545618","549008","545216","551494","549224","545614","551135","554709","547021","549872","548889","542586","547369"],"cl":[5],"cluster":["#05 &mdash; Sign 1"],"terms":["motel","sign","advertising","gas","signage","service","street","station","tv","1950"]}
