{"path":"542667.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scientific or technical scene, primarily illuminated by blue light that casts a distinct atmosphere. Two people, presumably scientists or engineers, are engaged in work within what appears to be a laboratory setting. The person on the left is seated and appears to be observing or monitoring something closely, possibly taking notes or adjusting a control. The individual on the right is standing and actively handling some equipment, focused on his task.\n\nThe central object of interest is a large, tubular device situated on a table that bathes the scene in bright blue light, suggesting some kind of optical or photonic experiment, possibly involving lasers or fluoroscopic methods. The equipment is sleek, elongated, and partially encased, indicating sophisticated technology designed for precise scientific work.\n\nThe background is simple and utilitarian, characterized by plain walls and minimal clutter, focusing attention on the experimental activity. The overall composition of the photo, with its dramatic lighting and focus on advanced technological equipment, highlights a moment of intense scientific inquiry or discovery.","title":"Photochemical tube reactor \"manufactures\" smog at the air pollution research center","placename":"Riverside (Calif.)","location":"Riverside, California","nn1":["549627","546344","555332","546327","555374","555375","551595","549364","548860","542765","552386","549608","546283","549367","555280","555249"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["equipment","inquiry","discovery","encase","scientist","engineer","method","clutter","experiment","monitor"]}
