{"path":"554404.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and peaceful sunset over a calm body of water, possibly a lake. The scene is mostly silhouetted, with the landscape engulfed in shadows due to the dimming light of dusk. The silhouette of dense, coniferous trees lines both the near and far shores, framing the water.\n\nThe sun, partially obscured by the trees, illuminates the sky with a soft, muted light which gradually darkens towards the top and sides of the image. This results in a gradient of colors from a gentle orange near the sun to deeper blues and purples in the upper sky.\n\nThe water itself is very still, creating a clear, mirror-like reflection of the surrounding forest and the sky. This reflection adds a symmetrical balance to the composition, enhancing the tranquility of the scene. There are no visible signs of human activity or disturbance, just the natural beauty of a quiet, untouched landscape during the twilight hours. The setting evokes a sense of calm and might inspire contemplation or appreciation for the natural world.","title":"North branch of the Moose River seen from the bridge at Thendara.
