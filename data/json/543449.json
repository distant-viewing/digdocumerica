{"path":"543449.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph captures two enormous redwood trees extending upward into a vivid, blue sky. The image is taken from a ground perspective, looking directly up at the towering trees, emphasizing their grandeur and the texture of their bark. The bark is rugged with deep grooves and appears weathered, suggesting the age and natural history these giants have witnessed. The trees are situated quite close to one another, and their trunks almost seem to merge into a single form at the base, diverging as they grow taller.\n\nBetween the two main trees and around them, one can see smaller, leafy tree branches, possibly from other types of trees in the forest, adding a contrast to the thick, darker trunks of the redwoods. The canopy is dense with these smaller leaves catching the light, creating splashes of brighter green against the darker shades of the redwood trunks and the shadowed underbrush.\n\nThe composition of the photo, with its upward angle and the play of light and shadow, conveys not just the physical presence of these trees but also an atmosphere of quiet and reverence, typical of redwood forests. There is a serene and ancient quality to the scene, typical of old-growth forests where such majestic trees are often found.","title":"California -- redwoods, Colwell Redwood State Park","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543442","542752","554969","543447","542845","554968","542748","542922","554966","542569","542745","542722","542750","554967","553576","542928"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["redwood","trunk","tree","bark","forest","reverence","groove","underbrush","history","splash"]}
