{"path":"556110.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between two men standing outside near a train. The setting is outdoors, indicated by the strong sunlight and shadows casting over the figures and the ground.\n\nOne man wears a traditional railroad conductor's uniform, which includes a dark blue cap with a badge and a blue jacket with gold buttons. His expression appears focused and slightly inquisitive as he looks towards the other man. The conductor is standing to the left side of the frame.\n\nThe other man is wearing a bright red blazer and glasses with a prominent black frame. He holds a small book or pamphlet, which he appears to be showing or explaining to the conductor. His demeanor seems attentive and engaged in the interaction.\n\nIn the background, part of a dark train with reflective windows is visible. The sky above is clear and brilliantly blue. The simplicity of the background focuses attention on the interaction between the two individuals.\n\nThe overall composition emphasizes personal interaction in a professional setting, highlighted by the sharp color contrasts (the red of the blazer and the dark blue of the conductor's uniform) against the vibrant blue sky.\n\nThis scene likely captures a moment of professional exchange or communication, possibly concerning train schedules, tickets, or regulations.","title":"Amtrak manager, right, and a conductor read contents of a message concerning train travel prior to departure of Expo '74 from Spokane, Washington, to Seattle. Amtrak assumed major responsibility for U.S. intercity rail passenger service in 1971, and leases use of the tracks from the nation's railroads. Ridership has increased since that time as equipment has been upgraded and modern business methods are used.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["556089","556108","556064","556006","542759","556045","556087","556113","557909","551921","555966","556083","556126","556676","555965","556706"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["conductor","train","blazer","uniform","pamphlet","interaction","exchange","schedule","ticket","regulation"]}
