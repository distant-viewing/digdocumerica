{"path":"555148.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"The photograph displays a deforested area, presumably recently cleared given the chaotic scattering of debris. The foreground shows an uneven, muddy terrain littered with broken branches, stumps, and remnants of felled trees. This detritus covers the ground, and the earth itself appears disrupted and bare, possibly from the use of heavy machinery.\n\nMoving towards the midground and background, the scene changes slightly as there are standing trees, though they appear sparse and thin, possibly indicating that this part of the forest has been thinned out rather than completely cleared. These trees look tall and straight, showing no leaves, which may suggest that the photo was taken in a colder season or these are evergreen trees native to a colder climate.\n\nThe entirety of the scene is bordered by a dense, untouched forest visible in the far background, providing a stark contrast between the cleared area and the still-living forest. The sky is overcast, casting a dull, bluish-grey hue over the scene, which enhances the sense of desolation and environmental disruption depicted in this image.","title":"Unreforested clear-cut on Washington State Department of Natural Resources' land. The stream that ran down the hillside is polluted with oil and clogged with logging debris, east of Clearwater River Road and south of Shale Creek, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542865","555150","555136","555139","555208","545138","546060","545289","542820","555092","555230","542828","545254","555221","545264","555162"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["forest","detritus","entirety","scattering","disruption","stump","tree","desolation","remnant","midground"]}
