{"path":"543977.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Keyes, Cornelius M.","caption":"This photograph captures a striking and rugged desert landscape dominated by a narrow winding river. The river, appearing dark in color, snakes its way through the desolate terrain, displaying sections of white sediment or froth. Its banks are lined inconsistently with sparse green vegetation, which stands out in contrast to the surrounding dryness.\n\nThe setting is enclosed by steep, craggy hills, which rise sharply on both sides of the river. These hills exhibit a layered structure, highlighted by various shades of browns and beiges that suggest sedimentary rock formations. Between these layers, the ground is strewn with rocks and boulders, indicating a frequent change in texture and color that adds to the ruggedness of the terrain.\n\nThe topography includes prominent peaks in the background, suggesting a mountainous region, likely formed by geological processes such as erosion. There is no visible sky due to the framing of the photograph, focusing entirely on the geomorphological features of the valley.\n\nThe overall composition of the image, with its focus on the sinuous river cutting through a severe and barren landscape, underscores the themes of natural erosion and the sparse but persistent life that can exist in such harsh environments. The absence of any human presence or activity emphasizes the untouched and raw nature of this landscape.","title":"Runoff from Phelps Dodge Corporation smelter and waste rock dump carries iron oxides into nearby streams.","placename":"Morenci (Ariz.)","location":"Morenci, Arizona","nn1":["545632","544752","545633","545629","552548","544744","552908","545787","545640","543793","545636","545329","544929","543976","550414","552925"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["river","erosion","froth","beige","ruggedness","rock","boulder","topography","hill","framing"]}
