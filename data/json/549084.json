{"path":"549084.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a scene from an agricultural field during a busy workday under a clear blue sky. At the center of the image, a person is struggling to balance a towering stack of cardboard boxes labeled \"ADMIRAL BRAND CRISP CELERY.\" They're dressed in blue jeans, a plaid long-sleeve shirt, and wear a wide-brimmed hat, suggesting protection from the sun. The individual's face is slightly obscured by the disproportional stack of boxes they are carrying.\n\nIn the background, other workers are engaged in similar tasks; one person to the left and another to the right are in motion, each carrying a single box towards or away from a particular area, indicating an ongoing process of either harvesting or packing. The field itself is filled with rows of leafy, green crops, presumably celery, complementing the text on the boxes.\n\nThe soil appears dry and is uneven, with visible clumps and furrows, typical of cultivated land. In the distance, beyond the field, the landscape is flat with minimal vegetation, underlining the rural setting of the photograph. The overall composition of the image with its dynamic angle, mainly focusing on the laborious task and the stacking of boxes, emphasizes the intensity and physicality of agricultural work.","title":"In lettuce fields along the Colorado River, Mexican farm worker carries boxes to field pickers.","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["553732","549048","557478","549036","554047","549050","555620","543324","552812","546964","543157","554936","552576","553879","543481","543845"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["box","stack","field","workday","task","harvesting","clump","protection","cardboard","person"]}
