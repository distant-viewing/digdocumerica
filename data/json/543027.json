{"path":"543027.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"The photograph depicts a rural scene with two young people sitting on a curved, tarmac road. The setting is sunny, suggesting a warm, clear day. The road is bounded on both sides by open fields and a sparse line of fences, hinting at a pastoral location, possibly near a farm or open countryside.\n\nThe two individuals, who appear to be youthful, are engaged in a relaxed, casual interaction. The person on the left, dressed in dark-colored clothing with their back partly towards the camera, is playing a guitar. Seated slightly in front of them, the other individual, wearing lighter-colored clothing and a cap, seems to be talking or gesturing towards the guitar player, likely enjoying the music or joining in a casual conversation. Both have backpacks by their side, hinting at a journey or a long walk, possibly hitchhiking or trekking.\n\nTheir relaxed postures and the casual spread of items around them - including what looks like a beverage bottle beside the guitar player - contribute to a laid-back, perhaps spontaneous atmosphere. They seem comfortable in the outdoor setting, indicating they are enjoying their time in the natural surroundings and each other's company.\n\nThe environment suggests tranquility and openness, with no other humans in sight, only a distant house partially visible in the background, reinforcing the sense of a peaceful, rural locale. The composition of the photograph, with the winding road leading through and around the subjects, creates a visual flow that draws the eye through the scene, enhancing the serene, expansive feeling of the setting.","title":"\"Hitchhiking\"","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["543461","548833","554900","557738","551942","546783","553152","545612","554494","547595","552949","558097","549756","545320","554513","551425"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Leisure Activities"],"terms":["guitar","player","back","tarmac","road","clothing","walk","music","countryside","sight"]}
