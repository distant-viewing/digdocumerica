{"path":"549491.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Burns, George","caption":"This photograph captures a beautifully illuminated, ethereal view of Niagara Falls at night. The scene predominantly features the cascading waters of the falls, intensely lit to create a striking contrast with the night sky. The falls appear vivid and almost mystical under the strong lighting which highlights the thunderous water pouring over the cliff.\n\nOn the left side of the photo, the American Falls can be seen with sheets of water smoothly flowing over the precipice, surrounded by darkness. The mist generated by the falling water adds a dreamlike quality to the atmosphere.\n\nTo the right, across the river, the background shows a cityscape on a hill. A prominent feature in this view is a tall illuminated observation tower among other lighted buildings and smaller lights that dot the landscape, probably representing street lights and other infrastructure. These lights twinkle against the night sky, adding a dynamic and vibrant edge to the tranquil scene of the falls.\n\nOverall, the composition is quite dramatic, contrasting the natural majesty of the falls with the human-made luminescence of the distant city. The photograph has a serene yet powerful quality, capturing the awe-inducing presence of one of nature's wonders juxtaposed with human civilization.","title":"Night view of the American Niagara Falls looking toward the Canadian side.
