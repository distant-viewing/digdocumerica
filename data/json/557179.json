{"path":"557179.jpg","date":"February 1975","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at an outdoor event where several people are engaged in using binoculars, suggesting they are watching something in the distance. The central characters include three individuals prominently featured in the foreground.\n\nOn the left, there is a young woman wearing a blue beanie hat. She has long brown hair and is looking off to the side, not at the same point of interest as the others. Her facial expression conveys curiosity or attention, and she is dressed in a pale coat.\n\nNext to her, in the center, is an older woman who is actively using binoculars to observe something. She is wearing a red beanie with a bright red scarf and gloves, emphasizing her readiness for cold weather. Her coat appears to be a checkered pattern with colors including white, black, and a hint of red.\n\nOn the right side of the image is a man who is also using binoculars. He has dark hair and a mustache. He is stylishly dressed in a dark, formal overcoat, white shirt, dark tie, and is also wearing a grey hat with ear flaps at the sides. Slung over his shoulder is a portable camera with a prominent lens, indicating interest in photographing the event or scenery as well.\n\nThe background is blurred but shows a winter setting with bare trees and possibly other attendees of the event, suggesting a public and open space, possibly a park or a public gathering area during a cold season.\n\nOverall, the photograph has a candid and vibrant feel, capturing a moment where attention is fixed on a distant point of interest, likely a part of an outdoor event or spectacle. The attire of the subjects reflects preparation for cold weather, and the use of optical devices indicates that whatever they are observing is not immediately close to them.","title":"Burrough audubon society members use binoculars to identify migratory shore birds during a scheduled outing at the squaw creek national wildlife refuge near Mound City, Missouri, in the northwest part of the state.
