{"path":"542595.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph depicts a large pile of cut logs stacked outdoors. The logs appear freshly cut with visible rings and varying shades of brown and gray on the cut surfaces. The stack extends upward filling the majority of the frame, giving a sense of the massive quantity of wood contained within it. The background reveals a clear blue sky, suggesting an open, unobstructed environment, likely a logging site or lumberyard. The sunlight illuminates the top logs, highlighting their textures and natural patterns, while the lower parts of the stack are in shadow, enhancing the three-dimensional effect of the composition. Despite the natural setting, the scene conveys a strong industrial or utilitarian vibe, emphasizing the scale and impact of logging activities.","title":"Ponderosa pine logs stacked at pine industry mill","placename":"Kings River (Calif.)","location":"Kings River, California","nn1":["542596","550877","552203","555144","548155","552197","550337","543489","553647","555507","552199","552163","545036","554434","545256","552178"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","stack","cut","quantity","ring","majority","logging","vibe","contain","brown"]}
