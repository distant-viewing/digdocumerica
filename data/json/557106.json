{"path":"557106.jpg","date":"September 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"This photograph features a tranquil and scenic landscape seen from an elevated viewpoint. It captures a wide river meandering gently through a lush environment. The river reflects the sky, creating a serene effect with its smooth and shiny surface. On the left, there are tall, thin posts visible in the water, perhaps remains of an old pier or fishing structure.\n\nThe shores are lined with dense greenery, including thickets and trees, which provide a rich texture to the scene. The riverbanks are filled with shrubs and foliage in various shades of green. In the foreground, some leafy branches slightly obscure the view, adding a sense of depth and natural framing to the composition.\n\nIn the distance, the river curves gracefully out of sight, and the background reveals a vast, flat landscape that suggests an expansive river valley. This area opens up to what appears to be agricultural fields or open grasslands, hinting at human activity but in a way that integrates subtly with the natural surroundings.\n\nThe overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and contemplative, emphasizing the beauty and quiet grandeur of a river landscape. The time of day appears to be either early morning or late afternoon, as suggested by the soft, diffused light, enhancing the calm and serene atmosphere.","title":"View of the Missouri River from a loess Bluff, a glacial-formed solid earth Bluff, which is characteristic of this area bordering the river.
