{"path":"545620.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a desert landscape primarily featuring a dirt track that is partially closed off by barriers, which are small branches laid out across the path. Prominently, a wooden road sign is positioned in the foreground with the text \"ROAD CLOSED SCENIC RESTORATION\" painted in white on a dark background. The signâ€™s shadow is cast on the ground, pointing towards the viewer, indicating it is either morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe surrounding terrain is sparse and covered with a scattering of desert vegetation, small bushes, and rocks. In the distance, the landscape is dominated by large flat-topped mesas and buttes characteristic of the American Southwest. The sky is clear and intensely blue, which contrasts sharply with the earthy tones of the desert. The rugged and arid environment suggests a remote or less-traveled area devoted to conservation or restoration efforts, as indicated by the sign. The overall composition of the photo, with the imposing natural features in the background and the man-made intervention foregrounded, juxtaposes natural beauty with conservation efforts.","title":"A major environmental problem in the canyonlands is the off-road use of vehicles.  Because of scarce rain and thin ground cover, this old road scar will take years to heal.  In the needles and near the maze area the park service is attempting to eliminate unnecessary roads and restore the natural landscape.  But the rules are difficult to enforce, especially in the remote maze section","placename":"Canyonlands National Park (Utah)","location":"Canyonlands National Park, Utah","nn1":["545624","545575","555582","554789","545604","555647","553057","545109","555628","545746","545591","544845","549016","545341","545336","544178"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["restoration","desert","conservation","effort","butte","mesa","scattering","sign","intervention","impose"]}
