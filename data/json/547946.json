{"path":"547946.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Tress, Arthur","caption":"This photograph depicts a suburban scene featuring a row of attached two-storey homes. The houses have light blue siding on the upper half and reddish-brick facades on the lower half, complemented by white door and window frames. Each unit has a small stoop and front yard, demarcated by short fences or hedges, and modest landscaping including manicured lawns and bushes.\n\nIn the foreground, there are several individuals engaged in casual activities, likely neighbors interacting or visiting each other. Two adults and a young child are standing on the stoop of one house, while another adult with two children are on the sidewalk, facing those on the stoop. The group on the sidewalk appears to be in conversation with the group on the stoop.\n\nThe environment is sunny, casting shadows to the east, suggesting it's either morning or late afternoon. A helicopter is visible in the sky, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise serene residential setting. Thereâ€™s a general atmosphere of a close-knit community, with personal interactions taking place amidst a typical suburban background.","title":"Recently built homes on border of Great Kills Park on Staten Island","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["547433","548441","550121","557405","556436","556601","558157","545397","552761","558131","547769","547938","557408","550160","557454","547211"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["stoop","half","sidewalk","adult","hedge","helicopter","child","house","landscaping","group"]}
