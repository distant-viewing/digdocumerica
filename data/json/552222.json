{"path":"552222.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque scene centered around a body of water, likely a large lake or bay. The composition balances elements of nature and human activity.\n\nIn the foreground, the dark blue water is animated with the activities of both motorized and sail boats. A motor boat is creating a splash and waves as it speeds by, closely followed by several sailboats with their sails fully deployed, gliding more gently through the water.\n\nThe middle ground features a thickly forested area on the far side of the lake with what appears to be residential housing interspersed among the trees, suggesting a suburban or rural setting.\n\nDramatically framing the background is a large, snow-capped mountain, dominating the landscape. Its slopes are smooth and gently rounded, and it rises majestically under a clear blue sky, imbuing the scene with a sense of tranquility and natural beauty.\n\nThe lighting in the photograph suggests it is a bright sunny day, indicated by the clear visibility and vibrant colors, ranging from the deep blues of the water to the lush greens of the foliage and the crisp whites of the mountainâ€™s snow.\n\nThe overall composition of the photograph, with its expansive view, the combination of natural and human elements, and the contrast between the dynamic activities in the water and the stillness of the mountain, creates a harmonious and inviting scene.","title":"Sailing on Lake Washington.
