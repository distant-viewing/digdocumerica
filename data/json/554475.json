{"path":"554475.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a lively scene by a river with various groups of people enjoying their time outdoors. In the foreground on the left, three men sit side by side on what looks to be a wooden board or low bench. The men are wearing casual clothing typical of a warm day, with one in a light shirt and the others in short-sleeve button-up shirts, all paired with pants.\n\nIn the middle ground, a group of people are positioned on and around large rocks beside the river. Two women and one man sit close together on a large rock, seemingly engaged in conversation while enjoying the shade. Their attire is casual, with the women in shorts and blouses and the man in a short-sleeve patterned shirt. Nearby, on another rock, a woman and a young boy sit separately from the group, the boy wearing a dark hat and the woman dressed in a tank top and shorts.\n\nOn the right side of the image, closer to the camera, more figures are partially seen engaging with each other and enjoying the environment. The river, scattered with small ripples and surrounded by lush greenery, compliments the serene atmosphere. The background reveals dense, vibrant foliage that lines the riverbank, enhancing the peaceful and secluded feeling of the setting.","title":"Group of Canadians at the edge of Cascade Pond, a public picnic area, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve.
