{"path":"548336.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Higgins, Chester","caption":"This photograph, taken from an aerial viewpoint, captures a scene dominated by two prominent smokestacks. The stacks are cylindrical in shape, with tan exteriors and dark caps, from which white smoke is billowing against the surrounding environment. Below and between the smokestacks, the textured roof of an industrial building is visible, possibly a plant or factory, marked by rectangular sections that suggest skylights or vent spaces.\n\nThe area surrounding the smokestacks and building consists of what appears to be a large paved lot or road, with several cars parked in an orderly fashion near the building. Additionally, the scene includes a fence that demarcates the boundary of the premises, hinting at restricted or controlled access to the area.\n\nThe overall image gives a sense of industrial activity, possibly involving energy production or heavy manufacturing, characterized by the use of the smokestacks for venting emissions. The setting seems urban or semi-urban, indicated by the proximity of roadways and structured parking. The atmosphere captured in the photograph hints at an overcast day, as suggested by the diffused lighting and the color tones, which are somewhat muted.","title":"Smoke stacks in Brooklyn","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["548376","548377","545925","546143","544495","550871","551034","550938","557214","552138","549967","550184","550716","544691","557293","543011"],"cl":[21],"cluster":["#21 &mdash; Smoke"],"terms":["smokestack","skylight","vent","production","emission","roadway","viewpoint","manufacturing","boundary","access"]}
