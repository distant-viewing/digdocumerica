{"path":"546099.jpg","date":"November 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"The photograph features a group of bison grazing in a natural grassland setting. There are four bison visible in the foreground, each covered in thick, dark brown fur, typical of the species. Their heads are down, suggesting that they are focused on feeding on the grass. The grass is dry and sparse, interspersed with small bushes, indicating a dry or arid environment. In the background, there are scattered trees and brush, which add some greenery to the otherwise brown-toned landscape. The sky is not visible in the image, contributing to the concentrated focus on the bison and the immediate landscape. The overall color palette is dominated by earthy tones, reflecting the natural habitat of these majestic creatures. The composition underscores the peaceful coexistence of the bison with their environment, highlighting their size and the texture of their fur against the rustic landscape.","title":"Buffalo herd on Bell Ranch","placename":"Leakey (Tex.)","location":"Leakey, Texas","nn1":["546095","546091","546123","552559","552558","546129","542626","542599","550379","550833","543022","557022","545901","546198","546102","550380"],"cl":[42],"cluster":["#42 &mdash; Deer"],"terms":["fur","creature","feed","grassland","brush","graze","grass","coexistence","specie","habitat"]}
