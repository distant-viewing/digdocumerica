{"path":"549233.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph captures a wide field covered with tall grass or cereal crop, possibly wheat. The foreground prominently features dense, green and golden stalks stretching upwards. These stalks are illuminated, with their tops highlighted by sunlight creating a slightly glowing effect. No clear paths or disruptions in the vegetation are visible, suggesting an untouched natural landscape.\n\nThe background reveals a gentle rolling hill landscape under a vast, light blue sky with subtle cloud cover. The horizon is relatively flat with a few subtle undulations, and no buildings or trees interrupt the wide open space. Notably, there is a small but noticeable dark blue lens flare at the bottom left of the image. The overall lighting suggests either early morning or late afternoon, creating a serene and tranquil mood. The image lacks any human presence or animals, focusing entirely on the natural environment. The frame's border has a rough edge, contributing to a vintage feel.","title":"Alfalfa field on the John Redding ranch in Sarpy Basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549251","549158","557191","549146","556990","545069","546154","549141","544046","545040","551370","544050","552903","557104","549156","549227"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["stalk","wheat","undulation","flare","lens","disruption","border","crop","vintage","cover"]}
