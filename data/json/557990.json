{"path":"557990.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"The photograph captures a serene, rural bike route set in a lush wooded area. The prominent feature of the composition is a well-worn dirt path that extends straight into the distance, flanked on both sides by dense green foliage, mainly trees and underbrush. The sky overhead is partly cloudy, suggesting a dynamic but pleasant weather condition, with patches of blue sky and white clouds.\n\nTo the left foreground, the path is obscured by a natural barrier, possibly a wooden fence or gate, signifying the entrance or continuation of the bike route. A prominent rectangular sign is mounted on what appears to be a wood or metal post. The sign, which is positioned at the forefront and to the right side of the image, is black with a white depiction of a bicycle and the words \"BIKE ROUTE\" in white, clearly marking this path as designated for bicycle traffic.\n\nThis setup provides a sense of solitude and focus on recreational or commuting activities by bike. The setting appears quite isolated, primed for a tranquil biking experience away from urban noise and interference. The overall mood conveyed is peaceful and inviting for nature lovers and bicycle enthusiasts.","title":"Bicycle and hiking trail are a part of the Akron, Ohio metropolitan park system at Hines Hill Road and Boston Heights.
