{"path":"550376.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photograph depicts a grand, gothic-style church set in a serene environment. The church is mainly constructed of what appears to be white-painted wood with grayish accents, and features tall, slender spires and pointed arches typical of gothic architecture. At the center of the façade is a large, ornate window and there are several smaller arched windows that are symmetrically placed around the building, adding to its historic charm. \n\nThe front of the church has three sets of steps leading up to three arched doorways, mirroring the symmetrical design of the structure. Each doorway is topped with a pointed arch, consistent with the gothic architectural theme.\n\nTrees with bare branches suggest that the photo might have been taken during late fall or early winter. The ground around the trees is covered with grass and appears well-maintained, though there are no leaves on the grass, indicating that the trees have recently shed them. A paved path leads up to the church, looking slightly wet, possibly from a recent rain, enhancing the peaceful yet slightly somber mood of the setting.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere of the photograph is quiet and evokes a sense of stillness, as if the church is a longstanding watchful guardian of the area, standing firm against the overcast sky captured in the background.","title":"Church in Milltown, New Brunswick, on the Canadian side of the St. Croix River","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["558024","557088","557083","554035","558019","558018","545366","558023","554207","556480","546455","554000","557952","553327","554792","552542"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["church","doorway","arch","spire","lead","grass","façade","accent","shed","rain"]}
