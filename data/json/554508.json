{"path":"554508.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a moment during a hiking trip, featuring three hikers on a mountain trail. All three hikers are equipped with large red backpacks and appear engaged in various activities, likely consulting or adjusting their gear. The hikers are dressed in outdoor attire suitable for hiking; two of them wear shorts and hiking boots, and all are wearing long socks.\n\nThe backdrop of the photo is a dramatic landscape showing multiple layers of mountain ridges extending into the distance, blanketed in a hazy, possibly misty atmosphere, which suggests high altitude or early morning weather conditions. The foreground where the hikers stand is a rugged rocky terrain, indicative of a mountain summit or high pass.\n\nVisually, the photo is rich in natural, muted colors with the red of the backpacks providing a striking contrast to the blues and greens of the mountainous landscape. The composition conveys a sense of adventure and exploration, with a focus on the experience of hiking in vast, open environments.","title":"Backpackers near the summit of Mount Marcy look southwest over the High Peaks region of the Adirondack Forest Preserve in New York State.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["554509","543381","543385","544305","554558","554503","543510","543382","554504","543371","545700","554505","554507","543383","543387","545776"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["hiker","hiking","backpack","mountain","summit","hike","sock","trip","pass","blanket"]}
