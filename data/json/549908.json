{"path":"549908.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts a group of men gathered outdoors, seemingly engaged in a serious discussion or listening to a speaker who is pointing with his right hand. The men appear as a diverse group, primarily in terms of age and attire, suggesting a professional or business context.\n\nKey features and elements include:\n- The central figure is a bespectacled man in a white shirt and dark tie, who looks assertive as he gestures with his hand.\n- Other individuals in the image include men in diverse outfits ranging from suits and ties to more casual attire such as short-sleeved shirts and light-colored pants.\n- The men are variously standing attentively, some with folded arms and others with hands in pockets or adjusting their glasses.\n- The background is slightly blurred but shows greenery and parts of urban building structures, suggesting that the setting might be a courtyard or a side street in a city.\n- The mood of the gathering appears serious, indicated by the facial expressions and body language focused toward the man who seems to be addressing or leading the group.","title":"Preacher draws lunchtime crowd in lower Manhattan's battery park","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551853","553182","551854","542562","558393","545672","557856","551852","555234","547443","557703","556272","552616","542607","547320","553172"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["man","tie","group","hand","courtyard","speaker","language","address","fold","pocket"]}
