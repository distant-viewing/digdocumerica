{"path":"549888.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph features a young woman standing alone on what appears to be an asphalt surface, possibly a street or a parking area. The angle of the shot, looking down at her, gives the suggestion that it may have been taken from an elevated position like a window or a balcony.\n\nThe woman is dressed in late 20th-century fashion. She wears a white turtleneck top and plaid trousers in a pattern with vibrant horizontal and vertical lines in various colors like red, blue, and yellow. She accessorizes with a narrow belt. On her feet are open-toed sandals. Her hair is styled up in a bouffant manner, and she carries a brown leather shoulder bag on her left shoulder.\n\nIn her left hand, she holds a clipboard or a similar flat item, indicating she might be engaged in tasks that require organization or note-taking, perhaps a business or academic activity. The environment around her is sparse, focusing the viewer's attention primarily on her and her attire.\n\nThe characteristics of the image, including its color saturation and grain, suggest it might have been taken with film, implying a vintage quality to the photograph. The scene is simple, capturing a moment in the day of a young woman dressed in a style reflective of past decades.","title":"Commuter at entrance to the Staten Island Ferry terminal in the Battery","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["551821","557039","556765","553191","546479","554270","553157","546623","549645","550079","551824","557901","553321","556470","551448","557904"],"cl":[35],"cluster":["#35 &mdash; Woman 2"],"terms":["shoulder","suggestion","woman","turtleneck","clipboard","sandal","accessorize","leather","organization","asphalt"]}
