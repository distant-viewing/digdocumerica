{"path":"543907.jpg","date":"March 1972","photographer":"Strode, William","caption":"The photograph depicts a semi-urban scene with a foreground prominently featuring a stack of newspapers. The newspapers displayed bear the title \"The Courier-Journal & TIMES.\" The visible headlines discuss topics about darkness falling on work to stabilize a bridge on Ohio and an article titled \"Day's Retreat\" describing a contrast between youngsters having an exciting day versus adults finding it less fun.\n\nIn the background, the setting includes a street with a vintage red vehicle, possibly a coupe, that has stopped and a figure appears to be either exiting or interacting with the car. Behind the stopped car, there is a yellow school bus and suburban-style trees lining the street, contributing to a calm, residential atmosphere. In the distance, a structure that resembles a commercial sign can also be seen, adding an element of everyday commercial activity to the setting.\n\nThe overall composition juxtaposes the mundane activity of daily news with an ordinary American street scene, captured from a low angle that gives prominence to the stack of newspapers in the foreground.","title":"Louisville newspapers tell the story of the potential disaster.
