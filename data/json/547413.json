{"path":"547413.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"In this photograph, two individuals, likely a man and a woman, are pictured together at the doorway of a house. The woman is inside the doorway, wearing glasses and a striped red and white long-sleeve shirt. She is holding a small, black-and-tan dog, which appears content in her arms. The man is standing outside, dressed in work attire covered with dirt; he wears a grey hoodie, blue jeans, and brown rubber boots. His attire and the dirt suggest he may be engaged in some type of outdoor or manual labor.\n\nThe man is wearing a cap with a lamp attached, indicating that he might work in conditions where additional lighting is necessary, such as mining or early morning/nighttime outdoor work. He is looking slightly downwards with a neutral expression. The woman is pointing outward, suggesting she is either showing something to the man or directing attention to something outside of the frame.\n\nThe background is simple with the white external wall of the house visible. The doorstep where the man stands has visible signs of dirt, implying frequent outdoor activity. The lighting and the quality of the image give it a slightly dated or archival look, evoking a sense of everyday life in a rural or working-class setting.","title":"John Dolezal and wife at their farm near Bee, Nebraska.
