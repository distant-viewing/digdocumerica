{"path":"554118.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a serene tropical beach setting. The scene is dominated by a large number of tall, thin coconut palm trees that fill the background, their leaves creating a lush canopy. These palms stand against a partially cloudy sky. In the foreground is a black sand beach that gently meets the frothy white waves of the ocean. The beach is fringed on one side by dark, volcanic rocks that contrast sharply with the light foam of the sea.\n\nThere are three individuals in the image, suggesting a leisurely beach activity. One is standing in shallow waters close to the edge where the waves break, while the other two are nearer to the treeline, appearing to be walking or standing on the sand. The natural, unspoiled landscape suggests a quiet, possibly remote location, ideal for relaxation and enjoying the natural beauty. The photograph has a peaceful, untouched quality, evoking a sense of tranquility and escape from busier settings.","title":"Famous black sand beach at Kaimu, created by lava runoff, is a favorite tourist stop. Area around beach is due to be developed. In order to preserve beach, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to add a new foundation of sand under the existing layer. Critics argue this would change color of beach, causing it to lose its appeal.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["554120","543296","543303","543089","548706","547596","545280","547697","547612","554122","553766","543287","553982","548757","554121","543254"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","palm","sand","wave","treeline","foam","relaxation","canopy","number","ocean"]}
