{"path":"551104.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a serene moment in a lush, green garden setting. The image is filled with vegetation, featuring various types of trees and shrubs that add a dense texture to the backdrop. Towards the foreground, there are multiple pathways winding through the grass, suggesting a well-used and cherished garden space.\n\nIn the center of the photograph, there is a woman standing near a small, brick structure, possibly a shed or an outdoor utility area. She is wearing a white, long-sleeve dress or tunic paired with light-colored pants, and is barefoot, adding a casual and homely feel to the scene. Her posture, focused on the shed, suggests she might be involved in a task or simply examining the area.\n\nThe shed itself appears to be practical, made of bricks with a wooden and possibly corrugated iron roof, indicating functional rather than aesthetic use. A fabric, like a curtain or cover, hangs loosely over what might be a doorway or an open wall, partially obscuring the interior or the contents of the structure.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes a peaceful domestic environment, possibly in a rural or suburban area, where nature and human habitation merge harmoniously. The photograph evokes a sense of quiet activity and attention to the immediate surroundings, inviting viewers to appreciate the simple and natural aspects of everyday life.","title":"Outhouse near the railroad at Riverside","placename":"Charleston (W.
