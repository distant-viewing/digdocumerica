{"path":"553200.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This photograph captures a woman with striking face paint, reminiscent of a mime or clown, standing in an outdoor setting. The makeup includes white face paint with dramatic black accents around the eyes and eyebrows, and a red circular mark on each cheek. She also wears red lipstick. Her hair is long, flows freely, and appears slightly windswept. She is dressed in a sleeveless, collared, checkered shirt that is knotted at the waist.\n\nThe background features a prominent fountain, which is actively spraying water, creating a dynamic and refreshing backdrop. There is lush greenery around and it appears to be a sunny day, as indicated by the brightness and shadows present in the scene. Visible in the farther background are a few indistinct figures, one of whom seems to be riding a bicycle, suggesting this scene might be set in a park or a similarly recreational public space. The overall atmosphere is lively and the setting implies a place designed for leisure and enjoyment.","title":"Girl made up for a sorority initiation crosses Fountain Square.","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553240","552700","550748","551484","551302","549983","551468","549578","553309","544747","558184","551451","552720","546223","557114","551384"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["paint","cheek","face","waist","mark","fountain","accent","bicycle","brightness","enjoyment"]}
