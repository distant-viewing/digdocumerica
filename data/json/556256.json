{"path":"556256.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"White, John H.","caption":"The photograph depicts a large gathering of people outdoors, likely at a public protest or rally. The crowd is diverse in terms of age and race, with many participants holding up signs with various messages advocating for socio-economic reforms. The signs feature slogans such as \"PUSH for Jobs Economic Justice,\" \"Guaranteed Income,\" \"Lower Prices,\" and \"Jobs Not Welfare\". \n\nThe setting appears to be an open field or park during daylight with overcast weather, as suggested by the soft lighting and lack of harsh shadows. Participants are sitting and standing, and the mood seems to be energetic but peaceful. In the background, there are hints of trees and possibly some structures, but the focus is primarily on the people and their placards. \n\nThe overall composition of the image captures the essence of a moment in a movement, highlighting community activism and public demonstration for economic rights and justice.","title":"A senior citizens' march to protest inflation, unemployment and high taxes stopped along Lake Shore Drive in Chicago to hear speeches from various officials.
