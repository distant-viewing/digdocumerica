{"path":"552619.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image captures a scene inside a warmly lit room, focusing on a middle-aged man sitting at a dining table, occupied with paperwork. The man, who appears concentrated and somewhat strained, is wearing glasses and a short-sleeved shirt. He has his left hand on his temple, suggesting deep thought or concern.\n\nThe dining table is cluttered with various items, including sheets of paper which appear to be bills or letters, a newspaper, a pair of glasses beside a case, a cup possibly containing coffee or tea, and some smaller miscellaneous items. There's a green chair visible on the opposite side of the table suggesting someone else might join or has joined the man at the table.\n\nA window adorned with sheer, floral-patterned curtains fills part of the left side of the image, letting in natural light that highlights the everyday domestic setting. On the window sill sits a small, quaint radio and behind it slightly, an old-fashioned alarm clock, indicating the scene possibly dates back a few decades. Various items and a small floral arrangement decorate the background further enhancing the vintage feel of the setup.\n\nThe right-hand side background shows part of another room defined by a wooden doorway, where a wooden buffet or side table holds a small lamp and decorative items including what looks like a covered dish and possibly more floral arrangements.\n\nA painting of a serene landscape hangs on the wall, and this artwork along with the overall arrangement and style of the roomâ€™s decor contributes to a 1970s or early 1980s aesthetic of a typical middle-class home. The scene conveys a moment of solitude, responsibility, and perhaps the pressure of personal finance management or similar obligations.","title":"Mayor john scalzo works on the Rifle city budget at home city hall has no office for him.
