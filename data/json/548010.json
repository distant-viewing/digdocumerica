{"path":"548010.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph offers a panoramic view of a scenic landscape characterized by a vast river running through a valley. The river, appearing reflective and dark blue, meanders from the foreground into the distance, flanked by high, lush green cliffs on the right and rolling hills on the left. The hills are dotted with patches of trees and open fields, suggesting a mixture of woodland and agricultural use.\n\nOn the right, a steep cliff dramatically rises, covered predominantly by dense forest. Atop this cliff, a notable large structure which looks like a grand building, possibly a hotel or historical monument, is perched, overlooking the river.\n\nIn the foreground, there's a well-defined road or highway that runs parallel to the river, with a few vehicles suggesting some human activity. This road cuts between the river and a railway track, seen just beside it with several sections visible. The calmness of the river is marked by a few small boats or objects floating in it.\n\nThe background has a range of mountains under a partially cloudy sky, the clouds casting soft shadows on the landscape. The lighting conditions indicate it might be late afternoon or early evening, as suggested by the soft, diffuse light and the length of the shadows.\n\nOverall, the composition captures the tranquil beauty of a vast, open landscape that is both utilised and preserved, offering a glimpse into a serene, natural setting contrasted with human infrastructures.","title":"The Columbia River gorge","placename":"Portland (Or.)","location":"Portland, Oregon","nn1":["548050","550562","555575","550542","548097","546424","550700","557106","550581","550680","542653","550524","550586","548916","549456","550487"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["river","cliff","monument","run","hotel","offer","preserve","woodland","perch","calmness"]}
