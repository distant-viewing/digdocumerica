{"path":"543636.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Gillette, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial or semi-rural setting, with a focus on a narrow, polluted water channel in the foreground, lined with large, irregular chunks of dirt or mud. This channel appears to be cutting through a dried and cracked earth surface, with scattered dead grass and small fragments of wood and debris. The water in the channel is murky and stagnant, suggesting pollution or lack of maintenance.\n\nIn the middle ground, a tall white water tower stands prominently, bearing no visible markings. The towerâ€™s supports are skeletal and metallic, typical of industrial structures. Beside the water tower, there are low buildings which appear to be part of an industrial complex, possibly related to mining or manufacturing, given the rugged terrain and the style of the constructions.\n\nIn the background, there is a gentle hill or a slope with sparse vegetation. There appears to be a clear boundary between the industrial operations and the natural landscape, marked by the stark difference in land use. Overcast skies suggest a gloomy or cold day, adding a desolate feel to the scene. The presence of heavy machinery or industrial vehicles is implied by elements like tracks on the ground.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph highlights environmental degradation adjacent to industrial activity, with a pronounced contrast between the disturbed land and the more natural features in the distance.","title":"Waste water from uranium milling process is piped into settling pond at union carbide plant","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["551562","544294","546080","551559","550684","543815","552019","546084","544775","546206","550193","543709","544803","547485","550708","543661"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["channel","tower","constructions","difference","pronounce","chunk","gloomy","land","fragment","mud"]}
