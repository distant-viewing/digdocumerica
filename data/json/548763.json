The house is surrounded by a fenced deck area, with various items like crates and potted plants visible, lending a lived-in and casual atmosphere. Behind this house, lush green palm trees sway, hinting at a tropical location.\n\nThe backdrop of the photograph shows a clear blue sky and calm sea, further emphasizing the serene setting.
