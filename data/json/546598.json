{"path":"546598.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph captures a group of four people in an outdoor, commercial setting. They appear to be involved in a casual conversation. Two of the individuals are standing on a pedestrian crossing painted on the parking lot, while the other two people, slightly behind the first, are standing on the sidewalk. The parking lot is mostly empty, indicating that the photo might have been taken during a less busy time or possibly outside of business hours. In the background, there is a large building, prominently displaying \"LERNER SHOPS\" in red letters, suggesting that it is a retail store.\n\nThe environment has a cool or perhaps early spring or late autumn feel, deduced from the bareness of the trees and the presence of some yellowed bushes. The ambience is somewhat subdued with a greyish sky. This setting may likely be in a suburban shopping center given the vast parking area and the type of building in the background. There are no other vehicles or people visible in the immediate vicinity, which adds to the tranquility of the scene. The clothing of the individuals varies slightly but suggests lighter outerwear, suitable for cool weather. One person is carrying bags, possibly from shopping.","title":"Disciplined riders queue up for early morning express bus from montgomery mall (md shopping center) to Washington, dc","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546594","546602","546590","546541","554691","550967","556801","553182","551815","544325","557207","548625","558033","553167","556731","554666"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["parking","shop","lot","crossing","people","shopping","ambience","vicinity","hour","letter"]}
