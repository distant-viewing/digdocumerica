{"path":"550612.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph features a majestic aerial view of a large, elongated lake nestled within a vast forested landscape. The lake curves gently through the scenery, winding between densely wooded hills with varying shades of green. The perspective suggests the photograph was taken from a higher altitude, giving a broad and sweeping overview of the region.\n\nThe lake appears calm with a smooth, reflective surface that mirrors the overcast sky above. The sky is filled with large, fluffy clouds, predominantly white with some gray undertones, suggesting a mix of weather conditions. The lake itself is a deep blue, interspersed with areas of lighter blue, reflecting the sky and cloud coverage overhead.\n\nThe shoreline of the lake is irregular, with numerous coves and promontories enhancing the natural beauty of the landscape. On the left side of the photograph, the shoreline is closer and more detailed, allowing the viewer to observe the texture of the trees and the ruggedness of the terrain. Towards the right, the lake extends into the distance, leading the eye towards a horizon lined with forested hills and more distant water bodies under the expansive sky.\n\nThe distinct lack of human presence or man-made structures in visible areas emphasizes the untouched and serene nature of the landscape. This setting depicts a tranquil wilderness, ideal for contemplation and appreciation of natural beauty.","title":"View south toward paxson lake","placename":"Alaska","location":"Alaska","nn1":["554652","550579","555695","552141","556926","554526","550493","556930","543816","556928","543643","554527","554399","556931","555702","543546"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["lake","shoreline","cove","undertone","appreciation","overview","coverage","blue","ruggedness","ideal"]}
