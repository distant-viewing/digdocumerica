{"path":"554092.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at an airport with multiple aircraft visible in the composition. The foreground prominently features the front views of two parked planes. Their engines, landing gear, and curved noses are clearly visible. Each plane is painted in a white, red, and black color scheme.\n\nIn the background, an incoming plane is approaching for landing, seen in mid-air and slightly defocused compared to the sharp images of the planes in the foreground. To the far right, a group of four individuals, small in size due to their distance from the camera, are walking across the tarmac. They appear engaged in conversation or observation of the activities around them.\n\nThe sky is partly cloudy, suggesting a bright but partly overcast day. The overall ambience of the scene conveys a busy day at an operational airport, with maintenance, arrivals, and pedestrian movement simultaneously taking place.","title":"Airliners at Maui Island.
