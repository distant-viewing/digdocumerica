{"path":"543452.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This image captures a tranquil, natural landscape dominated by a diverse assortment of trees and vegetation. The setting is distinctly verdant, featuring a thick forest composed of tall, slender trees in the background, with their trunks appearing somewhat shadowy, likely due to the lighting conditions or the time of day. Enhanced by a slightly misty or foggy atmosphere, this creates a serene and somewhat haunting ambience.\n\nIn the foreground, amidst a clearing with smaller shrubs and scattered yellow wildflowers, a person clad in a red jacket is seen kneeling down, apparently engaged in examining or interacting with the environment. This focal point of color contrasts vividly against the predominantly green and earthy tones of the rest of the landscape.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the human figure against the vastness of nature invokes a sense of solitude or contemplation. The background also reveals the subtle gradient of the land, hinting at a gentle slope that ascends towards the densely wooded heights, which are softly blanketed by the hazy, possibly early morning or late afternoon, light. This photograph not only showcases the beauty of the natural environment but also subtly emphasizes human interaction with nature, invoking themes of exploration or conservation.","title":"California -- Point Lobos State Park, near Carmel","placename":"Point Lobos State Reserve (Calif.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["550536","554424","554715","554099","557146","550602","557159","555217","557127","554982","554718","557099","554459","555133","556473","555116"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["invoke","haunt","ascend","kneel","ambience","assortment","conservation","wildflower","blanket","clearing"]}
