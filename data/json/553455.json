{"path":"553455.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Massar, Ivan","caption":"This aerial photograph captures a bend of a wide river winding through a densely populated area. The river is situated centrally in the image, reflecting the sky and surrounded by greenery on its banks. On the left side of the river, there is a bridge that crosses over to connect the two banks. This side features a combination of residential and lighter commercial areas with visible individual houses and smaller buildings nestled among patches of trees. This gives the area a somewhat suburban feel.\n\nOn the right side of the river, the land use appears more intensely commercial and developed. There are larger buildings, possibly warehouses or industrial facilities, arranged more closely together. A noticeable railway track parallels the riverbank, curving along the contour of the landscape. The community on this side of the river is compact, with roads weaving tightly between the buildings and a more urban layout is evident.","title":"The Nashua river flows into the merrimack river","placename":"Nashua (N.H.)","location":"Nashua, New Hamshire","nn1":["550548","550861","551188","551178","556949","550732","546694","557421","557420","548019","551181","546706","550549","551182","550551","546582"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["river","banks","populated","weave","side","warehouse","combination","railway","contour","win"]}
