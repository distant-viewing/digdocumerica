{"path":"549228.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"The photograph showcases a natural landscape featuring large, uniquely shaped rock formations. These formations, appearing robust and predominantly brown with subtle shades varying from gray to tan, dominate the upper two-thirds of the image. The rocks possess a smooth yet pitted surface, creating an intricate texture that reflects years of erosion and weathering. Notably, the rock on the left displays eye-like holes near its top, adding a distinctive character.\n\nIn the foreground, lush, vivid yellow flowers bloom profusely, injecting a splash of color and life into the scene. These flowers are set against a backdrop of various green plants, suggesting a fertile environment typically found in certain temperate or mountainous regions. The flora covering the ground appears healthy, indicating an ecosystem that supports diverse plant life.\n\nThe sky, visible at the top edges of the photograph, looks overcast with hints of a cooler, possibly windy day, which could explain the absence of harsh shadows and the soft, diffused lighting that envelops the scene. This lighting enhances the serene and natural beauty of the environment, emphasizing the textures and colors of both the rocky formations and the vibrant plant life.","title":"Flowers and rock formations at the Roy Fly Ranch in Sarpy Basin","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["545797","545703","552445","544435","545724","544887","552442","545562","545804","545791","545723","544429","552444","549197","558083","544363"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["formation","rock","plant","flower","life","hole","third","weathering","year","flora"]}
