{"path":"557379.jpg","date":"May 1975","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts a vibrant rural scene nestled in a valley surrounded by lush green mountains. In the foreground, a quaint residential area is visible, comprising several small homes with pitched roofs, tidy yards, and a smattering of outbuildings including sheds and garages. The houses are modest, primarily single-story, and arranged in a somewhat orderly pattern, highlighting the sense of a closely-knit community.\n\nThe area is thick with trees, adding a rich green canopy over the neighborhood. The scene captures a moment of serene, day-to-day life with no visible people, suggesting a quiet afternoon. A network of small roads or paths interconnects these homes, and a few vehicles can be seen, one of which looks like a red truck. \n\nIn the middle distance, a railway line runs parallel to a road, emphasizing the transport links within this rural setting. Beyond this residential and local transport hub, the picture offers a view of an industrial facility located between the mountains. Prominent features of this facility include multiple large structures, possibly silos or processing plants, and tall stacks emitting plumes of smoke or steam into the clear blue sky. These components suggest that the facility is possibly a manufacturing or processing plant integral to the local economy, yet distinct and separate from the residential area.\n\nThe overall composition strikingly contrasts the industrial background with the peaceful, tree-filled residential area, encapsulated by the natural beauty of the encircling mountainous terrain. This snapshot captures both the industrial and rural aspects of life in this region, framed against a large, clear sky that conveys a sense of openness and tranquility.","title":"Union Carbide ferro-Alloy plant seen from deep water. Total plant emissions decreased from 113,252 tons to 2,649 tons from 1967 to 1975, a drop of 97.7 percent. The decrease occurred after agreement on a compliance schedule between Union Carbide and the West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stack sampled plant emissions while developing national new source performance standards. (See images 8566 and 8567)","placename":"Charleston (W.
