{"path":"552150.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph depicts three individuals positioned in front of a large, maroon-colored, weathered ship hull that forms a striking backdrop. They are standing and sitting on a wooden log floating in water, near the shore.\n\nTo the left, a person is joyfully raising both arms high, celebrating or signaling. This individual has short hair, wears yellow shorts, and is barefoot. They appear to be full of energy and excitement.\n\nIn the middle, another person is also expressing jubilation by raising their arms. This person is shirtless, showcasing a moderately muscular build, and wearing grey shorts. They have facial hair and long hair pulled back, possibly into a ponytail.\n\nOn the right side of the photograph, the third individual - sitting on the log - exudes a more relaxed demeanor. They have short hair, wearing a long-sleeve light brown shirt, dark pants, and are holding what appears to be a pair of shoes or sandals.\n\nThe scene evokes a sense of freedom and enjoyment, with the vast hull and calm waters complementing the casual, carefree attitudes of the people. The reflection of the people and the log in the water adds an element of balance and tranquility to the composition.","title":"They found oil at the Everett harbor.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["544204","549373","553405","547879","543944","549386","551546","554199","549410","544980","553403","549355","546302","548511","547564","543943"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Outdoor Recreation"],"terms":["log","hair","hull","ponytail","short","person","arm","maroon","sandal","build"]}
