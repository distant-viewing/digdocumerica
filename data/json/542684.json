{"path":"542684.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a busy traffic scene on a multi-lane road, likely during peak hours, resulting in a dense traffic jam. The focus is on a multitude of cars from various eras, most of which appear to be from the 1960s and 1970s, judging by their designs. These vehicles vary in models and sizes, ranging from sedans to station wagons and a few trucks, displayed in a variety of colors.\n\nThe scene occurs in an urban environment, evident from the commercial signs visible in the background. One clear sign mentions \"Cindy's Leis,\" suggesting a location that might deal in floral or Hawaiian-themed products, and another sign for \"Philips.\" These signs hint at a commercial district lined with various shops and businesses.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the image is slightly chaotic, with no movement visible and every car closely packed against the others, highlighting the congestion typical of city traffic during rush hours. The quality of the photo suggests it was taken with film and has a somewhat grainy texture that adds a vintage feel to the scene. The weather appears to be overcast, contributing to the slightly gloomy ambiance of the image.","title":"Hollywood freeway","placename":"Los Angeles (Calif.)","location":"Los Angeles, California","nn1":["549903","556727","545884","556729","546370","547348","549919","553019","553018","548084","557229","556732","556734","553719","547369","550089"],"cl":[26],"cluster":["#26 &mdash; Highway"],"terms":["traffic","hour","sign","jam","deal","congestion","multitude","rush","mention","result"]}
