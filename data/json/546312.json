{"path":"546312.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"The photograph captures a close-up view of two individuals engaging in an outdoor activity, possibly related to ecological study or nature exploration. In the foreground, a man is shown from the side, facing to the left of the frame. He is shirtless, and the focus is on his hands as he holds some natural materials, possibly reeds or grass, which are being inspected or handled for study.\n\nFacing him and slightly out of focus, a young woman with long light-brown hair is leaning in with curiosity, looking intently at the materials he holds. She appears interested and engaged in whatever they are examining, with a look of concentration and perhaps discussion on her face. She wears a light brown jacket, suitable for outdoor activity.\n\nThe setting is a natural environment, possibly a wetland or marsh, suggested by the dense green reeds surrounding them. This gives the image a lush, green backdrop, enhancing the feel of being deeply immersed in nature. The photograph likely depicts a moment of discovery or learning about the natural environment, showcasing a shared interest in ecological or biological observations.","title":"Epa gulf breeze laboratory personnel on a field trip to a salt marsh.
