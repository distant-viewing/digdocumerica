{"path":"548150.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a sizable hydroelectric dam viewed from an elevated perspective, showcasing its industrial and functional architecture. The main structure of the dam features a series of large, triangular concrete sections that create a repetitive geometric pattern across the width of the river. These sections are supported by a network of trusses and metal beams, giving the structure a sturdy, engineered appearance.\n\nIn the foreground, a fish ladder is visible. This consists of a series of descending pools separated by weirs, through which water flows vigorously from one level to the next. The design of the fish ladder allows aquatic life to bypass the dam and continue upstream, providing an essential environmental mitigation for the barrier created by the dam.\n\nThe body of water held by the dam appears calm and expansive, contrasting with the turbulent flows in the fish ladder. Surrounding the dam are hills that appear barren or sparsely vegetated, suggesting a rugged, possibly arid landscape. The sky is clear and blue, indicating fair weather conditions at the time the photograph was taken. \n\nOverall, the composition is dominated by the imposing structural elements of the dam, underscored by the functional aspect of the fish ladder and framed by the natural environment. The photograph captures both the scale and the environmental considerations inherent in such a large-scale engineering project.","title":"The john day dam viewed from the Washington side of the Columbia River, looking towards the Oregon shore","placename":"The Dalles (Or.)","location":"The Dalles, Oregon","nn1":["548016","544166","548007","548003","553828","548013","549004","550654","548927","549486","548938","544141","553137","550701","544151","548936"],"cl":[47],"cluster":["#47 &mdash; Dam"],"terms":["dam","ladder","turbulent","engineere","series","consideration","flow","section","truss","scale"]}
