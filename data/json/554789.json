{"path":"554789.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of a highway with elements indicating road closure and construction or disturbance. In the foreground, a curvy part of the asphalt road is partially visible, bordered by a silver metal guardrail. A \"ROAD CLOSED Â½ MILE AHEAD\" sign is prominently displayed beside the guardrail, indicating the upcoming closure.\n\nThe middle ground reveals a varying landscape with undulating terrain, covered with patches of greenery and areas of bare soil or dirt. This typical setup might suggest roadworks or a larger development project in progress.\n\nIn the background, there are larger piles of earth or possibly mining debris, hinting at significant excavation or construction activity. The sky appears clear, which contrasts with the earthy and industrial nature of the terrain.\n\nThis composition of the photograph communicates themes of alteration and intervention in the natural landscape, likely for road expansion or industrial purposes. The road closure sign suggests a temporary disruption, possibly due to ongoing construction or environmental management activities.","title":"This road, route 100 in southeastern Ohio, was paid for by taxpayers and taken over by the hanna coal company.
