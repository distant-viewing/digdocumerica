{"path":"557835.jpg","date":"August 1975","photographer":"Eiler, Lyntha Scott","caption":"This photograph showcases two men having a conversation in an automotive workshop environment. The man on the right is likely explaining or demonstrating something as he points to a piece of equipment labeled \"Sun Infra-Red\" which is described as a \"Diagnostic Performance Analyzer\". The equipment is red and black with multiple gauges and a visible paper printout hanging from it. \n\nBoth men are dressed in work attire; the man on the left wears a light grey shirt with dark pants, and the man on the right sports a blue work shirt with a name tag and dark glasses. The setting includes visible elements typical of an automotive shop like hoses and tools hanging on a dark-colored wall, and a touch of natural light entering partly from the side, suggesting an open garage door.\n\nThe focus on interaction and the workshop equipment reflects a scene of professional consultation or instruction, emphasizing a work-related engagement centered around vehicle maintenance or diagnostics.","title":"A car owner reviews the results of his car's inspection with an employee of the Hamilton County Auto Emission Inspection Station at Newtown, Ohio. The exhaust analyzer gives readings for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. If a vehicle fails the test, the owner is given a 30-day temporary sticker to allow time for repairs and retesting. All light duty, spark ignition powered motor vehicles in the county must be certified annually.","placename":"Newtown (Ohio)","location":"Newtown, Ohio","nn1":["557857","557912","557859","557911","557864","546628","542763","557858","557852","557902","554870","557889","557833","557861","557372","557855"],"cl":[23],"cluster":["#23 &mdash; Manufacturing Processes"],"terms":["workshop","equipment","work","man","instruction","gauge","tag","hose","garage","shop"]}
