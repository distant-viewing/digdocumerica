{"path":"552923.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Dovydenas, Jonas","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a sprawling desert landscape during what appears to be either sunrise or sunset, given the warm lighting. The terrain is predominantly rugged and barren, characterized by various shades of browns and muted reds. The landscape is densely textured with undulating hills and shallow valleys.\n\nThe foreground is dominated by a relatively flat, textured surface that transitions into more pronounced ridges and gullies as the eye moves towards the middle ground. These geological features create an interplay of light and shadow, enhancing the sense of depth and the harsh contours of the terrain.\n\nIn the background, the hills become more substantial and elevated, forming a continuous chain that recedes into the horizon. The sunlight casts long shadows from the ridges, further accentuating the topographical variations. There are no visible signs of vegetation or water bodies, emphasizing the aridity of the area. The sky is not visible in the frame, focusing all attention on the expansive, textured landscape below.","title":"Aerial view of one of the formations of the Virginia Range, on the western shore of Pyramid Lake, showing characteristic color of the desert in springtime.","placename":"Pyramid Lake (Nev.)","location":"Pyramid Lake, Nevada","nn1":["544027","547717","545895","542518","545843","544016","545748","542511","545789","549016","545806","545771","544401","550397","555885","545809"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["ridge","gully","hill","sunrise","chain","variation","terrain","contour","transition","desert"]}
