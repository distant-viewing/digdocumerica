{"path":"551983.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Vern, Ike","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of an industrial construction site, likely associated with energy or water infrastructure. The most prominent feature is a large, circular structure in the foreground, which appears to be either a cooling tower or a similar construction that is in the midst of being built or maintained. This circular structure is massive, with visible framework patterns and an open top. Around this structure, there is construction equipment and materials scattered, suggesting ongoing work. A crane is positioned near it, indicating ongoing construction or repairs.\n\nTo the right and left of this circular structure, there are various other facility buildings. These seem to serve as control buildings or possibly housing equipment linked to the function of the central structure. Vehicles are parked outside these buildings, and fenced enclosures suggest a secured area. There are paved roads connecting these buildings and the main circular structure.\n\nThe background extends to an expansive flat terrain with sparse vegetation. There are several straight paths, possibly for transportation or utility lines. Some small water bodies can also be seen, which may be related to the facility's operational needs.\n\nOverall, the photograph gives the impression of a large-scale, heavily engineered industrial facility in the stages of construction or maintenance, located in a remote, expansive setting designed to support its infrastructure requirements.","title":"The Texas Eastern gas tank that killed 41 workmen when it imploded in January 1973, is now being rebuilt over the protests of New Jersey and Staten Island residents.
