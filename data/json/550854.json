{"path":"550854.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Rozumalski, Ted","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial river scene, likely taken from an elevated perspective or a bridge. Prominent in the foreground is a river over which water is flowing, creating white ripples and foam indicative of a strong current or a drop in river level. Alongside the river, a large tan-and-brown multi-story industrial building, possibly a power plant or factory, is situated. This building is equipped with several rectangular and arched windows and large exhaust stacks or vents.\n\nAdjacent to this large building, along the banks of the river, are additional smaller structures and what is possibly a loading/unloading area with a red brick building and metal structures that might be related to the plantâ€™s operations. A gated boat slip or dock area is prominently positioned in the foreground of the image, featuring an extended walkway leading to a small building or guard shack with an American flag hoisted next to it.\n\nThe broader environment includes lush greenery, with trees lining the opposite bank of the river, contributing to a picturesque contrast between the natural landscape and the industrial setup. This setting suggests a balance or coexistence between industrial activities and the natural river environment. The overall atmosphere of the photograph captures a serene yet industrially active riverside scene.","title":"Consolidated Paper Company at Appleton, near the northern tip of Lake Winnebago in the Fox River Valley.","placename":"Wisconsin","location":"OTHER","nn1":["552070","550673","557223","550856","551515","550961","551993","553393","550900","557295","557376","551202","550855","546395","548061","551201"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["river","bank","slip","guard","shack","building","exhaust","drop","unloading","hoist"]}
