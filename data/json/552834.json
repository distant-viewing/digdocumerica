{"path":"552834.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"The photograph captures a flooded field or wetland area under overcast skies. The scene shows a vast expanse of waterlogged terrain with patches of standing water reflecting the grey sky. Across the submerged land, remnants of crops or wild grasses stick out of the water in sparse, linear patterns, indicating that the area may be normally used for agriculture or is a naturally marshy field.\n\nThe foreground features dense water vegetation with lush green aquatic plants that line the waterâ€™s edge, creating a natural boundary between the water and the land. This undergrowth appears vigorous, suggesting the area supports a wetland ecosystem.\n\nIn the background, there is a dense line of trees that marks the horizon. These trees look like a mix of deciduous species, typical of a temperate climate zone. The overall atmosphere of the image is damp and somber with no visible wildlife or human activity, which imparts a quiet and serene mood to the image. The cloudy sky suggests recent rainfall or ongoing wet weather conditions. \n\nThe composition of the image, with its reflection, water, and variety of natural textures, combined with its wide, open view, conveys a sense of both tranquility and the overwhelming impact of water in this landscape.","title":"In the spring of 1973 the Mississippi river reached its highest level in more than 150 years.
