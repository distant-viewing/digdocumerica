{"path":"549932.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph captures a busy urban street scene, likely from a few decades ago as suggested by the style of the vehicles and overall grainy quality of the image. The street is lined with aged, multi-story buildings that have commercial establishments on the ground floors. Various signs, including one that says \"ALARMS,\" are visible, indicating the presence of different businesses.\n\nThe road itself is filled with a variety of vehicles, dominated by classic cars and large cargo trucks that hint at the commercial nature of the area. In the foreground, a brown car faces towards the camera, showing visible signs of wear and tear. In the middle of the street, there is a police officer, dressed in a blue uniform and cap, standing and directing traffic or possibly investigating a situation.\n\nThe setting appears to be in a part of a city with active commercial and potentially industrial activities, as indicated by the types of vehicles and storefronts. The atmosphere suggests a typical busy day in an urban environment where traffic control is needed, possibly due to the narrowness of the street combined with heavy vehicle use.","title":"Holland Tunnel traffic is lined up on Canal Street.","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554293","554309","546743","546635","547369","551135","555461","556724","545216","548369","547651","546626","549853","557705","556718","554299"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["street","vehicle","tear","traffic","officer","police","situation","storefront","establishment","cargo"]}
