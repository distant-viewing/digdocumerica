{"path":"542731.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a joyful scene in an outdoor, natural setting, likely on a fishing trip or a similar leisure activity. The image features two individuals and a dog. The main focus is on a younger woman standing in the center, exuding happiness as she laughs and holds up two small fish hanging on a string. She wears a casual outfit consisting of a white blouse, a dark vest, and sports a blue headscarf. To the left, an older man, presumably in his later years, stands closely observing or possibly assisting her. He is dressed in a light-colored jacket and darker trousers, and he appears to be holding a camera around his neck, suggesting he might have taken pictures during their outing.\n\nThe dog, positioned near the woman's feet, adds a dynamic element to the scene. It looks up attentively with its mouth open, possibly excited by the fish. The setting is lush and green, with dense vegetation visible in the background and some overcast weather, suggesting a cool or mild climate. Overall, the photograph portrays a moment of shared joy and outdoor adventure among companions in a serene natural environment.","title":"California--sequoia national park","placename":"Sequoia National Forest (Calif.)","location":"Sequoia National Forest, California","nn1":["551393","552274","551516","543164","546320","548737","542564","549928","550848","542648","552327","543693","548141","553081","543516","551283"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Fishing"],"terms":["dog","fish","happiness","companion","headscarf","laugh","string","trip","foot","vest"]}
