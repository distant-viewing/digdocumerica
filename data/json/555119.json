{"path":"555119.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and atmospheric landscape, primarily focusing on a lush coniferous forest at what appears to be either dawn or dusk. The scene is dominated by several tall pine trees, which are silhouetted against a soft, dimly lit sky that suggests the early or late hours of the day. The foreground shows the detailed, darkened silhouettes of pine branches heavily laden with needles, contributing to an intricate texture against the softer background.\n\nIn the background, soft, hazy shades of blue and purple gently layer themselves to create a sense of depth, portraying distant forest-covered hills or mountains that fade into the sky. This gradation of color adds a mystical quality to the scene, emphasizing the quiet solitude of a vast natural landscape. The overall mood is peaceful and contemplative, with the play of light and shadow creating a subtle interplay of visibility and obscurity, giving the viewer a sense of both revelation and concealment in the natural world. No human presence or activity disrupts the natural setting, highlighting the untouched and pristine quality of the environment.","title":"Hemlock trees in Olympic National Timberland, Washington near Olympic National Park","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542849","543406","555128","542924","543621","557019","557601","553593","555110","554393","555217","543016","555126","554965","554461","557000"],"cl":[16],"cluster":["#16 &mdash; Forest Environments"],"terms":["gradation","forest","needle","quality","pine","world","purple","hour","play","dawn"]}
