{"path":"550968.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph captures a scene that juxtaposes nature and industrialization. In the foreground, a small grassy hill is topped with three park benches, each occupied by men. The coloring suggests an early spring atmosphere as the grass and budding trees appear fresh but the trees are still largely bare.\n\nOn the left bench, a lone man, dressed in a light beige jacket, dark trousers and light dress shoes, is seen sitting while deeply engaged in smoking, his gaze directed downwards. He seems lost in thought, isolated in his act.\n\nThe middle bench hosts two men dressed in suits. The man on the left has a beige suit and the other wears a darker shade, both with subtle smiles, engaged in a conversation. Their relaxed postures and attire suggest a break or a casual meeting.\n\nIn stark contrast to this peaceful park setting, the background is dominated by a large industrial plant. Several tall, dark smokestacks rise above an intricate network of pipes and infrastructure. The plant carries a grayish hue, expressing functionality rather than aesthetics. The visual weight of the industrial complex, with its smokestacks and structural forms, stands in sharp distinction to the organic, soft contours of the grassy knoll and the human element in the park. This backdrop alludes to the co-existence of industrial progress and everyday life, possibly hinting at socio-economic narratives typical of urban settings in the industrial era.","title":"The FMC Corporation's South Charleston plant is just beyond the park.","placename":"Charleston (W.
