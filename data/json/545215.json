{"path":"545215.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural scene set by the sea. The foreground is filled with tall, dry grass that extends across much of the frame, giving a feeling of a natural, wild meadow. The grasses, possibly reeds or dried coastal vegetation, are illuminated by bright sunlight, highlighting their golden-brown tones and delicate textures.\n\nBeyond the grass, the middle of the image opens onto a tranquil beach scene. The smooth, sandy beach is visible through gaps in the grass and appears to be deserted, adding a peaceful and untouched quality to the landscape. The beach gently meets the calm, reflective waters of the sea, which mirror the clear blue sky above.\n\nIn the background, the composition includes rugged, dark cliffs to the right and two distinctive rocky outcrops emerging from the sea. These rocky formations provide a sense of scale and ruggedness contrasting with the softness of the beach and grass. The sky is mostly clear with few clouds, suggesting a bright and sunny day, and it casts a calm light over the entire scene, enhancing the peaceful and natural atmosphere of the photograph. The overall composition invites viewers into a quiet, reflective moment in a natural coastal environment.","title":"Heceta Head","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["545280","543301","547596","547612","555400","547592","547015","543287","547607","543304","543066","548220","548757","543303","551554","543192"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","grass","sea","softness","gap","meadow","outcrop","ruggedness","reed","emerge"]}
