{"path":"542932.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a tranquil and mysterious scene within a dense forest. The central focus of the image is the tree, prominently placed in the foreground, its trunk and branches stark against the light filtering through the canopy. The sun, partially obscured by the tree trunk, creates a dramatic burst of light, with sunbeams radiating through the mist or fog surrounding the trees. This effect adds a mystical quality to the image, enhancing the contrast between light and shadow.\n\nThe surrounding trees are largely silhouetted against a cool and faintly blue-tinted background, suggesting this photo might have been taken during early morning or late evening. The rays of light penetrating the fog emphasize the depth and density of the forest while also highlighting the intricate patterns of smaller branches and leaves.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph is one of serene solitude and natural beauty, likely invoking a sense of calm and wonder in the viewer. The composition skillfully uses light, shadow, and the natural forms of the trees to create a visually striking and emotionally resonant scene.","title":"Sunlight filtering through pinewoods","placename":"California","location":"OTHER","nn1":["542931","543021","554998","542929","554394","557601","554393","551365","555126","554976","553579","542958","555124","554959","542849","554395"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["fog","trunk","ray","wonder","branch","tree","penetrate","burst","radiate","filtering"]}
