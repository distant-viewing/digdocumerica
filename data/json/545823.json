{"path":"545823.jpg","date":"January 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"This photograph takes a close-up and dynamic angle focused on a weather-beaten wooden fence post linked with strands of barbed wire. The perspective used leads the viewer's eye down the line of the fence as it stretches into the distance alongside other similarly rugged posts, spaced evenly across a barren landscape. The ground is parched, crisscrossed with deep cracks that suggest extreme aridity. The sky above is clear and vast, implying a remote, sunlit location, possibly a desert. In the background, the flat silhouette of distant mountains can be seen under the bright blue sky, hinting at the expansive and open terrain. The shadow of the fence post prominently displayed on the cracked ground, stretching towards the viewer, adds to the depth and textural interest of the composition.","title":"Barbed wire fence across desert","placename":"Big Bend National Park (Tex.)","location":"Big Bend National Park, Texas","nn1":["545819","543774","543122","547404","543414","545159","544019","557212","547522","549156","553820","543660","542566","542895","545341","544149"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["fence","crack","post","barbed","strand","spac","crisscross","stretch","viewer","link"]}
