{"path":"546657.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a moment between two individuals on what appears to be a city street. The focal point of the image is an interaction between a man in a black polo shirt and a police officer dressed in a light blue uniform. The man in the black shirt is facing towards the camera, and part of his expression suggests he is speaking or reacting to the officer; his brow is slightly furrowed and mouth open as if in mid-sentence. He is also casually resting his left hand on his hip. The police officer, wearing a badge and a name tag, is turning slightly away from the camera, focusing his attention on the man in black. The officer is pointing his right index finger near the chest of the man in black, and his expression seems serious.\n\nIn the background, there are blurred images of trees and other natural elements, as well as a glimpse of parked cars lining the roadside. This setting suggests the photograph might be taken in an urban area near a park or similarly treed area. Notably, a building partially obscured by trees and the distant silhouette of a large monumental structure resembling a significant architectural entity (potentially a governmental or historical building, given the context) can be seen in the backdrop. The overall atmosphere appears somewhat tense but controlled, capturing a moment of civil discourse or disagreement between a civilian and a law enforcement officer.","title":"Worried driver learns how and where to retrieve his \"towed away\" car.","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["546633","546637","546663","546654","546658","546611","542757","546680","556847","547205","546634","547759","546661","551941","557868","553244"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["officer","police","entity","enforcement","law","polo","hip","man","finger","tag"]}
