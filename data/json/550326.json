{"path":"550326.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph depicts a logging scene with numerous logs scattered across a body of water, possibly a lake or river. Versatile in hue and size, the logs are interspersed, some partially submerged, creating a disorganized yet natural mosaic across the water's surface. The background shows dense forest with a variety of trees, primarily coniferous, that extend along the water's edge, reinforcing the setting’s remote and wild character.\n\nThere are no visible human activities or machinery, suggesting that the image captures a moment either before or after active logging operations. The lighting suggests it is daylight, possibly midday, as the light appears to cast minimal shadows on the logs, indicating a sun positioned overhead. The atmosphere feels tranquil yet carries a sense of labor and the utilitarian use of natural resources. The image serves as a powerful visual representation of the logging industry’s interaction with natural landscapes.","title":"Logs clog shoreline of St. Croix River above Georgia Pacific paper mill.","placename":"Bangor (Me.)","location":"Bangor, Maine","nn1":["552178","552161","552197","550325","548004","545036","552163","545266","545037","550338","548018","548162","552199","545028","552162","552176"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["log","mosaic","representation","logging","midday","resource","character","submerge","reinforce","labor"]}
