{"path":"555552.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene, somewhat eerie water scene, featuring natural elements in delicate tranquility and subtle interplay of shadow and light. Dominating the composition is a clear and reflective pool of water, possibly a pond or a calm part of a river.\n\nIn the center of the image, there is a single white snail shell that appears to be floating gently on the water's surface. The shell's spiral structure is distinct and softly illuminated, contrasting with the darker tones surrounding it. Adjacent to the shell is a dark, twisted piece of wood or a small branch that partially protrudes from the water, adding a textural contrast to the smooth surface of the shell and water.\n\nThe background is somewhat indistinct but consists of shaded tones and darker areas which might be other parts of the bank or submerged objects. The lighting in the photograph creates a moody atmosphere, suggesting it could be in the early morning or late evening, giving the reflection on the water a soft glow and adding a sense of mystery to the scene.\n\nThe overall composition, with the shell as the focal point amidst the shadowy, natural elements, evokes tranquility and a contemplative mood, inviting the viewer to pause and reflect on the quiet beauty of this moment captured in nature.","title":"Flies feast on a dead carp killed in a major fish kill in the olentangy river june 20, 1974.
