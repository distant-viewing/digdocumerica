{"path":"549940.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Blanche, Wilbert Holman","caption":"This photograph depicts a scene at a landfill or a waste disposal site. The primary object in the image is a large garbage truck equipped with a hydraulic lifting mechanism, which is in the process of tilting a full dumpster to empty its contents. The dumpster is elevated above the truck, angled in such a way that its contents would fall directly into the truckâ€™s receptacle compartment.\n\nThe backdrop of the image shows a vast expanse of accumulated garbage that covers the ground, reflecting a typical dump site packed with various discarded items. Given the variety of waste, it suggests that this site accepts mixed debris, possibly from residential and commercial sources.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a person standing next to the garbage truck, observing the operation. The worker is wearing a dark outfit that could be a work uniform, and the environment they are in appears dirty and rugged, with uneven and muddy ground conditions typical for such sites. \n\nThe sky in the photograph is clear and bright blue, indicating good weather conditions, which contrasts starkly with the dirty and cluttered environment of the landfill. This juxtaposition emphasizes the impact and scale of waste management operations.","title":"Garbage truck at croton landfill operation along the Hudson River","placename":"Westchester County (N.Y.)","location":"Westchester County, New York","nn1":["549945","549749","549949","546761","549743","549936","547208","549795","546257","543821","549746","549792","547975","546902","544083","549791"],"cl":[8],"cluster":["#08 &mdash; Waste"],"terms":["dumpster","garbage","truck","site","waste","landfill","content","lifting","accumulate","compartment"]}
