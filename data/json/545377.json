{"path":"545377.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a large church or auditorium during what appears to be a formal religious ceremony or event. The focus of the image is a central aisle leading towards a podium where a single person, perhaps a clergyman or speaker, is standing. The individual is dressed in a long, white garment and addresses a congregation that fills the seats on either side of the aisle.\n\nThe congregation is prominently seen wearing uniform white hats, which could suggest a particular religious group or a special event requiring such attire. Both sides of the aisle are filled with seated attendees, most of whom are focused on the speaker.\n\nAt the end of the aisle, behind the speaker, there's a large, vibrant stained glass window providing a colourful backdrop. This window illuminates the area with a mixture of blues, greens, and reds. Below the window, there appears to be a choir or additional congregation members seated in white robes, adding to the solemnity and formality of the event.\n\nThe overall setting is one marked by reverence and collective participation, located in a spacious venue with modern features, characterized by its clean, simple lines and unadorned walls, allowing the stained glass window to be a significant focal point. The lighting is slightly dim, contributing to the solemn and respectful atmosphere of the occasion.","title":"Sixth avenue baptist church","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["558404","552623","545381","558406","558400","558383","558388","558239","558390","556238","558382","558389","558384","558407","558401","556234"],"cl":[33],"cluster":["#33 &mdash; Event"],"terms":["aisle","congregation","speaker","stain","event","window","formality","reverence","ceremony","solemnity"]}
