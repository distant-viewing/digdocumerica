{"path":"553744.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a modern architectural building captured during twilight, creating a serene atmosphere with soft lighting. The building features a rectangular structure with a flat roof supported by evenly spaced, sturdy columns. The columns appear prominent against an illuminated background, suggestive of the sun setting or the early evening light.\n\nThis structure is raised slightly above the ground with a series of steps leading up to an open pavilion area underneath the overhanging roof. The edges of the building are angular, and the roof extends significantly beyond the support columns, providing a substantial shaded area around the perimeter of the building. This design suggests a purpose of accommodating gatherings or activities shielded from direct sunlight or rain.\n\nIn foreground, parts of tropical foliage are visible, framing the building and adding a natural element to the image. The surrounding environment indicates the building is situated in a location that enjoys warm, possibly tropical weather, evidenced by the presence of palm trees in the distance against the evening sky.\n\nThe sky in the background blends hues of blue and orange, indicative of the time during sunset, which adds a dramatic backdrop and enhances the architectural features of the building with natural light transitioning from day to night. The overall mood of the photograph is peaceful, and the setting evokes a sense of openness and contemplation.","title":"Hawaii--Hawaiian State Capitol, Honolulu (Oahu I)","placename":"Honolulu (Hawaii)","location":"Honolulu, Hawaii","nn1":["546464","546470","546546","546473","553743","546463","546481","546531","544561","546472","546506","544565","546542","546460","550011","549490"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["column","building","roof","pavilion","evening","perimeter","palm","openness","night","support"]}
