{"path":"549868.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures a busy urban street scene, predominantly featuring a line of stationary yellow taxis. The taxis, classics from what appears to be the 1970s or 1980s, exhibit a boxy style typical of that era. They are closely packed along one side of the street, suggesting a taxi rank or a congested traffic situation.\n\nThe focus of the image is soft, creating a somewhat hazy or dreamlike effect, and depth is achieved through the line of cars vanishing into the background where the street narrows. In the background, there are indistinct figures of people walking, some crossing the street and others talking on the sidewalks, contributing to the bustling atmosphere.\n\nThe image has a low-key color palette dominated by the yellow of the taxis and subdued hues, reflecting a typical overcast day that might be seen in many cities. The picture has an urban feel, accentuated by what can be made out as tall buildings faintly looming in the background. The ambient lighting and composition suggest either early morning or late afternoon timings, characterized by softer light and longer shadows.","title":"Pedestrian threads way amid stalled traffic in midtown Manhattan","placename":"New York (N.Y.)","location":"New York, New York","nn1":["554315","554316","554331","554330","554310","549848","548331","549876","549859","549869","549862","549873","554314","545325","548410","549899"],"cl":[29],"cluster":["#29 &mdash; Car"],"terms":["taxi","street","key","narrow","timing","vanish","situation","loom","talk","yellow"]}
