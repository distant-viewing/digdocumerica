{"path":"547239.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The image depicts an aerial view of a large-scale water treatment facility. The composition shows a systematic array of rectangular sedimentation tanks, some filled with water appearing in various shades of blue. These large tanks are segmented into rows and are covered by numerous panels, possibly to control the exposure to sunlight or to support chemical treatment processes.\n\nToward the bottom of the image, there are uncovered, darker water tanks which contrast with the covered sections. These areas might be for different stages of the treatment process, such as settling basins or aeration tanks. The facility is expansive with concrete walkways separating each section of tanks, allowing for maintenance and operational access.\n\nIn the background, additional infrastructure related to the water treatment process can be seen, including smaller circular tanks which could be clarifiers or digesters. There are also buildings that likely house administrative offices, laboratories for water quality monitoring, and possibly storage for treatment chemicals.\n\nThe surrounding environment appears semi-industrial with dirt patches, sporadic small buildings, and underdeveloped land visible around the facility's perimeter. The aerial perspective underscores the extensive scale and organized layout essential for modern water treatment operations.","title":"Blue plains sewage treatment plant: organic pollutants from raw sewage are absorbed in these secondary tanks","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["548216","547262","553837","553900","546895","548212","547681","547260","543572","545840","544555","547257","543574","549636","548151","547568"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["treatment","tank","chemical","process","facility","water","perimeter","section","basin","scale"]}
