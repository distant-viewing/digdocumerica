{"path":"555484.jpg","date":"January 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"The photograph captures a scene at a fuel station during what appears to be a wet, overcast day. Prominent in the image are several branded elements, including a green and white Texaco sign positioned on a pole at the left side of the frame. Beneath it, another pole supports a green horizontally-oriented sign with \"Texaco\" inscribed in white. To the right of these, green banners or flags are visible, flapping in the wind.\n\nIn the foreground, various promotional signs are present. The closest sign to the viewer reads \"OPEN\" in red on white, followed by another sign detailing an offer or reminder to \"CHECK YOUR GAUGE FILL UP TODAY.\" These signs are strategically placed along the edge of the wet pavement, guiding customer attention toward the services and promotions available at the station.\n\nThe scene also includes a few people engaged in typical gas station activities. A man in a green uniform, likely an attendant, is seen interacting with another man beside a brown, classic sedan with its trunk open. It appears that the attendant might be aiding the customer, possibly with filling up gas or checking the vehicle's oil, typical services offered at full-service stations during the era indicated by the car's design.\n\nThe atmosphere of the scene is enhanced by a dark, moody sky, suggesting that rain might have recently fallen, as evident from the wet surfaces around the station. There are trees and some residential structures in the background that suggest the gas station is located in a suburban setting.\n\nOverall, the combination of branded signs, operational activities, and atmospheric conditions provide a nostalgic glimpse into everyday life at a mid-century American fuel station.","title":"Oregon gas station dealers had a flag system to help motorists.
