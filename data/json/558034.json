{"path":"558034.jpg","date":"September 1975","photographer":"Aleksandrowicz, Frank J.","caption":"This photograph shows an old church, captured in a vintage, somewhat faded purple tone, which suggests it could be a historical image. The church is predominantly white and built in a traditional architectural style. Its key features include a prominent steeple with a spire topped by a decorative element, possibly a cross or a weathervane. The steeple houses louvered bell openings, framed by peaks on top, enhancing its classic charm.\n\nThe church structure consists of a gabled main fa√ßade, complemented by a smaller gabled entrance area where the main entrance is located. This entrance features a set of double wooden doors, reached by a few steps, indicating a slight elevation from the ground level. Flanking the doors are two sets of windows: one directly next to the door and another set positioned on the sides of the edifice. The windows appear to be tall and narrow, typical of many church designs, possibly for decorative stained glass, although the image does not confirm the glass detail.\n\nThe building's siding is horizontal, and the overall condition looks well-maintained, though the image quality cannot confirm fine details. The surroundings are basic, with a dirt road leading up to the church and an unadorned landscape with a few sparse trees and clearings visible in the background. There is also a utility pole visible to the left of the church, suggesting the presence of modern amenities at the time the photograph was taken.\n\nThe church is set against a somewhat cloudy sky, inferring either an early morning or a late afternoon setting, considering the lighting and tone of the sky. Given the pastoral and tranquil setting, it conveys a serene atmosphere typical of a rural religious building. Such a photograph might have historical value, reflecting the architectural and cultural characteristics of its time.","title":"Peninsula Methodist Church on Main Street in Peninsula, Ohio near Akron as it was seen in a copy of a black and white photograph taken about 1910. Since that time the spire has been changed. The village with its period structures is of interest to visitors. It is located within the newly created Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area situated in a 20-mile stretch between the metropolitan districts of Cleveland and Akron.","placename":"Peninsula (Ohio)","location":"Peninsula, Ohio","nn1":["554207","556480","547346","558024","558163","558019","545366","558023","554035","558018","547333","554033","557088","553327","550376","547414"],"cl":[34],"cluster":["#34 &mdash; Religious Buildings"],"terms":["church","set","entrance","door","value","steeple","amenity","bell","glass","cross"]}
