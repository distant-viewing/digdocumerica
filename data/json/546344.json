{"path":"546344.jpg","date":"July 1972","photographer":"Shrout, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a scene inside a darkly lit laboratory setting, with an emphasis on advanced instrumentation and a focus on precision. The image features a silhouetted profile of a person, likely a scientist or lab technician, seated at a work station. The individual is engaging directly with the laboratory equipment, suggesting an intense involvement in an experiment or research activity.\n\nThe room is equipped with various high-tech devices and instrumentation. Visible is a sophisticated microscope setup to the right of the person, which likely serves as the main point of focus for the work being conducted. Next to the microscope, there's a digital display showing a timer or measurement (displaying \"00:05\"), indicating that timing is crucial to the experiment at hand.\n\nAdditionally, the work station is cluttered with laboratory glassware, including beakers and flasks, which suggests that chemical or biological processes are being monitored or manipulated. The red ambient light in the background not only adds a dramatic tone to the setting but also may indicate the use of light-sensitive materials or procedures.\n\nFurther away and to the right is a large, box-like piece of equipment with additional gauges and readouts, amplifying the high-tech nature of the laboratory. The overall composition and setting imply a serious, controlled scientific endeavor, focusing heavily on detail and precision. The aura is one of meticulous research and advanced scientific investigation.","title":"EPA Gulf Breeze Laboratory: Tom Heitmuller, biologist, measures cation in shrimp serum at the atomic absorption spectrophotometer.","placename":"Florida","location":"OTHER","nn1":["546327","546283","549332","542667","546282","555281","549364","546275","551594","546278","555280","549608","546284","549342","555374","549607"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["laboratory","microscope","precision","experiment","research","work","station","glassware","flask","investigation"]}
