{"path":"550000.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Halberstadt, Ernst","caption":"This photograph depicts a tranquil, natural scene centered around a river. The image is framed by lush, dense greenery on all sides, giving the viewer a sense of observing a hidden or secluded spot. Through a foreground of vibrant and varied foliage, which includes several shades of green, two people in a small boat are visible. The boat appears to be a simple, small rowboat.\n\nThe two individuals are distinctly engaged in an activity, likely fishing, given the serene environment and their focused postures. One of them, wearing a red cap, seems to be handling either a fishing rod or an oar. The location is serene and rich in vibrant natural colors, reflecting a sunny day as indicated by the bright light and shadows cast upon the boat and the water.\n\nThe river itself is calm, with reflections of trees and light spots visible on the surface, enhancing the peacefulness of the setting. The setting is heavily wooded, and the composition of the photograph, with trees in the immediate foreground framing the shot, gives it a contained and intimate feel, inviting the viewer into a private moment in nature.","title":"Canoeing on the Charles River Audubon Society reservation at Natick","placename":"Boston (Mass.)","location":"Boston, Massachusetts","nn1":["551350","550989","552317","553411","543444","550769","550988","550208","550835","550975","557972","546976","550780","554472","551217","551281"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["boat","spot","fishing","oar","rowboat","peacefulness","viewer","rod","river","shot"]}
