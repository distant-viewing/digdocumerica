{"path":"549375.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"The photograph displays a serene coastal scene. In the foreground, there’s a paved path that curves gently towards a small, squat lighthouse on the right. The lighthouse is white with grayish-blue accents, equipped with a sizeable rectangular structure topped with what appears to be a light room or observation area. There is a slight incline covered with grass and small shrubs leading down to the water’s edge.\n\nOn the left side of the path, overlooking the sea, a mature tree provides some greenery to the scene. The sea occupies the middle portion of the scene, stretching towards the horizon. It is dotted with small waves, suggesting a light breeze. A single boat, a mid-sized vessel, possibly a fishing or leisure craft, is seen moving right to left across the frame.\n\nThere are a few people visible near the lighthouse and in the surrounding area, likely enjoying the view or visiting the lighthouse. The landscape across the sea includes distant landmasses, which appear as hazy hills across the horizon, adding depth to the scene.\n\nThe sky is modestly clouded, diffusing the sunlight and casting a soft light over the entire scene. Overall, the photograph captures a peaceful maritime setting, inviting contemplation or a leisurely visit.","title":"The ruder boskovic institute's research ship on the adriatic sea.
