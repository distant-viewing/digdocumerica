{"path":"545987.jpg","date":"December 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures an industrial waterfront scene under a heavily clouded sky. The image shows a wide view of an industrial complex with multiple buildings. The buildings are primarily white, with various sizes and structures, some featuring large windows and flat roofs. There are cylindrical storage tanks and silos present, colored in white, which contrast with the industrial setting.\n\nOne of the most prominent features of this landscape is the series of plumes of smoke or steam billowing into the sky from multiple points across the complex. These emissions vary in density and spread, creating a dramatic and somewhat foreboding atmosphere against the backdrop of a cloudy sky. The sky itself is filled with thick, textured clouds, suggesting perhaps an overcast day.\n\nOn the far left, there's a tall, slender structure that appears to be a chimney or tower, marked with a red stripe at its top, possibly for visibility. The waterfront is visible in the foreground with calm waters reflecting some of the structures and the clouds above.\n\nThis scene likely depicts a factory or processing plant, possibly related to chemicals, energy, or heavy manufacturing, given the extensive infrastructure and emissions. The overall mood conveyed is industrial and functional, with a strong emphasis on the environmental impact visible through the emissions dispersing into the air.","title":"Freeport sulphur co.
