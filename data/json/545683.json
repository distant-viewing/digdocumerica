{"path":"545683.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This image captures a series of handprints on a rock surface. There are four visible handprints in total, imparting a striking impression against the warm, reddish-brown stone. From left to right, the first handprint is different from the others as it is created by the overlay of three separate impressions creating a multifaceted, almost stenciled appearance, presenting more as a representation of layered hands with different orientations.\n\nThe next three handprints are standalone and more traditional in style. Each shows the detail of fingers and palms, and their outlines appear highlighted with a white or lighter substance that contrasts vividly with the red rock, emphasizing the contours of each hand.\n\nThese prints are rendered with a technique that enhances their definition against the coarse texture of the rock. The background is fairly uniform in color, focused on the natural stone texture, which adds a rustic and ancient feel to the overall image. The top of the frame shows a slight overhang of rock, indicating that these prints might be located in a sheltered area, possibly a cave or under a rock overhang.\n\nSuch imagery typically suggests a form of ancient human communication or art, possibly serving a ceremonial, ritualistic, or simply decorative purpose.","title":"These Fremont culture pictographs, dating back to the 11th century a.d., have been vandalized by a recent application of spray paint","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["545687","545688","545675","557117","545679","545671","545608","544915","557118","554172","550466","545686","544750","544907","545567","545692"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["rock","overhang","print","impression","coarse","overlay","stone","cave","imagery","render"]}
