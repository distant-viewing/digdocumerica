{"path":"545368.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph portrays an atmospheric urban scene, predominantly shaded in tones of dark amber and black. At the forefront, a man stands adjacent to a street pole that supports a glowing \"DON'T WALK\" sign, illuminated in bright orange, contrasting starkly with the otherwise dim surroundings. The man, dressed in a dark suit with a diagonally striped tie, appears to be waiting, his pose relaxed but attentive. He is holding what appears to be a cane or a similar object, suggestive of movement or perhaps a pause in walking.\n\nTo the right of the man is a bright yellow object, resembling a newspaper vending machine or a public utilities box, adding a splash of color to the otherwise shadowy scene. Behind him, the glass windows of a store display posters and advertisements partially lit by ambient streetlight. Visible through the window, there are images promoting \"Woolworth's Week for Dogs,\" indicating the storefront likely belongs to a business related to pets or animal care.\n\nThe setting suggests a typical city street corner at twilight or night, imbued with a sense of quietness, possibly in a somewhat older part of a city given the design of the street elements and lamp post. The overall ambient lighting casts deep shadows, creating a moody atmosphere that emphasizes the solitude of the figure standing alone.","title":"Birmingham street crossing","placename":"Birmingham (Ala.)","location":"Birmingham, Alabama","nn1":["550136","546642","546646","547820","543037","547695","556733","547816","545351","546419","548373","555930","557277","553188","550127","556199"],"cl":[39],"cluster":["#39 &mdash; Street Life"],"terms":["street","vending","pet","cane","streetlight","quietness","pause","poster","storefront","city"]}
