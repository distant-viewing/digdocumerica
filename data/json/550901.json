{"path":"550901.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Pittman, Blair","caption":"The photograph depicts an aerial view of a river scene, capturing a bustling industrial overview. The main focus is a tugboat, partaking in navigation through the waters. This boat, central in the image, features a predominantly black and white color scheme and is creating a noticeable wake as it moves, indicating its active motion.\n\nTo the right side of the riverbank, there is a tall black crane positioned on the edge, likely used for loading and unloading goods. This area appears industrially developed, with buildings dedicated to similar functions aligned along the shore. The other parts of the landscape primarily consist of an expanse of green spaces that might hint at less developed or possibly recreational areas.\n\nTowards the top of the picture, in the distance, we can see a faint silhouette of a city skyline, possibly indicating that this river is near a major urban area. The sky is overcast, casting a hazy, diffused light over the entire scene, which imbues it with a somewhat moody and serene atmosphere.\n\nOverall, the image captures a mix of industrial activity and calm, natural waters, placing the bustling human endeavor of the tugboat against a vast industrial and natural backdrop.","title":"Tugs on the heavily industrialized Houston Ship Channel seen from a recently built bridge.
