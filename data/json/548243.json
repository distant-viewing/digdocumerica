{"path":"548243.jpg","date":"February 1973","photographer":"Parks, Deborah A.","caption":"This image depicts an elementary classroom scene, likely taken during a class activity. The room is filled with young students, approximately 14 in number, who appear to be around the ages of 6 to 8 years old. The students, dressed in varied casual attire such as sweaters, shirts, and pants, are standing up facing the front of the classroom.\n\nThe classroom is richly decorated with educational materials and displays. To the left of the image, there's a board displaying the alphabet, alongside various diagrams and pictures that seem to provide visual learning aids about different animals and objects. The central wall at the front of the classroom has several hanging educational posters, some featuring the United States map and others depicting historical themes. Notably, there's a prominent American flag hanging vertically beside these displays.\n\nIn the center and right of the classroom, more educational materials can be seen, including what looks like a bulletin board with more student artwork and creative projects. These works include what appear to be individual student portraits and possibly some thematic artwork related to seasons or other study topics.\n\nThe room is furnished with traditional school desks arranged in rows, each desk facing forward towards the teacherâ€™s area at the front. The floor is not visible, but the ceiling shows standard fluorescent lighting common in many school settings.\n\nThe entire scene evokes an educational atmosphere focused on interactive and visual learning, with a strong emphasis on American cultural and historical themes. The organization of the room and the attentiveness of the students suggest an active learning session is in progress, with the teacher possibly out of view in the scene.","title":"Second graders pledge allegiance in rockport elementary school","placename":"Gloucester (Mass.)","location":"Gloucester, Massachusetts","nn1":["544322","558214","554838","558212","548227","543919","544798","543920","546548","552590","546556","558210","553911","558410","552946","545547"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Room"],"terms":["classroom","student","teacher","learn","artwork","room","desk","school","board","front"]}
