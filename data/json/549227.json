{"path":"549227.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a natural, rural landscape under a partly cloudy sky. The foreground prominently features dense, wild vegetation, with a mixture of grasses and shrubs. Some of the shrubs have silvery leaves that reflect light, adding a textured brightness to the image. The midground extends into a meadow filled with various types of tall grass and scattered bushes. At the horizon line, there are trees and a rolling hill in the distance. The clouds overhead are fluffy and white, suggestive of a pleasant weather condition. This serene setting appears to be in a natural state, possibly untouched by urban development. The composition emphasizes the expansiveness and tranquility of the outdoor environment.","title":"Untouched prairie grasses near colstrip","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549229","549186","549238","552903","550667","549142","556990","557191","557099","545040","547649","549236","550604","551370","555596","549218"],"cl":[45],"cluster":["#45 &mdash; Rock"],"terms":["shrubs","expansiveness","silvery","meadow","grass","brightness","midground","mixture","textured","roll"]}
