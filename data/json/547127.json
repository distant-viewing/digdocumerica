{"path":"547127.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Sequeira, Paul","caption":"This photograph features a moody, tranquil lakeside scene during what appears to be either dawn or dusk, given the soft, dim lighting. The foreground shows dry, tall grass and snow patches suggesting it is winter or early spring. On the left, several bare, slender trees stand, adding to the starkness of the scene.\n\nThe lake itself is calm with small, gentle waves lapping onto the shore. The water stretches to the horizon, blending with the overcast sky in shades of muted blues and grays.\n\nOn the right side of the image, atop a slight hill adjacent to the beach, there is a dark wooden structure, possibly a cabin or storage shed. This building lends a sense of isolation or abandonment to the scene, emphasized by its sparse surroundings and lack of visible activity or human presence.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys a serene yet somber atmosphere, typical of cold season landscapes by large bodies of water. The scene might evoke feelings of solitude and reflection.","title":"Lone house on lake Michigan shore","placename":"Gary (Ind.)","location":"Gary, Indiana","nn1":["554405","550493","550735","545213","551207","548034","550745","554752","557021","547052","543611","552319","550389","557493","557562","550324"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["starkness","lap","shed","cabin","lack","winter","dawn","lend","spring","abandonment"]}
