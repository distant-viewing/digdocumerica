{"path":"548690.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and scenic outdoor setting. In the foreground, prominently positioned on the left side of the image, is a red motorcycle, likely from the 1970s, judging by its style and design. The motorcycle is equipped with various bags and items attached to it, suggesting preparation for a long trip or a camping adventure. Among the visible equipment are a sleeping bag or tent, and a couple of red packs strapped to the bike, indicating readiness for outdoor activities.\n\nBehind the motorcycle on the right side and slightly in the background, a person sits near the edge of a body of water, possibly a lake or large river. The person, appearing contemplative, is dressed in casual outdoor attire and seated on what looks like a faded small cooler or tackle box, gazing out towards the water. The background features calm water extending to a barely discernible opposite shore under a partly cloudy sky, creating a peaceful, natural environment.\n\nThe composition of the image, with the motorcycle sharply in focus, and the natural surroundings blurred slightly, directs the viewer's attention to the interplay of human activity (represented by the motorcycle and the person) within a tranquil, natural setting. This possibly conveys themes of travel, solitude, and the enjoyment of nature.","title":"Vacationer from Ohio relaxes near his motorcycle during sightseeing tour of the keys","placename":"Key West (Fla.)","location":"Key West, Florida","nn1":["548691","545134","553955","544844","558232","554876","547588","554874","545598","543730","544840","553954","546976","556418","557777","549058"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["motorcycle","bag","person","sleep","readiness","strap","bike","tent","camping","trip"]}
