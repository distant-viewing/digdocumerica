{"path":"551223.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene nocturnal scene over a body of water, likely a large lake or river. Taken at night, the scene is characterized by vibrant reflections of lights on the surface of the water. Here's a breakdown of the elements visible in the image:\n\n1. **Water and Reflections**: The central feature of this photograph is the water, which is calm and mirrors the colors and lights originating from the nearby establishments and structures. Notable reflections include a striking pinkish-red light that casts a vivid streak across the water, alongside softer white and yellow reflections.\n\n2. **Boats and Docks**: On the water, there are several small boats docked along wooden piers. One larger boat, which seems to be a houseboat or a small passenger boat, is docked prominently in the foreground.\n\n3. **Architecture and Buildings**: There are multiple buildings visible along the shore. They appear to be both residential and commercial properties, radiating lights of different colors and intensities. A particularly bright building towards the right-hand side of the image stands out with neon lighting, possibly indicating a restaurant, bar, or another public venue.\n\n4. **Vegetation and Terrain**: There is an observable tree line beyond the buildings, suggesting that the water body is situated in a moderately wooded area. The terrain gently slopes upward from the water's edge, indicating the presence of either a hill or a rise in elevation.\n\n5. **Lighting and Ambience**: Streetlights and outdoor lighting from the buildings contribute to a warm, inviting glow, highlighting the banks and providing a contrast to the nocturnal blue of the sky and water.\n\n6. **Overhead Wires**: In the foreground, multiple wires (possibly telephone or electrical lines) stretch across the view, subtly reminding viewers of the intersection between natural beauty and human habitation.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a tranquil yet vibrant nightlife scene by a water body, showcasing the interplay between man-made lights and natural elements in a peaceful setting.","title":"Dusk over the gRand glaize arm of lake of the ozarks at osage beach.
