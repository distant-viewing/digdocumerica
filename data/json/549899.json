{"path":"549899.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"McCoy, Dan","caption":"The photograph captures an aerial view of a bustling city street intersection filled with vehicles and pedestrians. The scene shows numerous vehicles, predominantly taxis, which are easily identifiable by their vibrant yellow color. The taxis are intermixed with other vehicles including sedans, vans, and a couple of buses. In the frame, there are several lanes of traffic moving in at least two directions, alongside pedestrian crossings.\n\nSeveral pedestrians are visible at the corners of the streets and crossing crosswalks, appearing tiny in comparison to the density of the automobiles around them. The cityscape around the intersection includes features indicative of an urban environment, such as traffic lights, street markings, and various shades of pavement.\n\nThe ground has distinctive black and grey linear patterns, typical of road surfaces in heavily trafficked areas. No specific architectural elements are discernible besides partial views of buildings on the streets’ edges, contributing to a purely vehicular and pedestrian perspective. One corner of the intersection displays a small, rectangular green space, contrasting with the surrounding urban environment. The photograph’s color palette is a mix of somber city tones and the vivid yellow of the cabs, capturing the dynamic and often congested nature of city traffic.","title":"Traffic in the herald square area of midtown Manhattan near intersection of 34th street and broadway.
