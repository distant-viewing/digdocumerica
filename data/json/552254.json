{"path":"552254.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"The photograph shows a scene of large concrete pipes, or similar structures, which appear old and slightly damaged, resting along a water's edge, probably a river or lake. These cylindrical pipes are irregularly scattered and some are half-submerged in the water. The concrete has weathered surfaces suggesting exposure to elements over time.\n\nIn the background across the water, there is an industrial setting visible with buildings that look like factories or warehouses. These structures are somewhat indistinct but are characterized by flat roofs and a generally utilitarian architectural style.\n\nThe surrounding landscape includes lush greenery along the bank opposite to where the concrete pipes lie. The sky in the image is lightly clouded, giving a serene yet slightly overcast atmosphere to the setting. The reflection of the sky in the calm water further adds a peaceful quality to the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition juxtaposes the serene natural environment with the abandoned or discarded industrial elements, creating a thought-provoking contrast between nature and human-made landscapes.","title":"Culvert pipe and cables dumped as riprap (a haphazard sustaining wall to prevent erosion) on the edge of the duwamish river","placename":"Seattle (Wash.)","location":"Seattle, Washington","nn1":["547581","552253","553393","547890","544674","552071","543257","546002","547582","552040","553462","545167","547622","552255","552240","546067"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pipe","provoke","thought","water","concrete","warehouse","damage","abandon","exposure","discard"]}
