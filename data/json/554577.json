{"path":"554577.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph vividly captures a group of ferns in the early stage of their lifecycle, specifically showing the fiddleheads: the curled fronds of a fern before they unfurl. The fiddleheads are presented in sharp focus, standing erect with a variety of heights, appearing both singular and in clusters. Each has a slightly fuzzy, textured surface, with a plush greenish-brown color, and they are tightly coiled at their tips, resembling the top of a violin, from which the name \"fiddlehead\" is derived.\n\nAround the base of the ferns, there are various pieces of plant debris, including old fern leaves that are brown and dried, contributing to the natural, raw feel of the setting. The background is softly blurred and showcases a dark, forest-like environment with patches of lighter green, possibly from other plants or light filtering through trees, enhancing the depth and the natural wilderness context of the scene.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes the natural beauty and the intriguing forms of these young ferns, inviting viewers to appreciate the details and patterns of early plant growth in a woodland ecosystem.","title":"Fiddleheads of ferns, in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"OTHER","nn1":["555048","553590","555191","555049","555053","554996","555192","553358","553589","555093","555190","554993","554743","554729","555183","555050"],"cl":[15],"cluster":["#15 &mdash; Flowers"],"terms":["fern","plant","lifecycle","frond","tip","filtering","stage","ecosystem","growth","height"]}
