{"path":"551113.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"The photograph captures a detailed view of an industrial site, possibly an old factory or processing plant, spreading over a lush, green hillside. The key elements include several large, industrial buildings made of various materials including corrugated iron and concrete, in varied conditions from worn to maintained. Several of the buildings are connected by pipes or conveyors, suggesting a complex used for processing materials.\n\nIn the foreground, the industrial complex is surrounded by dense green vegetation, which also frames the upper part of the image, indicating the factory's integration into a forested or rural area. One prominent feature is a very long, broad chute or conveyor belt that descends from the main structures toward the base of the hill. Just below the chute, there is a water body, possibly a river, where a barge can be seen. The barge appears to be stationary and positioned directly below and parallel to the chute, likely for transporting materials processed at the plant.\n\nThe overall atmosphere conveyed by the photograph is a combination of industrial activity set against the backdrop of natural greenery, emphasizing a juxtaposition of man-made structure and nature. The complex, while big and somewhat sprawling, does not completely overwhelm the landscape, suggesting a balance or coexistence within its environment.","title":"Coal plant and barge loading operation at Harewood Mine near Boomer in the Kanawha Valley region","placename":"Charleston (W.
