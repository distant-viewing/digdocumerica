{"path":"551902.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an interior scene of a high-tech control room or operations center, likely from the mid to late 20th century based on the style and technology visible. The room is spacious, with a high ceiling dotted with numerous small, round lights creating a grid-like pattern.\n\nIn the foreground, there are at least three people visible, working at desks outfitted with various technological devices, such as telephones and bulky computer monitors. These individuals are dressed in business attire, which includes white shirts and ties, suggesting a professional environment. Their focus is directed towards their tasks, highlighting a scenario of concentration and perhaps monitoring or surveillance duties.\n\nThe desks are simple and functional, without excessive decoration, aligning with the utilitarian feel of the space. Papers and other office items are neatly organized, indicating an environment where precision and order are likely valued.\n\nTo the right side of the photograph, a large wall is filled with numerous smaller monitor screens, each displaying different images. These monitors are of the CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) type, commonly used before the advent of flat-screen technologies. The images on the screens are not clear, but they suggest live feeds of various locations or operations, potentially for security or traffic management.\n\nThe back wall of the room features a map and a framed painting, adding a decorative yet functional element to the space. The map suggests geographic monitoring or operational oversight, possibly related to the imagery displayed on the screens.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a moment in a specialized workspace, likely related to surveillance, monitoring, or communication, where technology and human oversight intersect systematically.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day, controls all traffic lights, receives remote TV inputs from major intersections, and maintains radio contact with all traffic control vehicles.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551903","551901","551904","551905","551916","551900","556758","551898","555334","552387","542765","551896","549367","556384","549610","547720"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["screen","monitor","oversight","technology","surveillance","room","map","desk","monitoring","feed"]}
