{"path":"547725.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph displays an aerial or satellite view of a vivid and geometrically patterned landscape dotted with agricultural fields. The fields are variously colored in shades of red, pink, green, and beige, creating a quilt-like pattern that stretches across the majority of the image. This part of the image looks similar to a patchwork of farmlands, which are likely differentiated by the types of crops being grown or the seasons of the crops.\n\nToward the bottom of the photograph, there is a significant contrast where a body of water is visible. It appears dark against the colorful farmland. Intricately branching into this water body are red-colored waterways or channels, giving it a tree root-like appearance. These vividly colored channels could be due to sediment or particular minerals in the water, often seen in estuarine areas.\n\nThe overall composition is aesthetically striking due to the juxtaposition of the geometric human-made agricultural patterns and the natural, organic forms of the waterways. The image invokes themes of human impact on nature and the complex interactions between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The lighting in the image creates a gradient from bright at the top to darker tones below, which may indicate the sun's position at the time the image was captured.","title":"Farmland of the Imperial Valley, and the Salton Sea infrared film","placename":"Blythe (Calif.)","location":"Blythe, California","nn1":["547724","548817","542708","549094","553972","553661","553668","542517","553973","549253","552858","542730","553977","558414","557517","542713"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Aerial Photographs"],"terms":["farmland","channel","crop","waterway","quilt","root","patchwork","majority","field","mineral"]}
