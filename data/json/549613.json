{"path":"549613.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph features a large ship floating on calm waters. The ship, named \"Martin Karlsen,\" is painted in a striking red color with a white superstructure, navigating under a clear sky. The hull is clearly visible with the ship's name prominently displayed in white letters. The ship is equipped with a substantial deck structure, including a central tall, thin mast, surrounded by various antennas, cables, and possibly cranes, suggesting its use for specialized tasks like research or fishing.\n\nIn the background, there is a tranquil, natural scene with a hazy horizon where the sky meets the sea. The gentle ripples in the water suggest a very calm day. The topography hints at a distant, flat landmass that could possibly be a low-lying island or a distant coast, enveloped partially by mist or fog. The overall atmosphere is serene, with the setting enhancing the isolation and purposeful presence of the ship in this maritime environment.","title":"The \"martin karlsen,\" a canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in lake superior.
