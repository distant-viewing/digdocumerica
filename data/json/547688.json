{"path":"547688.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This is a photograph showing a group of young people at a beach. In the foreground, two women are walking through shallow water. The woman on the left is wearing a black bikini and sunglasses hanging from her swimsuit, while the one on the right is dressed in a white tank top and cutoff denim shorts. The expressions and body language suggest leisurely movement and casual interaction.\n\nIn the background, other individuals enhance the lively beach scene. A person is wading in the water with splashes around, and another is floating on the water, further away. To the left, another woman wearing a wet, partly see-through shirt appears to be adjusting her hair, standing out of the water.\n  \nThe ambient light, water shimmer, and the casual attire of the people give off a vibrant, summery vibe typical of a busy beach scene. The overall composition captures a moment of youthful enjoyment and relaxation in a natural setting.","title":"On the beach at Rocky Point near Hawk Cove, east of Baltimore","placename":"Baltimore (Md.)","location":"Baltimore, Maryland","nn1":["550936","543534","547507","555923","543458","546794","546768","548699","550929","544185","547009","550228","543397","546874","555892","547503"],"cl":[12],"cluster":["#12 &mdash; Beach"],"terms":["beach","woman","shimmer","bikini","water","language","swimsuit","splash","relaxation","denim"]}
