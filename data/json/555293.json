{"path":"555293.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a man interacting with a solar panel installation on a rooftop. The man, who features a dark, neatly groomed beard and mustache, is dressed in a fashionable striped suit with a distinctly 1970s-1980s style, and he appears to be adjusting or inspecting the solar panel. The panel is mounted on a white, metallic stand that is tilted at an angle, possibly for optimal sun exposure.\n\nThe setting is a sunny day with a clear blue sky, and the environment suggests a semi-urban or suburban area. In the background, one can see flat, expansive landscapes typical of such settings, including low buildings and a distant view that features sparse vegetation and wide, open fields. Some industrial structures are visible in the far distance, contributing to a setting that combines elements of residential and industrial zones.\n\nThe rooftop on which this scene unfolds is surrounded by a low wall, hinting that this might be a commercial building or an institutional structure. The focus and context of the image underline themes of renewable energy and technological adaptation, characteristic of the era concerned with new energy solutions.","title":"Dr. R.L.
