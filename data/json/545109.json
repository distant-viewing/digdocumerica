{"path":"545109.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph features a natural landscape dominated by sandy, grass-covered terrain that appears to form part of a dune system. In the foreground, a single wooden post prominently displays a white sign with bold black lettering that reads \"VEHICLES PROHIBITED ON GRASS AREAS.\" The sign suggests the area is likely protected or part of a conservation effort to maintain the integrity of the natural environment.\n\nBeyond the sign, the ground consists mainly of sparse, sandy soil with patches of brownish, dry grass, likely indicative of a coastal habitat suffering from some degree of erosion or poor soil nutrition. Several low sand dunes rise gently in the background, covered with similar grass and scattered plant life, emphasizing the barren yet subtly dynamic nature of this ecosystem.\n\nThe sky appears overcast, casting a flat, diffuse light over the scene which softens colors and eliminates harsh shadows, typical of overcast weather conditions often seen in coastal regions. The overall ambiance is quiet and somber, free from human presence or activity, emphasizing a sense of isolation and tranquility typically associated with protected natural areas. This scene encapsulates a balance between human-imposed restrictions and the raw, understated beauty of a natural landscape.","title":"Grass has been planted to stabilize the sand dunes in national recreation park.","placename":"Florence (Or.)","location":"Florence, Oregon","nn1":["547015","547973","548672","543192","549183","544220","556943","544522","543420","552434","545620","550490","543104","549453","553994","549132"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Signs"],"terms":["grass","restriction","soil","degree","sign","dune","conservation","balance","lettering","habitat"]}
