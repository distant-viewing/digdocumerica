{"path":"549609.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Emmerich, Donald","caption":"This photograph shows a man in a lab setting, apparently focused on a scientific or chemical experiment. The man has medium-length brown hair and a mustache, and he is looking intently toward a bright light source, possibly used for heating or illumination of his experiment. He is wearing a light blue shirt with rolled-up sleeves, grey suspenders, and a wristwatch on his left wrist.\n\nThe setup includes what looks like a laboratory with a cluttered table holding various items: a conical flask with a sedimented substance at the bottom is placed on a heating or stirring device, and there are other containers, such as a bottle with a white liquid. In front of the man is some sort of stand or holder with metal rods, which might be used to hold or manipulate scientific instruments.\n\nThe background is a white wall with some visible signs of wear like marks or stains, which gives a sense of an active and possibly long-used laboratory space. Thereâ€™s also some tubing and other equipment attached to the wall, adding to the overall busy and functional appearance of the place. The lighting in the image seems artificial, likely provided by lab equipment or ceiling fixtures, focusing primarily on the experiment area.","title":"The \"martin karlsen,\" a canadian ship, is a floating laboratory from which scientists are analyzing physical, chemical biological and meteorological conditions in lake superior.
