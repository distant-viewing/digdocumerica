{"path":"545553.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"The photograph shows a lizard basking in what appears to be a warm environment, most likely on a sunlit day judging by the brightness and shadows visible. The lizard, with a spiny back and a long tail, is positioned vertically, clinging to a rugged, reddish-brown rocky surface that has multiple crevices and rough textures indicative of natural erosion.\n\nThe focus is sharply on the lizard, showcasing details such as the scales on its skin and the individual spines along its back and tail. The background and immediate surroundings of the lizard are uniformly rocky, with similar red and brown hues, giving a sense of a dry, desert-like ecosystem, possibly indicating the lizard's natural habitat. The lighting highlights the geometry and texture of the rock, enhancing the three-dimensional feel of the surface.\n\nThe composition of the image is simple yet striking, with the lizard positioned centrally, allowing the viewer to immediately focus on it while also appreciating the harsh beauty of its environment. The image invokes a sense of the resilience and adaptability of life in such stark conditions.","title":"Lizard","placename":"Moab (Utah)","location":"Moab, Utah","nn1":["543778","551366","551250","544622","550476","544904","544908","555196","549459","544487","543286","551331","550474","555886","554594","544440"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Desert Landscapes"],"terms":["tail","back","spine","crevice","skin","brightness","resilience","habitat","erosion","texture"]}
