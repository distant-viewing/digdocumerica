{"path":"549157.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph presents a scenic landscape featuring rolling hills and vast plains. The foreground is covered in rich green grass, interspersed with patches of vibrant yellow wildflowers and a few areas of reddish vegetation, giving the field a colorful texture. A notable undulating terrain with small gullies and pockets of shadow emphasize the natural topography of the area.\n\nIn the middle distance, there’s a more cultivated landscape, possibly farmland, with orderly rows suggesting agriculture, and scattered trees dotting the fields. There’s a small rural community visible, characterized by a collection of white and light-colored buildings, including what appears to be homes and possibly barns or storage structures, which suggests a farming community.\n\nThe background is dominated by a pale blue sky, beneath which lies a sweeping vista of distant hills and mountains, providing a contrasting backdrop to the green and fertile plains in the foreground. The colors are soft, giving the photograph a calm and serene feeling. The overall composition conveys a sense of expansive open space and natural beauty typical of rural or semi-rural landscapes.","title":"Ranch lands and prairie near custer battlefield, part of the crow indian reservation","placename":"Billings (Mont.)","location":"Billings, Montana","nn1":["549236","545040","549238","549186","552903","549229","557087","555567","554722","549142","549218","549146","549141","549256","549155","555603"],"cl":[44],"cluster":["#44 &mdash; Field"],"terms":["plain","gully","vista","farmland","community","pocket","field","cultivate","topography","hill"]}
