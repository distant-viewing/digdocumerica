{"path":"555219.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This photograph captures an aerial view of a narrow river canyon surrounded by a lush, forested environment. The river winds through a rocky terrain and is flanked by steep canyon walls that are covered with dense foliage, predominantly coniferous trees.\n\nThe river appears turbulent in certain areas where white water is visible, indicating rapids or small waterfalls. Along the riverbanks, large moss-covered boulders contribute to the rugged terrain. The overall atmosphere of the photograph is natural and remote, evocative of a pristine wilderness area.\n\nIn the river, there are two individuals with a canoe. One is standing at the front of a narrow canoe, seemingly preparing to embark or navigate through the calm section of the river, while the other stands by, appearing as though they are steadying or assisting in maneuvering the canoe.\n\nThe high vantage point from which the photo is taken offers a comprehensive view of the challenging yet scenic natural environment. The emphasis on height and the vastness of the setting also gives a sense of tranquility and isolation from urban settings.","title":"The Skokomish River in Olympic National Timberland, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["550663","550659","543444","558064","542700","548156","553413","550989","553806","550542","542696","542701","550980","549442","553452","550625"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["canoe","river","canyon","steady","rapid","maneuver","boulder","waterfall","assist","moss"]}
