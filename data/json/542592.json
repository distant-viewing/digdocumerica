{"path":"542592.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a scenic and rugged mountain landscape, predominantly featuring a dense pine forest with rocky terrains occasionally peeping through the lush greenery. The view is centered around a significant man-made structure, an aerial tramway or incline lift, which ascends steeply between the mountains.\n\nThe tramway system includes two visible tracks running parallel up the mountain, supporting a series of cables likely utilized for transporting passengers or goods to higher elevations. The rails are flanked by tall, slender pine trees that emphasize the steepness and height of the mountain slopes.\n\nIn the foreground, a particularly tall pine tree stands out prominently on the left side of the frame, perhaps symbolizing the untouched natural elements surrounding the technological intrusion. The background offers a glimpse of smaller buildings nestled among the trees at the lower part of the mountain, indicating some level of human habitation or activity within this primarily natural scene.\n\nThe color palette is rich in various shades of green from the trees, highlighted by the grays and earth tones of the rocky mountain sides, conveying a sense of rugged wilderness. The sky is clear and a bright blue, adding contrast to the deep greens and earthy browns. Overall, the photograph portrays a blend of natural beauty and human engineering, set in a remote and mountainous environment.","title":"Unhealed cut for incline railway used until 1920's.
