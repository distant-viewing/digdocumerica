{"path":"550348.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"The photo captures a man standing in a deforested or clear-cut area. He is dressed casually in a light brown cardigan, white shirt, and dark trousers, and is wearing a cap. His hands are in his pockets, and he appears to be looking slightly towards the camera with a serious expression.\n\nThe terrain around him is rough and uneven, covered with woody debris, tree stumps, and wood chips. The ground seems moist, likely due to recent rain, as suggested by its dark color and reflective wet surfaces. There are no standing trees visible in the vicinity, emphasizing the extensive cutting of vegetation in the area.\n\nIn the background, mounds of similar debris and chopped wood accumulate, creating a hilly landscape that further portrays the aftermath of significant logging activity. The setting appears isolated and devoid of visible wildlife or greenery, highlighting the environmental impact of such deforestation.","title":"Charles towne on the property which, he claims, is being used as a dump for waste bark and chemicals by the Georgia pacific paper co.
