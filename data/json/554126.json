{"path":"554126.jpg","date":"November 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph depicts a man engaging with a dog in an outdoor setting. The man, shirtless and wearing denim jeans rolled up to his knees, is squatting and gently holding the dog's face, seemingly in mid-conversation or playful interaction with the animal. The dog, appearing to be a medium-sized breed with a light brown coat, is sitting attentively in front of the man, facing towards him with its mouth open as if responding or panting.\n\nBehind them is a yard filled with small gray stones that cover the ground completely. A red house with white trim and a staircase is visible in the background. The house looks somewhat rustic, with wooden walls and a simple design. To the right of the man, there is a partial view of a covered structure that might be used for storage or as a workspace.\n\nThe setting suggests a rural or semi-rural environment, possibly in a warm climate given the vegetation and the choice of building materials. The image captures a moment of companionship and leisure between a man and his dog, adding a warm, personal element to the overall scene.","title":"Eugene Kaupiko, 66, was born and still lives in the remote fishing village of Milolii. A planned subdivision one mile away now threatens the simple life of the village. In 1971 its only approach road was paved for easier access to the development.

His house is on the left.","placename":"Hilo (Hawaii)","location":"Hilo, Hawaii","nn1":["556549","557637","543031","553089","556421","554951","550756","543780","549112","554537","555929","549928","542874","556171","553481","556529"],"cl":[51],"cluster":["#51 &mdash; Wildlife/Animals"],"terms":["dog","man","breed","companionship","house","choice","staircase","knee","workspace","mouth"]}
