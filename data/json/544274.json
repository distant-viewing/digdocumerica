{"path":"544274.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Messina, John","caption":"This photograph captures a serene outdoor scene at the edge of a large body of water, possibly a lake or a slow-flowing river. The foreground shows a rocky beach littered with small stones and a few pieces of driftwood partially submerged in the water, with soft waves lapping against the shore.\n\nIn the background, there are four individuals engaged in an activity along the shallow waters near a modestly vegetated land area. They appear to be fishing or managing a long net implemented in a curved formation within the water. The individuals, spaced apart, are standing in shallow water and on the shore, each holding onto the net. One of them stands on the shore observing or directing the activity.\n\nThe vegetation surrounding the water includes dense shrubs and a few trees, offering a verdant backdrop to the human activity. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a bright, sunny day, which casts natural light over the entire scene.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photo, with its focus on interaction between humans and the natural environment in a tranquil waterside setting, evokes a sense of peaceful coexistence and perhaps teamwork in a natural setting.","title":"Fishing in canal off Highway 11, on southeastern shore of Lake Pontchartrain.
