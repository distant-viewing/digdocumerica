{"path":"554969.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"","caption":"This image captures a majestic view within a dense forest dominated by gigantic redwood trees. The focus of the photograph is a towering redwood tree, which appears to rise straight towards the sky. The tree's bark is deeply furrowed and has a reddish-brown color that is characteristic of redwoods. To the right of the main tree, there are partially visible trunks of other similarly massive trees, one of which is splintered, suggesting either natural decay or damage.\n\nThe forest setting is lush, filled with various shades of green, indicating an underbrush densely packed with smaller plants and shrubs. Sunlight filters through the canopy, creating a play of light and shadows on the trees and forest floor, enhancing the ethereal and serene atmosphere of the setting. In the background, the outlines of other tree trunks can be discerned, surrounded by a mist or light diffusion, likely caused by the interplay of light filtering through the moisture that these forest environments often retain.\n\nOverall, the composition conveys the immense scale and tranquil beauty of the redwood forest, emphasizing the age and majesty of these ancient trees.","title":"Candelabra western red cedars over 500 years old with salal dominant as ground cover on Milwaukee Land Company timberland in Clallam County, Washington, near Olympic National Park.","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542845","554968","542922","543447","543449","554966","542750","542752","542569","543442","542745","542748","554990","542575","542722","555051"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["redwood","forest","tree","trunk","diffusion","underbrush","majesty","filtering","moisture","damage"]}
