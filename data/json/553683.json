The point of view appears to be from an elevated position, looking down towards the shoreline. The beach is moderately crowded with people engaged in various activities typical of a beach setting: there are individuals swimming in the sea, others are walking along the shore, and numerous people are sunbathing on towels spread out on the sand. \n\nThe sea has gentle waves and is populated with swimmers and a few individuals on floatation devices. The beach's sand looks light-colored and fine, leading up to a line of lush palm trees which suggest a tropical location. Near the top right, there is a lifeguard tower, signifying that the beach is likely a public and supervised area.\n\nOn the beach, the individuals vary in their activitiesâ€”some stand and talk, others walk, and many are lying down, either sunbathing or possibly reading.

The composition of the photo, with its inclusion of water, sand, and flora, all bathed in bright sunlight, conjures an inviting, carefree atmosphere typical of a warm, sunny beach day.","title":"Waikiki Beach is the most popular tourist spot on the island.
