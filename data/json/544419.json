{"path":"544419.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Eiler, Terry","caption":"This photograph features two large receptacles (barrels) placed along the side of a building. The barrels, colored dark blue and black, are used for collecting old flags as indicated by the sign above them which reads \"PLEASE LEAVE OLD FLAG HERE IN RECEPTACLE.\" The sign is white with black lettering, mounted on what appears to be a wooden siding of a building, possibly a shed or standalone storage structure.\n\nThe barrels are visible filled with various discarded items, primarily dried flower wreaths and other similar faded floral decorations that suggest they have been used in a commemorative or memorial context. The black barrel has some text and symbols printed on it, which are related to the product that originally contained, labeled as \"Turco Products, Wilmington, Calif.\"\n\nThe background is sunlit, highlighting the broad daylight conditions, with a clear sky implying it's either dawn or dusk given the quality of the light. The scene has a rustic and somewhat neglected feel, utilitarian and devoid of any people in the immediate vicinity. The environment suggests a rural or semi-rural setting, and the purpose of the barrels gives a sense of community memory or respect relating to the flags and other commemorative items.","title":"Veteran's cemetery","placename":"Window Rock (Ariz.)","location":"Window Rock, Arizona","nn1":["552884","546000","547896","552885","550301","546004","552883","548577","543806","552461","543762","554361","555277","553433","547159","552076"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["barrel","barrels","flag","neglected","respect","collecting","memory","relate","item","symbol"]}
