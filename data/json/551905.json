{"path":"551905.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts an indoor scene within what appears to be a control or monitoring room. There are two men visible, both dressed in light-colored, long-sleeve shirts. They are seated at large desks, facing towards a wall that is extensively covered with various monitors displaying multiple images and videos. Each man is focused on his workspace filled with papers and possible command inputs.\n\nThe room seems well-organized and equipped with advanced technology for the time, indicated by the substantial number of black-and-white monitors mounted in a grid formation on the wall. These screens show different visuals, some of which appear to be technological or scientific data, while others display more abstract and unclear content.\n\nThe interior's aesthetic is utilitarian, with a nearly monotone color scheme dominated by beige and white, low fluorescence lighting, and minimal decorative distractions. This set-up suggests a professional environment where attention is primarily focused on the data displayed across the screen-filled wall. Opposite the wall of monitors, there's a shuttered window and adjacent to it, a standalone TV-style monitor on a separate stand, enhancing the room's functionality as a significant information processing and observation space.","title":"The central police control station, manned 24 hours a day controls all traffic lights, receives remote tv inputs from major intersections, and maintains radio contact with all traffic control vehicles","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551901","551902","551904","555334","551916","551900","549367","552377","551896","551903","549378","552356","542659","556384","545952","549610"],"cl":[30],"cluster":["#30 &mdash; Laboratory"],"terms":["monitor","screen","datum","room","wall","tv","visual","command","display","distraction"]}
