{"path":"543154.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"The photograph captures a scene of industrial decay, featuring a large corroded steel tank and pipework. The focus is on an enormous, rust-covered pipe that enters the frame from the foreground and curves out of the left side. The tank, situated towards the top right, appears weathered, with sections of oxidized copper-green and orange-brown rust. Attached to it is a smaller, similarly corroded pipe.\n\nSurrounding these central industrial elements are clusters of rocks and rubble. Some of the rocks near the foreground are significantly large and have a rough, jagged appearance. The background hints at some sort of underpass or similar concrete structure, possibly a bridge, with its geometric, metal supports partially visible at the top left corner. There is very little vegetation visible, suggesting an arid or harsh environment. The lighting in the photograph is natural, casting shadows and highlighting the textures and colors of the rust and metal surfaces, enhancing the feel of abandonment and decay.","title":"California--Monterey Bay area","placename":"Monterey Bay (Calif.)","location":"Monterey Bay, California","nn1":["543258","543257","556352","549307","556402","545982","553342","542975","556324","554346","545978","554565","543170","547470","546201","543687"],"cl":[6],"cluster":["#06 &mdash; Decay"],"terms":["rust","pipe","decay","tank","rubble","rock","sort","metal","support","steel"]}
