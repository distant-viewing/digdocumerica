{"path":"545123.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph shows an aerial view of a large body of water, with a significant focus on environmental or pollution issues. A small boat—possibly used for transportation or surveying—is moving through what appears to be a polluted area of the water, creating a distinct wake behind it. The water itself has extensive swirling patterns of a thick, dark substance which could be oil or some other form of pollution. The pollution forms intricate, swirling gray and black patterns on the water's surface, suggesting a situation of environmental concern. The overall composition emphasizes the scale of pollution with the small size of the boat against the vastness of the contaminated water. The image might be intended to highlight environmental issues such as water pollution or the impact of human activity on natural water bodies.","title":"White scum bubbles up by the hundreds of gallons in the Columbia River at the Longview Fibre Plant.
