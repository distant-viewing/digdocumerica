{"path":"557730.jpg","date":"June 1975","photographer":"Stephenson, Al","caption":"The image depicts the construction scene of a building with several workers onsite. In the foreground, large wooden planks are piled up on the grassy ground, contributing to the feel of an active work site. A circular saw and scattered wooden scraps also occupy the foreground, adding to the sense of ongoing labor.\n\nAt the center of the photograph stands a partially constructed house. The building is primarily made of cinder blocks on the lower levels, while the upper section features a wooden framework for what appears to be the roof. The structure includes a peaked roof under construction with visible trusses and a skeleton of the framework that suggests it's in the early stages of being roofed.\n\nTwo workers are visible; one on the roof and one is walking along the wooden framework of the first floor. The man on the ground level is shirtless, suggesting a warm climate or strenuous physical activity, and is captured mid-stride, enhancing the dynamic nature of the scene.\n\nAdditionally, the background is minimal but includes a clear blue sky and a hint of verdant trees, indicating a semi-rural or suburban setting. This backdrop emphasizes the openness and possibly the early stages of development in the area.\n\nOverall, the photo captures a moment of active construction, focusing on both the structural progress of the building and the human element of construction work.","title":"Carpenters at work on the first unit of the new alpine village at the outskirts of helen, Georgia, near robertstown.
