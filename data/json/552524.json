{"path":"552524.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Greenberg, Arthur","caption":"The photograph features an industrial scene dominated by the silhouette of an electrical substation in the foreground. The substation is densely packed with numerous high-voltage transmission towers and equipment including tall metal frameworks, transformers, and connecting electrical lines that create a geometrical pattern against the sky. In the background, a large white water tower stands, with a label reading \"Western Illinois Power Cooperative, Inc.,\" on its spherical tank atop a slender column supporting it from below. The sky in the background is a light bluish color, suggesting it might be either dawn or dusk. The overall composition reflects a complex intersect of industrial infrastructure against a relatively clear sky.","title":"Pearl steam and electric generating plant","placename":"East Saint Louis (Ill.)","location":"East Saint Louis, Illinois","nn1":["557298","544296","547929","553028","549110","546389","548136","544355","544277","555574","544613","553830","543903","544300","557977","550168"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["voltage","bluish","transmission","reading","slender","intersect","towers","column","framework","tower"]}
