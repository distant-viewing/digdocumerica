{"path":"545641.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial or construction site surrounded by a dramatic natural environment. In the foreground, rocky terrain stretches out, littered with various debris like pieces of wood, industrial materials, containers, and a large white canvas tent. Within this cluttered area, there are also splatters and puddles that reflect the light, suggesting recent rain or water use in the area.\n\nCloser to the center, a crane extends out across a brownish body of water with patches of muddy, wet groundâ€”indicative of recent water level changes or disturbances from construction activities. A couple of large industrial machines or trucks can be seen near the crane, hinting at ongoing construction or excavation work.\n\nThe background features a stark, picturesque landscape with towering rocky mountains and cliffs under a cloudy sky, giving the scene a stark contrast between the natural beauty and the harshness of industrial impact. The body of water also reflects the gray of the sky, enhancing the somber mood of the setting.","title":"Site of clean-up operations following a massive oil spill into the San Juan river.
