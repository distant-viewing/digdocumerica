{"path":"554008.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"The photograph captures two individuals engaged in activity at the shoreline of a body of water. Both individuals are knee-deep in the water. The person on the left appears to be adjusting or handling fishing nets or lines, while the person on the right seems to be holding and looking closely at a small object, possibly examining their catch or preparing bait. They are wearing swimwear which indicates a warm environment, likely a tropical or subtropical area.\n\nThe background presents a striking contrast with the serene and close-knit activity at the foreground. There are distant mountains which are majestically prominent, enveloped partially by mist or a hazy atmosphere that gives a soft silhouette appearance to the peaks. The ocean is relatively calm, marked only by gentle waves breaking at a distance which suggests a barrier reef or shallow waters.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph, with its focus on traditional fishing methods against a dramatic natural backdrop, evokes a sense of harmony between humans and nature. The soft, filtered light suggests it might be early morning or late afternoon, a typical time for fishing activities in many cultures. This moment is captured in a way that emphasizes a lifestyle deeply connected to the natural environment.","title":"On Saturday, schoolboys from Lanai City go out to dive for octopus--a delicacy which represents good money if sold to local markets. Extensive development is proposed for the island.
