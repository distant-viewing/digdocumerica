{"path":"542618.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene sunset scene where the sun is setting behind a cluster of trees. The sun appears large and partially obscured by the trees, casting a vibrant orange glow across the sky and reflecting beautifully on the surface of a calm water body in the foreground.\n\nThe water catches multiple hues of orange and red, mirroring the sky. There is a subtle texture in the water seen perhaps due to slight disturbances on the surface, likely caused by a light breeze or small aquatic animals. A distinct swirl in the water near the center bottom of the image draws attention, adding a dynamic element to the otherwise tranquil water surface.\n\nThe background is mostly silhouetted due to the backlighting of the sunset. It shows a line of low-rise structures or possibly fences that span the horizon beneath the trees, contributing a sense of quiet residential or rural environment. The overall mood of the photo is peaceful and reflective, emphasizing the beauty of natural light at sunset.","title":"Central California","placename":"California","location":"California","nn1":["552294","543415","557447","554404","552277","544711","544707","552338","552335","554759","543062","547731","547719","549847","557497","554731"],"cl":[11],"cluster":["#11 &mdash; Water 1"],"terms":["sunset","orange","sun","backlighting","water","surface","breeze","disturbance","swirl","cause"]}
