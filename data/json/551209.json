{"path":"551209.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This photograph captures a serene and picturesque river scene during what appears to be late afternoon, given the soft, warm lighting. The river bends gently and is flanked on both sides by dense, lush forests that extend into the background, forming a verdant envelope around the water. The calm surface of the river reflects a hint of the dusky sky.\n\nSeveral boats are scattered along the river, engaging in various leisure activities. On the left side of the image, a group of motorboats travels at different speeds, creating light trails of wake behind them. On the right, a solitary sailboat with its sail fully unfurled glides peacefully, adding a sense of tranquility and leisurely pace in contrast to the faster motorboats.\n\nThe composition uses the natural lines of the river and the positioning of the boats to lead the viewerâ€™s eye through the frame, enhances by the horizontal layering of forest, water, and sky. Overall, the scene radiates a calm, recreational atmosphere, typical of a late summer or early autumn day, ideal for boating and enjoying the natural environment.","title":"Pleasure boats sail on main osage arm of lake of the ozarks at horseshoe Bend","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["557972","550769","551217","551208","550989","550773","551281","550771","550988","543444","551350","547234","548077","549417","552292","548028"],"cl":[14],"cluster":["#14 &mdash; Boat 1"],"terms":["river","motorboat","boat","unfurl","glide","layering","pace","radiate","positioning","forest"]}
