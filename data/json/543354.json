{"path":"543354.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rowan, Dick","caption":"This photograph presents a vivid scene from a historic, rustic landscape, possibly a ghost town or an abandoned settlement. In the foreground, there is a prominent old and rusted vehicle or machinery part tipped on its side, displaying wheels and metal components. Nearby, a large wooden beam is partially buried in the grass along with scattered metal objects that emphasize a sense of past usage and abandonment.\n\nThe middle ground features a large, old-fashioned agricultural wheel-based machinery, suggesting a farming background. It appears to be a threshing machine or some sort of grain harvesting equipment left in disuse.\n\nFurther in the scene, various wooden buildings in varying states of repair form a row. Their construction is typical of early-to-mid-20th-century utility and storage barns, which helps to frame this image in a historical context. These buildings sport weathered wooden siding, indicative of long exposure to the elements.\n\nThe background shows a sweeping, grassy landscape backed by distant hills, which sit under a clear sky. This shows that the area is likely rural and spacious, enhancing the feel of solitude and decay due to human desertion.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a sense of forgotten history through the depiction of abandoned equipment and buildings, set against a naturally enduring landscape. It evokes a narrative of past human activity, now suspended in time, offering a compelling visual study of decay and the passage of time in a rural setting.","title":"'\"Ghost\" town'","placename":"Bodie (Calif.)","location":"Bodie, California","nn1":["543120","557701","554561","552673","552997","554783","544809","543342","556313","553985","550279","545982","554211","556352","543341","547587"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Rural Communities"],"terms":["wheel","decay","machinery","harvesting","disuse","equipment","grain","repair","usage","time"]}
