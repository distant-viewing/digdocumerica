{"path":"552642.jpg","date":"October 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph captures a scene in a cemetery during a grave construction process. In the center of the image, two men are actively working on what appears to be the wooden framework or liner of a grave plot. The man closest to the foreground is wearing a helmet, light blue shirt, and jeans, indicating that he might have a supervisory or safety-focused role. The other man, who is directly engaged with the wooden structure, is dressed in a brown work jacket, grey pants, and also wears a helmet, engaged in adjusting or securing part of the structure.\n\nIn the background, various tombstones and grave markers can be observed across the neatly manicured lawn studded with mature trees. The setting suggests a peaceful, well-maintained cemetery. The sunlight casts shadows that indicate it is either morning or late afternoon. A third person, partially visible on the left edge of the frame, wears a helmet and watches over the activity, contributing to a sense of ongoing work and attention to detail. The grave being worked on is directly next to an existing grave marker which is somewhat visible in the bottom left of the photograph. The name and details on this marker are not entirely clear, but it contributes to a sense of the location's purpose and ongoing use.\n\nOverall, the composition of the photograph emphasizes both the labor involved in maintaining and preparing final resting places, and the serene environment of the cemetery.","title":"Cemetery at Rifle","placename":"Rifle (Colo.)","location":"Rifle, Colorado","nn1":["552643","552641","546147","552017","552451","552639","554825","557942","552640","550364","547417","544267","546168","557184","550365","545322"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["cemetery","marker","helmet","resting","tombstone","grave","watch","plot","work","detail"]}
