{"path":"547417.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"O'Rear, Charles","caption":"This photograph depicts a serene cemetery setting. The focus is on various tombstones and grave markers that are scattered throughout the grassy area. The tombstones vary in size, shape, and material, but most are traditional, upright headstones made of what appears to be granite. \n\nEach tombstone carries inscriptions, presumably the names of the deceased and possibly dates or epitaphs, though specific details are not completely clear. Notable inscriptions that are visible include names like \"KRAMER,\" \"HAASE,\" and \"GREGOR PRISINGER.\" The grounds are covered with lush green grass, and a few weeds and wildflowers are interspersed, indicating a natural, somewhat unkempt state.\n\nThe background is slightly blurred but shows more grave markers and a hint of overcast sky, suggesting either a foggy or cloudy day. The atmosphere conveyed by the image is quiet and contemplative, typical of a cemetery landscape. There are no people or moving objects in the scene, which enhances the feeling of tranquility and solemnity.","title":"Cemetery near Immanuel Lutheran Church on Highway 34 outside Garland","placename":"Lincoln (Neb.)","location":"Lincoln, Nebraska","nn1":["557942","547420","550364","546147","554790","552451","557184","558040","550731","552017","554792","546098","552683","550365","544267","557089"],"cl":[4],"cluster":["#04 &mdash; House"],"terms":["tombstone","inscription","cemetery","marker","name","headstone","solemnity","weed","wildflower","date"]}
