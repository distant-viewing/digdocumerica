{"path":"549350.jpg","date":"July 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph depicts the interior of an aquarium gallery. The setting is characterized by its architectural elements, including a beige stone floor and archways that complement the series of stone brick walls.\n\nOn the walls are mounted multiple large fish tanks, illuminated and filled with various aquatic plants and probably fish, although the specific contents are not clearly visible. Four individuals are present in the scene; three are interacting or observing the aquaria while the fourth seems to be just walking through. These four men are casually dressed, typical of a relaxed, informal outing.\n\nThe ceiling has an exposed wooden beam design with fluorescent lighting that brightens the space evenly. The atmosphere suggests a quiet, educational environment, geared towards observing marine life. The overall appearance is of a well-maintained and serene public aquarium.","title":"The aquarium at the Rovenj branch of the Ruder Boskovic Institute","placename":"Rovinj (Croatia)","location":"Rovinj, Croatia","nn1":["553657","549346","551589","551597","555556","548713","551773","551596","548719","551487","546517","544957","546511","543181","546526","550290"],"cl":[17],"cluster":["#17 &mdash; Fish"],"terms":["stone","archway","wall","outing","fish","content","ceiling","beam","interior","tank"]}
