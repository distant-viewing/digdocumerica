{"path":"558298.jpg","date":"October 1974","photographer":"Villalobos, Horacio","caption":"This photograph features a woman engaged in cooking or preparing food in a kitchen setting. She is standing by the sink, stirring or working with something in a pot. Her attire includes a mustard yellow buttoned shirt and dark red pants. The woman has long, straight brown hair.\n\nThe kitchen has a vintage or retro feel, possibly from the 1970s or 1980s, suggested by the style of the curtains, kitchenware, and the construction materials used. The counter where the woman is working is equipped with a variety of common kitchen items:\n- A large jar of Gerber baby food (tomato, beef, and rice) is visible, suggesting there might be a baby in the household.\n- Several kitchen tools including spatulas and a whisk are seen on a small rack.\n- Condiment bottles, possibly mustard or mayonnaise, and salt and pepper shakers with happy faces designed on them are neatly arranged beside the sink.\n- There's a yellow squeeze bottle and some other containers, adding to the cluttered yet homey atmosphere of the space.\n- A yellow sponge and various cleaning tools sit beside the sink, indicating the ongoing or upcoming cleanup process.\n\nThe background features a window with a lace curtain and a floral-patterned drape pulled to one side. This window looks out to a building with a sign partially visible, possibly the back of a store or another establishment, indicating an urban setting. The reflectivity of the window shows a clear day outside. On the window sill, the cheerful theme continues with more decorative touches like draped fabrics. \n\nOverall, the image captures a moment of everyday domestic life, emphasizing functionality and lived-in comfort within the space.","title":"Housewife in the kitchen of her Mobile home in one of the trailer parks.
