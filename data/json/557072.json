{"path":"557072.jpg","date":"June 1974","photographer":"Duncan, Patricia D.","caption":"The photograph captures a vintage and distinctive architectural structure prominently featuring a red Victorian house with several pronounced details. The most striking aspect of the house is its conical-roofed turret, which extends up, creating a visually appealing vertical line against the sky. The turret roof is grey, possibly made of shingles, and is topped with a decorative weather vane. The body of the turret features arched openings on a balcony, suggesting a wrap-around porch at the turret’s base that offers a panoramic viewing area.\n\nThe building’s exterior walls are clad in red, with white lines marking horizontal divisions and window frames, lending it a classic, sturdy look typical of Victorian era designs. Part of an entrance can be discerned—a large archway perhaps leading to a porch or front door, hidden by dense foliage in the foreground.\n\nAdditional elements include a large brick chimney protruding from the roof, hinting at a fireplace inside. Green trees and shrubs envelop the lower part of the scene, partially obscuring the building's base and providing a lush, verdant foreground that contrasts with the structured and orderly architecture of the house.\n\nThe sky in the background is a bright blue with scattered clouds, suggesting a fine, clear day. Overall, the composition and the age of the building evoke a sense of historic grandeur and preserved beauty, typical of well-kept homes from a previous century.","title":"Restoration of a late 19th century example of Victorian architecture in Atchison, Kansas.
