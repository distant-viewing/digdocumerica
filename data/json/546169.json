{"path":"546169.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"St. Gil, Marc","caption":"This photograph captures a vivid street scene characterized by a shallow depth of field, wherein the foreground clearly displays a motorcycle's handlebar with an attached black rear-view mirror shaped like an arrow. The handlebar and mirror are in sharp focus and positioned on the right side of the frame, leading the viewer's eye across the scene.\n\nIn the blurred background, there are various elements of a busy urban street: people walking and others sitting on a sidewalk, and vehicles like cars and trucks in motion. The scene evokes a bustling city environment, hinting at midday activities with ample daylight. The street appears to be lined with buildings, likely shops or offices, contributing to an urban commercial atmosphere.\n\nThe overall composition, using selective focus, cleverly uses the motorcycle's arrow mirror to metaphorically point the viewer towards the activities unfolding in the distance, suggesting movement and the flow of life in an urban setting. The color palette consists largely of blues, whites, and muted colors, typical of an overcast daylight setting.","title":"Street scene","placename":"New Orleans (La.)","location":"New Orleans, Louisiana","nn1":["553845","551383","551465","551464","556206","553681","557882","556708","556719","551864","554874","553822","549854","549902","548690","552481"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["handlebar","mirror","arrow","motorcycle","street","daylight","unfolding","urban","midday","whites"]}
