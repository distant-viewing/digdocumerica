{"path":"549819.jpg","date":"March 1973","photographer":"Miller, Gary","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid maritime scene focusing on waste management procedures involving a waterfront setting. A red tugboat, labeled \"The Hustler\", is prominent at the left, actively engaged in a pushing maneuver against a large barge. The rectangular barge, marked with “US 65” on its side, is heavily loaded with a towering heap of assorted trash and debris, illustrating the barge's role in transporting garbage.\n\nThe tugboat features a raised pilothouse painted in red and a dark lower hull, emitting white frothy water at its stern, indicating movement. A man wearing a safety helmet can be seen standing on the tug, overseeing the operations, which reflects a sense of everyday industrial labor and management.\n\nThe surrounding environment and the background are not dominantly visible because the focus is primarily on the tugboat and trash-loaded barge. Yet, a glimpse of a calm blue sky and hints of distant structures suggest an urban maritime setting, underlining the scale and ongoing nature of waste transport via waterways.\n\nOverall, the composition emphasizes industrial activities, environmental impact, and the essential yet often overlooked labor involved in city waste management systems.","title":"Part of the 26,000 tons of solid waste that New York City produces each day.
