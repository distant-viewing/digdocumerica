{"path":"552965.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Lyon, Danny","caption":"The photograph depicts a gritty, urban scene showing a two-story brick building that appears aged and somewhat worn. The building features a series of arched openings on the ground level, suggesting they might be shops or open spaces, though they appear vacant. Above, the second story is fitted with evenly spaced doors and windows that likely lead into individual rooms or apartments. Notably, the upper railing is adorned with numerous items of laundry hung out to dry, adding a personal and lived-in touch to the building.\n\nOn the street level, a row of vintage cars parked parallel to the building provides a hint of the time period, suggesting this photo was taken several decades ago. The street is paved but shows signs of wear and few littered objects are visible, perhaps indicating a less maintained urban environment.\n\nTo the far left, there's a lone individual standing. The person is dressed in bright colors providing a stark contrast to the otherwise muted tones of the setting. The scene is imbued with a sense of everyday life in this community, highlighting a moment of quiet amidst an urban backdrop. Further enhancing the mood is the damp reflection visible in a puddle on the street, suggesting recent rainfall.","title":"The Chicano area, or Second Ward, is slowly giving way to urban renewal.
