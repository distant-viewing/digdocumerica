{"path":"548602.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schulke, Flip","caption":"This photograph features an aerial view of a coastal region. Prominent in the frame are expansive salt evaporation ponds laid out in a symmetrical pattern, appearing as a series of rectangular and geometric shapes with varying shades of white, beige, and blue. These ponds are distributed methodically in an area bordered by waterways.\n\nTo the left side of the photograph, there's a visible road running parallel to the coast, lined by thick green vegetation, likely mangroves, which suggests a tropical or subtropical climate. The dense greenery encloses a body of water forming a natural inlet or lagoon.\n\nIn the foreground, the water body reflects a murky brown color, possibly due to silt or mud, contrasting sharply with the vibrant greens of the vegetation and the more subdued colors of the salt ponds. The horizon shows a clear blue sky with minimal cloud cover, enhancing the visibility and brightness in the photograph.\n\nTowards the upper left and far background, a glimpse of an urban area is notable, along with further development along the coastline. The cityscape appears small from this distance but indicates the proximity of human habitation and possible industrial activities related to the salt ponds.\n\nOverall, the photograph captures a mix of industrial operation in harmony with the natural coastal environment, highlighting a juxtapose of human impact and natural landscape.","title":"Aerial view of the Marco Island land development, on the southwestern Florida coast","placename":"Marco Island (Fla. : Island)","location":"Marco Island, Florida","nn1":["544782","548601","545628","548600","545627","548640","544670","548635","548779","551575","555844","548631","544686","551606","552991","547508"],"cl":[22],"cluster":["#22 &mdash; Treatment"],"terms":["pond","salt","mangrove","lagoon","silt","inlet","harmony","coast","mud","brightness"]}
