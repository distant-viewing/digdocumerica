{"path":"543101.jpg","date":"April 1972","photographer":"Sennett, Tomas","caption":"This photograph captures a serene rural scene dominated by a landscape and real-estate signage. In the foreground, there is a 'SOLD' sign planted into the ground, bearing the name \"Bodega Harbour\" along with a graphical logo of a bird in flight. Perched atop the signpost is a small bird, seemingly observing its surroundings. The area around the sign is grassy and speckled with wildflowers and small shrubs.\n\nBehind the sign, the landscape unfolds as a gently rolling hill with a few sparse trees or shrubs. The middle distance of the image reveals a series of utility poles strung with power lines, indicating some human development in the area.\n\nThe background features a large, tranquil body of water (likely a harbour or a bay) and overcast skies above further suggest a calm, moist environment typical of a coastal area. There is a very faint silhouette of a hill or low mountain in the far background, further shaping the tranquil and scenic location being depicted in this photograph. The overall mood conveyed is peaceful and pastoral, with a hint of residential or commercial development.","title":"California--Point Arlina","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["543115","545049","547648","557419","552090","556989","555567","542870","549039","557553","556971","553831","549453","548248","552988","543104"],"cl":[7],"cluster":["#07 &mdash; Sign 2"],"terms":["bird","shrub","signpost","estate","development","sign","hill","flight","wildflower","bay"]}
