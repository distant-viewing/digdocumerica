{"path":"550734.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Steinhacker, Charles","caption":"This photograph captures a captivating top-down view of a polluted water surface, displaying intricate patterns and swirls of dark violet, gray, and black. The patterns appear as fluid, swirling lines and formations of pollutants intertwined with the natural water current, creating an almost marble-like effect. The presence of these pollutants suggests an environmental issue, possibly due to industrial discharge or runoff. \n\nOn the upper right side of the image, there is a partial, natural border created by the overhanging branches of a tree with lush green foliage, partially obscuring and shading this section of the water. The darkness of the branches contrasts with the metallic sheen of the polluted water, enhancing the visual impact of the pollution.\n\nOverall, the composition of this photograph—with its focus on environmental degradation—is both aesthetically striking and thought-provoking, underlining the tension between natural beauty and environmental impact.","title":"Effluent from International Paper Company mill at Jay, on the Androscoggin River, flows sluggishly downstream.","placename":"Lewiston (Me.)","location":"Lewiston, Maine","nn1":["550690","547617","550369","550371","544175","547537","545168","550368","545014","552811","550723","544804","553858","547614","546806","543302"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["pollutant","marble","discharge","runoff","branch","fluid","swirl","tension","impact","sheen"]}
