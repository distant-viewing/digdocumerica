{"path":"556688.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Pickerell, Jim","caption":"This photograph captures a scene at a train station, where several people are gathered in front of a large electronic train information board, suggesting an indoor setting possibly within a large, bustling train terminal. The board is quite detailed, displaying various train departure times, destinations, origins, service names, and status updates. Destinations and origins listed include cities such as New York, Miami, Washington, Harrisburg, and others. Some trains are marked as \"On Time\", while others have delays noted.\n\nThe people appear to be passengers, as they are facing and presumably reading the board, likely to check the status of their respective trains. There is a diversity of fashion evident among the individuals, including a range of hairstyles and clothing styles, which adds a touch of personal identity and era to the scene. The atmosphere conveys a typical moment of transit, with passengers checking train timings, perhaps adjusting their plans according to the information displayed.\n\nThe background behind the passengers is less detailed, primarily showcasing the train information board and what appears to be the interior architecture of the station. The stationâ€™s design features, illuminated by indoor lighting, along with the functional style of the information board, are typical of public transport facilities designed for utility and efficiency. The overall composition of the photograph focuses on the interaction of the passengers with the train schedule, capturing a moment of travel-related anticipation or adjustment.","title":"Amtrak passengers stop for train information in the main hall of the 30th street station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  It is one of four or five stops made by metroliners which make 16 round trips each day between New York city and Washington, district of Columbia.  Amtrak is trying to achieve a 55 percent average load factor and has reached the 50 percent level.  To reach a higher load factor management would have to pack the trains during peak ridership","placename":"Philadelphia (Pa.)","location":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","nn1":["556071","555960","556073","556103","555967","556054","556855","556686","556074","556026","556024","556827","556122","556677","556670","556648"],"cl":[28],"cluster":["#28 &mdash; Train"],"terms":["train","board","information","passenger","status","origin","station","check","timing","adjustment"]}
