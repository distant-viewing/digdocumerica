{"path":"547238.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Neubauer, John","caption":"The photograph captures a vivid scene centered around turbulent brown water, likely a river, rushing forcefully towards the viewer. The water is frothy and agitated, displaying a muddy color typically indicative of a river carrying a significant amount of sediment. The impression is of being very close to the water surface, creating an intense, dynamic perspective.\n\nIn the background, under a clear blue sky, is a fairly busy industrial riverside scene. Numerous structures, possibly related to port facilities, are visible. The shoreline is lined with cranes and other large machinery typical of cargo handling operations. Part of a bridge structure also appears in the distance, suggesting a connection between two terrains, possibly facilitating transport or other logistic operations.\n\nThe overall composition is characterized by a contrast between the organic chaos of the natural environment in the foreground and the ordered industrial activity in the background. The photograph portrays a moment that captures the intersection of natural force and human industrial effort along a waterway.","title":"Silt-laden wake from a power boat on the Potomac","placename":"Washington (D.C.)","location":"Washington, D.C.","nn1":["548061","553392","547242","550673","550710","553380","548091","550647","551993","553389","551515","550742","551519","553395","549515","555792"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["chaos","operation","riverside","handling","port","force","intersection","river","sediment","cargo"]}
