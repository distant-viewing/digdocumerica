{"path":"553183.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Hubbard, Tom","caption":"This image captures a lively outdoor scene, likely from the 1970s based on the fashion observed. The photograph shows a bustling public square or street, filled with numerous people engaged in different activities.\n\nCentral to the composition are four individuals seated on the ground in casual attire, notably jeans and patterned shirts. They appear to be in conversation, with some of them holding what might be snacks or perhaps small personal belongings. Their relaxed posture and focus on each other suggest a social gathering or break in their day.\n\nSurrounding these seated individuals are multiple other figures, dressed predominantly in the period-appropriate clothing, such as bell-bottom jeans, flared trousers, and flowing dresses. People are seen walking in various directions, suggesting a busy thoroughfare or meeting area, some carrying bags which might indicate shopping or commuting purposes.\n\nThe atmosphere evokes a sense of daytime leisure, with the background lightly populated by trees providing some shade, which contrasts with the sunlit open area. The style of clothing, along with the dynamics among the crowd, provides a vivid snapshot of social life during this era. The overall vibe is one of casual interaction and youthful energy within an urban setting.","title":"Fountain Square in downtown Cincinnati is a public square that works for the city and its people in a myriad of ways: eating lunch","placename":"Cincinnati (Ohio)","location":"Cincinnati, Ohio","nn1":["553155","549909","553319","556532","550082","551124","555906","553264","549923","553210","551835","553158","545231","553761","553204","556808"],"cl":[38],"cluster":["#38 &mdash; Woman 3"],"terms":["jean","commuting","thoroughfare","clothing","snack","belonging","bell","meeting","shopping","square"]}
