{"path":"552326.jpg","date":"April 1973","photographer":"Wilson, Doug","caption":"This photograph captures two individuals fishing from a small boat on a river. The environment appears chilly and overcast, as evidenced by the subjects wearing heavy, hooded coats and protective gear to shield themselves from the elements. The person on the left, who is standing, wears a red head covering beneath a grey hooded jacket and dark-colored trousers, and is actively fishing with a noticeable bend in their fishing rod, suggesting they might be in the middle of catching a fish. The other individual, situated on the right, is in a crouched position with their head lowered, possibly tending to another aspect of the fishing gear or perhaps handling bait. The background is blurred but reveals a tree-lined riverbank, creating a serene yet somber outdoor setting. The boat itself is simple, flat-bottomed, and marked with an identification number, hinting at a no-frills approach to their fishing expedition. Overall, the scene is one of quiet, focused outdoor activity amidst a natural, possibly cold setting.","title":"Winter steelhead trout fishing on the skagit river.
