{"path":"554719.jpg","date":"October 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"The photograph captures a scenic lakeside view, likely taken in a natural park or wilderness area. The foreground of the image is dominated by a rugged, flat expanse of rock, which seems to be limestone or similar sedimentary rock, displaying distinctive stratification lines. The rock extends into the image from the bottom left corner and opens up towards the edge of the lake.\n\nSeveral small trees and shrubs, demonstrating early autumn colors, are scattered sparingly across the rocky landscape. To the left, a heavy shadow, likely from a large cloud or an out-of-frame object, cuts across the rock surface. The middle distance presents a similar rocky outcrop, which juts further into the lake, adorned with more dense vegetation including evergreen trees and a variety of deciduous trees dressed in hues of green, yellow, and red.\n\nThe lake itself is choppy, suggesting a breezy day, and spreads out to the horizon, where distant hills or low mountains line the background, under a vast sky decorated with wisps of white clouds on a backdrop of blue.\n\nThis setting evokes a late autumnal feel, with a sense of quiet and serenity, despite the wind. The composition and natural lighting suggest a broad and open environment, inviting exploration or contemplation by the viewer.","title":"Glaciated flat rock \"pavement\" shows gouge marks of glacier at flat rocks on Lake Champlain.","placename":"Adirondack Forest Preserve (N.Y.)","location":"OTHER","nn1":["554761","554758","552900","554757","543816","554749","543771","555387","555388","554635","551207","554714","554750","550493","554648","554649"],"cl":[1],"cluster":["#01 &mdash; Mountain"],"terms":["rock","lake","wisp","stratification","outcrop","serenity","cloud","contemplation","wind","autumn"]}
