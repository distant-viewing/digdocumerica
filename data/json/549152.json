{"path":"549152.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Norton, Boyd","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a section of a log cabin wall. The logs are horizontally stacked with visible chinking—likely a mixture of clay or mortar—filling the gaps between them. Each log is rounded on the outside and shows variations in the wood's color, from light brown to dark brown, with some areas showing a more reddish hue. The ends of the logs are cut flat and reveal the rings and natural texture of the wood.\n\nOn the left side of the image, part of the cabin's roof overhang is visible, featuring what appears to be wooden shingles or boards. Beyond the wall, you can see a lush, green garden environment. There is a dense growth of leafy trees and bushes, suggesting a well-maintained, verdant setting. The leaves are vibrant green, indicating the photo was likely taken during spring or summer.\n\nThe composition uses a shallow depth of field to focus sharply on the texture and details of the log wall, while the background garden and foliage are slightly blurred, emphasizing the rustic and natural aesthetics of the scene. The lighting appears natural and soft, enhancing the organic qualities of the wood and surrounding vegetation.","title":"Roy Fly Ranch near Sarpy Basin.
