{"path":"550327.jpg","date":"May 1973","photographer":"Lockwood, Lee","caption":"This photograph is an aerial view of an industrial area situated alongside a river. The river flows through the center of the image, surrounded by abundant greenery and trees that are likely part of a natural landscape. Directly adjacent to the river are industrial buildings and structures, which vary in size and are primarily constructed with dark materials. Notably, there are several large storage tanks, and some of the industrial rooftops are covered with what appears to be sawdust or wood chips, suggesting that this might be a lumber or paper mill.\n\nOn one side of the river, a significant pile of wooden logs can be seen near the water, and a dam is also visible, suggesting control over the water flow for industrial or power generation purposes. Various roads and pathways are seen around the industrial compound, and small vehicles are noticeable, providing a sense of scale and activity.\n\nIn the background, beyond the industrial site, a small community with residential houses set amidst the trees can be spotted. This provides a sharp contrast between the natural and developed environments. The area surrounding the industrial site and the community appears semi-rural, with scattered trees and green areas prevalent around the buildings and roads. The overall scene captures the interaction between industry and nature, highlighting both the economic activities and the environmental setting.","title":"Georgia Pacific paper plant on the St. Croix River","placename":null,"location":"OTHER","nn1":["542933","547994","551579","544471","551578","551194","550330","545152","550856","551173","550335","551201","551192","550860","551197","542944"],"cl":[20],"cluster":["#20 &mdash; Facility"],"terms":["river","sawdust","compound","chip","site","lumber","generation","community","mill","dam"]}
