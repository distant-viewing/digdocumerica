{"path":"545927.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Rain, Belinda","caption":"This photograph captures a narrow waterway flanked by dense vegetation under a clear sky. The water surface is partially covered with frothy white foam, suggesting either movement in the water or pollution. The channel is bordered on both sides by thick plants and reeds that exhibit varying shades of green and golden brown, indicating different types of vegetation or possibly seasonal changes. The view is directed along the length of the canal, leading the eye toward a vanishing point at the horizon, where the waterway continues between the plant-lined banks. Shadows suggest that the sun is high, possibly indicating midday or early afternoon. The overall mood is serene yet slightly somber, with the natural beauty of the scene contrasted by the foam on the water, which might raise questions about the health of the ecosystem.","title":"Truckee river","placename":"South Lake Tahoe (Calif.)","location":"South Lake Tahoe, California","nn1":["549641","558011","553427","550844","544470","545923","558009","546868","547502","545008","552733","550686","554623","544536","549032","547487"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["foam","waterway","question","vanishing","covered","banks","midday","health","canal","reed"]}
