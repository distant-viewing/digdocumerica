{"path":"555490.jpg","date":"February 1974","photographer":"Falconer, David","caption":"This photograph depicts a vintage scene at a gas station. In the foreground, a man is fueling a classic black car, possibly from the 1960s or 1970s. The man is wearing a hat and a jacket, and is slightly bending over as he operates the gas pump nozzle into the carâ€™s fuel tank. You cannot see the man's face as it's obscured by his hat.\n\nThe car has a distinctive rear design with horizontal red taillights and a chrome bumper. The license plate reveals it's registered in Oregon with the registration \"MCW 886\". On the side of the pump, a prominent sign stands with the text \"EVEN NUMBERS ONLY\" in bold yellow letters, indicating a possible fuel rationing system based on the license plate numbers.\n\nThe background shows a typical American road scene, likely from the same era as the car. Various signs are visible, including one that says \"EAT HERE.\" It appears to be a suburban or small-town environment, suggesting that this might be on the outskirts of a city or a less densely populated area.","title":"The state of Oregon was the first to go to a system of odd and even numbers during the gasoline crisis in the fall and winter of 1973-74.
