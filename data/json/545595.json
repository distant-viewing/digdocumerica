{"path":"545595.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Hiser, David","caption":"This photograph features a breathtaking view of a rugged canyon landscape. A person is seen lying on their stomach on a flat rock ledge that juts out over a deep canyon. The ledge appears precarious as it protrudes from a vertically layered, reddish-brown rocky cliff face. The person, possibly a woman based on their build and hairstyle, is propped up on their elbows with their head turned away from the camera, perhaps admiring the vast and dramatic view before them.\n\nThe surrounding geography consists of layered rock formations typical of canyon terrains, exhibiting various shades of red and brown strata. The far background provides a panoramic view of the canyon extending into the horizon under a clear blue sky. The scale of the scene is underscored by the sheer drop visible just beyond the ledge where the person is positioned, highlighting the grandeur and the potential danger of the setting.\n\nOverall, the composition captures a moment of solitary contemplation or thrill-seeking, set against a majestic natural backdrop that emphasizes both human vulnerability and the awe-inspiring scale of the natural world.","title":"Looking out at canyonlands from dead horse point","placename":"Dead Horse Point State Park (Utah)","location":"Dead Horse Point State Park, Utah","nn1":["545599","545697","544899","544931","544917","545607","545300","544895","545750","545689","544341","544946","544902","545696","545765","553962"],"cl":[43],"cluster":["#43 &mdash; Tractor"],"terms":["canyon","ledge","person","admire","stratum","thrill","vulnerability","geography","danger","elbow"]}
