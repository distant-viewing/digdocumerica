{"path":"545068.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"This photograph captures a serene natural landscape composed of a confluence where a river flows into a calm lake. The river, in the foreground, is brisk and studded with rocks, suggesting a shallow and fast-moving body of water. The flow of the river is highlighted by its textured surface, reflecting the light and creating patterns in the water.\n\nA substantial amount of rounded river rocks and pebbles forms a natural bank on the left, which guides the river into the lake. This bank separates the dynamic river from the placid lake, which dominates the middle and right part of the scene. The lake mirrors the sky and the surrounding environment with its smooth, reflective surface, contrasting with the rough texture of the river.\n\nOn the far right, overhanging branches and a large fallen log interrupted in its descent by another rock barrier suggest recent natural changes, perhaps due to weather or flowing water. The background features gentle, rolling hills covered with dense forests, implying a secluded, possibly remote, location. The sky, partly visible through the overcast light, adds a moody tone to the scene, suggesting early morning or late afternoon light.\n\nOverall, this peaceful, natural landscape evokes a sense of tranquility and the ongoing interplay between dynamic and static elements within a natural ecosystem. There is an absence of human activity in the photograph, which emphasizes the untouched and wild character of the scene.","title":"The site of a temporarily discontinued gravel operation that desTroyed a prime salmon spawning stream.
