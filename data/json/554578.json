{"path":"554578.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"LaBastille, Anne","caption":"This photograph captures a close-up view of a Trillium plant, prominently displayed in a natural forest setting. The Trillium plant is marked by its three large green leaves and three vivid red petals, centering around a black pistil, which adds a striking contrast to the bright colors of the petals.\n\nThe background of the image is softly blurred but shows a typical forest floor littered with brown fallen leaves, suggesting an early spring or late autumn season. You can also spot green moss on rocks, adding texture and indicating a possibly moist environment. Behind the Trillium, there seems to be either a large rock or the trunk of a tree, covered with patches of moss and showing signs of weathering, which blur into the backdrop highlighting the plant's vivid colors and shapes.\n\nThis composition focuses sharply on the Trillium, using a shallow depth of field to draw attention to the details of the plantâ€™s leaves and flowers, while the natural light appears to softly illuminate the scene without causing harsh shadows, emphasizing the serene and undisturbed quality of the natural setting.","title":"Red trillium (trillium erectus), in the Adirondack Forest Preserve","placename":"New York","location":"New York","nn1":["553361","553368","544875","555037","554587","555040","555188","549230","553074","547642","543451","555053","543623","542615","553588","554743"],"cl":[46],"cluster":["#46 &mdash; Flower"],"terms":["petal","plant","moss","leave","blur","rock","forest","weathering","cause","autumn"]}
