{"path":"551083.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Schaefer, Harry","caption":"This photograph depicts an industrial landscape with a significant amount of visible air pollution. In the foreground, a highway can be seen, with a blue pickup truck driving on the road. The middle ground of the photo features a large industrial complex with numerous structures including storage tanks, pipes, and buildings. Prominent in this complex are two large vertical towers emitting smoke or steam. Beyond the industrial area, a densely forested hill fills the background, partially obscured by haze or pollution, which casts a bluish tint over the scene. The overall atmosphere of the picture suggests heavy industrial activity in a valley, likely contributing to environmental degradation. The color tones in the image are a blend of purplish and bluish hues, which may be due to either the film used or color processing effects.","title":"DuPont Belle Works","placename":"Charleston (W.
