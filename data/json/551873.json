{"path":"551873.jpg","date":"September 1973","photographer":"Okamoto, Yoichi R.","caption":"This photograph captures a rainy day scene in an urban setting that is likely European, evidenced by the architecture and the cobblestone street. In the foreground, there's a flatbed truck parked on the street with its back open, showing large sacks that might contain goods for delivery or pickup. A man in a trench coat and hat is seen interacting with another individual who is partially obscured inside the truck, suggesting some sort of commercial activity or transaction.\n\nOn the left, there are white and red chairs neatly stacked outside, likely belonging to a café or restaurant, their placement indicating preparation for, or the end of, the day's business, possibly influenced by the weather. The ground is wet, reflecting the overcast sky and the rain, emphasizing the mood of a wet, business-as-usual day.\n\nMidground shows multi-story buildings with colourful facades, shops at street level, and residential or offices on the upper floors. Notable among the signage on the buildings is one that reads \"TAS HION,\" possibly a shop or business name.\n\nIn the background, the pointed spire of a Gothic-style church or historic building towers over the scene, lending a traditional, old-world feel to the setting and indicating the historical significance of the area. The entire scene is a tableau of daily life intersected with commercial activity on a rainy day in a historically rich European city.","title":"Munich's large and beautiful Fussgängerzone (pedestrian zone) has returned the city's commercial and cultural center to the people. It is totally traffic free. Not even bicycle riding is permitted. On the rainy morning, as on every morning from 6 am to 9 am, the entire Fussgängerzone is thoroughly cleaned. This is the time too, when trucks and cars may make deliveries.","placename":"Munich (Germany)","location":"Munich, Germany","nn1":["551871","551863","551868","546643","551877","546660","550128","551866","551869","550138","551862","549659","551933","551872","551788","551864"],"cl":[36],"cluster":["#36 &mdash; Street"],"terms":["business","shop","street","transaction","sack","truck","café","delivery","flatbed","day"]}
