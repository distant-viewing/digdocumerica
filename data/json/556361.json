{"path":"556361.jpg","date":"April 1974","photographer":"Corn, Jack","caption":"This image features a dramatic night scene focused on a stream of water, possibly from a pressure washer, spraying against a rusty, metallic surface. The setting is industrial, likely outdoors at night, with artificial lighting contributing to the scene's moody, dim aesthetic. The spray of water is finely detailed, catching the light as it jets downward, resulting in a scattered pattern of bright droplets against the darker background. The top left corner shows a blurred edge of a large container or industrial item, suggesting the scene is within a work area, possibly a construction site or a similar environment. The background is mostly shrouded in darkness with faint, distant lights possibly indicating nearby buildings or street lights. The overall tone is gritty and slightly somber, highlighting the interaction of light, water, and metal within an urban setting.","title":"Water in a continuous spray is used along the face of the long wall when the coal machine is in operation to cut down on the amount of airborne dust. The machine's teeth rake the coal onto a conveyor belt which moves it for transport out of the mine. Long wall mining is relatively new and more costly, but allows about twice as much coal to be taken from a mine. This is Virginia-Pocahontas Coal Company Mine #3 near Richlands, Virginia.","placename":"Richlands (Va.)","location":"Richlands, Virginia","nn1":["546907","543830","546829","542990","557398","555794","553901","543904","543004","546767","553866","545646","547029","547702","554016","552717"],"cl":[31],"cluster":["#31 &mdash; Pollution Cleanup"],"terms":["night","pressure","droplet","light","spray","darkness","stream","container","corner","aesthetic"]}
