{"path":"555585.jpg","date":"July 1974","photographer":"Calonius, Erik","caption":"This photograph depicts a unique urban scene, rich with various elements of visual interest. The focal point is a large, dark-colored mining cart filled with a vibrant arrangement of flowering plants—whites and reds—which sits on old-fashioned metal wheels placed on a short track. The cart's rustic appearance contrasts appealingly with the lush flowers it holds.\n\nIn the background, the setting includes a well-manicured lawn leading up to an impressive statue of a standing man, which dominates the central backdrop of the image. This statue, mounted on a sizable ornate pedestal, enhances the historical feel of the setting. Behind the statue, architectural elements include parts of elegant stone and brick buildings with classic designs, indicative of a public square or historical district. Noticeable features of these buildings include sophisticated stonework and grand entrances, suggesting they might serve significant public or governmental functions.\n\nToward the right, a tree in full leaf adds a touch of natural green, contrasting with the built environment. Also visible are several parked cars, dating from a style typical of the mid-20th century, which offer a temporal clue to the era of the image. Collectively, these elements—transport medium, nature, statuary, and architecture—compose a scene likely situated in a town or city with historical significance, curated to reflect its heritage and beauty.","title":"Coal car flower planter in front of the town hall, is an indication of the importance of the industry in the southeastern part of the state","placename":"Cadiz (Ohio)","location":"Cadiz, Ohio","nn1":["549676","551747","551743","551794","546488","551739","551744","557257","551756","551746","551646","552705","551489","551705","552396","550094"],"cl":[37],"cluster":["#37 &mdash; Garden"],"terms":["statue","cart","medium","flower","stonework","pedestal","heritage","manicure","leaf","district"]}
