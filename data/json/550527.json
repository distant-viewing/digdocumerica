{"path":"550527.jpg","date":"August 1973","photographer":"Cowals, Dennis","caption":"This photograph is a high aerial view of a meandering river flowing through a densely forested landscape. The river, dark and reflective, cuts through the terrain, creating an S-shape as it winds through the scene. The banks of the river are lined with lush, dark green trees which appear to be coniferous, suggesting a boreal or temperate forest environment.\n\nThere are distinct sandbars visible within the river's bends, consisting of lighter, almost grayish sand, contrasting sharply with the dark water and the greenery of the forest. These sandbars indicate regions where the river's flow slows and sediments are deposited.\n\nApart from the river and trees, the landscape includes a significant amount of underbrush and smaller vegetation, filling gaps between the trees and covering the ground almost completely, giving the setting a wild and untouched appearance.\n\nIn the upper part of the image, the river branches out into several smaller streams, feeding into the main river. This network of waterways suggest a delta or a floodplain area.\n\nThere are no visible man-made structures or humans in the photograph, emphasizing the natural and pristine quality of the environment. The lighting in the photo, possibly from a low sun, highlights the textures of the forest and the rippling water, enhancing the sense of untouched wilderness. This aerial view provides a broad perspective on this serene natural scene, emphasizing the quiet and isolated beauty of the area.","title":"Grayling Creek (named for the good grayling fishing).
