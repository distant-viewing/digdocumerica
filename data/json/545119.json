{"path":"545119.jpg","date":"September 1972","photographer":"Daniels, Gene","caption":"The photograph displays an aerial view of a body of water affected by industrial or chemical pollutants. The water appears foamy and is swirling with various shades of white, grey, and black, indicative of contamination or pollution. Near the top of the image, a built structure (possibly a pier or jetty) can be seen extending into the water, with small boats moored alongside it. There is a significant presence of floating debris or materials around this structure, contributing to the cluttered and disturbed condition of the water. The foamy patches and swirls cover much of the water's surface, suggesting strong currents or agitation. The right edge of the photo shows part of an aircraft, likely indicating that this was taken from a plane, providing a broad and encompassing perspective of the environmental concern depicted.","title":"White scum bubbles up by the hundreds of gallons in the Columbia River at the Longview fibre plant","placename":null,"location":null,"nn1":["544779","549624","545168","550371","550206","552127","545123","546806","550815","551560","550193","544775","548090","550369","552019","551561"],"cl":[19],"cluster":["#19 &mdash; Water 3"],"terms":["swirl","contamination","pollutant","water","jetty","plane","current","affect","aircraft","chemical"]}
