{"path":"544446.jpg","date":"May 1972","photographer":"Reaves, Bill","caption":"This photograph depicts an aerial view of a landscape that features a diverse array of terrain and activities. On the right side of the image, there is a large body of water that curves along the edge of the land, bordered by a green zone of dense trees. A narrow road or path runs parallel to this water body, enhancing the boundary between the land and water.\n\nThe main part of the landscape is dotted with numerous trees, mostly scattered throughout the area. The land appears rugged and primarily natural, with patches of vegetation and bare earth showing through. Central to the image is a wide, unpaved road leading from the bottom edge to a large circular clearing. This cleared area has a pile of what seems to be either refuse, rocks, or construction debris.\n\nThere are also two distinct paths branching off from this road, snaking through the landscape and adding to the fractured appearance of the terrain. The region has an earthy color palette, consisting of browns, greens, and the blue of the water, which contributes to a natural, rustic aesthetic. The image captures an expansive, somewhat undeveloped area that may be used for various outdoor activities or might be in the process of some form of land management or development.","title":"Central Texas--near lake buchanan","placename":"Buchanan, Lake (Tex.)","location":"Buchanan, Lake, Texas","nn1":["543767","556938","556937","556919","550540","550615","550757","554164","556920","555873","555705","553454","542821","555845","556997","550614"],"cl":[2],"cluster":["#02 &mdash; Fire"],"terms":["land","road","path","consisting","bare","refuse","snake","water","clearing","edge"]}
