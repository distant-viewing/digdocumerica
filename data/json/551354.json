{"path":"551354.jpg","date":"June 1973","photographer":"Kuykendall, Bill","caption":"This image captures an underwater scene showing a cluster of green pondweed plants submerged in water. The leaves of the pondweed are elongated, slim, and slightly wavy, exhibiting a vibrant green color. The photograph is a close-up, focusing on the natural arrangement of these water plants.\n\nAdditional features enhancing the visual interest include the visible parts of the waterâ€™s surface at the top, where light reflections and small bubbles can be seen, adding a textural contrast to the smooth underwater environment. There are also some darker, potentially decomposing pieces of plants among the green leaves, adding a natural diversity to the scene.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the photograph feels calm and tranquil, marked by the muted light and obscured details typical of underwater photography, giving an intimate glimpse into the aquatic plant life. The composition focuses on the natural density and arrangement of the plants, providing a detailed snapshot of an aquatic ecosystem.","title":"Grasses in clear water of a lake formed by one of Missouri's famous blue springs in the Ha Ha Tonka region. Only the tips of two stems protrude above the water in this picture. The sediment-free lake permits visibility clear to the bottom in most places. Water here is about 2 feet deep.","placename":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park (Mo.)","location":"Ozarks, Lake of the, State Park, Missouri","nn1":["543566","543558","555044","555022","547509","543561","542554","542582","543187","544524","552525","544541","555069","544525","546875","543555"],"cl":[48],"cluster":["#48 &mdash; Water 4"],"terms":["plant","arrangement","decompose","bubble","leave","photography","diversity","close","density","up"]}
