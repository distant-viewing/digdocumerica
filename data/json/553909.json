{"path":"553909.jpg","date":"June 1972","photographer":"Woodson, LeRoy","caption":"This photograph appears to have been taken outdoors, showcasing four individuals positioned in a line, with a picturesque city skyline and lush greenery in the distance. Starting from the left, the first individual is an older man wearing glasses, a dark suit, and a tie. Next to him is a woman with shoulder-length brown hair, wearing a red, white, and blue striped top paired with a white skirt adorned with red and blue horizontal stripes. The third figure is a younger man, dressed in a light gray suit and tie, while the man on the far right has a darker complexion, and is wearing a dark suit with a red tie.\n\nThe background provides a sweeping view of a cityscape enveloped in a hazy atmosphere, which could possibly be due to the time of day, suggesting either early morning or late afternoon light. The foreground features tall grass and various other lush green plants, indicating that the photo was taken from a vantage point that overlooks the city, possibly from a hill or a higher elevation area within a park. The overall ambiance of the image is serene, highlighted by the soft, natural lighting and the expansive view.","title":"Leaders in fight against air pollution.  Left to right: dr.  A.
